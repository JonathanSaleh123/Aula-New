MATH 113 w/ Rui Wang,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ka2a9/math_113_w_rui_wang/,2,1684348395.0,Has anyone taken MATH 113 with Rui Wang? I noticed that she has pretty high bins in her class. Are her exams easier?,[removed] | https://i.imgur.com/lD0mY17.jpg
Math 113 and 185,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bwby00/math_113_and_185/,3,1712301727.0,"Should I take them concurrently next semester?

Also I'm not sure which prof should I pick for each. Right now 113 has Mladenov and Rui Wang, and 185 has Pasqualotto, Korotkikh, and Jikang Wang. If you've taken classes with them, how was your experience?","I think it's okay to take these two classes concurrently. 

I took a class with Rui Wang before, tho not on algebra. I think her teaching was okay, but in terms of logistics it was pretty chaotic and she was also not very responsive. Overall a pretty meh experience. | i previously had a bad experience with mladenov with his class being quite difficult but curious about the 185 profs | no you will die"
Applied math upper div order,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1b8cdox/applied_math_upper_div_order/,7,1709761916.0,"I have 113, 128a, and 185 left. Whats the best order to take them? For 113, the professors are Voiculescu and rui wang, and both have horrible reviews rmp. Should I just take 128a with persson first?","185 last but for the other 2 pick whichever has a better professor and do that first | If you've taken 104 already, you can do them in any order. Just take the class with the best (least bad) professor that semester | wait where r u able to see who the 113 profs are | Thx, did u take any with these 3 profs? | Nah, doing 104 and 110 rn. I just did a lot of research into the recommended order. | 110 with frenkel? How was mt? | Honestly did well, feeling +1 sd

Incoming data science freshman schedule. Thoughts or Suggestions?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xx9lv/incoming_data_science_freshman_schedule_thoughts/,1,1689188132.0,"1. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler (mixed reviews on RMP but seems like a hard professor), CS 61A with Prof. John Denero (not sure if I‚Äôll enroll as a DS major and with 300 waitlist max), and EPS 7 Climate Change and Computer science mentors (not sure how to enroll in CSM)

2. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler, DATA C8 w/ Prof. Swupnil Sahai, EPS 50 Planet Earth w/ Michael Manga

3. Math 32 (Precalculus) w/ Prof. Rui Wang (bad reviews on RMP but not suer if I should enroll in precalculus since I want to do well in calculus at Cal), CS 10 w/ Dan Garcia (friendlier pace than CS 61A) and some other random GE course

4. Math 32 w/ Prof. Rui Wang (again, has bad reviews on RMP), Data C8, and some random GE.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like. 

Also, could anyone recommend any easy and fun 7-breadth courses? That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",I like the first one with Data 8 instead of EPS 7

ZEAN WANG!

If you know them, have them DM me. If they can meet me in Emeryville I'll return it. Much better than paying Berkeley $25 for a replacement.","Go on gmail and just type in zean wang it popped up for me | Maybe not Berkeley student | ZEAN WANG, where you at? We have a Good Samaritan searching for you. | Return it to Bart station |  Berkeley Clipper cards say ‚ÄúUniversity of California Berkeley‚Äù on them. It might be. | üôè | search the name in the Berkeley Student Directory, then send an email to the person. | It's a Berkeley student. Has their name and the Berkeley logo on it. BART will make it available at lost and found or at best return it to Berkeley Dept of Transportation after a long wait. By then the student will have applied for a replacement which is pricey and annoying. The card was dropped at a bus stop so I'm hoping they're close by. | Yep, this one is a Berkeley student. It has the Berkeley logo, a link to Berkeley Class Pass, and the student's name. Looks like they graduated in 2023 based on my stalking of commencement lists.. | Great idea.

Does anyone know anything about them in terms of how tough they are on grading? Deciding between CS 61BL and CS 61B in Fall, but I've heard Yakota is crazy. Have his tests been even harder than Hug's?","crystal is goated | Crystal is the fucking goat | i love crystal wang. i knew her outside of c1b before i took that class bc we‚Äôre in the same club, and i was so excited when she mentioned she TA‚Äôd the class. she genuinely has a great understanding of the material and explains things in a very friendly and easy to understand way. yokota‚Äôs tests were hard but every time i went to his OH he was really really helpful and explained things extremely clearly. i always left feeling really satisfied. | Crystal and Anton are excellent, AIed for them and honestly you can‚Äôt really do much better than them | laksith is the goat | Crystal Wang was one of my favorite TAs when I took 61b, always had great interactions with her | Laksith is legit | crystal and anton are super cracked | all the GSI instructors are great!

Math128A w/ Ming Gu or Math104 w/ Jikang Wang,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/162c485/math128a_w_ming_gu_or_math104_w_jikang_wang/,2,1693097521.0,"I've only taken Math53 and Math54, which of these two classes would be better suited / easier for me to take this semester?","My friends in math think that Math128A is cringe (especially with Gu).   
One of my peers who took Math104 said she suffered and barely passed because she hadn't taken the Math55 prereq.  
I would say both classes are feasible if you have enough time to study and go to office hours, but it would require a lot of extra time if you don't have Math 55. 128A is probably a little easier if you have coding experience, but they also require a group project if you take it during fall or spring. My math friends think the best order is Math 55 ‚Üí 110 ‚Üí 104 ‚Üí 185 ‚Üí 128a, but I've only taken 128a so I can't accurately say anything about the others.

I took Math W128A with Persson over summer, and I came in with Math53, 54, and E7, which were the suggested pre-reqs. However, my math 54 knowledge was shaky because I took it with Wehrheim over covid, and they covered eigenvalues in april when it should have been covered much earlier. I could have gotten an A- if I went to office hours, but I was too busy with other classes/research and ended up with a B. | Okay got it, thanks for the advice!"
Help: Which Professor should I take for Math 104?,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/djhxai/help_which_professor_should_i_take_for_math_104/,6,1571370840.0,"Currently my options are; **Nicholas Miller, Mariusz Wodzicki, Ryan A Hass,**  **Yu-Wei Fan,**  **Sebastian Eterovic, Rui Wang,**  **Philip J Wood**

Thanks for the help!","Not wodzicki if you value your sanity.  I've heard very good about Hass. | I have Hass right now for 104 and he‚Äôs a wonderful teacher! Lectures are very example based, and he walks around the classroom chatting with students. Neat notes for if you miss a class, very fair midterm 1 (aside from one question but whatever), and generally available. | Echoing the comments about Hass - he's a very engaging lecturer which I find relatively uncommon among professors, and his assignments are reasonable | Can vouch for Yu-Wei Fan! amazing chalkboard work, his clarity in lecture is superb, and he answers every question thoughtfully and precisely. Every student who‚Äôs gone to his office hours lauds him for his helpfulness.

He is also great at managing admin stuff, keeping us students well informed about what material will be covered, and about upcoming deadlines. 

11/10 in my book. And I come from CC, where I feel like I had great professors, but was definitely coddled. | Not Wang. She means well but the language barrier and accent makes her hard to understand, at least for me. | Rui Wang, and I cannot stress this enough. Crystal clear lecturer (unless you have an issue with her accent - see another comment below) and is incredibly helpful during office hours and always open to questions. Of all the classes I've taken at cal so far, analysis with Professor Wang probably made me smarter more than any other class has. I found it difficult initially, but that is by virtue of the difficulty of the material and my inexperience coming into the class - not because of quality of instruction. She uses Rudin, and will give you a rigorous foundation in basic topological concepts that should prepare you well for 202 A/B. She structures the class logically, so that you get a complete treatment of the constructions of the reals, and almost everything is generalised to topological spaces and metric spaces, unlike other sections which may just state a completeness axiom for the reals, and then specify all work to the reals for the majority of the semester and do some basic work with metric spaces in the last two weeks (making for a very boring, and much easier class). You will also get some very basic introductory concepts in functional analysis which few of the other sections bother introducing at all (equicontinuity, uniform convergence, arzela ascoli).  I would take her again in a heartbeat. The only possible qualm you may have is her accent, and that the class is rather fast paced if you do not have any background in proof based math at the level of abstraction that 104 goes into (I did not. Many others found the pace just right or too slow even). I for one, did not find her accent particularly hard to follow."

No question from me, just sending my love. | Hey Alexis, lately I've been watching your show, Small Empires. At some point in the show, you'll usually ask an employee, if College / School has helped them in their careers over being self-taught. But I want to know your opinion, did you take the skills learned in College to create Reddit? or was a lot of it self-taught?  | alexis, thanks very much for doing this. i'm super excited to meet you. do you know if we need tickets or do we just show up at the door? any idea how many people they're capping it at? sorry for the boring logistical questions but you did say ama. | Will you marry me?!? | Oh god, I actually say ""I read it on reddit"" all the time... | hey alexis can you post a link to that wrecking ball remix?

Here is the full article:

> In an odd way, UC Berkeley‚Äôs new Shyh Wang Hall ‚Äî built to house supercomputers capable of handling as many as 2 quadrillion calculations per second each, whatever that means ‚Äî resembles a mainframe computer itself. It‚Äôs a sleek metal cube that‚Äôs hard to disguise, smooth in front with odd connections coming out the back.

> The difference is that this four-story chunk of metal and glass isn‚Äôt tucked into a corner of a basement or control room. It‚Äôs attached to a hillside above the UC Berkeley campus ‚Äî yet another Bay Area example of how research and medical buildings, no matter how innovative they might be inside, are increasingly awkward neighbors as our region grows more dense.

> In and of itself, the $143 million structure dedicated in November is designed to be operated with machine-like efficiency, pairing form and function in surprisingly sustainable ways.

> The new building is named for Wang, a Cal professor who did pioneering work in semiconductor research before his death in 1992, and sits inside the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a 202-acre enclave managed by the Department of Energy.

> The top two floors are office and meeting spaces for researchers in applied mathematics, computer science and high-speed computing and networking. The level below contains the drama: the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, which makes its hardware available to 6,000 or so researchers around the country when they want to run their most demanding computer simulations.

> **Utilizing ridgeline**

> As for the bottom ‚Äúfloor,‚Äù it‚Äôs not really a floor so much as a 30-foot-tall space pressed against the steep ridgeline with solid walls on the north and south and a screen of open horizontal grills facing west.

> Taking advantage of the ridgeline might be the most innovative feature of this building designed by the San Francisco office of Perkins + Will. The west edge allows fog and cool air to come in from the bay ‚Äî a largely passive system for heating and cooling that includes large screened cuts through the concrete floor of the computer level so that air can be sucked upward and filtered to allow the outside air to circulate more efficiently.

> **Blunt visual impact**

> Given the machines humming inside at all hours, the complex is still an energy hog: One look at the 30-inch-diameter cooling water pipes emerge from the south edge of Wang Hall into four induced draft cooling towers is all the visual proof you need. But with such features as the ventilation system, and smart-looking perforated sunscreens that slice from the exterior of the office floors, the goal at Wang Hall is to use 60 percent less energy than conventional mechanical systems would.

> ‚ÄúIt was an absolute design requirement that this building perform as well as possible,‚Äù said John Long, the Perkins + Will principal overseeing the project. The design team also included the structural engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti and Dynamic Isolation Systems to collaborate on such challenges as the need to ride out a 7.5 temblor on the nearby Hayward Fault.

> Early schemes by the architects set the office floors perpendicular to the levels below, to reduce the visual bulk from afar. But space on the hillside already is so cramped that the office portion would have needed to climb several extra stories. So instead we have a thick bar that is 384 feet long and 85 feet tall.

> The visual impact is as blunt as it sounds. Fortunately, the architects‚Äô desire for white metal panels was nixed by the lab. They‚Äôre a dusty green meant to blend with the hillside‚Äôs eucalyptus trees ‚Äî a hue that helps lessen the shock value from afar, though the hulk remains daunting when viewed on the approach to Lawrence Berkeley from Cyclotron Road.

> This is a variation of the awkward shove of UC Berkeley lab buildings against downtown Berkeley. Or UCSF‚Äôs Mission Bay campus. Or every suburban hospital that rebuilds at a scale the neighbors have never seen. State-of-the-art code requirements plus user expectations equal boxes that often seem to land with a thud.

> Wang Hall shows more care, with details like the office floors‚Äô crisp sunshades and the tight metal grill vents cloaking the oversize lower floors. But there was no review of the project by UC Berkeley, since Lawrence Berkeley is autonomous. Nor does the city of Berkeley have anything beyond a courtesy say, since state-owned land is off-limits to local approvals. Once the client is happy and has money, the construction crews get to work.

> Wang Hall is more sensitive to its surroundings than Lawrence Berkeley‚Äôs older crude, squat boxes. But like them, there‚Äôs no avoiding it from nearby neighborhoods ‚Äî and with each new addition to the crowd, the crowd is harder to miss. | That was my first reaction too.  Seems like clickbait. | u/skwm's criticism seems pretty legitimate in the context of the full article.  Basically, the author keeps talking about the different groups that collaborated on the project, the unique design requirements they seem to have done a good job taking into account, and then concludes by complaining that it's aesthetic is too ""blunt""."

Math 113 Spring 2024 Professors,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1778p93/math_113_spring_2024_professors/,1,1697231114.0,"Hello looking for advice on math 113 professors for next sem. 

Options: Nicole Gonzalez, Kendric Schefers, Owen Barrett, Jikang Wang, and Aleksandra Utiralova

For reference I am taking math 110 this sem and haven taken all the math 113 prereqs. ",[deleted] | How hard is the final for her class? I have midterm in an hour and I am very behind so i don't think i will do well. Going to need to clobber.
"So, how bad is Wodzicki really?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13cgvvg/so_how_bad_is_wodzicki_really/,11,1683611239.0,"I'm tryna take 113 next fall. Profs are Wang, Wodzicki, Talaska, Mladenov, and Utiralova. Unfortunately, I'm basically at the end of the line wrt registration priority (can't register until Aug 9), so Utiralova is out (already filled up with ~10 people on the waitlist). I've heard Wang is good if you can understand her accent, and maybe won't fill up since it's 9am (but on the other hand, it's at 9am). Talaska I've heard is better than the reputation on RMP for higher-level courses. Mladenov I've heard is awful, with little elaboration.

And then Wodzicki. From what I've heard, he manages to turn everything into category theory. But, I kind of want to learn category theory? I was actually asking my analysis prof today about how feasible it would be to self-study category theory alongside algebra with something like Aluffi's Algebra: Chapter 0. So the question remains, how bad is Wodzicki really? Cause if he'll teach even category theory badly and I won't learn any algebra, then idk.

EDIT: and I assume it's probably impossible, but how likely is it to get into Utiralova's class? On Berkeleytime it looks like enrollment dropped to 95% before class actually started, but that happened with a couple other sections as well so maybe a glitch/weird accounting thing.

Also, it seems Wodzicki doesn't really publish, so what do they keep him around for?","Wodzicki is to be avoided at all costs. I have not heard a single positive anecdote about him. So few people sign up for his classes that his sections often get canceled. Far and away worst grade distribution out of any upper div prof. He will teach you category theory, but he will do it badly. If you want to learn category theory, take 174. | [deleted] | Mladenov's assignment are hard as shit (source: taking 113 with him and he even stated thought that students his 104 assignments were hard). | [removed] | He's not bad, but be prepared to work hard. | Wait, what is 174? I'm not seeing it https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/math/ | And can confirm. 90% sure I failed his final I took today. Worst class ever. | Hi, could you elaborate on the grade distribution of Utiralova's 113? Its still not available on berkeleytime. I'm torn between between Utiralova's 113 and Haas' 104 next sem. Appreciated! | Have you heard anything about Wang? | Oh you're just a spammer advertising your website, got it | Sorry, it‚Äôs actually [MUSA 174](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/6110), it‚Äôs a decal. | [deleted] | No worries!
