Freshman Intending Physics + Astrophysics Double Major Schedule Advice,0,1deiojf,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1deiojf/freshman_intending_physics_astrophysics_double/,0,"Hi! I'm an incoming freshman and I intend to double major in physics and astrophysics. I took AP Calc BC in high school junior year and got a 5, so I intend to start with Math 53 in the fall. I took both AP Physics C Mech and E&M in senior year and with my strong math background, I plan on taking the Physics 5 series. I was debating whether or not I should take 5a this fall because Hallatschek is teaching it, and this is solely based on ratemyprofessors and what people have been saying, but he doesn't have the most positive reviews... Any thoughts on Hallatschek teaching it? I personally don't mind if it means taking the physics series earlier and being able to take upper div classes faster too. 

Do you recommend just waiting until the spring to take 5a just because there's probably a different professor teaching it then? Any other class recommendations I should take in the fall and the spring? I really wanna jump right in to the math and physics classes because they're just the most fun for me. Also, for context, I intend to do a phD in either particle physics or something to do with theoretical astrophysics (black holes and gravitational waves in particular). 

  
I wanted to take Astro 7B (not 7A because I'm personally most interested in the topics in 7B and not 7A); what kind of classes should I take before I take 7B? I'm assuming I shouldn't take it freshman year without taking any of the 5 series yet.

this is more specific to spain i guess, since that's where i studied abroad, but a lot of my friends and i had bad experiences with the stem classes we took. some of the professors didn't speak english that well, and had slides that were sometimes in spanish. the way exams were written tended to be very awkward, likely because they weren't properly translated into english, so semantics ended up coming into play. exams specifically are very different from berkeley as well (think like, writing short paragraph responses to questions for a technical course instead of actually solving problems) and tend to be very much rote memorization (ex. questions asking about a specific example from the slides). take it from someone who went abroad with a 3.9 gpa and came back having failed a class (failed or c-, still unclear rn) ‚Äî and this was not for lack of trying. i fully believe i would've learned more and also done much better if i'd taken the same classes at berkeley.

most of the resources i found prior to studying abroad either recommended against tech classes for the sake of taking a chill semester or recommended taking them because they would be easier than berkeley's. i think they were easier than berkeley's and were less work (much fewer projects/labs with less time needed for each), but exams/assignments were designed to trick you and were graded much harsher. lab/project grades in fact often felt arbitrary ‚Äî they consisted primarily of writing (several of my lab reports were 10-20 pages long, *not* double spaced) and had no specific rubrics or auto graders like with berkeley's classes.

How to Maximize my Chances at a Transfer Spot? ,2,1dcxwzl,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dcxwzl/how_to_maximize_my_chances_at_a_transfer_spot/,1,"TL;DR is title

Hello everyone,

I'm finishing up my first year in CC (in the Bay Area if that matters) and I was wondering what I might do in the limited time I have left (4-5 months between now and application time) to maximize my chances at a transfer spot.

I will be applying for computer science (not EECS, just boilerplate CS) and I plan on grinding out several Gen Ed courses over the summer. I know that applications are a craps shoot to a certain degree but I figured I'd ask to see if there were any glaring issues with my methodology. I have a 3.9 GPA and I'm pretty sure I can keep it there, I've taken a number of the ""weeder courses"" such as Calc 2 and Data Structures, and passed with As as well. Additionally, I was wondering if it was worth pursuing the 61A and 61C requirements at other schools (my school only provides 61B).

From what I can tell Berkeley values having a personal connection to the school and while it's not the best, I was a part of the SPMP and will be attending the AI Hackathon on campus in a couple of weeks.

I haven't started on my essays, obviously, but I'm a strong writer and I've been told as such by teachers and ""experts"" so I hope that at least in that way I'll be good. I'm a high school dropout with a GED and I think that the more in-depth details that I'll divulge in my essays will make for a strong entry, at least I hope lol.

Letters of Rec. are tough, anyone in CC can probably attest to this, but I have a plan for this so hopefully I can pull out at least an above-average performance.

ECs are tough as I work part-time but I do contribute to a small number of clubs (competitive coding club, aerospace club, and I'm currently applying for a leadership position for another engineering-oriented club).

My big hook (aside from being a first-generation son of low-income immigrants) is landing a pretty big fellowship in the Machine Learning space, It's not the Turing award but I think it's cool.

Off the top of my head, that should be it. If anyone has anything to add or has any questions, please do so as any little bit helps!

Thanks in advance.",1718056839.0

I went to my highschool last week,99,1dcuxoy,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dcuxoy/i_went_to_my_highschool_last_week/,23,"i was at my highschool yesterday to watch a drama production my brother's in. it struck me as the director gave senior honors at the end that I've wasted two years of university. when i was in high school, i did so much stuff, multiple clubs and stuff that i stuck with for all four years that i really enjoyed. I'll be a junior come august, and feel more disheartened than ever that I'll never be a ""four year senior"" for any club or class at Berkeley because i never put in the time freshman year and not as much as i wanted sophomore year. I haven't been able to get an internship yet (fuck the cs market), and though i was banking on doing +1 gradschool here after graduating my gpa is only 3.6 and my research is looking really mid.

i can't honestly say I've made a single friend here and most of the ""parties"" I've gone to were memorable really only because of the drinks- so i can't even say i've been fucking around to have a good time. most of my days sophomore year have been lonely and depressed if not filled with anxiety.

of course i can turn it around and give it my all for the next two years, but how much can i possibly do to catch up? and I'll still never get back these two years that I've lost. watching all the kids graduating and going to uni rn just reminds me of how much excitement and potential i had two years ago and how much it's all gone to waste- and if i could take it back and start all over again i absolutely would. I'm begging for some advice because i don't want to end university like this, if anyone has realistic advice or has been in this boat, please share bc i honestly can't take this anymore.",1718049523.0

Torn Between UCSB vs. UC Berkeley,0,1dby8n8,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dby8n8/torn_between_ucsb_vs_uc_berkeley/,19,"I am torn between attending UCSB as an Economics and Accounting major or a (non-Haas) Economics major at UC Berkeley. I would be attending as a transfer student in my second-year of college. I want to be honest and thoughtful in my deliberation and consider these two options in the context of accounting, looking beyond arbitrary ranking and prestige. My goal is to become a CPA and I would greatly appreciate insight/advice to ensure I can make an informed decision. Thank you!

**BOTH**

* Comparable in-state cost of attendance
* Questionable housing

**UCSB:**

* Economics and Accounting major (fulfills CPA educational reqs), likely to graduate on time b/c I should be able to get my classes since I‚Äôm that major¬†
* Big 4 recruitment target (not sure if comparable to UCB but I‚Äôd like to work in the Bay Area after graduation)
* Seems like there are more school-based accounting opportunities, e.g., has an official accounting society, etc. than UCB
* Susceptible to homesickness

**UC Berkeley:**

* Non-Haas Economics major (can fulfill CPA educational reqs as long as I get all of my classes as planned, which is uncertain since the CPA accounting reqs are housed in the Haas Business School and they don‚Äôt give priority registration for my major), may not graduate on time given non-priority registration of CPA accounting required courses
* I think it‚Äôs also a Big 4 recruitment target but would be happy to be corrected if wrong. The only advantage I could think of is it may be easier to secure post-grad opportunities in the Bay if companies recruit locally
* Seems there‚Äôs a bigger consulting/finance culture and I couldn‚Äôt find school-based opportunities to join for during the school year. Again, please correct me if this isn‚Äôt true¬†
* Closer to home",1717951788.0

I‚Äôm currently going into my second year as an IEOR major, and was wondering if anyone had recommendations on EECS classes that are great for personal interest. I‚Äôm not going to be double declaring EECS or CS due to a variety of reasons, but am realizing that with my current scheduling plan, I have about ~6 slots over the next 3 years for classes that I just want to take for personal interest.

I took EECS16A (Ranade) and 61A (DeNero) this past year and thoroughly enjoyed both. I didn‚Äôt really put in the work for 16A and ultimately got a C-, but in the last few weeks of the course I just fell in love with the concepts covered and thought the way linear algebra, EE, and CS came together was just beautiful. 61A with DeNero was obviously a great class aswell. I‚Äôve worked part time as a professional python developer for 3 years now, and still found myself learning new content or just gaining a better understanding of the language in 61A. Both of these classes just made me so enthralled with their content, trying to learn bits of what they tease at long past leaving the class.

I‚Äôm debating taking 61B this semester as all of the concepts my friends in the class covered seemed fascinating, but am wondering if people think this class is not worth taking for personal interest due to the workload. Beyond that though, I want to fill the rest of my schedule with extremely well taught and developed courses in the EECS/CS department.

I need help deciding what to do next in regards to graduate education. I got into my local law school ag university of Idaho and was thinking about doing a gap year between because I graduated in three years and want to travel. I‚Äôm not totally sold on the idea of law school because I would have some debt. Or being a lawyer, I like the idea though and could def be a lawyer. Thinking about maybe going and getting my masters and phd in Germany because I am an EU citizen and it is free. Idk also would be away from home and would have to pay for lodging where in Idaho I don‚Äôt. Just law school is 25k a year so weighing the options. I like the mashes program because it is cheaper and I think I would work in more places like maybe work in the government. Idaho law would only be Idaho work only pretty region locked 
Would you mind helping me 
I like teaching and maybe government work 
Could I teach in the US and work on the us with a German PhD or other European PhD

i have discussed with my doctors, and the consensus is that we dont really know what state of health i will be in in two months; maybe i will be ok and maybe i wont be. the recommendation was that i just go ahead and proceed as though i will be well enough to attend in the fall, skip the summer session while we are doing investigations, but enroll and drop my classes day 1 if i have to.

my doctor already wrote me off work for six months minimum. he would have no issue doing the same for school, and might even tell me to delay an entire year right now, if its allowed. when i asked another doctor his opinion about me going, he said, ""your school or your health. you cant have both.""

then, a few weeks ago, one of my parents passed.

i dont think i can deal with any of the enrollment stuff right now. i dont want to tank my whole education plan because of how i feel during this time, but its honestly hard to care.

in addition to The Thing We Arent Naming, i have a full plate of prior mental health diagnoses. (depression, anxiety, c-ptsd, etc.) that stuff is all on an 11 right now.

does anyone here have experience with medical deferment? i know i could/should just call the school but im literally having panic attacks with every medically-related phone call, and its humiliating and debilitating. i would like to be better prepared when i reach out. and i would like to understand if i should just throw all of this at them (mental and physical) or if one-vs-the-other are somehow different tracks / standards for approval or re-starting.

also: is there a limit on how long you can be in a medical withdrawal state, especially if i haven't actually taken berkeley classes yet? and if this medical stuff extends my leave, will it fuck up my transfer credit situation for anything i took in 2020/2021, or is the 5-year window only considered for transfer admission?

tl;dr: im not medically ok. i realistically should defer everything related to my transfer admission so i can focus on my health, but i also have no idea how long i will be in this state or what having 0 credits yet with berkeley means for me.",1717543891.0

What‚Äôs the point of Having Sex Ed if sex is out of scope for me?,0,1d6sjj2,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d6sjj2/whats_the_point_of_having_sex_ed_if_sex_is_out_of/,43,"(This is not a troll post, it‚Äôs my genuine opinion and feeling from my personal experience, and I hope no one is feeling uncomfortable from this. I hope to give everyone who‚Äôs entering this school in the fall a heads up to be mentally prepared, as well as telling current students who might have similar experiences that you are not alone. Please comment or upvote/downvote after reading everything first.)



I remember my high school teacher mentioned several times the importance of sex education, ‚ÄúYall need to treat sex ed seriously and be able to protect yourself and others, this is no joke!‚Äù This is like education in preventing yourself from drowning in your room piled with cash from floor to ceiling, when you know it‚Äôs not gonna happen. It has been 2 years since and I have come nowhere near that stage. From fall 2022 till now, the number of girls I have interacted with for at least 5 minutes in person is around 20. The number of them that are close enough to a point that we can be called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù is around 6 or 7. The majority of them are not possible to become girlfriends due to either not having the same race, or due to the special relationship between she and me that makes it not possible. Since I was born, there has not even been a time when a girl told me ‚Äú\[my name\], you are so cool!‚Äù It‚Äôs rare to even have a chance to spend time with a girl alone for 10 minutes, it‚Äôs rare to even have a friend group where there are at least 1 girl. One of my many goals is getting a girlfriend before I graduate (in 2 years). This goal is probably the hardest among the goals I have. I have heard many people say, ‚Äúthings will come naturally.‚Äù I don‚Äôt really like this phrase, because this phrase sounds to me like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do anything, don‚Äôt take initiatives, just slack off and wait for things to come to you.‚Äù Right now there is no way anything good is coming to me if the only thing I do is wait and don‚Äôt make any changes. The chance of me getting a girlfriend if I follow what I did in the past 2 years and don‚Äôt make any improvements is extremely low. I think factors that contribute to me being unable to get a girlfriend are both due to the introverted nature of myself, and coming to this school that naturally forces me to spend lots of time alone for the majority of my time and limits my chances of social interactions. None of the 2 factors alone are the sole reason, but 2 of them together make it significantly impactful and disastrous. Obviously I don‚Äôt want to leave this school, so the only thing I can do and have to do is change my personality, make myself more comfortable in social environments, and get myself to spend more time in social environments, thus improving my ‚Äúsocial maturity‚Äù. Right now I have come nowhere close to achieving my goal, everything is just so distant, so out of scope from me. Before someone comments ‚ÄúSkill issue‚Äù, I believe there is something more subtle and deeper to that, which I want to share about.

  


This question has been baffling me since \~week 4 of college freshman year, and gradually becoming more intense as time progresses, to a point that I‚Äôve become depressed and feeling hopeless. Everyday I‚Äôve been asking myself, ‚ÄúWhy is everyone else having such an easy time meeting people of opposite gender to a point that they need to protect themselves, whereas me on the other hand, always on square one and never made any progress?‚Äù This anxiety did not fade until recently, when I watched my 21 year old snooker idol, Si Jiahui, and suddenly realized something. I have known Si Jiahui since 2023 when he made his world snooker championship debut, and I‚Äôve always been fascinated by his skills, more importantly, his mentality. He is definitely the person that influenced me the most, and completely reshaped my attitude toward life. In a post-match interview when Si was asked, ‚ÄúThis is your first time playing in front of such a big crowd in the biggest event of the year, do you feel a lot of pressure?‚Äù Si replied, ‚ÄúNot really feeling any pressure, I just treat it as everyday practice sessions, I try to hit every ball to the best of I can and keep my rhythm. It‚Äôs never been my philosophy to set a hard goal on whatever I have to achieve, and if I don‚Äôt achieve it I am gonna be disappointed in myself. My opponent is a world class player so I don‚Äôt expect too much, I just want to perform my true skills and hopefully don‚Äôt lose by too many. Whatever the outcome is, I will be happy about it, because I gave my best try. I made it to this arena through multiple qualifying rounds so I already achieved something remarkable, so I won‚Äôt give myself too much pressure, just enjoy the game.‚Äù In the 2023 world snooker championship, he became one of the youngest players to reach semi-finals, although he lost with one of the worst chokes in history. This year he lost in the quarter finals. Although it‚Äôs sad seeing the last Chinese player getting eliminated, I 100% don‚Äôt regret waking up during midnight of dead week watching him playing for few hours in the last session. It has always been a joy to watch Si playing, cheering for my idol who is just 1 year older than me. I like how he‚Äôs always confident and doesn‚Äôt get upset, even when he choked on easy shots.¬†



Reflecting on Si Jiahui‚Äôs mindset, I realized I can do the same thing as him by applying this philosophy to my everyday life. Nowadays, I still set goals for myself of what I expect to do everyday, but I don‚Äôt really get upset if I don‚Äôt finish with what I wanted initially, as long as I put in the effort and give my best shots. There is just so much uncertainty in life that you can‚Äôt control, so you shouldn‚Äôt be disappointed when things aren‚Äôt going your way.¬†



Not giving myself too much pressure on what I have to achieve turned out to give me a much easier time in social interactions as well, surprisingly. Before I used to be so scared to reach out to people or ask other people for help because I was worried that they would think I am ret\_\_ded or awkward. Because my expectation of their response was too high, I sort of gave myself a lot of pressure and became afraid. Nowadays, because I don‚Äôt give myself too much pressure or expectation on how the result has to be, I stopped worrying about how other people are gonna think about me or think how ret\_\_ded or awkward I am, as long as I don‚Äôt do anything harmful to them. Yes, maybe right now I am still one of the most ret\_\_ded or awkward people when it comes to social interactions, but I am no longer as remotely as scared to interact with people and seek for more opportunities, I am challenging my comfort zone because I think challenging yourself is such a cool thing to do. With more practice and taking advantage of every opportunity, I believe my social anxiety is gonna fade some day, but I don‚Äôt give myself any pressure or hard deadline on when that anxiety has to fade, just hope as quickly as possible. I think that people who give up their opportunities due to worrying about how others might think they are ret\_\_ded are the real ret\_\_ded people.



There is something called internal confidence. In the past, most of my confidence was built upon what I have, or what I call external confidence. I am good at math, so I am confident. I got 100 people commenting on my agar.io video, I am confident. But I am bad at socializing, so whenever I am talking to people that I have never met before, I lose my confidence. Relying on external validation is problematic, because it‚Äôs not a confidence you truly possess, but confidence from outside. For example, if you build your confidence from how much money you have, maybe one day you got broke again, you will lose your original confidence. Internal confidence on the other hand, is built into yourself, not imported from nowhere. No matter what you have currently, you are confident that you can still be yourself, you can still have your emotions under control. You still will try your best and make the most of every opportunity you have, and no matter what the outcomes are, you will still maintain that confidence. Having internal confidence is especially advantageous when it comes to interacting with the opposite gender, because you would be able to display the most natural self to others and make use of every opportunity, and enjoy the process, and don‚Äôt worry about how they respond to you. Whether they give you a good or bad response or however they feel about you, you would still be able to maintain your confidence and have emotions under control.¬†



I used to be envious or even jealous of others who are better than me or achieved more than me. Nowadays, my jealousy almost completely fades away, because I don‚Äôt feel like there is a need to feel insecure about yourself, even if you are not as good as others in some aspects. I believe there is still something about myself that others admire. Still, internal confidence is key, no matter what I currently have or currently am, I know I will always try my best and maintain an optimistic attitude. There are many people in this school I see that are able to attract other people. Back then I felt sort of insecure of myself or depressed, but nowadays I no longer feel that way, because I don‚Äôt give myself too much pressure, I can accept the fact that other people are doing better than me. I am confident that my confidence or ego won‚Äôt be affected even if I am not as good as others. Also I don‚Äôt look down on anyone who does not seem to be as good. First I believe everyone definitely has something that others admire, second I believe comparing yourself to others more than merely learning from each other is not a healthy thing to do.



Late in the semester I have made a few friends, which gave me some confidence. However, most of the confidence gained is not from having more friends, but from myself, knowing that I am more fearless than before, more capable in having my emotions under control regardless of what the result turns out to be, and able to constantly seek more opportunities and not worrying about how others feel about me. Even if my friend count restarts from 0 again, I am sure I am still able to maintain this internal confidence and stay optimistic.¬†



I don‚Äôt really want to give myself too much pressure from this point on. I know right now 2 years have already passed by and I have not come anywhere close to finding a gf. I will still give my best try, constantly seek for opportunities, ask help when necessary, and maintain my confidence. I don‚Äôt expect anything fantastic to come with 2 years left, but no pressure at all, I will go for everything that I think it‚Äôs worth the try using Si Jiahui mentality, and hopefully I get somewhere close to what I want to achieve, and have enjoy the process of social interactions, and learn something cool. I believe no matter who you are, where you are currently, as long as you are not prisoned for life, you should always be confident. Try to put effort on your goals, and be ok with any outcomes. Just don‚Äôt do anything stupid below:



1. Give up opportunities due to feeling others might think you are dumb
2. Only put in effort, but never analyze whether what you are doing is efficient (Usually every 3 days, I would spend 30 minutes thinking deeply, reflecting whether what I did in the recent past is pushing me toward the goals, and whether there are something better I can do)
3. Knowing this is 100% a dumb thing to do and still do it.
4. Slack off way more than you are supposed to



Back to the original question, I think sex Ed is pretty important. However, without knowing the importance of confidence and mentality inspired by Si Jiahui, sex ED may potentially bring many students into depression and self doubt. This is why I think during high school, in addition to sex ED, we should also be taught a lot specifically about the importance of having confidence, as well as how to build initiatives and emotion control, how to deal with things when things aren‚Äôt going your way.

im a ccc student who applied to cal as an econ major and got in but i was initially applying to haas. after hearing about the low acceptance rate for community college transfers i ended up changing my major in december

im seriously regretting it now after seeing some of my peers get in with lower gpas and no extracurriculars (sorry if thats mean) 

just from looking at the upper divs for both majors, business definitely interests me more (marketing, accounting, ect) instead of just straight econ classes (also this is dumb but: the talks about psets are also scaring me, i looked up some online psets and after skimming them i cant imagine myself ever being able to answer them) 

not to mention im seeing mixed responses on whether or not haas students actually get better/more jobs than econ students, i wanted to get into marketing, pr, possibly pm after grad so wouldnt business have been better for that üò¢

this is also stupid and doesn‚Äôt relate to academics but the evans building vs the new haas ones is just another pinch in the heart

The police participating in the training exercise were initially said to include police from UC Berkeley and from UCSF. (UCSF, see below, says they didn't participate). And the police participants brought at least some of the gas used in the training. And...some of that gas may be really old...like from the 1960s.

My guide to picking out classes.,55,1d3rrmu,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d3rrmu/my_guide_to_picking_out_classes/,7,"Hi yall, I've noticed its that time of year where people are starting to ask about what courses to take/what schedule to do so I'm just gonna write down what I personally think and I hope it'll help some people.

Here's a few things I want to address first to the people who are coming in from hs since I've found hs classes and college classes are vastly different and they take a lot of getting used to for a good chunk of people. Here's what I found that are different abt college classes vs hs classes.

1. Classes are always graded not on how well you do objectively, but how well you do relative to your classmates. That means no more 90% = A and 80% = B, and so on. Instead, what will matter for your grade will largely be three things - your score, the average score, and the standard deviation of your score. Basically these things can tell you how well you did relative to your classmates and will largely determine your grade. This also means that you don't need to be discouraged if/when you come out of an exam knowing you probably got less than a 70% on an exam. There's a good chance that exam was just hard. In fact, a 50% or so was enough to get an A comfortably in some of my classes so please don't take it to heart and give yourself a hard time if you don't do very well objectively.

  
2. Professors can make or break your class. In highschool, there's usually only a few teachers who teach each class, maybe 2-3 and they all basically teach the same things because there are guidelines (such as common core or AP guidelines) that shape what will be taught in your class. This reduces the amount of variance in hs classes and that makes it so that what teacher you get usually doesn't matter too much. In college, your professors kinda have free reign on what they cover and how they cover. Different iterations of a class can have very largely differing content and difficulty so I'd highly reccommend looking up who is teaching the classes you want to take and see if they are well liked (a common tool for this is ratemyprofessors.com). (footnote 1

3. You have complete freedom over whatever you take and it's all up to you. You guys are legally adults now (or at least fairly close to it. If you're one of those kids who are at college at the age of 13 I don't think this post is for you to begin with). It's not up to any person to choose what you take and I personally believe that you can ask for people's advice/opinions on stuff but you ultimately make the decision. Don't let anyone (including me) dictate what you should do.

4. Depending on where you come from, the classes here may seem much harder relatively. This is a common thing I've seen in a lot of people and I just want to tell you that you're not alone and I believe you guys can do it if you put in enough effort. I could make a whole thing about my advice for this stuff but that's off topic.

Ok I think that's all the major differences between college and hs classes I can think of rn. Let's carry on to choosing courses.

1. The unit system is a scam and don't believe it. They say that each unit will take a student approximately 3 hours/wk but this could not be any less true. There are some classes that will quite literally take you 3 hours every month even though they have 3-4 units (footnote 2). Other classes are notorious and take a lot of people 20+ hrs/wk even though the 4 units suggests it should be 12. A particularly infamous example of this one would be CS 70.

1.1. Just tacking along, this also means that classes vary a lot in difficulty so it's usually kind of pointless to ask people if taking a certain number of units is a good choice because taking 16 units can mean anywhere from ""I have basically no work to do and can fuck around every day"" to ""I'm taking way too much because I'm taking 4 of those 20 hour courses and basically working 2 full time jobs""

2. Thus, it's improtant to figure out what classes are relatively easy and what classes are relatively hard. There's two methods I'd suggest.

2.1 First is you just look for it on google/reddit. A lot of classes (especially the cs ones) have people commenting on the class if you just look for ""\[Insert name of your class\] berkeley reddit"" such as ""CS 70 berkeley reddit."" Also another tip I've found is most of the times where you don't get results ur satisfied with, try asking google a phrase of all the keywords you want instead of asking ""What is the difficulty of CS 70 at berkeley like."" Dont have any evidence to prove it but personally its worked so if you want u can give it a try.

2.2 Try taking the classes yourself. ADJUSTMENT PERIOD IS YOUR BIGGET FRIEND!! You can enroll in up to 20 units and so what I'd reccomend is just enroll in an extra class or two that you are thinking about taking and see what all the classes are like for the first week or two. Then, you can have first hand experience with the workload of the class and you can determine if you think you can take it yourself instead of having to rely on what other people say.

3. It's usually pretty pointless to ask ""Is this a good schedule or is this too much."" Everyone is at different skill levels and you kinda have to account for that. I know a lot of people who struggle with getting by at 13 units while there are also some people who take 30+ units and still thrive. Don't go hating on everyone who asks these questions but ultimately, the answer to any of these questions will always be ""depends on who you are and how good at this stuff you are."" You guys have 4 whole years here and just take it slow and figure out what pacing is good for you instead of forcing yourself to go along with what is ""normal."" You can finish basically any degree taking less than 12 units/sem if you don't do any other classes for fun. Not that I'd reccomend doing that cuz please take a courses that interest you but I just wanted to put that there for people who are worried they're behind. You're gonna graduate on time anyways with the same degree as everyone else so who cares.

4. Speaking of fun classes, theres this thing called decals here which are student led classes and there are a lot of interesting ones so I'd reccomend you look at them and see if there are any that interest you. Similarly, there's courses that are titled freshman/sophomore seminars which are classes where you don't have much work and you listen to ur profs talk abt a variety of subjects. If you don't know what to take it might be nice looking for one of these that fit your taste.

Uh I feel like that's all i have for rn have a good day yall and hope this helped. Comment if there's anything that you disagree w or want to add and I'll try to take it into account. Oh also i didnt know what flair to use so uh i'll just got w other.

Foonotes

1. An example from my first sem here was math 53 taught by James sethian vs Norman sheu. Sheu's class had hws that were graded much more leniently and had about 1/3-1/2 the length of Sethians. Idk if sethian did this but Sheu gave extra credit for attendance + released ""practice exams"" for all the exams that were basically the same things with numbers tweaked or a small twist.

2. (in my case, nus ctx 11 was this for me. Nothing requried except 5 hws and 3 open note, mc, online, exams. hws are super short and you literally just skim the notes/ctrl f for keywords and you can finish each in an hour or so. Everyone I knew taking the class also didn't study for the exams at all/minimally and got A-s or As just by looking up answers on the fly). ",1717030888.0
Chances of transferring ,0,1d3ohyw,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d3ohyw/chances_of_transferring/,10,"Hey everyone!
I am a rising sophomore at GMU. My major is Neuroscience on the pre-med track and I am thinking of pursuing a minor in music. Next spring I am considering applying to a couple schools to transfer. 

My GPA is a 3.74 (my first semester, fall 2023, I had a 3.45 GPA I was not prepared for college courses, 2 Bs and 1 A- and this last semester, Spring 2024, I received a 4.0). I now figured out the best way to study for me. 

Here are my ECs:
I am currently shadowing an ENT doctor and will have around 150 hours by next spring, I am currently enrolled in an EMT course and will be certified by the end of this month, I am close to finishing up my first publication by the end of this summer (1st author), I am volunteering at my local high school‚Äôs food pantry and an emergency department in my area, I also presented my research at a poster presentation in May and I am going to join a cancer research lab starting in August. I worked in the office of undergrad education in my uni as a front desk assistant this past semester too for 150 hours. I also worked as a medical assistant in Europe last summer in a radiology clinic.

After my EMT training I will start volunteering at hospices and nursing homes in my area by playing the guitar for them (I have been a guitarist for the past 8 years), I might shadow a neurosurgeon, I will also start work as an EMT in my local ED,  will volunteer at the crisis hotline, and I will release my first single with my band this summer. 

I am currently in the process of learning my 3rd and 4th languages: Spanish and German.

I am wondering what my chances are to applying to this institution as a transfer student.

I just don't want my grade to become an F.

"Being in the College of Engineering, I've realized my friends in the humanities are far more interesting and engaging to be around",724,1d3myu2,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d3myu2/being_in_the_college_of_engineering_ive_realized/,154,"I'm not discrediting any of my friends in the CoE, they've been helpful in study sessions and I enjoy hanging out with them outside the classroom.

With that, my humanities friends all offer intriguing insights into the world which I would never learn from my courses alone. It makes them far more interesting to be around in retrospect.

Just to list some of my friends, I have 3 of them majoring in Philosophy and they ask the most pragmatic, probing questions challenging the actuality of my knowledge. Some questions they ask me are insanely rigorous in a great way, as it's helped me question just how much, and just how truthful I actually know of a certain topic and the universe at large.

My Music friend has tried to meet me halfway with my skills, as I have toward hers. She's always inviting me to symphonies either on-campus or at San Fran, and is always playing the violin, piano with the largest smiles on her face. She explains to me how impressive it was that humans were able to apply Physics into vibrations so that we can broaden our insights of the world via a clearer voice of instruments speaking to us.

Comparably, 2 of my Theater friends invited me to their improvs. It's amazing how well they can take command of an entirely different persona on the stage, and they enjoy it, explaining how meaningful theater has been for them to learn, cherish, and assume global cultures encapsulated by their characters they practice.

And then my Public Policy friend, always inferring insights into the existence of a ""law."" He has explained to me how inequalities are latently exacerbated/remedied, the complexities of humans in a way I have never contemplated until now. It's substantial just how far the human race has evolved.

I can keep listing like 12 other friends on the top of my mind. My point stands that when it's my turn to share my insights and hope others can learn from me, I pale in comparison to their intrigue. How am I supposed to share interesting details of what I've been learning? ""Oh yeah, the other day I modeled a constrained optimization algorithm to simulate a virtual supply chain optimization."" That doesn't sound all that fascinating, if anything it sounds greedy and too detached from human experiences.

And then it hit me, I know very little of the world around me. I know very little on how America operates socially and culturally, I know virtually nothing about the cultural interpretations of other countries, the nuanced differences in their human conditions. I never realized I wanted to explore more meaning by learning about the humans around me until I arrived here. Now that I am here, I've acknowledged I'm actually very boring and chose Engineering for money's sake (I come from poverty).

And my friends who are great conversationalists, they are so much happier learning exactly what they wanted. I'm not saying I'm entirely unhappy, I just don't think I bring too much to the table with knowledge that isn't immediately ""humanistic."" And I guess based from what I've observed and from my own feelings, humans gravitate toward those that can exert more humility.",1717017432.0

Thoughts from a Incoming UChicago Student about UC Transfer System,0,1d36txv,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d36txv/thoughts_from_a_incoming_uchicago_student_about/,29,"I've seen this discussed on this forum a few times and I wanted to address it as a California resident who has taken several California CC courses as dual enrollment and was admitted into Berkeley CS as a transfer from an OOS 4 year university.

Berkeley and UCLA are not considered as prestigious as other ""comparable"" privates such as Rice, Georgetown, etc. due to the transfer backdoor method. California CC students have a 40-50% transfer acceptance rate into Berkeley and the average accepted GPA of certain majors often dip below 3.6. From personal experience, CC courses are far easier and are often online with online exams. Assignments are sometimes just one discussion forum bi-weekly.

This leads to diluting the student body with often underqualified students which employers are well aware about this ""backdoor"" method of acceptance which leads to worse outcomes. Berkeley is overrated by US News which favors publics due to their social mobility factor. Publics provide much lower tuition to lower income students which inevitably leads to higher social mobility.

Course Suggestion for EECS Extra Semester,1,1d2vyib,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d2vyib/course_suggestion_for_eecs_extra_semester/,12,"I'm doing an extra semester but I want it to be very chill workload wise so I can focus on projects and applying to jobs. I'm already signed up for cs188 and looking for another class to reach the unit requirement for my financial aid. Also most of these courses are full, would my graduation date improve my odds of getting off the waitlist for all or just some?

Some options so far:

Data 101: Seems light and actually useful for ML related jobs

CS 168: Seems easy, most people say it's useless but I like cybersecurity so maybe it'll be useful in that field?

CS186: Heard it's easy compared to some other upper divs. Don't know how useful it will be for actual work(would appreciate hearing people's perspective on whether this course was helpful for them in the industry)

CS288: Not sure how much the workload will be, also don't know if i'd be able to take it as an undergrad 

  
Open to any other 3/4 unit course that you know is fun or useful. Can be lower or upper div or in any other department.

  
Thanks everyone in advance. Any opinion or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. If you have also taken any of the courses mentioned i'd appreciate hearing your opinions on it regarding its difficulty and usefulness.

Can't declare Psychology because of Prereq GPA and now I feel hopeless.,20,1d2qibo,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d2qibo/cant_declare_psychology_because_of_prereq_gpa_and/,6,"I have currently finished my second year and  second semester at Berkeley. As mentioned in the title, I've recently  filled out a major declaration form in Psychology, hoping to declare the double major before phase 2 so I can enroll in Upper Divisions. I've passed all the preqs required to declare Psychology with a passing letter grade with a ""C"". With that,  I've also submitted the declaration form as soon as I received my final grades on CalCentral. But, this morning I've received an email from the psych department that they couldn't sign me off because my prereq GPA wasn't high enough. The department then asked of me to submit an appeal by July 1.

I plan on completing the appeal this month, but I honestly believe that I don't have great luck with my appeals. Receiving that email gave me a major blow to the head, as if all the work that I've done throughout my years of Berkeley were for nothing.  And I feel behind compared to everyone else who has declared my major. I really don't want to consider changing majors because I was so fixated on Psychology in the first place while I was undeclared. My plan was to  explore research opportunities as soon as I declared and pursue grad school, but realistically with this scenario, I find the odds to be quite skim.

Choosing Between USC Marshall and UCB Haas for Entrepreneurship,27,1d2906t,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d2906t/choosing_between_usc_marshall_and_ucb_haas_for/,51,"**THIS IS FOR A FRIEND**


Hi everyone,

I'm a Bay Area CCC transfer student who was admitted to both USC Marshall and UCB Haas. After graduation, I'm aiming for a career in business entrepreneurship (particularly in the startup space), entertainment (specifically the music industry), and investing (with a focus on real estate).

I'm torn between these two schools, as they're both highly regarded top 10 undergrad business programs with robust curriculums, extensive resources, strong networks, and impressive alumni success stories. I personally know transfer students who have turned down one school for the other, and I've learned that 48% of all students admitted to both chose USC while 52% chose UCB (according to Parchment).

I'm primarily considering the following factors:

UCB Haas has a higher ranking and greater prestige, a lower transfer acceptance rate, a higher number of successful startups founded by undergrads, a lower cost of attendance (by approximately $100k, but I can afford both), the absence of a grading curve which may lead to a higher GPA, closer proximity to my hometown and Silicon Valley, and a more focused and driven student culture.

On the other hand, USC Marshall offers a more customizable degree program (with new Wharton-esque specializations and minors), a seemingly stronger and more engaged alumni network, a more visually appealing campus and facilities, a vibrant social life with welcoming student clubs and organizations, a greater sense of security and safety on and around campus, a more desirable location for post-graduation living, and potentially smaller class sizes allowing for more personalized attention.

I'm also taking into account USC's recent upward trajectory in rankings and prestige, as well as LA's emerging startup scene, particularly in the Silicon Beach area. Moreover, USC has had notable commencement speakers such as Elon Musk and boasts 4 more billionaire alumni compared to UCB (although this is not a primary factor for me).

Ultimately, I want to commit to the school that will best enable me to reach my full potential, maximize my personal and professional growth, and eventually make a meaningful impact on the world.

I greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or personal experiences you can share to help guide my decision-making.

Thank you for your time and response.

Continuing Studies in a different field: UC Berkeley Extension or Degree?,4,1d0wsba,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d0wsba/continuing_studies_in_a_different_field_uc/,19,"Hello everyone! I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley for a CS degree last year. I've been interested in continuing my studies, not in the field I did my undergrad in, but in Physics - something I've always been a little bit interested in but haven't took the opportunities to learn (I did take Physics 5a, 5b/l, 5c but never took it seriously for me to grasp any useful material). I saw that Berkeley have opportunities such as UC Berkeley Extension for graduates to take a class (assuming you get off the waitlist). But something I am potentially concerned about is how will UC Berkeley note the classes I will take through UC Berkeley Extension. Definitely something I'm not sure yet but there MIGHT be a chance I take physics courses and I absolutely love it - love it to the point where I might consider doing grad school. But I'm curious to see if me taking physics classes through UC Berkeley Extension might put me at a significant disadvantage as opposed to, let's say, doing another degree for physics in Berkeley or elsewhere, I would have to know before committing to either of these options. If anyone has any input about your experiences with UC Berkeley Extension or just my best next course of path going forward, I would love to hear them. Thank you",1716711570.0

Ik this is such a humiliating post to make but a colleague called me out for not using profanity and it made me feel bad,0,1d0pxgd,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d0pxgd/ik_this_is_such_a_humiliating_post_to_make_but_a/,5,"I absolutely could not care less how anyone else speaks on a day-by-day btw, your voice is yours to say whatever profanity in rapid fire succession if you'd want. Just wanted to get that cleared.

I don't like to use profanity that said. I used to swear all the time in middle/high school and something kinda clicked afterward and I quickly developed a habit of stopping. I generally never felt good using that language toward anyone. Yes, I am aware of lexical semantics and the contextualization of meaning in words, and I know I used profanity in more social contexts, mostly around friends and family, not to shame/patronize them, more as ""recreational"" language. I do admit I would sometimes swear to demean others, and it took away from the more mindful, sympathaic side of me I wanted to nurture. It was a easy means of attacking and feeling a quick rush of dominance in a argument.

Again, I get semantics and acknowledge I can swear without attacking anyone. I guess with that, the contemporary social hierarchy with profanity seems pervasive in denoting a increasingly common nature of hostility toward someone you want to assert a attacking dynamic. I don't exactly buy into it myself, relying on social cues more than anything, but I stopped swearing to divorce myself from appearing as defensive and more approachable to others. I don't think swearing is generally helpful and I'm better off using more pragmatic language.

With that, I started an internship last week and have been working closely with the group I was assigned to. One of them quickly latched onto my nature I suppose, and said outright 'you don't really swear a lot don't you.' I said I don't at all, and they started going on tangents telling me how much of a loser I am. It felt highly oppressive and made me question my own morals and values. I don't want my language to be confused as a pushover, yet I'm worried this will be a recurring thematic.",1716684689.0

im a transfer student from a quarter system community college. i know application decision was last month but i talked about my submission with multiple people and they said my result was just simply weird so i figured i would like to have more opinion from here by sharing my stats.

major applied: environmental economics and policies (non-impacted and from rausser)

gpa: 3.98, all As and one A-

ecs: multiple major related extracurriculars such as researcher on student garden, 2 internships on economics and policies field, secretary of business club, and 5+ summer volunteers and organizations (directed a podcast) that heavily related environmental and economic.

piqs: i asked multiple friends from my cc who transferred earlier and currently studying in berkeley to proof read my piq and they thought all of my piqs are solid enough to show most of my qualities as a student as well as enough elaboration on my ecs and values.

i thought i got rejected because i haven‚Äôt take any econ classes (macro and micro) before submission but i got waitlisted for ucla‚Äôs economics which is impacted and more competitive‚Äîthey recommended students to finish all pre-reqs before fall. i also thought i had problems with the total of units i‚Äôve taken but i got accepted by all other UCs i applied except waitlisted by ucla. 

i did submit an appeal talking some special conditions that i went through while im taking the rest econ classes for pre-reqs but not so major and impactful but i received A+ on both. i also talked about my new achievements in my appeal simply for the AOs to re-review my application. i‚Äôm also an international student.

After their short convo she decided to watch totally random movies.  The first was Oppenheimer (we all know about that one) and the second was The Boys in the Boat.  Turns out the later was about UWashington's crew team that went on to win the gold medal at the 1936 Olympics.  In that movie, Cal's Crew Team was their rival so there's a small side story about their rivalry/camaraderie).   Total coincidence that she picked two movies that had Cal in it.  She loved both movies btw.   

This morning, my parents are watching the morning news and they see the guy who sat next to my mom on the plane speaking at a news conference.   Turns out he's Shareef Abdur-Rahim, the President of the NBA G-League, former NBA & Cal basketball player, and a very generous donor to Cal's Cameron Institute.

will I be rescinded?,0,1cz53j3,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cz53j3/will_i_be_rescinded/,2,"Hey guys. I'm an incoming freshman in L&S, and I was wondering if I'm at risk for being rescinded because of a transcript discrepancy.

Currently, I'm taking a Dual Enrollment CC class that is taught at my high-school; however, there are different gradebooks for both the CC and for my high school. The class is identical in both gradebooks, but the only difference is that any late assignment in the CC gradebook is given a 0%. In contrast, there is no late penalty given in my high school gradebook. Because of this policy, I have a A- in my high-school gradebook, but a D in my CC gradebook.

Given this situation, I was wondering if I'm at risk for being rescinded. I know that I have to submit both transcripts, but I was wondering which one Berkeley would evaluate and use to determine if I broke my Conditions of Admission. The only difference between those two gradebooks was 1 large project that I turned in late, which resulted in my CC grade dropping to a D because I was given a 0% on that assignment. Any advice would be appreciated.

My three thoughts:

* it's pretty mediocre and unnecessary. And why would an A-list institution choose the letter ""B"" (synonymous in academic institutions with a passing but still second-rate, grade) as its symbol?
* don't waste your time lobbying or complaining the marketing department, University spokespeople, etc. They are not the decision-makers. **The ultimate decision-maker in this case will be the new Chancellor, who is himself a Cal alumni.** He could easily decide to overturn or ""pause"" this poorly conceived decision upon entering office. That's a relatively easy time to ""make changes"".

this would cause me to not meet the 3.0 requirement for this semester, so i am a bit worried as to if this would lead to berkeley rescinding my acceptance. 5 out of the 6 classes i am taking this semester are AP classes (ironically my lowest grade may be in the one normal class i'm taking), so i'm not sure if this would make them more lenient in any way. please let me know if you have been in a similar situation or if you have any general advice!",1716474392.0

I am an incoming graduate student and am currently searching for housing for the 24-25 academic year, and I am looking for suggestions and recommendations. Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

A bit about myself: I rarely use amenities and strongly prefer living alone, so I am specifically looking for quiet studio apartments. I am considering both university housing options and off-campus apartments, though I'm not sure if there are any suitable options left in terms of university housing. I anticipate mostly eating in dining halls (hopefully they aren't too bad, haha), so close to dining facilities is a plus. Additionally, since I don't have a car, I prefer to live in a safe area close to campus (walking distance probably).

Fun fact: I briefly stayed in the Berkeley Housing Unit One for a few days in 2016 during junior high summer activities, but I expect things might have changed since then, and my memory is a bit blurred.

Could you please give me with some cost-effective housing options for reference? Alternatively, if you could advise on areas to avoid, I would greatly appreciate it.

Hello Berkeley Brand,

Please consider changing the LinkedIn logo to the official UC Berkeley seal. I and many alumni are upset by the recent branding change, and feel that the new social media logo undermines the university‚Äôs brand recognition and credibility on LinkedIn. 

On first glance, the general public has no connection with or awareness of the new logo on social media, which strips the soul and spirit of the older look. Given the increasingly competitive job market, consider how this rebranding may negatively impact graduates entering the job market, as both recruiters and the general public will not recognize, and may even be confused by the new logo. I find it unacceptable that the official seal is not used for LinkedIn, as it is the largest professional networking site. 

Almost 1000 students have already signed a petition that can be found [here](https://www.change.org/p/reverse-the-new-uc-berkeley-rebranding). Please acknowledge the feedback by members of the UC Berkeley community, and consider publicly addressing our concerns. 

Best,

did i miss out on the college experience ?,0,1cyanio,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cyanio/did_i_miss_out_on_the_college_experience/,5,"It‚Äôs been over a year since I graduated, but I keep getting swept up in this pit of nostalgia for the past, specifically college. I can‚Äôt help but feel so depressed when I listen to other people reflect about their college years and everything they did, the ‚Äúlifelong friends‚Äù they made along the way, or how they met their fianc√© in class or through a campus organization. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I grew immensely, met a fuck ton of people, and gathered a lifetime of stories/experiences/skills under my belt from the four years I spent at cal (technically only 3 because COVID stole one of them), but it wasn‚Äôt in the quintessential college experience way that my younger self envisioned and yearned for. 

For starters, I was a sugar baby virtually the whole time I was there. I was basically never in a relationship with someone my own age that had the potential of growth and ‚Äúunconditional love‚Äù while in college. Yes, I was able to save over six figures without ever working just from sugaring and gained a lot of wisdom and confidence from running in elite circles with powerful men in SF and having proximity to the ‚Äúupper echelon‚Äù, but what about the counterfactual? Would I have had more fun / evolved more / been happier if I had tried to make things work with a broke college boy who‚Äôs idea of fun was binge drinking at a frat party and who asked to split the check on dinner dates? 

It was also really hard for me to make close female friends while I was there. One of the reasons was definitely the time commitments I had from sugaring & later exotic dancing at a club in the city (worked 4 days a week). I would start work at 7pm and come back around 2am, which basically meant all the ‚Äúpartying‚Äù and ‚Äúsocializing‚Äù I did was reserved for my shift and the rest of my free time was for studying/sleeping. I can‚Äôt entirely say I regret dancing because it did teach me soooo much about myself, not to mention I made almost $13k a month in cash just for working 24 hours a week. 

The what-ifs are the thing that‚Äôs killing me now because I can never go back and do college all over again. Even if I end up going to grad school, it won‚Äôt be the same. For those that did have the ‚Äúquintessential‚Äù experience that you read about in books or see on TV, do you think I missed out on something priceless? Did I sell my youth for short term gain but life long loss?

It‚Äôs not your fault if you‚Äôre a lonely man,12,1cxg2ty,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cxg2ty/its_not_your_fault_if_youre_a_lonely_man/,23,"**Intro:**

I just saw a post here about a lonely guy and his struggles in dating.

When I read it, the frustration, sadness, and despair were palpable. But since [63% of young men are single](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/08/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans/), [and half of male university students are virgins](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sex-and-Relationships-Among-Students-Summary-Report.pdf), I can understand why this poster wasn‚Äôt happy. 

The majority of men are lonely. 

While I cannot solve this very real societal phenomenon, I will try to put things into perspective.

After all, trite as it may sound, life is truly about much more than dating. We‚Äôll talk about this later on.

Before we begin, I would like to sincerely dedicate this post to all of those people who carry a void in their hearts every day.

I truly hope that reading the following will bring you at least a little peace of mind.

***

This is something that you need to tell yourself every single day. Life coaches and toxic PUAs like Andrew Tate [are telling you to run game on 5 women every day](https://www.aol.com/murky-online-world-andrew-tate-065208828.html), but I'm telling you to tell yourself this 5 times a day:

**It's not your fault.**

This should be said and emphasized a lot more. I want you guys to completely digest this idea. It is important to keep reminding yourself of this truth. Once you truly understand this, you will have a much more peaceful mindset.

The situation you are in was *forced upon you*.

[Genetic determinism is anathema to most people](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/01/science/effects-of-beauty-found-to-run-surprisingly-deep.html?pagewanted=1). You will always see the fortunate, the lucky people [try to take credit for their living situations](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-role-of-luck-in-life-success-is-far-greater-than-we-realized/), but they won't acknowledge the opportunities they were given.

I want you to understand something: when people tell you ""you can do it, you can do anything,"" they are not saying it for your benefit. They are saying it to gaslight you and feel better about themselves. It implies that if you fail, it was because of something you did wrong.

""You could've done it, but you didn't, so it's your fault.""

Don't let people gaslight you.

You look at a guy like Jeremy Meeks, scum of the earth. This guy is the personification of luck. The guy made the wrong choices and decisions at every step of the way, and he still made it as a [multimillionaire top model](https://sfist.com/2017/01/03/hot_felon_jeremy_meeks_now_has_big/), all because of his looks.

He comes from a [broken family](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5644925/Jeremy-Meeks-father-jail-33-years-murder-young-mother.html), he's a [criminal, robber, gangster, beat an underage kid to near death](https://hollywoodlife.com/2014/06/21/jeremy-meeks-2002-arrest-beating/), [drug dealer](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/weird/hot-felon-in-court-asks-for-public-defender/77-271067739), [weapons charges](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hot-felon-jeremy-meeks-gets-two-years-prison-gun-rap-n302041), you fucking name it. Yet, women are worshiping him, [literally worshiping him](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/women-offer-to-pay-bail-for-handsome-convict-why-society/).

I ask you this: how many mistakes is too many? 10? 20? 50?

When you are good-looking, [no amount is too many.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6762156/) [Anything is forgivable](https://www.insider.com/cameron-herrin-tiktok-viral-videos-prison-free-too-cute-2021-8).

&#x200B;

""Anything is possible. Never give up. God's got a plan for you."" - [Jeremy Meeks](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/F2QtEjb6t1E)

&#x200B;

Well, when you look like [him](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcRbZSv-NNUGLtTLfeiXSI1Eo3bIHQlB418Vs-nedpE3So6RQH4_O5TbvzOBPeu6CMUn5bxHghHLsEpJMqc), yeah, of course anything is gonna be possible.

&#x200B;

You look at a guy like Hunter Biden, [drug addict](https://time.com/5952773/hunter-biden-memoir-beautiful-things/) and [porn actor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/marjorie-taylor-greene-hunter-biden-photos/). Still, he's a [board member of a nine-figure international investment firm](https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2023/03/09/hunter-bidens-mine-truth). All because of his dad. All because he was lucky enough to be born into the Biden family.

You look at Elon Musk, richest guy on earth. He in turn comes from a dirty rich family that [makes bank with him off of the backs of literal child slaves](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-children-trfn/tesla-apple-among-firms-accused-of-aiding-child-labor-in-africa-idUSKBN1YK24F/). [His 80-year-old father made a child with his 30-year-old stepdaughter.](https://www.mamamia.com.au/errol-musk/) Think about it, this guy was fucking 50 years old when he adopted that child.

These are **morally bankrupt** people, and yet you see the lives they are living.

You look at a guy like Bill Gates, [whose classmates' parents literally bought a computer room](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-gates-at-home/) for his high school during a time when even top U.S. universities didn't have computer rooms. Bill got to spend unlimited time with the latest and greatest computers as a child in the 1960s.

I am not saying Bill is dumb. Of course, you also need brains, but [even intelligence is luck](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270739/).

It's brutal how lucky you have to be in life. Not only do [you need the smarts](https://docs.iza.org/dp8235.pdf), but you need to be born in the [right time and location](https://news.byu.edu/news/study-hockey-players-born-october-through-december-score-more-and-are-paid-more) into the [right family](https://magadhmahilacollege.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Advantages-of-Nuclear-Family.pdf). You think a smart kid who was born in a war-torn third-world country stands any chance?

Never.

Fucking never.

You gotta be lucky in this life. The most important factor governing success in life is luck. [Looks will directly influence how you are treated by others](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-2909.111.2.304) [from the day you were born](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264380105), before you could even remember. Your **[neurotypicality, face, race, and height](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/s/2ZGaGrF5V2)** are paramount when it comes to how society will treat you (I have mountains of data at the above link, **read it** to see just how important these genetic factors are). This in turn shapes your personality.

[Your intelligence](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf), the [opportunities you were born into](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6296851/), [your gender](https://mitili.mit.edu/sites/default/files/project-documents/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.07-Terrier.pdf); they are all important.

Even in the job market, [just your gender influences your chances majorly](https://ifunny.co/picture/sent-100-applications-as-a-man-and-a-woman-it-BbmtYyFB8).

Everything in life comes down to luck.

""Anything is possible, you can do anything.""

No, you cannot do anything you want to in life, and it's not your fault. Genetic determinism and luck rule every aspect of your life.

**You did nothing wrong.**

So don't let anybody gaslight you.

Instead, don't be a free agent in life. Let the blackpill guide you.",1716318801.0

I'm not mad at the reason why they have it (I understand the issue with too many students into one major) but why would they have it be due in spring 2025 for *2023 admits*???? at least if you want to implement such a process have it figured out before you finish announcing it.

This is accurately portrayed on my high school record and the UC application record but not on my CCP one.

2.) The UC application grade I indicated is consistent with the grade on my high school transcript (accessed January 12th).
3.) Since I could not access Blackboard during application season, I never saw my CSCC transcript. I was not aware I could purchase it from Parchment. 
4.) Since I was under the impression that I could audit the course, I turned in work on my own time instead of according to the schedule, probably resulting in a ""D"" grade.
5.) My family has already started selling our two Dublin properties for the cross-country move to California, and I don't have any other college options :(

So disappointed ,88,1cv4496,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cv4496/so_disappointed/,43,"I was studying all semester and staying on top of one of my classes and was honestly doing average but I was honestly okay with getting a B if it came to it. I got my pre-final composite score and got exactly average like exactly down to the percentage average which again, I was okay with. I thought I studied enough for the final and felt well about it tbh. However I check cal central today and see that I got a C :( I guess I had my hopes high when I thought I would get a B. I don‚Äôt know how I did on the final because they haven‚Äôt released the exam on grade scope. I‚Äôm just super bummed because I watched all the lectures, read the chapters, took notes on everything, and did all chapter exercises as well. I feel super discouraged and disappointed because if I was honestly trying my best and still got a mediocre grade, what does this mean?? Does anyone have any advice on what I could do better? I was going to office hours and asking for help too so I just don‚Äôt get it. I would say I studied harder for this class than macro and I got an A- in macro so I just want to know what I can do better.

Edit: thank you everyone who commented wonderful advice and their own experiences :‚Äô)",1716057767.0

I've been quietly following along for some time now. My family and I have always had our eyes on your beautiful town as a potential long-term home. However, due to a certain weather event in our area, we've been temporarily displaced and will be staying in your lovely town for two weeks.( until memorial day weekend).  This trip wasn't exactly planned for this time, but we're determined to make the most of it despite the bad timing.

Our main goals during this unexpected visit are to immerse ourselves in the community , explore the nearby natural surroundings, and of course, indulge in some delicious food along the way. Any recommendations on how we can achieve this? And oh, I should mention, we'll have our 2-year-old with us too! 

Any inputs are greatly appreciated !",1716036693.0

Looking at [assist.org](http://assist.org), I see that this class fulfills ""1B,"" so is it safe to assume that this will satisfy my R1B requirement? Just a bit cautious because some colleges apparently needed 2 classes to fulfill it.

Change of college steps,1,1cusziq,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cusziq/change_of_college_steps/,0,"I was intending to submit all of my paper work and personal statement needed to switch colleges by June 1st, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll be possible (whether there‚Äôs enough time or not). Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at right now:

1) Writing personal statement explaining why I want to transfer and my academic goals
2) Filling out change of college petition 
3) Filling out major declaration
4) Filling out degree plan 

I noticed that in these forms, they require a signature from a major adviser. Would this be a signature from my current major adviser (I‚Äôm in the College of Natural Resources), or the adviser that will go through my work (an adviser in Letters and Science)?

I was hoping to get this clarified so I can try to transfer by the time school starts in Fall 2024. I would have to have all of my work submitted by June 1st.

Made the biggest and dumbest mistakes- Getting a D in class,0,1cuscbb,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cuscbb/made_the_biggest_and_dumbest_mistakes_getting_a_d/,1,"Literally, I believe I'm going to get a D. And it wasn't even a hard class.

Context: Trying to declare Political Economy. Wanted to do Econ at community college. Did Macro last semester. Did Micro this semester and class ended at 11:59, May 17th, so yesterday.  
Because it was simple and easy, I left almost everything in the last minute and got 20 missing assignments. Finished the Final and got a 74/100 without it being fully graded, but assignments were worth 30%, the most out of any... Also had a bit more than 10 missing work. Kept adding 0's on Canvas to my missing assignments and i just kept seeing the score get lower and lower until I officially hit a 70 and stopped caused I didn't want to look any more.

On the Poli Econ website, we can only take econ once with a C.

Okay, came back to this post and had a fabulous idea. Just sent the Community college transcript to Berkeley from Parchment. It'll have the econ classes, but it won't have this graded econ class and just last semesters. I can take another micro class at another CC and just never attend my current community college ever again and send that future transcript :) .  
Would this actually work?? I think it will.

My dad just came in and I told him I failed the micro class and he said, ""You should have applied yourself."" lol ... :,,) I know. Also, where did I hear this phrase before?? Teachers growing up :/ .

Anyway, lesson learned. Don't be like me. Rant over.

Advice - do a minor during PhD,6,1cumiz5,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cumiz5/advice_do_a_minor_during_phd/,4,"Berkeley offers a DE in Computational & Genomic Biology for PhD students. I'm in the second year of my PhD and I have a background in molecular biology and my PhD is in metabolism. I will have to analyze a lot of data during my PhD (it's not the focus, but a good part of the project requires analysis of proteomes and gene expression). I was thinking about taking this ""minor"" in Computational & Genomic Biology, however, it is strongly suggested that students participate in a bootcamp before classes start, but it costs $300.   
I don't think my PI will pay for it, but he's cool with me taking a couple of extra classes. It will be very difficult for me to pay the 300 dollars for the bootcamp, but I may have no choice but to pay out of pocket. My question is: do you think this minor is worth doing? I've heard colleagues talking about the value that companies give to those who have some background (formal, not just experience) that relates to big data analysis. Will spending those 300 dollars and taking the classes now really bring me any extra benefits in the future?

I appreciate any suggestions",1715997879.0

Admission Question ,0,1cugsic,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cugsic/admission_question/,0,"Hi! I am an incoming transfer and I have some questions and was hoping anyone here might have the answers. I am also a first-generation college student and trying to navigate this difficult process. 

My first question is what is the difference between getting accepted in the fall and the spring other than the start dates? I was admitted for spring but I have heard a couple of different people say stuff to help make me feel better but honestly, I wasn't really sad about that in the first place. I don't mind taking the semester off to start working, saving, or even traveling after completing my associate's in a year and a half. I heard someone mention that I have two summers and another person mentioned that there is a difference between that and a two-year program. 

My second question is I submitted a change for my conditions of admission. I switched classes last minute due to it not fitting my schedule and I also added one more class. It was accepted but it still shows the old class and no mention of the new classes in my conditions of admission. Should I reach out to the admissions office? Does anyone know if it takes awhile to change?
