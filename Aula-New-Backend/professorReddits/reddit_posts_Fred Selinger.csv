UGBA 154 Edward Kass,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w8177s/ugba_154_edward_kass/,2022-07-25 14:43:48,"Hi guys!

I'm an incoming junior to Haas and was wondering if anyone has taken Power and Politics with Edward Kass. I'm currently debating between dropping either this class or UGBA 135, Personal Finance Management with Terrance T Odean, Fred Selinger. Any help would be very appreciated, I don't really know anyone in Haas lol. Thanks so much :)",[deleted]
