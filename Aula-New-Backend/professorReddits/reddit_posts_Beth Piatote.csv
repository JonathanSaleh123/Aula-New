to all my humanities lovers...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u28qd1/to_all_my_humanities_lovers/,2022-04-12 13:33:53,"what's been your favorite class at cal in the humanities department? i'm looking for classes that genuinely get you thinking, ""wow i never imagined that..""","not popular but Slavic 170. Djordje is the fucking best T\_T and it was interesting to learn about Yugoslav literature. Additionally, ASAMST 128AC, Anthro 149, Global 173, and Anthro 119 all taught me revolutionary things about the world I'd never even heard of
English 178A law and literature blew my mind
Phil 133
I really loved ANTHRO 3AC! Make sure to take it with Karl.
rhetoric 165 with professor NA Weston. best class ive ever taken in my life
I loved NATAMST20A with Beth Piatote!

Take an art history class with literally any of the professors.
History 100AC (Sports and Gender) with Prof. Bonnie Morris!
Hi I am thinking of going into Slavic Studies at Berkeley. It’s been rly hard finding information from students about the major! Pls let me know what info you know about the major!! Thank you❤️
JAPAN 177, it’s a japanese literature class that talked about the concept of “urami”, which roughly translate to rancor but has really interesting cultural implications. We read Japanese short stories, books and watched films about urami and then presented our own pieces in other cultures that resembled urami, which was my favorite part of the course because people presented all sorts of stuff like rap songs and drawings. I honestly enjoyed that class so much, even as a stem major."
