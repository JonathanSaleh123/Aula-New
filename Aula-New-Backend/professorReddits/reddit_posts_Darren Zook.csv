"The first ""real"" jobs of UC Berkeley's esteemed faculty. Alex Filippenko: gift shop salesperson. Darren Zook: bagging groceries in Texas. Laura Stoker: McDonalds. Joshua Hug: intern at at Lockheed Martin. Martha Olney: babysitter. Paul Hilfinger: Summer job with Chevrolet Engineering Division of GM.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/11/uc-berkeley-professors-talk-first-jobs/,2017-09-11 23:16:12,,"I can definitely see Filippenko as a gift shop salesperson. He's exactly the kind of person I'd want to buy my souvenir shot glasses from.
The thought of Josh Hug working at Lockheed Martin makes me chuckle, even if he didn't do anything."
"One perspective on poverty intervention comes from the area of study known as peace and conflict studies, or PACS, at UC Berkeley. Campus lecturer Darren Zook commented that, from a PACS point of view, global poverty is a form structural violence and should be treated as such.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/65u41s/one_perspective_on_poverty_intervention_comes/,2017-04-17 00:04:59,http://www.dailycal.org/2017/04/16/peace-data-development-perspectives-poverty-intervention/,"I've always wanted to know how people involved in PACS and other social science fields at Cal thought of the Effective Altruism philosophy/movement. Especially regarding the concept of earning to give.
Based on the title, probably like other commies: why make when you can take"
Thoughts on SOCIOL 180I,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i0hm4l/thoughts_on_sociol_180i/,2020-07-30 00:13:37,"For anyone who has taken this class, how insightful and practical do you think it is? Is it difficult? Would you recommend this class or GLOBAL C10A? For reference,  Szonja Ivester is teaching SOCIOL and  Darren C Zook GLOBAL.","Ivester is terrible.
how so?"
What we‚Äôre some amazing classes you had this last semester?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13uj2x1/what_were_some_amazing_classes_you_had_this_last/,2023-05-28 20:03:04,I had History of US Capitalism with Rosenthal and it was F-ing brilliant. I would love to hear about some of the great classes you all had.,"International Human Rights w/ Darren Zook
Philos 3 -- really an awesome class that I can't recommend more highly
if you really want to learn about public policy analysis, pub pol 101 w larry rosenthal is good to go - its also easy - small assignments, one easy midterm, and a semester long project that isnt very hard which replaces the final
Complex Analysis with Eric Chen was fun
War in the Middle East with Ron Hassner

CS70
Public Health 116. A really good and fun introduction to a lot of aspects of public health while also being P/NP so there isn‚Äôt the worry of ruining your grade :)
Japan 178 with Zwicker was amazing. Also 61B is unironically my favorite class that I‚Äôve ever taken.

Construction Management with Mark Shami
mcb 38 - super great class and is not too hard content wise, profs are amazing and super kind!
History of US capitalism sounds awesome ‚Äî would you send me the syllabus??
Chem 3a? Loved drawing hexagon 10,000 times
Data 8 - really well organized class
Was the workload challenging? How was grade assessed? Papers? Tests?
I heard he's a great teacher
Loved this class ‚Äì really fascinating material and discussions (at least mine) were really talkative and would often go on interesting tangents. Light workload and it knocks out the Philosophy breadth if anyone needs that.
Oh cool! I‚Äôll take a look I have a semester where I can take whatever I want basically
Omg
Do CS majors ever get tired of making the same joke on every post in this subreddit
CS70 was really fun ngl, I loved everything about probability and discrete math except for computability and stable matching. kinda varies from person to person, cuz I absolutely hate writing papers/read books but I‚Äôm never tired of doing math for 10 hours straight.
I‚Äôm reporting you to Oski
Stem cell ethics sound cool
Paper for midterms and group video projects for final. Grades depends on GSIs but if you go to office hours to edit your paper then it‚Äôs pretty much a guaranteed B or above. Very interesting class, just no laptop allowed unless DSP.
Awesome! I seriously cannot recommend this class enough -- the content is super interesting, the discussions lively, and the workload extremely light! It's a 4-unit class, but I don't think I ever spent more than an hour to an hour and a half on it per week (outside of class).
It's not a joke to me and many other people. It was unironically one of the most enjoyable classes I've ever taken.

I have good memories scrambling to do the homework on Saturday afternoons half drunk from a frat party, and the notes were really fun to read.
Why do you even ask the question if you already know the answer?"
Is this schedule manageable? I will be a sophomore intending CogSci and Media Studies and will be my first time taking upper divs,https://i.redd.it/4xhy4un4khwa1.jpg,2023-04-27 08:21:38,,"Definitely manageable! You might just feel tired though on Tuesdays having an 8am and the last class being at 5pm (that's just me though). 

I will say, SOCIOL 167 is by far my fav class I've taken at Cal with Professor Edwin Lin! An incredible professor and I'm sure you'll enjoy his class, if you decide to attend the lectures LOL
Edwin Lin is a good and easy prof üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Second all the comments about Edwin Lin! He‚Äôs amazing"
Good international breadth requirement class?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q6u64p/good_international_breadth_requirement_class/,2021-10-12 12:50:07,"I‚Äôm looking for an easy, interesting international breadth course for the spring semester. I‚Äôm an MCB major but my next semester is not too course-heavy at the moment, so any straightforward, easy-graded class recommendation would be appreciated :))","Check out Global C10A with Darren Zook
sociology 180I, i think it was comparative politics if i remember, the class was pretty easy and straight forward with some pretty interesting content!
Global 10A
How about Watts? Is the class harder with Watts?
Did you end taking global 10a with watts? And how was it? Thanks!"
