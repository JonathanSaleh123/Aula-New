"September 17. A century ago, in 1923, much of Berkeley north of the campus burned. 1,000+ students lost their homes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16ksw6z/september_17_a_century_ago_in_1923_much_of/,2023-09-16 22:58:31,"Sunday is the Centennial of the Berkeley Fire of 1923.

Monday, September 17, 1923, strong, dry, winds were blowing down off the hills. The hills were filled with dry grass. A fire started in Wildcat Canyon (now Tilden Park) and traveled quickly over the ridge line into North Berkeley. By late afternoon, when the winds finally changed back to their normal pattern--blowing from the Bay, rather than towards it--about 600 buildings, mainly houses, in north Berkeley had been destroyed.

The fire burned to the northwestern edge of the campus and all the way to Shattuck Avenue in some places. 3,000 to 4,000 people lost their homes. The small business district along Euclid Avenue above Hearst was spared as were buildings to the east (uphill).

Thousands of Cal students went into the endangered area during the fire. They checked homes to see if people needed help evacuating, brought furniture and valuables from homes, and fought the fire at individual buildings, often by climbing on the roof and using cloth sacks to beat out burning embers.

The Euclid area at that time had several fraternities, sororities, and student boarding houses. Some burned, others survived. About 1,000 Cal students lost their homes, as did about about one in every four faculty and staff members.

There were about 10,000 students at Cal then, so imagine when you're on campus this week that one out of every ten students you see was made homeless yesterday by fire, and many of your professors and campus staff as well.

The campus was briefly an impromptu refugee camp. A lot of evacuated furniture and belongings were brought to the campus grounds, and had to be sorted through and returned to owners. Stephens Hall--then the Student Union--became a center for helping the refugees, from providing meals, to reuniting lost children with their families.

After the Fire, University officials emphasized that the campus itself had been untouched and was returned to normal. But the *Daily Cal* reported students were upset that except for the day of the fire--when there was chaos on campus in the afternoon--no classes were cancelled that week, and some professors continued to give assignments and teach without recognizing the hardship of the students who had lost their homes, clothing, study materials, library books--and were just trying to cope.

After the Fire there was also discussion of the University buying some of the burned land to expand the campus, and potentially as a site to build much needed student housing (yes, there was a ""housing crisis"" then, as now). But there was no quick action and, ultimately, the University bought only one piece of burned over land, today known as the Oxford Tract (north of Hearst, between Oxford and Walnut Streets). It was used for agricultural research.

If you want a short, vivid, impression of what happened in 1923, look at this video, below. It's less than 3 minutes long and it's a newsreel filmed. during the Fire. The busy street with buildings along it in the first scene is Euclid, looking north from Hearst Avenue and the campus edge. Note how strongly the wind is blowing and how many buildings are on fire at the same time. And see how many Cal students were right in the Fire area as it burned.

Dear Colleagues,

As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, show that infections continue to increase.

The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.

Although we have repeatedly noted that all fall plans are subject to public health conditions, we understand that this news will be disappointing. Many of you have worked diligently to develop plans to provide in-person instructional activities for almost one thousand classes across the campus. Many faculty and students continue to look forward to resumption of some element of in-person instruction. We will continue to work hard on our plans, and to learn from the setbacks as well as the advances. 

Learning to switch between remote and in-person

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow.

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to providing guidance and support. 

If previously approved in-person instruction returns later in the semester, students will not be required to attend classes in-person—they can continue to attend classes remotely through the semester. 

To the degree that operational logistics and public health conditions permit, we will prioritize offering in-person instructional activities for Tier 1 and some Tier 2 courses, depending on instructor, classroom, space, and facility availability. Tier 1 is defined as instructional activities that, by their pedagogical nature (e.g., labs, studios, fieldwork), are significantly preferable to offer in-person or partially in-person. Tier 2 is defined as instructional activities that, if offered in-person, would substantially contribute to cohort-building for entering students, to academic engagement for students who are underrepresented on campus, and/or part of a capstone experience (e.g., freshman/sophomore seminars, first-year cohort-building courses for graduate students, capstone courses for seniors, etc.). 

The Office of the Registrar will continue to assign general assignment classrooms as needed for courses provisionally approved as Tier 1 and Tier 2 in the event that we can return to some hybrid or flexible instruction later in the semester. At this point, it is less likely that we will be able to offer Tier 3 in-person instructional activities, those in which the instructor strongly prefers to offer instruction in person—even later in the semester—so we are holding off on Tier 3 room assignments for the time being. 

Current fall planning

For now, as we plan for the start of the fall semester, faculty should implement their contingency plans for fully-remote instruction. Waiting for conditions to improve would not provide us with sufficient time to prepare for the start of instruction. If it is not possible to offer a particular course remotely and the course needs to be canceled for the fall semester, please work with your department scheduler to update the schedule of classes at your earliest opportunity. It is important that students have the most up-to-date information. For questions, please contact the Office of the Registrar scheduling@berkeley.edu.

Whether or not public health conditions allow us to return to some in-person instruction as planned, we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for our students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. Please also take a look at the following FAQs: 

For instructors (COCI)

For students (Registrar)

Participation/Attendance (CTL Resource) 

Looking forward 

We acknowledge the challenging times for our community with regard to childcare, dependent care, personal health, and other responsibilities through the fall. Our instruction planning and operations recovery management teams are working to develop plans to support instructors, GSIs, and staff who require classrooms or office space to prepare for and/or deliver instruction. We will send more detailed information about these plans in the near future.

We will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester.

As the public health situation continues to evolve, we will keep you updated as additional information regarding fall plans develop. We will provide regular updates leading up to and throughout the fall semester.

For your information, a message about fall plans that students will receive later today is appended below. 

We are immensely grateful for your incredible dedication to our campus community in the face of this pandemic and for your remaining flexible to our ever-changing environment.

Letter to be sent to students today

 

Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students -


As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, continue to increase.


The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.  

 

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow. 

 

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students, but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to continuing to communicate regularly with you regarding these matters.  

 

Regarding Thanksgiving, we will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester. 

 

Whether we are all remote, or mostly remote, you should know that we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. 

 

We realize that these changes may be frustrating and make it difficult for you to choose what you want to do for fall. This may also be confusing for incoming undergraduate students, including first generation college students (students from families in which neither parent has a four-year college degree). Please know that you belong here. You are an essential part of the UC Berkeley community and we will support you in having a rewarding college experience. We have numerous offices, groups and services at Berkeley and the Educational Opportunity Program is a great place to start. This incoming undergraduate class also marks our most ethnically diverse freshman admitted class in more than 30 years. We are committed to encouraging and supporting all underrepresented students through programs like The Office for Graduate Diversity and the Centers for Educational Justice & Community Engagement.

We’re hoping this email can provide more information to help you make your decision. In general, if you can reasonably live and learn where you are right now, staying there may be the preferred choice for you. However, you may decide to reside in the Berkeley area if you have on-campus housing, critical in-person classes (depending on public health conditions), in-person research or work, or other specific directive to come to campus; or accessibility, accommodation or other needs. Fortunately, the federal government has rescinded the rule that would have harmed our international students. They can now make the decisions that work best for them.

Learn More

We are hosting a series of “conversations,”live-streamed events where you can learn more.

 

Student housing (including on and off campus housing): Tuesday, July 21, 12-1 p.m.

Instruction: Wednesday, July 22, 12-1 p.m.

Newly admitted undergraduate students (for freshman and new transfer students): Wednesday, July 29, 5-6 p.m.

Student experience (including professional offices and student groups and events): Tuesday, August 11, 5-6 pm. 

 

Help Us Support You

To help us better understand how to support you, we will asksurvey you about your plans for fall and your public health habits so that we can create a program to support COVID-19 prevention practices. Your feedback is important. Watch your email for more details. 

 

Instructional Support

For graduate student instructors, the Graduate Division has created FAQs about fall instruction. 

 

We will begin by providing remote access to academic services such as academic advising, tutoring and peer advising and will assess other options as public health conditions allow. We are exploring how technology can enhance our services, creating toolkits for staff, and following guidance to support equitable access including adhering to ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) best practices and ensuringstudents have the technology they need to succeed.  

 

The Campus Experience

 

The campus experience will begin remotely. There will not be opportunities to gather with groups of other students on campus at the start but we hope to switch to a more flexible approach should public health conditions allow. The State of California is currently drafting guidance for universities and colleges, we expect to share that soon. We will provide more information at sa.berkeley.edu/covid19/Fall2020. 

 

Students who do come to campus, including living in the residence halls and apartments, will be required to adhere to public health and safety requirements. 

 

Financial Aid and Scholarships

 

We are committed to offering financial aid to support students in covering the estimated total cost of attendance, including tuition, housing, books, food needs, and more, whether they are living on or near campus or outside of the Bay Area with their family. 

Students not living in on-campus housing are encouraged to update their “Cost of Attendance” information in CalCentral as soon as possible. Click on “Update Housing” and select “Living Off Campus.” Please review Financial Aid & Housing Updates for Fall 2020 for more detailed information. Should the standard allocation not match your actual living expenses, you may request a cost of living adjustment in mid-August.

On-Campus Housing

 

On-campus housing for students in the residential halls will be single occupancy only; you’ll get your own room. We will be able to accommodate all students who have received housing offers. Occupancy levels in apartments for undergraduate and graduate student and student family housing (University Village Albany) remain the same. All housing complexes will continue to have residential life, housing, custodial, maintenance, and other critical staff on site. Additional information is available at housing.berkeley.edu/fall2020covid. 

 

Off-Campus Housing

 

We remind students that off-campus housing (including private apartments and houses, fraternities, sororities, and the co-ops) is not owned or managed by the university. You are more likely to contract and/or spread the virus if you live in crowded, congregate living environments. We advise that if you are living off-campus in Berkeley you have your own bedroom and you not socialize in person with anyone outside your household (the people sharing your apartment). For group living environments with large numbers of residents, we encourage students to create smaller social bubbles like we will have in the residential halls. 

 

Preparing for Positive Cases

 

While we are working diligently to mitigate the spread, we will reserve space in the on-campus Foothill housing complex for students who have tested positive and are in isolation; are waiting for the results of their test; or have had close contact with a known positive and need quarantine under public health orders. We will make sure students have meal service and other resources they may need during the isolation/quarantine period. Students living in on-campus housing will be given priority but University Health Services will also oversee a small number of spaces at Foothill that will be available to house high risk students who live off campus, as appropriate. Students who are experiencing symptoms or think they have come in contact with a positive case should call the 24/7 Nurse Advice line at (510) 643-7197.

Final Thoughts

 

Our plans will, by necessity, evolve as we receive direction from public health officials. This is the case all over the country with cities, counties and states easing and then reintroducing restrictions. We are grateful for your patience and flexibility. These are challenging times but we continue to invest in a robust remote experience - both instruction and student engagement - to ensure students can have a full and meaningful university experience no matter where they are learning. The campus remains as resourceful, determined and resilient as our students. We will get through this together, and our shared journey through these difficult times will make us stronger. 

 

Stay well, Bears. 

 

Sincerely,

Please do not reply to this message","yo why do I have a course materials fee if I can't actually take labs for the course...
bamboozled
Does the school have any thoughts about people living off-campus and can't cut their leases? Seems super unfair for us to pay \~4000$ over the semester for rent if everything's fully remote and not making the announcement until midway through summer
What does this mean for athletics?
how the fuck are they going to justify charging people 25k a semester when none of the facilities are open on campus lol
\*will begin fully remote
Tldr? 

I can't read this.
It's possible that you will be mailed a lab kit, at least that is what 16A is doing this summer.
Berkeley released a city ordinance that allows any student to cancel their lease with 30 days' notice. This is a city policy so it would supersede anything written in the lease not allowing this. Landlords have already gotten in trouble for trying to stop tenants from doing this.
 I foresee the Big Game played in April

If you think that they can still hold anything in person after starting and ending the semester fully online, I want some of whatever you're smoking.
The title
Imagine going to a world-class university and not being able to read.
Classes in fall start online, might go back in person if things get better, if you have a housing offer you can keep it but you can cancel it, and a couple other things for students to know.
seriously doubt I'm going to be doing 143 stuff at home tbh
You are still on hook for the rent until a new person takes over the lease, so it’s not really that helpful.
The issue is that leases are signed way in advance - finding housing is such a shit show that most students (me included) sign leases in like March, because if we wait until June we’d literally be living a mile and a half out from campus.
At least we get to keep the Axe?
He's probably including rent, food, alcohol, textbooks, condoms, and event tickets. Either that or he's out of state / international
I know leases need to be signed way in advance in berkeley (I'm actually the house manager of a \~40 person house). But even if you signed in March, you can still give them 30 days notice today. It will be a little annoying with Spring leases \*if\* classes are in person, but even if you signed a long time ago, you can still give 30 day notice today.
oos rise up
I see, this changes everything. Let me look into it, thanks."
