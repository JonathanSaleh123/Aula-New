How is ColwritR1a?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13bfrpl/how_is_colwritr1a/,2023-05-07 23:04:28,"So I'm an incoming freshmen and I'm sure everybody knows about that Uc writing requirement. I took the AP lit exam and i feel confident in it but I can't be 100% sure that I'll pass. In case I don't, what is ColwritR1a like? How is the workload? Is it stressful for those who took it? 

Just want to be prepared in case my Lit score goes in the dumpster fire. Thanks!","Lots of reading and writing, takes up a lot of time. It can be stressful (time management wise) but you wouldn't be worrying about not passing (It's a class you should be able to pass if you try hard in your assignments, English is my second language but I was able to get a good grade in that class.)

I took it with Professor Jordan Ruyle and I would recommend him if he is teaching this semester too, he basically allow you to get the grade you strive for if you put in proportional amount of work.
it really depends on ur prof! im so glad i got a lenient professor so i‚Äôve definitely improved in my writing. 4 essays for the semester (3 of which 1200-1600 words) and it was just fun learning not only ab writing but learning about things that are currently going on around the world. i took a ‚Äúnatural rights‚Äù class so it was amazing. it definitely helps you improve as a writer!

also, your ‚Äúfinal‚Äù is you creating a portfolio of all ur essays + reflection piece. it shouldnt be too hard since uve already worked on these essays the whole semester. good luck!
if you can then I‚Äôd suggest look into community college courses for summer. Colwrit R1A may be said to be ‚Äúeasy‚Äù but it‚Äôs a lot of work behind the class too! but if you want to, then definitely look into berkeleytime to get a good idea :)
Shit is a lot of work üò≠ lot of essays, readings, and a portfolio üíÄ
Was it hard to pass the portfolio? I'm currently taking R1A and I'm a little worried about the portfolio since you either receive a P or NP regardless of your actual grades in the class.
Who was your professor
I think as long as you try it should be okay, I've only heard of one people not pass? And my teacher told me not to worry about it. English was my second language and I did just fine.
Matthew Parker! such an amazing guy, highly recommended."
