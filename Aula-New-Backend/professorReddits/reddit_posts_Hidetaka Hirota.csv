Professor Hidetaka Hirota for History 7A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14afswv/professor_hidetaka_hirota_for_history_7a/,2023-06-15 15:40:46,I’m an incoming Freshman and am planning on taking History 7A this semester but saw there were no reviews on Hirota. Has anyone had any experiences with him/ know how rigorous his courses are? Or would it be better to take History 100AC with Bonnie Morris? Thanks :),"I’m taking Hirota for History 137AC in the summer. He’s a good professor, very approachable and acknowledge in US History. There is 2 papers for 137AC, so I assume there will be at least 2 in a normal semester. For each will be 5 pages double spaced. Your sources will come from the readings he will assign which are not lengthy at all, so you don’t have to do outside research for a paper. No midterm but one final. In History 137AC his final is all short answer questions based on a book he wanted us to read. This might be different for 7A. Overall fair professor. You should definitely take him. He’s chill. I hope this helps. 


40% on papers.
30% final

Edit: I thought about it. There really should only be 2 papers. I highly doubt there would be more. Since I see History 7A is only two days. You probably just have two reading each week. Max 3.
did you take it online? I'm hoping to take History 137AC this summer with Professor Hirota. So in terms of commitment is just two papers and a book?
Yes it is an online class, final is online. You just need to go to the lectures on Zoom. The commitment is just two papers and two books.

Unfortunately the final is very time restraint, hopefully he changed it because a lot of students complained about it in my class, but it will 400-500 word “discussions” about each book and connecting it to the class lectures and with page numbers of quotes from the book (30% each) . Then finally a comprehensive essay(40% of final grade) , 700-900 words using 6 lectures as reference. In 1 hour 30 minutes. I didn’t finish and got a 70 (completed the two book essays and intro paragraph for the comprehensive) but still got a B+ in the class. Not hard besides the final time restraints.
hii i'm also taking history 137ac over the summer. just wondering, does he record lecture at all? or is there some kind of attendance policy for lecture? i will be in a different time zone, and so i won't be able to attend lecture, but i was hoping there would be a replay that i can watch. also, if you have the syllabus, could you send it to me? thank you so much!
Yes, when I took it the lectures were recorded but you would have 3-4 days after the initial lecture date to watch it then afterward it would be deleted. There is a “in class discussion part” worth 10% but again I wasn’t able to participate much but still ended up with a good grade. 

Please send me your email privately and I can send you the syllabus.
just sent u my email! tyy"
