A email about UCOP monitoring of UC network traffic. Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/441pld/a_email_about_ucop_monitoring_of_uc_network/,2016-02-03 12:34:05,"Pasted and edited for personal details:



Fellow students,

I want to bring to your attention an important issue on campus. Recently, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) installed hardware on the campus network designed to monitor and possibly record all network traffic coming or going to the campus. This secret monitoring is on-going and opposed by UC Berkeley’s own campus IT security staff.

The only reason we know about the UCOP’s monitoring activity is because of Ethan Ligon’s bravery to speak out about this issue. As a member of UC Berkeley's Senate-Administration Joint Committee on Campus Information Technology (JCCIT), Ethan knew about this coordinated monitoring initiative several months ago and was instructed not to share any information about it. Eventually, Ethan and his colleague Greg Niemeyer decided to speak publicly about this activity.

For more information, here are a couple of news stories:

Tomorrow, I will be discussing the UCOP’s coordinated monitoring initiative at the Graduate Assembly's meeting during the public comment period. I am also in the process of authoring a GA resolution requesting that the UCOP cease this activity and offer an official apology. If any of you would like to be involved in either of these actions, or would like to discuss things with me in more depth, please let me know.
