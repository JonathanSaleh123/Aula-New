Bro rolls up trees
I saw squirrels on UCB campus so fat they couldnâ€™t climb trees. Theyâ€™d struggle at the bottom of the trunk with their fat little arms reaching upwards, completely ineffectually.
Big boned

SAUR CUTE
Oh got DAYUM, he chonk
Those squirrels at UCB are quite literally built differently
Thereâ€™s literally a subreddit for *anything* nowadays
Iâ€™ve named him Frederick
Frankly wasnâ€™t paying attention that closely.  But even better lol. Sheâ€™s just fat with baby squirrels lol
Apparently itâ€™s a chunky girl lol. Another comment pointed that out
Surely r/SandyCheeksCockVore canâ€™t be a real subreddit, right?

*chuckles nervously*
How about Fat Frederick? :)
Ericâ€™s cousin.
Lolol oh damn ðŸ˜…
how come it says you're a moderator of that subreddit?
Frederick the Fat suits him better.  More regal that way
Ronald the Rotund?

Lol idk"
"Interviewing at Google and 3 out of 5 interviewers are Berkeley alumni, so proud, Go Bears!",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s8cyss/interviewing_at_google_and_3_out_of_5/,2022-01-19 23:06:59,"I am consistently impressed by Berkeley. The rest-- 1 was UC San Diego, and 1 is Stanford, so really 4 UCs and 1 wannabe, hehe.","I also interviewed with google but 5/5 of my interviewers were from cal. There was something really weird about the interview tho. I actually didnâ€™t have 5 interviewers, I had 1. He also kept talking to me about inclusion-exclusion and the total probability rule. Now that I think about it, my interviewer wasnâ€™t even an engineer from google, he was the CS70 head TA Richard Hu and I was actually in a CS70 discussion. Man.
I had an interview (not FAANG) with a Stanford alum today and she had the audacity to say 'Go Trees!' when we finished, so I responded with 'Go Bears!' and left the call ...
I feel like Iâ€™d have a bias for Berkeley students as a interviewer haha
When I interviewed at my current job, both my bosses were Cal alum. Was pretty cool
Yo how did you get an interview at Google? Iâ€™ve been trying for months and they donâ€™t care even when I have a referral!
oh well, go bears
[deleted]
Happens to me all the timeðŸ˜”
This happened to my buddy Eric
this is the best comment I've read in a while
did you get the job?
Imagine unironically saying 'go trees' without dying of embarrassment.  Like go where? Trees can't fkn move.
lol if this is a serious ask, google got back to me 2mo+ after the initial screening and was like ""oops sorry the email got lost in my drafts folder. if you are still interested in interviewing, fill this out""
Change all of your background images to Google images (ie. Google logo or offices).. such as your desktop background, your screensaver... your phone wallpaper... and this will help bring Google energy into your life
Itâ€™s honestly pretty easy considering their recruiter spam quite a bit
Who pays you more? Who treats you better during the recruiting process? Did you negotiate? Assuming they spent months interviewing you, I'm sure they'll go the last mile and bump up your offer so you don't go to their competitor.
Go with Google.
canâ€™t go wrong with either tbh
What did you end up picking ? I also had the same situation
haven't heard back yet
Nor do you care, because you would never subject yourself to employment by a tree-supporting establishment"
