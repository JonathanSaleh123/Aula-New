UGBA 106 Reviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sj5arg/ugba_106_reviews/,2022-02-02 16:52:04,Senior in my last semester here who is currently enrolled in UGBA 106 - Marketing with Ming Hsu for fun (non-Haas major). Course seems interesting but a bit demanding. Is this class worth taking??,
