The president has had articles of impeachment against him voted in the House of Representatives.  The impeachment trial, and therefore the actual vote regarding his removal from office, has not taken place in the Senate yet.

The petition came from academics who believe that the articles are warranted and are encouraging the Senate to vote in favor of the articles as well.  2/3 of the Senate would have to vote in favor for the president to be removed, a result that appears remote at the present given the support the president enjoys from Republicans in the Senate, who make a majority of that body."
