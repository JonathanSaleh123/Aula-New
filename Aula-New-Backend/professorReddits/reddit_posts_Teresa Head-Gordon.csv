Chemistry Course Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hqxd9k/chemistry_course_advice/,2020-07-14 00:52:53,"I am trying to take chem 32 in the fall, but need approval from the professor to enroll. I haven't heard back after filling out the google form and no email response yet either. My enrollment is Thursday agh. If I can't take chem 32, should i just screw it and take chem1a OR wait till spring semester? 

Someone said Peter Marsden usually teaches chem 1A in the spring but idk how to check if he will be. Teresa Head-Gordon is teaching Fall, and seems like a lot of ppl don't like her and think she's hard? Aghhh idk what to do. Any advice is very much appreciated. Context: dumb lost incoming freshman lol.","[deleted]
Thanks so much for your response! Ya, I haven't taken AP chem lmao, just honors chem sophomore year. I was able to get an A both semesters but struggled still. Would you advise taking chem1a w Head-gordon? I feel very insecure in my chem abilities agh!! That sounds intense!
I'm in the same situation as you, last time I took chem was honors sophomore year. I've been self studying with khan academy and the openstax chem textbook to try and understand as much as possible before 1a. Good luck"
