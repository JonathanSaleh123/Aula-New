College of Chemistry is safe!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4btril/college_of_chemistry_is_safe/,2016-03-24 14:53:09,"I just got an email from Dean Douglas Clark that ""the campus administration has removed the possibility of dissolving the College of Chemistry from the academic structural realignments that are being considered."" All hail Guy Fieri!","A tiny awful part of me was morbidly curious about the kind of shitshow that would have gone down as a result of the CoC dissolution. 

But mostly I'm happy. Merging CoC's students into L&S would be extra bad for both parties. Long live the College of Chemistry. 
WE DID IT REDDIT
This, like Athletics in 2010 was never going to happen.  It was however intended to get people's minds and wallets open to the gravity of the problem faced by the campus.
