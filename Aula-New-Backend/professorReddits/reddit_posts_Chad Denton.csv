"IAS N45 this summer, anyone?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/o9gi08/ias_n45_this_summer_anyone/,2021-06-28 02:07:37,was wondering if anyone here is taking Survey of World History with Chad Denton too. it's getting lowkey concerning that there's no update from the teaching staff when the class is starting next week...,"A week is a really long time. Some profs don’t release bCourses/info until the first day of class. Don’t worry, enjoy your week instead!
Still did not get any information or update...
are you enrolled in the class too? :0
Yes..."
