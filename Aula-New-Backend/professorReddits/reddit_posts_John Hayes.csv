"Berkeley Alumni Who've Changed the World: Dalip Singh Saud, First Asian American Elected to Congress",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ao1941/berkeley_alumni_whove_changed_the_world_dalip/,2019-02-06 23:20:36,"Hey everyone! I've been meaning to create this series for a while, but finally got the impetus to actually start it after reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/anqk7v/state_of_the_subreddit/) here. A lot of subreddit subscribers commented about the dearth of non-repetitive (and more noticeably, positive) content, so this is my attempt to breathe some more new life into this sub! Hope everybody here appreciates it! :)

For being one of the most accomplished schools in the world, UC Berkeley does not do a great job of highlighting all the brilliant alumni it produces. This is not really a fault of the university itself– there's just [so many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_California,_Berkeley_alumni) out there to begin with! This series will aim to highlight one distinguished alumni every week (or other week) who has changed the world as we know it for the better. Let's begin with this week's showcase,

### Life Story:

(Excerpts taken from his official US House biography [here](https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/21228).)

Dalip Singh Saund was born on September 20, 1899, and raised in Chhajjalwaddi in the far-northern province of Punjab, India, which at the time was a British colony. Saund’s father worked as a construction contractor for the government and died when Saund was only a boy. His father and uncles saved enough money to open a one-room schoolhouse about a half mile from where Saund lived. At the age of eight, his parents sent him to boarding school 16 miles away in the city of Amritsar near the border with modern day Pakistan.

Saund majored in mathematics, graduated with a BS degree in 1919, and moved to America to further his education. Berkeley, California, was not the most welcoming of places for Indian and Asian students, and “outside of the university atmosphere,” he later remembered, “it was made quite evident that people from Asia—Japanese, Chinese, and Hindus—were not wanted.” Saund, however, became involved with the local community and then earned MA and PhD degrees in mathematics in 1924.

After he finished his studies, Saund’s family informed him that the Indian government had been keeping tabs on his “anti-British utterances in America.” Saund decided to stay in California and later authored My Mother India, a book about his experiences at home and a critique of British imperialism. He moved south to California’s Imperial Valley, where a number of other Indians had settled.

Saund closely followed politics during his time in the west, studying the issues of the 1924 and 1928 presidential contests. “By 1932,” he wrote in his memoirs, “I had positively and definitely become a Democrat by outlook and conviction.” 

Saund was elected to the Imperial County Democratic Central Committee in the summer of 1950 and ran for a judgeship in November. He claimed to know every voter in the district and campaigned door-to-door, building momentum. He won, but a higher court vacated his election after it became clear that Saund had not been a U.S. citizen for a full year at the time of his victory. Two years later, Saund ran again, and in the buildup to the 1952 judicial election, he faced a barrage of discrimination. Voters, and even old friends, told Saund that they liked him well enough but could never bring themselves to “go for a Hindu judge.”

As the election heated up, Saund adamantly refused to go negative, his message being, “I am not running against anybody; all I’m asking for is a job, and it’s up to you to judge whether I deserve your support or not.”

“Doc, tell us, if you’re elected, will you furnish the turbans or will we have to buy them ourselves in order to come into your court?” someone later asked him in the middle of a restaurant. “My friend,” Saund responded, “you know me as a tolerant man. I don’t care what a man has on the top of his head. All I’m interested in is what he’s got inside.” On Election Day, Saund won by 13 votes.

When the incumbent Congressman, Republican John Phillips, announced his retirement from the House, six Republicans and two Democrats—Saund included—jumped into the race by early 1956.

Saund’s main opponent in the Democratic primary was a lawyer from nearby Riverside County named Carl Kegley. The race began cordially until Kegley filed legal action to disqualify Saund, arguing the Judge had not been a U.S. citizen long enough to serve in the House. Undismayed, Saund saw it as an opportunity. “When he filed suit against me,” Saund remembered a few years later, “it became front-page, headline news in all the Riverside and Imperial County papers. Even if I could have afforded it, I couldn’t have bought that kind of publicity.”

Saund remained confident in his eligibility throughout the fight, pointing out that, if he won the election, he would take office in January 1957, making him a citizen for just over seven years, as required by the Constitution. He stayed on message and refused to attack his opponent, eventually winning the primary by more than 9,000 votes.

Saund’s ethnicity and religious beliefs were a constant issue in the race. The Associated Press reminded readers that Saund was “a Sikh Hindu born in India” with “darkhued” skin before noting that he had been “thoroughly Americanized after 36 years here.” Saund bought airtime in Southern California to introduce himself to voters throughout the district. But as the New York Times told its readers two weeks before the election, Saund ran up against “considerable racial sensitivity in the area.” When the dust settled, he won, taking 54,989 votes, or roughly 52 percent.

“Californians have not always been hospitable to aliens—and especially to aliens of Asian origin,” the Washington Post’s editorial board observed. “In this election they ignored ancestry and considered the individual.” “He’s growed cotton. He’s growed lettuce and beets. He’s worked in hay and he’s worked for wages. And he won’t let any smart aleck lawyers trick him,” a district farmer told the culture magazine Coronet. “That’s why we sent him to Washington.”
