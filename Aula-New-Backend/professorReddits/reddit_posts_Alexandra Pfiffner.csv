Is this schedule manageable? I will be a sophomore intending CogSci and Media Studies and will be my first time taking upper divs,https://i.redd.it/4xhy4un4khwa1.jpg,2023-04-27 08:21:38,,"Definitely manageable! You might just feel tired though on Tuesdays having an 8am and the last class being at 5pm (that's just me though). 

I will say, SOCIOL 167 is by far my fav class I've taken at Cal with Professor Edwin Lin! An incredible professor and I'm sure you'll enjoy his class, if you decide to attend the lectures LOL
Edwin Lin is a good and easy prof 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Second all the comments about Edwin Lin! He’s amazing"
