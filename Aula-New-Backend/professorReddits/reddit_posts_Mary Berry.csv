Please give me feedback or suggestions on how I can improve this!","I love these!  Last week I went to the Rose Garden for the first time.  The view of the bay was great!  Unfortunately, the roses weren’t blooming yet, but it was still pleasant to walk around.  The walk through the neighborhoods was fun on the way, too.
