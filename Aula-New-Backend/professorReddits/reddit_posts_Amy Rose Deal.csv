AI planned my weekend,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ba5vte/ai_planned_my_weekend/,2024-03-08 17:49:28,"Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me and my friends to figure out what to do during the weekend in Berkeley. So like any other group of CS majors we decided to throw a list together from multiple data sources, and asked AI to create the perfect itinerary for this weekend! (based on the weather forecast, local events, and a couple other parameters) 

This is what it came up with. If you guys like this, I might try to do it every, or at least every other weekend!

**HAVE A GREAT CUP OF JOE AT ARTIS COFFEE**

    Artis Coffee  
    Fourth Street   
    Saturday at 10:00 am  

In my opinion, every weekend should start with coffee. Artis is known for carefully sourcing their beans so their coffee is super fresh! The honey lavender latte always sounds intriguing, but I‚Äôm a sucker for a classic flat white. They also have scones and breakfast burritos. As a student on a budget, this beats a fancy brunch spot.

**GO LOCAL WITH A TRIP TO THE MARKET**

    Berkeley Farmers‚Äô Market    
    2030 Addison Street  
    Saturday at 12:00 pm   

After your morning coffee fix, head to the Berkeley Farmers‚Äô Market for fresh produce and local goodies. It‚Äôs a bit of a splurge but worth it as a treat! Grab a bite to eat, relax, and enjoy the sunshine. They‚Äôre not open Sundays, so it‚Äôs a great stop to include in your Saturday plans.

**CATCH A COLLEGE BASEBALL GAME**

    Cal Baseball vs UCLA  
    Stu Gordon Stadium  
    Saturday at 2:00 pm      

If you and your friends are looking for a fun Saturday afternoon activity that won‚Äôt break the bank, try scoring some cheap baseball tickets (between $9 and $20) to watch a home game versus UCLA.

See the full sports calendar and grab tickets¬†[here](https://calbears.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS:CTO:BB24:BB08:&linkID=cal&RSRC=SIDEARM&RDAT=cal&_ga=&dataAccId=143&locale=en_US&siteId=ev_cal).

**CLEAR YOUR THOUGHTS WITH A HIKE AT TILDEN PARK**

    Tilden Park   
    Contra Costa County  
    Saturday at 4:00 pm     

After the game, head to Tilden Regional Park for hiking trails, a botanical garden, a steam train and a farm where you can even see some farm animals! I‚Äôm a huge fan of hiking and this is a spot you won‚Äôt want to miss. If hiking‚Äôs not your speed, just take an afternoon walk and enjoy the fresh air.

**CATCH A STUNNING SUNSET AT GRIZZLY PEAK**

    Grizzly Peak   
    Berkeley Hills   
    Saturday at 5:45 pm    

Located in the Berkeley Hills, right by Tilden Regional Park so you won‚Äôt have to trek very far, Grizzly Peak offers some of the best views of the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the city skyline. Stay and watch the gorgeous sunset and I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed!

**ROCK OUT AT THE** **BETWEEN YOU & ME CONCERT**

    Between You & Me  
    Cornerstone, Berkeley  
    Saturday at 7:00 pm   

This is an all-ages event, perfect for students. Doors open at 6pm and the show starts at 7. A concert is such a fun Saturday night activity to get your mind off of classes and exams. For just $21 in advance or $26 at the door, end the night off on a high and see Between You & Me in concert with Young Culture, Homesafe and Zoe Ko.

**GET A TASTE OF NYC WITH A BOICHIK BAGEL**

    Boichik Bagels   
    College Ave  
    Sunday at 10:00 am   

Start the day at Boichik Bagels for a New York-style bagel sandwich. If you‚Äôre feeling bold, try the ‚Äúpumperthingel‚Äù bagel‚Äîa hybrid of pumpernickel and everything (the two best bagel flavors in my opinion)‚Äîfilled with your choice of cream cheese and veggies.¬†*You‚Äôll thank me later.*

**WAKE UP AND SMELL THE ROSES**

    Berkeley Rose Garden  
    Euclid Ave  
    Sunday at 11:00 am    

Visit the Berkeley Rose Garden to get some fresh air and enjoy the beauty of more than 3,000 rose bushes. There‚Äôs nothing I value more than my Sunday morning walk to get my head clear for the week ahead and my body moving (especially after a bagel‚Ä¶).

**TAKE THE EDGE OFF WITH AN OUTDOOR WINE TASTING IN OAKLAND**

    Outdoor Wine Tasting at PRIMA MATERIA  
    Temescal Alleys of North Oakland   
    Sunday at 2 pm   

Enjoy a wine tasting in Temescal Alley where you can sip different kinds of wine for just $20‚Äîor free if you purchase two bottles! Which is a great deal for us students. Prima Materia is open Sundays from 1-4 pm with tastings happening as of 2 pm. Grab some friends and secure a reservation¬†[here](https://www.prima-materia.com/reservations)¬†to have a super memorable and relaxing afternoon.

**TAKE A STROLL DOWN TELEGRAPH AVE**

    Walk & Shop   
    Telegraph Avenue   
    Sunday at 4:00 pm  

Shopping is my guilty pleasure so I always have to stroll along the vibrant Telegraph Avenue on a weekend. I love to check out the eclectic and unique boutiques, local art galleries, and street vendors. I always try to pop into Moe‚Äôs Books and Amoeba Music.

**GET SOME GRUB AT A CASUAL PIZZA PLACE**

    Rose Pizzeria   
    University Ave  
    Sunday at 7:00 pm   

Any good weekend should end with pizza and Rose Pizzeria is perfect for a lowkey Sunday night dinner. You‚Äôll chow down on some excellent thin-crust pies in a quaint patio setting. I recommend trying one of their epic salty/sweet flavor combos like sausage and caramelized fennel or burrata and garlic confit. Now my mouth is watering‚Ä¶

Let me know what you guys think. Thanks!","Interesting, here's mine:

Great idea
I love it - great ideas!

2 hours for a baseball game? Ai falling short there ‚Ä¶ and then you beam up to Tilden üòÇ
What prompts you used buddy?
The baseball games are free for students. Last night were down to UCLA 7-1 and came back to beat 11-7!!!
how were you able to give all the local events into LLM? Did yo manually find them first and prompted all the events or is there a api for that
You can tell it's AI generated because none of those places exist
Hey wanna do this with me?

But like, separately. In our respective homes. Not speaking or communicating at all.

Date ideas around Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bz6jf9/date_ideas_around_berkeley/,2019-06-10 19:00:23,"Does anyone have good date ideas around Berkeley for Fridays? My significant other works in SF and thus doesn't want to go there, and I'm running out of date ideas.","A visit to the Cheeseboard in North Berkeley and a walk to the Rose garden is a nice evening. Rose garden is about a mile from Cheeseboard up Rose st with some great old architecture on the way.
Pick one of the secret staircase walks in the Berkeley hills, followed by drinks/dinner in downtown or gourmet ghetto.
Late night steaks at Chez Panisse cafe. Mon- Thursday 10-1030. Its a good deal 30 bucks for a steak dinner and a glass of wine.

Comal has an awesome late night deal as well. 9 to close, a bowl of pozole and a beer or for 10 bucks. 

Daytime I'd go out to Point Isabel or Cesar Chavez park after a nice lunch at vic's or Standard faire.
Almost everything cute/good is in north berkeley and 100% worth the investment.
Trails near Grizzly Peak are really nice
Find a cool restaurant and/ or climb up the big C or hike up the first couple miles of the fire trails. If you go at the right time you can see some very nice sunsets over the bay. You can also walk to Indian rock in North Berkeley, but this is at least a mile from downtown.
Dinner at Epicurious Garden followed by cooking classes at Kitchen on Fire.

Drinks and dinner at East Bay Spice Company

Same with Comal

Go see a Moth Storyslam at Freight and Salvage (or any number of shows) followed by ramen at Ippudu

Spanish Tapas at La Macha Tapas Bar

Drink tea at Blue willow tea

Trivia on sunday nights at Albatross (along with darts and pool)

Fancy dinner at Corso followed by board games across the street at Victory Point Cafe (also food)

Movie at Rialto Cinema, with dinner at Trattoria La Sciciliana and ice cream at Hunphrey Slocombes
Drive over to Tiburon or Sausalito and have a beverage overlooking the water, and walk around.
share a pancake souffle at bette's oceanview diner. wait can be long tho, get there early
Go to Epicurious Garden on Shattuck! They are open until 9pm, but have a variety of different food options (it's like a fancier food court) and you can walk to Cesar next door for drinks and dessert (get the caramelized fig ice cream, AMAZING!) 
On Solano Ave there is a cheap Indie theatre as well that is fun! There is loads to do up and down Solano so might just be fun to walk up the hill looking at the shops and choosing your place to eat based on the walk. If you like pizza, go to Zachary's they have a to die for mushroom deep dish pizza!! 
There is so much to do! Have fun on your date üòä
cornerstone has good shows, there's also the greek/cheapskate hill.
Tuesday night bingo at golden gate fields!! It‚Äôs expensive. Like 50 bucks to buy in but even the lowest prizes are $1200 its super fun.  I think it‚Äôd make a great date
Dinner at La Note will not disappointment.
Berkeley Ironworks is a rock climbing gym :)
Go to the Rose Garden, Collect Sea Shells at Point Emery, play pool at Draw. Go catch a classic movie at Shattuck Cinemas.
Legally in San Francisco, but Treasure Island! There's a gorgeous view of the city at night and lots of places to walk around.
just uber to random places on yelp, bietches love food
Axe throwing!
Commenting to save :D
Alternatively, walk from Cheeseboard to Victory Point Cafe down the street and play board games. :) It's $5 a person while you're there.
For a slightly more bougie idea go to gregoires and eat your lunches at the benches on top of the rose garden.
If you take the long route up northwest, a lot of the houses also have some really pretty gardens (and theres a dog park too!), def would recommend
Rose Garden?  You folks are hard core.  For those with more modest aspirations or are afraid their date may suffer heat exhaustion, I'd recommend grabbing a to go order in the gourmet ghetto and heading up Virginia  to Arch and eating at the top of the steps going to the GTU.  There's nice views and the quad is fairly peaceful.  

A little more ambitious program starts on Solano Avenue to grab some grub.  Head east on Solano and take steps at the Alameda up to Indian Rock for sunset views.  No need to hoof it all the way to the Rose Garden.  YMMV.
why is the dinner better than the breakfast. because you didn't say breakfast
There are also a ton of great little beaches to collect shells up in the Marina Bay area of Richmond and really amazing views of Brooks Island and Marin at sunset
as the bietch, I agree I love food
Is Gregoire's open again? They had a kitchen fire that closed the restaurant for a while.
men can be bietches too
They recently reopened I believe
Well I know what I'm eating tonight."
Vent about roommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xw0mk9/vent_about_roommates/,2022-10-04 21:30:40,"Warning: this is pretty long and contains some stuff I‚Äôve had bottled up for a while. I‚Äôm also not feeling great right now due to school stress, EC stress, sleep deprivation stress, stress from the situation I‚Äôm about to describe, so it might come off as whiny.

I‚Äôve recently not been happy with my living situation with respect to my roommates. (I‚Äôm been living with them for about two years.) One of them, Person A, reached out to me early in school, and at first I was pretty happy, since 1. I was worried about not getting a dorm from Berkeley, and 2. I didn‚Äôt think I would find anyone to room with me, since I‚Äôm a fairly reclusive person. The rent was cheap, and they seemed fine talking to me, which is a big plus as I‚Äôve had trouble keeping friendly relationships of any sort in the past. (Long story‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been ditched by a lot of people, and the few friendships that remained were fun for me, but they‚Äôve petered out since I left high school. And they weren‚Äôt that close to begin with, even if I was able to talk with them about a diverse array of topics. I really miss being able to do that‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs neither here nor there, I guess.) So I moved in with them, and two other people I didn‚Äôt know. And we‚Äôve been sharing this apartment for a while.

I‚Äôd like to say that my time here was all gravy and roses or whatever else, but it really wasn‚Äôt. A, B, and C are all pretty friendly with me sometimes‚Äîwe‚Äôve had conversations that were pretty interesting and fun‚Äîbut my whole time here has still been tainted with a kind of awkwardness. Sometimes they‚Äôre talking and become quiet when I enter the room. To picture it, you can imagine one of those times when someone verbally acknowledges how awkward it is‚Äîan ‚Äúummm, awkward!‚Äù type of mood. It hasn‚Äôt gone away over the years, either‚Äîif anything, it‚Äôs increased. 

Since the first year‚Äîprobably within the first few months, actually‚ÄîI knew that the atmosphere would be off. I‚Äôm not all that similar to A, B, and C, so I often don‚Äôt make conversation with them and vice versa. And Person A, the one who asked me to join the group in the first place, has repeatedly asked me if I might consider finding a studio apartment, saying that it might be a better fit for me. Which is fine, I guess‚Ä¶ I told them that I wasn‚Äôt able to find a single room apartment I liked the price of to begin with. Except that they‚Äôve brought it up several times since then. Maybe they didn‚Äôt remember what I said to them, which again is fine, because I don‚Äôt expect everyone to remember everything I say. But I‚Äôve given the same answer again and again, and the last time they brought it up wasn‚Äôt that long ago. At this point, it should have stuck, right? I‚Äôm just getting an odd feeling about them bringing it up so many times when I‚Äôve repeatedly said that it isn‚Äôt monetarily easy for me. And if they do mean it as a pointed hint, I resent that they would try to frame it as a nice thing for me instead of a way for them to get me to leave without feeling like they chased me off. I don‚Äôt know if this is my pessimism talking or not. 

A few days ago, Person A ‚Äúofficially‚Äù told me that they were all planning to split up. (That was actually the last time they talked with me about potentially finding a studio apartment. They even offered to help me look along with the other roommates.) Now, that‚Äôs fine with me. People split up all the time and find new roommates, and we‚Äôve been together for two years. But‚Ä¶ they had already kind of been talking about splitting up before consulting me. I would be doing my homework in the room I share with Person B, and one of them would kind of just wander in and talk with the other about their plans for leaving. I did actually confront them about this later, but they said that they hadn‚Äôt made concrete plans, so they didn‚Äôt tell me before they solidified their ideas. (Looking back, I guess that‚Äôs reasonable. No need to tell me stuff that hasn‚Äôt been set in stone yet. But as the fourth renter‚Ä¶ I really would have liked to know if even one of them was considering, just because it would shake up the apartment a little). Even then, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily malicious, but that night I kind of heard them discussing together in a hushed sort of tone in the living room. It stood out to me because they‚Äôre usually pretty loud when they talk together, and I overheard Person A talking about the conversation I had with them, regarding me eventually finding a studio apartment. I wouldn‚Äôt normally think that‚Äôs weird, but the hushed voices‚Ä¶ that stood out to me as odd. They really don‚Äôt talk that quietly, even when I‚Äôm doing the same sort of thing I usually do away from them‚Äîstudying, entertainment. They moved away from that topic and immediately resumed conversation with louder voices, so I assume it had to do with the topic and not some bizarre sudden respect for me potentially studying. (Days after my midterms, which they asked me about.) That kind of was the final straw for me. It seems so little when I write it out, but I really dislike my living situation, etc. being talked about by others while I‚Äôm not involved in the conversation. Even if Person A might have provided a reason for them to talk about it with the ‚Äúhelping me find a new apartment‚Äù thing, the hush-hush thing is still weird to me. Would there ever be a good reason to keep your voice down while talking in a group about another person‚Äôs apartment situation? Especially if they lived with you and were presumably distracted? I definitely was not aware that they were talking about me until I noticed the change in their tone. 

I know my roommate situation could be a lot worse‚Ä¶ but I also kind of wish I hadn‚Äôt jumped at the first person to offer me housing. Even if it was a lot easier than trying to find a single apartment by myself. Even if I was pretty friendly with them, and thought it was as good a deal as I might get. I just want to wash my hands of them already, but I really don‚Äôt want to uproot myself in the midst of a semester. (Plus, it would be awkward to explain to my family why I‚Äôm leaving a supposedly stable roommate situation for a single.) And I would honestly feel bad about leaving the three of them to pay rent by themselves. I so badly wish I could just teleport or something out of here into a nice single room apartment so I can get the stress of my living situation out of my mind, because I have so much stress already. But I know it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôll be better for me to leave before the time we‚Äôre splitting up. (I imagine if I were to explicitly talk to them about any of this, they would see it completely differently. Not to mention how much more awkward it would get for the next two or so semesters I‚Äôm spending with them. As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm remembering that Person B helped me make a program for generating random strings of DNA/RNA just a week or so ago, so I feel both guilty and upset.)

If anyone has comments, or suggestions, or commiseration to offer, please reply.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my lease ends sometime May next year. I talked with them a little about leaving early, and that‚Äôs what they responded with.","I'm going to be brutal about this. 
Your roommates don't want you to be their roommate any longer.
Staying in this living arrangement isn't going to get any better for you or them.
It's high time you seek alternative living quarters by the end of the semester if at all possible.
Sorry for being so blunt.
It may be awkward, but I think you should politely confront them on why they don‚Äôt want to live with you. Maybe you have done something unintentionally or maybe it‚Äôs something else that has nothing to do with you. I think it‚Äôs good for you to clarify this so you can know.
Sorry to hear about your housing situation. Just as a thought, you can apply for on campus housing, the co-ops, and reach out to the basic needs center for different options for housing. You could also try to sublease your room for the spring semester, lots of international exchange students start looking early.
I suspected as much. I really don‚Äôt want to move around during the semester, though. And I didn‚Äôt mention this in my post, but our lease ends at the end of the spring semester, so I would still have to pay rent (as far as I know). Money is an issue for me.
I don‚Äôt think it will work out if they‚Äôre potentially talking about me behind my back. Actually, I‚Äôm not really interested in the reasons anymore, no matter what they might be‚Ä¶ the fact that one person kind of presented the idea of splitting to me instead of having a more open discussion really rubs me the wrong way. Even in the best case scenario, I doubt they‚Äôd want to stay with me after I cast such suspicion on them‚Ä¶ not to mention it‚Äôll be even more awkward. Thank you for replying, though‚ÄîI do appreciate you taking your time to do so.
I actually left on-campus housing because it wasn‚Äôt letting me through, so I‚Äôm not sure if I should apply again. Definitely going to consider a co-op‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt the rent sometimes like $750? Less than what I was paying with these people üòÇ

Thanks for the advice!
Well then, you are stuck until the end of the lease unless your roommates agree that you can find another person to move in so you can leave.  Or they agree to find another roommate to replace you.

It sounds from your description of things that said roommates have been discussing this among themselves and not been speaking with you openly or honestly.  But you second guessing them and yourself doesn't work either.  

Someone needs to be direct in their communication to resolve the issue(s) here so all can move on.
Yeah, I talked to them and asked (well, more like told) them to keep me in the loop. They said they would, so‚Ä¶ not sure what else I can do. Except maybe start looking for apartments immediately and confront them again when I‚Äôve lined something up + checked the landlord‚Äôs policies + told my parents about the situation.
Sounds like you're getting some good advice here. Keep following up on any leads. I think you'll find a better situation pretty soon."
