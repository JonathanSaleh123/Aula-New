"Is this schedule doable? Should I drop a class? If should, do I drop a tech class or a breadth class?",https://i.redd.it/rbw8c256mobc1.jpeg,2024-01-10 13:36:21,Thanks for answering. XD,"Why is your Friday afternoon open? You should be able to fit at least another 2-3 classes there ü§î
If you‚Äôre good at physics, drop a breadth. Else drop a tech
That‚Äôs so extensive man. Regardless how smart you are, you should spent some number of hours some day for each class( worksheets, slide reviews, assignments, online quizzes, practice questions‚Ä¶). There‚Äôs no way you can handle this.
Phew, that seems pretty intense even if I consider you wouldn't do any extracurricular activities.
Music can wait
To me it seems like with research and extracurriculars, this would be pretty hard, especially because doing this schedule would mean you have basically no time for other things and each class still requires a decent amount of work regardless of difficulty. I haven‚Äôt taken Physics yet but I‚Äôve heard it can get pretty hard, so I would drop that if you‚Äôre not super comfortable with the material, but breadths could be easier to drop so that you could then do better in your techs.
Lol we are in two classes together but the rest of my classes are definitely easier.
This looks freaking hard. That being said, I love Matt Denham and swim PE! Hope that gets to stick around in your schedule!
As someone who did relatively well in 137A, I had to devote a lot of my time outside of class working to understand that material and get the homework done. I took the class with a good friend now pursuing a PhD in physics and I think it‚Äôs safe to say he also found it quite time consuming. Just accounting for the fact that it alone will likely take you 10 hours + a week outside of class I think you need to drop something, probably that class
Forgot to add, I‚Äôm also in a research. So I don‚Äôt know if I should drop one since the research requires 10hours a week
You gonna love Mendelssohn, he's such a sweetheart. Hw and grading are easy, his review/critic are critical and on point. Really goofy and love to get to know his students really well.
Bruh we are in same music class üòé
Drop 137A otherwise you dont have enough big blocks of time for research and studying
I don‚Äôt know much about music classes, but the physics is doable, especially with Chien-I (love that man). But the spread is AWFUL. Why is it so spread out? I like to crunch my schedules in the morning but I guess a downside is that I‚Äôm usually asleep in the second or third class üò¥.
depends, how much adderall you got?
Should be alright
Assuming you don‚Äôt already know all the content of 5b and 5c, you should probably drop 5c and 137. They‚Äôre going to be very hard if you don‚Äôt understand all the prerequisites.

Also, doing fewer classes to do more research is probably always a good tradeoff. Really impress your research professor, try to get multiple papers out, be more valuable than a grad student.
Even if this schedule is ‚Äúdoable‚Äù, why would you do it? Do you not want to have fun this semester?
Dude i have ur WeChat ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
The problem is I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm good at physics
Which one? Music 27 or music 128
What r they?
In my own experience, I think it‚Äôs def doable (without research at least). I never did research in berk so I‚Äôm not quite sure how demanding it really is, but worst case scenario I would just drop a class. If it is all really demanding, maybe drop a tech, but if you think you are struggling mainly bcz of time spent on breadths, I would drop one. Hope this helps!
Yeah I heard about that but what I‚Äôm worried is the topic is about philosophy and I‚Äôm sure if I‚Äôm good at it.
Which one I have two music classes ü§î
I‚Äôve taken 5a and 5b last semester, 5a was challenging but 5b was ok, so I think I would drop either 5c or 137a then
Make sense, ty
huh who r u?
Have you taken a physics course at Berkeley already?
137a and music 27.
tyty
I took music 128, honestly is very easy and during class is basically a discussion session to help to understand the topic, which should be fun. As long as you go to 90% of the lecture you should be fine!
Music 27. It‚Äôs my first music class, I don‚Äôt know what to expect ü´†
I forgot they had 5b and 5bl separated like that (they changed it since I graduated). In that case maybe it‚Äôs not crazy. I‚Äôd think that 5c should come before 137.
When u know u‚Äôll know
Yeah I got one B+ and one A, that‚Äôs why idk if I‚Äôm good at it üò¢

Maybe drop 137 then. Finish the lower divs and use your research exp to decide if you like / develop your physics skills. Horrible class time for 137 anyways
Why ppl r down voting this?
True
It‚Äôs a somewhat common meme on this subreddit for people to post absolutely ridiculous schedules (e.g. 40 units or something) and ask ‚ÄúiS tHiS scHeDuLe reAsoNabLe??‚Äù sarcastically.

I think most people looking at this post would knee jerk assume your post was referencing this meme because looking at your calendar spread alone, this looks like a pretty terrible schedule crunching from 9am-6/7pm every day (not to mention research).

Then I imagine people‚Äôd start scrolling down, reading your comments, and realizing that this isn‚Äôt a meme, and you‚Äôre being ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù. I‚Äôd put genuine in quotes because you mentioned you‚Äôve gotten pretty good grades in your previous classes, which would probably make a lot of people think you‚Äôre posting here to humble brag about taking on a hard schedule (which is where that sarcastic meme comes from). With good grades like that, people might imagine you *should* have a reasonably good gauge of whether or not you‚Äôre good at physics and whether or not you can take on this kind of semester.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to avoid the downvotes on something like this even being genuine without both (a) being aware of the meme/sensitivity about these kinds of posts on this subreddit, and (b) putting up front in your post acknowledging that you already do pretty well but want advice anyway. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt pay too much mind to the downvotes.

I don‚Äôt know physics, but I do agree with u/Away-Advance6823 on dropping 137, as from a high-level view, opening up your afternoon such that you‚Äôre not ending at 6/7pm every day should make things feel much better."
Physics 7b Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j8ttp4/physics_7b_professors/,2020-10-10 15:34:10,Trying to decide if to take Physics 7b with Speliotopoulos or Chien-I Chiang. Can‚Äôt seem to find Chiang in Berkeley time for grade distribution knowledge or on rate my professors. Any insights on them would be super helpful! Thanks! Physics 7A was brutal enough so wanna make sure to get a good professor for 7b,"I had Chien-I Chiang for Physics 7C. He is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the physics department and he is such a good professor. He puts so much effort into putting out helpful materials and telling students what they need to do to succeed. I'd highly recommend him!

Chien-I Chiang is a relatively young lecturer (he's in his 30s). I took 110B with him.

Spelio is a much more experienced (in his 50s) lecturer. I took 137A with him. 

I liked both -- both are well organized and clear lecturers, both are very accessible in office hours and over email, and both have lots of CC teaching experience (which IMO is a positive sign that they care about their students). 

I will say that Spelio will give the department's grade distribution, no matter what. If you look at the historical average distribution for 7B, that is a good indicator of what Spelio will do: he's historically been VERY clear about this. On the first day of lecture he said ""these are the department bins. I will follow them. Unless there has been a grievous error in allocation of points for your work, your final grade will not change after it has been issued. After exams are graded, you have 48 hours to request a re-grade. Initial grading is done by the GSI, re-grades are done by me"". I liked his crystal-clear and air-tight grading policies, but others found the rigidity to be stressful. 

In the case of the 7 series, that means he'll give 20% of students an A or A+, the next 10% get A-, the next 12.5% get a B+, and so forth. 70% of the class will get a B- or better. If you look at the bins for ""all-instructors, all-semesters"" for 7A/7B, that is exactly what Spelio will give. 

Chien-I Chiang may have different *personal* proclivities about grading than Spelio, but he is a relatively new hire, so he's unlikely to deviate from the department guidelines (he isn't exactly a senior professor with tenure, so he's unlikely to rock the boat).
Awesome! Thanks!
How does physics 8a look like for you with everything online? How was the labs?
hmm is there a video accessible to other cal students so I could try to see how hard it's going to be for me to read his board?
Super helpful, thank you!

There is not a significant difference in teaching quality. 

As Chiang is younger, I expect things like Zoom to go much more smoothly. 

As Spelio is much more experienced, I expect him to be able to answer questions much more precisely (he has a *command* of the material and has heard your question before). 

If you really rely on the professor to be able to go into minutiae to get you there, Spelio, with the textbook for broad outlines. If you really need the professor to get you started, with the text for minutiae, Chiang. 

I really cannot stress enough that they are both very high quality lecturers.
Have you found ppl to study with? Don‚Äôt know anyone taking the class next semester."
