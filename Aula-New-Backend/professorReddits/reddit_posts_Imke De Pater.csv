"Imke de Pater and Dan Weisz, two UC Berkeley astronomers, are eagerly awaiting the spring 2019 launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, having been chosen to lead two of the first 13 groups that will test the capabilities of NASA's snazzy new successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/11/21/berkeley-astronomers-selected-to-take-new-space-telescope-for-a-spin/,2017-12-03 01:06:55,,
"STOLEN CAR, please be on the lookout ðŸ¥² yesterday evening (Wednesday 4/5 8pm) I found my car was stolen from my private parking garage on Dwight and College. It was last seen Tuesday 4/4 2pm. Itâ€™s a 2003 Acura TL-S. License plate is 5ETR259. any info would be appreciated!",https://i.redd.it/2n1n0z7x3csa1.jpg,2023-04-06 09:45:19,,"Damn, that's unfortunate, any idea how they did it? I thought this car had a transponder key.
Oh man, that's terrible! I'll definitely keep an eye out for your Acura TL-S. It sucks that people would do this kind of thing. Have you reported it to the police yet? Hopefully they can help you track it down. Best of luck to you!
I hope all criminals die
That's horrible. I'll be on the lookout, really hope you end up getting it back somehow.
Nice car
I feel so bad bruh :(
Canâ€™t have crap in berkeley
Iâ€™ll keep an eye out !
The amount of stolen cars recently has been crazy. Berkeley PD just found an unreported stolen one being driven by a bunch of juveniles (they got the car but the group ran away).

Will keep an eye out for yours as I am out walking
[UPDATE] It was found today in Oakland on Castro and 5th st. Turns out someone was living in it and it was full of trash, stolen items, drugs, and more. Thanks everyone for the help!
Guess no one is going to talk about the use of that emoji there.

Ok
will insurance help in any way?
Hope it can be found soon, good luck
I had this car and put a supercharger in it. The thing use to fly. But the fwd was boring so I had to get a rwd to swang it.
So sorry dear
Iâ€™m not sure to be honest. They had to have entered through the gate into the lot, and somehow gotten through the lock for my car :/
Yes, I've reported it to the police. Fingers crossed!
At this rate cant blame this thinking
So they saw them but couldnâ€™t catch them?
average r/berkeley user discovering sarcasm
It was called in by a person who saw the group messing with the car. When PD arrived group was already gone (unknown direction, but RP said they ran off)"
