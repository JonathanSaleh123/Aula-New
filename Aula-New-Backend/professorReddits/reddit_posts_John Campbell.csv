(Yet Another) “Schedule Advice” Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xbs5k/yet_another_schedule_advice_post/,2023-07-11 19:50:04,"Hi all! Incoming freshman here to terrorize you with another scheduling post. I am planning on majoring in Political Science, and am also interested in History or Philosophy. I’m sure you’ve seen a fair share of posts about scheduling, but I would appreciate any advice or feedback regarding these courses/professors:

POLSCI 5 - Aila Matanock

HISTORY 4A - Carlos F Norena

POLSCI 3 - Jason Wittenberg

PHILOS 3 - John Campbell

I was also interested in taking PHILOS 25A with John MacFarlane (instead of PHILOS 3) but noticed that the only seats remaining are reserved. Is it worth joining an already pretty full waitlist?

I realize it’s difficult to give advice without additional information, so any general recommendations are welcome. Wishing you all a wonderful day.","As a history major, this coursework looks a bit much in terms of reading volume and essay assignments but definitely not impossible. If you're a humanities student by heart, I wouldn't be worried about struggling. 

Carlos Norena is a great lecturer so don't be afraid to ask questions during lecture or during office hours because he is very helpful guy. History 4A is a pretty easy class but do keep up with readings or else you'll struggle with papers. 

Philosophy 3 with Professor Campbell was a interesting class but I took it during lockdown so I honestly can't recall what I learned lol
Took PS3 with Wittenberg a few years ago. His version of PS3 is more technical than the Broockman (the newer instructor), and notably has exams (Broockman's version doesn't). Wittenberg's problem sets were difficult, but not impossible. Exams were fair imo. I believe general consensus is that Broockman's version of the course is more enjoyable, but I personally think Wittenberg's PS3 is fine too.
I took PS3 with broockman this past spring and if you can hold out until taking it with him, I highly recommend it. Lecture was only mandatory for like 20 minutes bc there’s group assignments in class every day. There’s individual notebook assignments 1-2x a week, that usually are the same as the group component. Again, very doable. Problem sets weren’t that difficult whatsoever, coming from a non tech savvy person who can’t code for sh!t. Also my GSI let us submit late work, the final project was very easy, and the midterm/ final were MC and curved. Based on the negative reviews I heard from friends who took PS3 in the fall, I was so scared but it ended up being my highest grade at a 97% lol. Definitely wait to take it. Also u could always take the prereq Lower divs at a community college. Transfers for credit, and doesn’t affect ur GPA. PS 1,2,4, and 5 have course equivalents at community college.
Also, if u can in the spring take philos 2 with R Jay Wallace. Very easy, and actually quite interesting !"
PHILOS 3 or PHILOS 12A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jjdi7u/philos_3_or_philos_12a/,2020-10-27 17:20:53,"Have you guys taken any of these classes? Which one do you recommend? (Prof John Campbell for philos 3 and prof Paolo Mancosu for philos 12A)
Thank you!!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jjdi7u)","Philos 12A is propositional logic which could be useful if you're studying computer science or discrete math. That being said, you don't learn any actually philosophy or write any papers. It's just solving propositional logic questions which is pretty easy if you've ever programmed before. When I took it with Seth Yalcin, his philosophy was not having any exams or finals because he didn't believe in students cramming. Instead, he just had a weekly quiz and homework assignment. Also, it's noted as top 10 easiest classes at Cal. So take it if you just wanna fulfill reqs and don't wanna do any philosophy papers.
Philos 3... usually it’s just 3 papers
I see! But I saw on ratemyprof that the prof for 12A has super hard final... and ok midterms and stuff. But everyone described the final as “EPIC” so I’m kinda scared lmao
So do u think philos 3 is easier?
IDK as I never took 12A. 3 definitely wasn’t difficult
kk thanks!"
How to pronounce “Campanile”?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/aurmd7/how_to_pronounce_campanile/,2019-02-25 14:55:36,"So I think calling it Sather Tower is lame and prefer The Campanile. I’ve been pronouncing it like how Professor John Campbell said it in my freshman year philosophy class camp-uh-kneel-aye, but recently someone else called it the camp-a-Nile (like the Egyptian river).  So r/Berkeley, who’s right?","Camp-uh-knee-lee
Only Stanford students pronounce it the second way
Wait is it camp-uh-kneel-ayy or camp-uh-kneel-eye or camp-uh-nilly? I've been saying the third one for more than a year.
You can google the definition of it and then have it pronounce the word for you 
Say it the second way only silently in my mind so I spell it correctly.
Cam-PEEN-el
In every part of the country except here I have always heard ""camp-uh-kneel"" and I refuse to change my pronunciation.
""campuhnul""
This. It’s an Italian word meaning “bell tower.” This is the closest approximation of the Italian pronunciation that’s easy to say in English.

The vowel in the last syllable should be  /[ɛ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel)/ .  And the first syllable should be more like  /[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_central_unrounded_vowel)/ .

&#x200B;
Stanfurd*
The two most common ones are camp-uh-Nilly and camp-uh-kneel-eee from what I can tell (both are very similar in sound tbh)
I did this but it’s different than what those in this thread are saying - hence the thread.
Mm well then everyone you have talked to outside Berkeley about this tower in Berkeley is wrong.
[deleted]
This is because the English impose English pronunciation rules on words of foreign origin.
Stanturd
They are wrong, but it's not like it's a Berkeley-specific name. It just means clocktower.
But then you have the problem of ""Say-ther"" vs ""Sah-ther"" vs ""Saw-ther"". You can't win.
Yeah I'm from the Midwest and lots of places have them and everyone says it the way I said above.

I wish I knew IPA :(

I assume that's IPA..."

The art will be finding consistent time to do socials/club work/hanging out. 

Eg : for the first 5-6 weeks you’ll be able to balance your social life and work. Then towards the middle all the way to finals week you’ll probably end up sacrificing your social life if you’re aiming for all As"
