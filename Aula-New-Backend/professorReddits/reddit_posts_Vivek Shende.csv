Math 55 Struggling,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d9b4e0/math_55_struggling/,2019-09-25 16:13:08,"This is my first semester at Cal and I'm in Math 55 with Vivek Shende. The last 2 weeks of quizzes have been really bad for me despite investing a lot of time in reading before class, doing the homework, and studying. I talked with some other students in my discussion section and they said that they also found the quizzes were difficult. I have a solid math background, but for whatever reason I am still struggling. What should I be doing to ensure I don't do terribly in the class?","If you’re already going to your GSI office hours maybe check out MUSA office hours, they’re really helpful and everyone there is super friendly
Honestly from what I’ve heard, Shende is not the best professor. I’m guessing you’re doing number theory type stuff now? When I took it last semester that was the hardest part. Most of the beginning of the course, the best way to do quizzes is to sit down, memorize all the different rules, and then do lots of practice problems. As you go deeper into proofs and such your math background will be much more relevant, but this early stuff is new to a lot of people. Maybe try looking at other professor’s lecture notes too, if you can find them online (I know my professor, Ken Ribet, has some posted on his website and can highly recommend).
I'm in 55 this semester too, these first few quizzes have been tough but I also feel like I am getting a handle on some of the material. If you want to talk to someone in the class or just study I am happy to.  (I cant guarantee I can help with all the material as I am seeing it for the first time too)
I agree it's hard! I have zero intuition for proof-writing so I can do the basic problems well enough and then it just comes crashing down from there.
Thank you! I haven't heard of MUSA, but I will look into it.
Yeah the past few lectures haven't actually covered a lot of content. He does a warm up exercise normally involving identifying some kind of pattern based on some numbers he has written on the board. This ends up being the majority of the class though and we don't cover very many theorems or examples. He explained that the teaching method was to help us build an intuition for modulus properites, but for me it doesn't actually help with problem solving or proof writing.
Who is your GSI? I talked with a friend who has a different GSI than I do and his quizzes seemed to be a lot easier.
It's the Mathematics Undergraduate Student Association! They have office hours pretty much every day from like 10-4 so it's pretty sweet. I also find that the since you're being helped by someone around your age the information is often a lot more understandable vs a professor's office hours whose language might be more esoteric
i'm in a section with Ben Castle"
Math 1A Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6n6mq3/math_1a_teachers/,2017-07-13 20:28:15,"Does anybody know if there is a large difference between the Math 1A teachers in regards to difficulty of class? I currently have Vivek Shende, and some of my friends have Pierre Simon. Any help would be appreciated as I still have a little time to switch around my schedule. ",
