UGBA 196 vs UGBA 192AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ant3ze/ugba_196_vs_ugba_192ac/,2019-02-06 09:29:08,"I know they are both different courses
But which one would be better for getting A?
I am a freshman and thinking of Transfer so my gpa would be very important..

(Ugba 196 with Selinger vs Ugba 192ac with David Harris)","Sellinger is pretty easy if you attend class. He gives you a bunch of the questions prior to the midterm and final. Just pay attention, take sufficient notes, and you should scrape away with an A- with decent effort.
Thanks!
So are the questions which professor gives before the midterm and final  actually on the real exams?
I am worrying about taking this class because I dont have much knowledge for personal finance and it seems that professor doesnt explain all the term necessary for understanding...
