Rest in Peace.
I‚Äôm devastated‚Ä¶ PLG was such a kind and understanding professor as well as a genius and just an all around cool dude who liked legos and King of the Hill. Rest In Peace Phill thank you for everything. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Terribly heartbreaking. Rest in peace. 

Passed away while on a hike...God you never know when your last moment is coming.üòîüò≠
He was such a sweet professor who made every effort to make Berkeley freshman feel welcomed and to make CHEM 1A an enjoyable course. The effort he put into preparing engaging lectures and in-class demonstrations was remarkable. I feel so lucky to have had the chance to learn from him. He will be sorely missed.
He was probably my favorite professor i had. I loved how dedicated he was to chemistry and his songs really made us all so happy. I remember how he would invite the band in to play songs for us on the weekend of the big game, and he would do the great titration to predict the result. RIP, he will be missed greatly.
my very first class at Cal was his Chem 1A lecture @ crackass 8AM in Pimentel :‚Äô)) this really is a shock. rest in power, prof geissler
RIP
How very sad. :-(
You were a legend, I am really thankful I got to take your class. Rest in peace.
I knew Phil from college, he was the year ahead of me. He had a pet hedgehog named Zilla named after ‚ÄúGodzilla, but secular.‚Äù I‚Äôm pleased to see he was so well loved but this is devastating.
what classes did he teach?
May he Rest In Peace ‚ù§Ô∏è

Wow, what a loss. Rest in peace.
Same, I'll never forget his first class. He gave us an iclicker quiz asking why we took his class. The choices:
- to see complicated molecules and math
- to see the prof play the guitar
- to see stuff explode
- to see the prof sing
(Something along those lines)

Next he is like well we will do all four of those at the same time, man was playing his guitar and singing while his TAs were writing shit on the blackboard, and another TA blew up what I can only assume is H2 filled balloons or something.

This was my first taste of American scientific education and I was here for it.
Dont forget the simple basics in life: relax and enjoy, as you say, you never know.

RIP
Chem 1A, Chem 120B, Chem 121 that I know of
Please tell me that those classes were recorded!
Coincidentally enough, they are:
