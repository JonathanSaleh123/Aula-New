Looking for paid interns! (web developers/designers),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i28ks/looking_for_paid_interns_web_developersdesigners/,2011-06-17 09:25:58,"I am hiring for an opening at anthonysweb.com

Right now we are specifically looking for someone who knows CakePHP but if you have a diverse skill set we will keep you on.

Please tell me a little about yourself, send a sample of your code (the cleaner the better) and let me know how much per hour you're looking for. (We're looking between $15-$25/hr, you'll learn a lot and we'll be a great reference!)

Thanks,
  Stephanie@AnthonysWeb.com","Oh yea, I guess I should mention that this would be a mostly working from home gig.  Sometimes we may have you come into the office, but that's pretty rare."
