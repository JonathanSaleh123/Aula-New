"Hi, I’m a new freshman and recently admitted into both Berkeley and Michigan. I’m leaning towards Michigan right now, but am not sure. I have a couple questions :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1291xnm/hi_im_a_new_freshman_and_recently_admitted_into/,2023-04-01 16:00:52,"I’m planning on doing Psychology in my first 2 years then going into either Haas/Ross in my last 2 years. 

I’d be paying around 40K for Berkeley and around 55K for Michigan. The difference is small, but it is definitely still there.

1. Why did you choose Berkeley/Michigan? Are those reasons different from what makes you like being studying here today?

2. What other colleges did you apply to? What attracted you to them?

3. What’s something future students should know about the college? Like, anything in a bad way?

4. What’s the best thing that sets Berkeley apart from other high ranking colleges. What’s the worst thing that sets it apart?

5. How would you characterize the majority of students?

6. What are your favorite aspects of school spirit?

7. What is the campus like? Not in an aesthetics way, but is it fun and exciting? 

8. How much work do you usually have a day/week? I’m probably doing a psych undergrad and something in Haas/Ross for grad

9. What do you like to do for fun? Like, something specific, around campus maybe. 

11. What’s the most helpful advice you could give to someone going here, in a specific way related to Berkeley. Any other college in general?

12. Berkeley has an overpopulation problem and I want to know how that factors into student life. Is there a problem getting classes I’d want? Student housing? Etc 

P.S: please don’t sugarcoat anything, I wanna read a couple honest opinions and really see what it’s like.

THANK YOU!!!❤️","1. i chose berkeley because of the cost (given the price comparison you said, i would say that 15k is a large difference for sure) and also the resources here. i was honestly going in not too sure what i was going to do, and I'm so glad that i came here. given the fact that you're immediately exposed to this vast network of individuals who are not only welcoming but also readily willing to share their resources with you, it's quite reassuring to know that you'll end up okay because you know so many individuals who have gone through the same things you did. not sure what you mean by the second part of the question but everyone here is so diverse and brings a lot of cultural meaning to the work they do, and you definitely learn a lot from the people you interact with. 
2. i was picking between berkeley and washu st. louis as my top choices at the end of the day and honestly it was down to price and the development of the areas around it, given that i was wanting to go into industry right after graduation anyways. while i had gotten admitted to washu's program that would allow me to receive specific resources and get a nice job, i think i was just looking for something more affordable as well as in a location that would be best for me. (i am a pre-haas major so business definitely has more opportunities in the bay area because we have so many start-ups that are based here, that's not to say that just because you don't go to Berkeley you won't get any access to these companies as well). but overall i wasn't looking for something specific in a school because i knew i would thrive wherever, just down to the location + price
3. i think one thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of students here at Berkeley are from California (and a lot of those students are bay area kids) meaning that competition and working hard is kind of ingrained in them. obviously, people here are super supportive but everyone is always on the grindset. be prepared to look for internships from the get go and start thinking about your professional life (especially if you're applying to haas because it's a huge culture here with consulting clubs and everything). but i recommend that you try out looking for clubs to join (sproul tabling will let you know everything you need) as it really helped me figure out what exactly i wanted to do! also grade deflation is honestly not that big of a deal unless you are taking really hard technicals (which i doubt you will be given your major). it's just about learning to study for exams rather than doing homework because the vast majority of classes weigh exams a lottt more than you think it does. 
4. i think berkeley is definitely an all-rounder academically, you really can't find anything as nice as the quality of education being taught here. we have top ranked stem but also top ranked business and other humanities and overall we're just really ranked high in so many areas i will assure you the education you will get will not be subpar whatsoever. however, we do have a housing crisis meaning prices for rent are major expensive (be prepared to pay at least 1500 a month for rent if you move out of the dorms for your own room). also it definitely is not the safest in Berkeley (as you may know) but at the same time it's a lot of major cities and it's jus about learning to be aware of your surroundings and be street smart!
5. the majority of the students are definitely passionate and hardworking. I've honestly never met a group of individuals who are more passionate than the people here. we're super open to social topics (obviously because we protest literally on campus) and it's super inspiring to see all the future leaders learning with you in the same classroom and it just inspires you to do the same as well. i think we're all trying to make an impact in this world in some way, and that's why i am really happy to be here because I'm always so inspired when i talk with individuals on campus about their experiences, etc and it's really motivating as well.
6. honestly I'm not too into school spirit and i think umich def has it better for school spirit (i have been to one sports event in the entirety of my freshman year) but the rivalry game is definitely the most fun thing ever because that's when the spirit really comes through. but other than that it's alright most people are studying anyways LOL
7. the campus is always lively honestly esp in the beginning of the semester because on sproul clubs will be tabling and advertising and stuff and there's always people on campus everywhere. and MLK def hosts a lot of events as well so if you're interested in that they got free stuff being handed out all the time too. however, housing is entirely off-campus so campus itself is just buildings for classrooms and learning etc. but we occasionally get those performances on sproul so it's fire
8. i think for me just based on classes alone (i am public health + business) it really did not take that much of my time to get through work. obviously the more technicals you take (like CS classes) there will be more work because of the amount of projects and other stuff they have, but it's definitely manageable, because i also have other stuff that I'm doing at the same time (such as a club, internship work, etc.). plus i have time to hang with friends on a Friday or Saturday so it's really chill
9. for fun there's a lot you can do!! you can go to SF and explore there because it's an entirely new place that you can walk around and see (it's a bart ride away), there's often concerts in SF or oakland, even at the greek theater too or the UC theater downtown. there's also club events if you are in a club (my club hosts socials once in a while so it's fun to go out to those). obviously the frats throw and if you get a bid you can go to frat row and party it out. and there's so much to explore on telegraph (thrifting!) and downtown as well. 
10. most helpful advice is to be open-minded i would say, it's important to not limit yourself to a specific social bubble or mindset and always be willing to learn new things! it kind of comes with the fact that Berkeley has like 40k students for undergrad and grad so you'll always be meeting new people somehow. also it's important to establish a work-life balance as if you are trying to get into many activities it can be hard to see that, but once you got it down it's honestly manageable to live your life and be good with academics!
11. obviously classes it'll be hard to get it if your enrollment time is pretty bad, HOWEVER it's easy to get off waitlists for most classes because you can talk to the gsi or the prof. housing is going to be hard to get, even the good dorms as well because there's so much competition and it's a lottery at the end of the day. most people go off-campus (not affiliated with the uni) after first year because it's honestly a scam (I'm paying 2.5k a month for a triple in a small ass room FYI) and you can find MUCH better options off-campus. another thing is advising. i didn't really talk to an advisor at all to plan out my college career i kind of did everything myself and figured it out myself, you kind of have to be self-sufficient in this way because our advising (esp in L&S) is ass. however the upside to the large student pop is that you have sm upperclassmen who can help you!

ya that's all i have to say, hope this helps you make your decision!!
No guarantee you’re gonna make it into haas, but that’s what good abt Berkeley, u can switch to any other field and you’re still getting a world class degree. 15k x 4 = $60k for going to Michigan, u say ur family is well off enough for that so u can choose whatever but $60k will take u very far.. I would personally just say Berkeley, live the good bay life and at the same time have a LOT of flexibility in your future career options. But it’s ur choice eod
1. I was accepted to Berkeley and waitlisted at Michigan with both being in my top 5, but I declined the waitlist. Biggest reason was having visited UIUC, which is south of UMich, and my face literally peeling due to how cold it was during a 2 day visit. Meanwhile, when I visited Berkeley, it was super sunny and great and beautiful and there was a ton of nature around. Other reasons included Berkeley being better for my major, not liking sports, and wanting a very progressive student body. Also we have better squirrels

1 1. Classes are a lottery especially for high demand gen eds. Housing is fine but pricy, but you shouldn’t have trouble finding somewhere nice off campus for significantly better value than the dorms.
Ok as someone who has lived in Michigan for 13 years if your mood or motivation is affected by weather (and I mean like seasonal depression ) don’t go to Michigan lmao especially if you grew up in California/ SoCal. But maybe that’s just a me issue 😅😅. Also Berkeley is tied #1 for psychology so I would definitely recommend Berkeley especially if there is a chance you won’t be able to get into a business admin program.
Props to you for being diligent. I was not. However, I’m really happy at Berkeley. Classes are tough, students are active and interesting, and there’s much to do in the Bay. I’m sure Michigan can say the first two things (Berkeley is still better there) but it certainly lacks the third (why would you willingly choose Ann Arbor over the beautiful bay). Ok, I am overselling. 

In all seriousness, Berkeley is a great place if you love learning and want to see more of the world—it’s so unique. Come here and choose to experience it all.
Did you get into Ross already or are you trying to transfer to it?
11. Getting classes you want depends on your enrollment time. You get assigned a random time on Enrollment Day 1 or Enrollment Day 2, so the earlier the time, the more likely you are to get your classes. For very large lower div's you generally don't have to worry about being enrolled in them. Most of the smaller classes I have to take are all requirements such as Reading & Comprehension, L&S Breadths where there are many classes that can fulfill the same requirement. It's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you have backup courses in case you can't get your first choice. I haven't had problems getting courses I want, but know some people who have. This experience may be different with different majors.

Also quite note - idk how UMich enrollment works, but some smaller colleges also have problems with enrollment; there's less students, but there's less seats available. Smaller school doesn't have to equal less trouble enrolling.

&#x200B;

For housing, Cal Housing is guaranteed your first year but that's it. Most people find off-campus apartments their second year and beyond, some look as early as November/December/January. You can still apply for university housing but you're more likely to not receive an offer than to receive an offer after your first year, so it's better to just look for other options. Rent may get a bit expensive, depending on what's available when you start looking.
6. THE BIG GAME THE BIG GAME THE BIG GAME :D
I selected preferred admission and have a pretty good chance of getting into Ross
(admittedly we don't have the most school spirit but especially during the Big Game and if we're winning, you can feel it)
If you care a lot about getting an undergraduate business degree, go to Michigan. If you're fine with alternative majors in the event you don't get into Haas (such as Psych by itself or an Econ/Psych double major), go to Berkeley."
What are you doing this afternoon? Stop by Dwinelle and take our money. Undergrad Research Fair starts at 4 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3n5pk9/what_are_you_doing_this_afternoon_stop_by/,2015-10-01 15:22:43,"Hey everyone, [Elliott from Canadian Studies here](http://imgur.com/Zum030r). I want to give a plug to today's [Undergrad Research Fair](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1085471868143246&id=164508060239636) which kicks off at 4 PM in Dwinelle. We're going to be there with information about the [Ross Prize](http://imgur.com/dZRoVP2) in Canadian Studies and the [Undergraduate Merit Scholarship](http://imgur.com/TdxqWBA) from the Institute of International Studies (IIS). 


There will be a ton of other departments there offering scholarships. So I hope you'll visit them too, but mostly we want you to stop by the IIS and Canadian Studies table and take our money.   ","[deleted]
May I research about [this phenomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spclNLYVblk)?
Thanks to everyone who came to the event yesterday. We had a few questions we answered in person that I want to clarify on here as well. 

For the IIS [Undergraduate Merit Scholarship](http://iis.berkeley.edu/funding-opportunities/undergraduate-merit-scholarship) you do NOT have to be an international studies major, or minor. The scholarship funds international research in any discipline. Last year, one of our standout scholars who received the funding was a chemistry major studying water pollution in SE Asia. You could be an EECS major looking at technology development in India, a biology major studying a species of fish from Africa or an English major writing about literature in Australia. Anything international, from any discipline is eligible. 


Same goes for the [Ross Prize in Canadian Studies.](http://canada.berkeley.edu/rita-ross-undergraduate-prize) You don't have to be taking a class on Canada. You can write a paper on Canadian disability law in a disability studies class. You could be writing about [paleo-style diets among the Inuit people](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/09/17/what-the-inuit-can-tell-us-about-omega-3-fats-and-paleo-diets/) in a biology class. Really any project, in any class, that touches on a Canadian case study or has a Canadian connection is eligible. 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Have a great weekend, and GO BEARS.
The [IIS Undergraduate Merit Scholarship](http://iis.berkeley.edu/funding-opportunities/undergraduate-merit-scholarship) pays up to $2,000, with an extra $1,000 awarded to the best project completed by all of the scholarship winners. So up to a **$3,000 scholarship.** 


[The Canadian Studies Ross Prize](http://canada.berkeley.edu/rita-ross-undergraduate-prize) pays **$250 cash.** You can use that for tuition if you want. Or you can use it to buy poutine. Or hire a creepy clown to follow your friends around all day. Or make it rain singles from the Campanile. Whatever you want. It's your money if you win. 
Have at it! Although you might have a more fruitful inquiry researching [this phenomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8haHgfq2x4) "
Poli Sci 179 Study Guide for those interested,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1rinp5/poli_sci_179_study_guide_for_those_interested/,2013-11-26 12:08:45,"Hi, would anyone be interested in a study guide for Poli Sci 179? If so, I could compile my notes for everyone, but I'd like to listen to the podcasts again and can't get them to work. Has anyone had any luck with them? I missed the first two lectures, so I just need the notes for them, and I can post notes of all of it together. 

Edit: There's like 700 people in this class from lots of different majors, so please don't downvote it. Just trying to be helpful. 

Edit #2: Waiting for user versaill24 to send me their notes from speakers 1+2, then will put a study guide up either tomorrow night or Friday morning.

Update: Got the notes for the first two speakers, and I will try to have a guide up tonight. Happy Holidays

It's all very general things that are easy to pull from the lectures, I spent way too much time studying for it last semester and I finished the exam in about 20 minutes no sweat. Y'all will be fine. 
Hey guys, don't stress about the final too much. It's pretty simple as long as you paid attention and reading over your notes once or twice. 

Tl;dr study guide is a good idea, but stressing isn't. 
I would be interested!
I would be very, very interested! 
Has anyone gotten the podcasts on itunes to work? I missed the first few lectures because I added in late, and I can't seem to get them to run on my computer.
I would be VERY interested!
yup!
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cWgMyXHvwq770QV6WFepzFGc7V2vZumPwyZDWJvrNNc/edit
Does anyone know what the questions will look like? I know it's multiple choice, but are the questions concerned with their main points/ideology? Or more simply just attaching a name to their previous organizations/experiences? 
Is the final next week or during RRR week? I've heard conflicting reports.
Very interested in this as well, if you're willing to share it'd be much appreciated! 
Interested, thanks for doing this!!



interested as well
I am the DSP notetaker for Poli Sci 179. Alan and I are meeting soon to go over the notes to make sure that they are thorough and focused on relevant material (and I think he'll hint at specific material on the final). They're supposed to be for the DSP students, but I'm willing to sell copies for $35, which we can do via paypal. 

If you're concerned about academic dishonesty, don't be. I've looked at the Code of Student Conduct closely, and it doesn't fall in any of the categories. You and your friend can trade notes before an exam, and that's obviously not a violation (and is even encouraged). Exchanging notes for money definitely seems shady, but it's not a violation. 

So anyway, if you want to study effectively and pass 179, while also making time to study for your other classes, send me a PM and I'll we can coordinate something. 
Yeah, I'm not too worried about it. I know a lot of people missed/didn't go to lectures, so this may help them. Also, Reich didn't show this semester, so that knocks out a huge chunk of easy answers/familiarity.
Or, even better, if someone can give me their notes for the first two speakers, I will type up bulleted points of all the rest. I watched what Ross wrote down during lectures, so I have a pretty good idea of stuff that could be on the test
yeah, they work.  you need to download them and then play them though.
The final is next week! Professor Ross mentioned it in class last lecture.


Really dude? This is going to be the easiest exam I have ever taken. I just wanted to help people out who may have missed a lecture or two like myself (I missed the first two), or others who don't like taking notes while listening to the speakers. Either help out with this, or get the fuck out
Yeah I can get you notes for the first two speakers.
Ok, cool. Could you PM them to me when you get a chance? Follow this post guys and I will make a write up of all the speakers for everyone as soon as tomorrow morning
Yeah I can PM them to you tomorrow morning. I'm heading home tonight.
Thanks, no rush"
