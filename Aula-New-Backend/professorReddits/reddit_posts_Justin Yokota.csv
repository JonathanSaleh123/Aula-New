Justin Yokota Hates People,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1css6pp/justin_yokota_hates_people/,2024-05-15 11:35:02,Why does bro think were all Robots who can think in code? Is he a Robot?,"Rather than plain hate, I genuinely think he only focuses on one upping the +2 SD kids of the class, almost a feeling like he‚Äôs back in his college era and competing with these kids. 

He designs exams only with these people in mind, and the average and below average student who‚Äôs just trying to pass is caught in the crosshairs instead. Because no matter how hard the exam is, the ppl who get 100% will get 100%, and the ppl trying to get the avg will get a 50% and barely pass the class
Bro failed the 61c test
You're just salty that you didn't do well bro. Instead of blaming the teacher try taking accountability for why you didn't do well. Sometimes it's not your day, maybe you had something else going on in your life etc. These are all valid reasons for not doing well in the class, it's not that deep. But you're being a wuss by just blaming his exam writing. If you would have put the work in you would have done well in the class. Don't be a sissy and blame everyone else but you
I don‚Äôt understand all the hate he gets, I felt like the exams were easier and less aimed towards tricking you than 61A and were all very fair esp with the curve
I feel like it can't be that hard to treat our lecturers like people. If you have issues with exam structure, it's very reasonable to complain about an exam and discuss questions you think are unfair. And you can definitely bring it up in course evals, or even email staff and let them know. But I think making totalizing statements about other human beings like this is very unkind--and these Reddit hate threads don't really accomplish anything.
Hot take, I think Yokota‚Äôs exams are pretty fair and well set, at least from how I remembered them when I took stuff under him (I went through the whole 61 series with him). He has a pretty uncanny ability to achieve a good curve (in my 61b midterm 2 of spring 23, the curve was almost perfect, a statistician‚Äôs dream). Whether that‚Äôs a good thing or not is up to you, but fwiw he has a policy of curving the mean of an exam up to 65% if its below 65, and doesn‚Äôt do anything if it‚Äôs above 65. 

He does set ‚Äútrickier‚Äù and ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù exams compared to past semesters of the same class, but his papers only tend to have that one or two difficult questions that really challenges your conceptual understanding and problem solving. And it shouldn‚Äôt be regarded as a bad thing that his questions are of a different style from the past. If the point of CS is to apply your knowledge towards solving a problem, it shouldn‚Äôt matter if a question is similar to what you‚Äôve seen in the past or not.
Oh Jesus it gets worse?!? üò≠ istg im transferring omfg I can‚Äôt do this
yeah you know justin yokota as a person real well. how about you go talk to him and try to understand him better than you do now?
tbh yeah fuck yokota go peyrin
I don‚Äôt like Yokota but Peyrin is the goat no matter what
average covid intelligence¬†
[deleted]
Job can blame God but doesn't until he curses him to fate
Typical EECS Incel
Also him and Kao were math double majors I believe so there's obviously a bias on how they frame the class and the type of problems they create.
Dude 61b was so bad Iv never felt worse ab a class at Berkeley. He had us proving shit üò≠
What does SD stand for
I dont even want to know what that was like
My dude im a senior and have taken 6 tech classes. Iv done pretty ‚Äúok‚Äù in all of em averaging a B. I know how to judge a class at this point. Not Doing well is not the point im making, Im saying his exams are very un reasonable for an intro sata structures course.
Bro u have to come down to the level of normal people
I feel like a lot of people would have brought it up in course evals but everytime it seems like he just makes it harder
Do not take 61b this semester or any semester where you see Justin Yokota. Thats my advice. He is insane.
61B with Yokota was easier than 61A with Denero. The curve is really nice as well. Don't sweat it, people will always exaggerate.
I have showed no interest in anything i had to say.
Written by Justin Yokota
incel is when struggling academically
nah peyrin the goat, exams are fair with him and he is very accomodating
wait peyrin's not a math major
> proving shit

This here should be the job of CS 70 and 170.
I also didn‚Äôt really see any past exams that had a 15 points problem dedicated to designing an algorithm that we didn‚Äôt learn in class. Isn‚Äôt this supposed to be a CS70/CS170 type of problem, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. This final had a few weird questions and the average was around 50% which is pretty bad for a cs final imo. Ik they curve the exam so the average is 65%, but id rather work hard and be able to score 65% with my own effort than score a 54% and get curved to 65%. It‚Äôll make me feel better about myself and give me more confidence.
proving what
that was genuinely the worst question i‚Äôve seen, that was the first time i was completely lost on an exam. This guy pulled out so many new question types for this it was crazy.
Ong, his tests are pretty fair. Don't know what you're on about.
Wasn't too bad, 61/100 mean
How is it unreasonable exactly? Yeah sure it requires a lot of effort to get a good raw score but each exam is curved up to a 65% average, and he never curves it down. If people unanimously find the exam hard then the curve reflects this and your grade gets bumped up. Grades aside, his exams don't ask anything out of syllabus - all they do is force you to think about the problem in an abstract way. People complain about this but I think it's an important skill for anyone who wants to work in a field that requires problem-solving.
Normal people don‚Äôt study CS at Berkeley
I'm sure he's working on it. but either way do u genuinely think that his exams are hard justifies public hate threads where we talk about how he wants to one-up college students and ""hates people""?
i think he‚Äôs gonna teach it every sem, he said he really likes it
Fr, these posts have me confused because I found the 61A exams to be way more tricky than 61B but with no curve and razor thin margins for an A
actually, the exams this semester were pretty reasonable as well. Plus they curve everything to a 65% mean what more do you want
What are you smoking ? I need some crazy shit like that to get me thinking whatever ur on
bro ur just salty that you suck. maybe you should have actually studied for the class. there's no point giving a man hate when he literally curves the exams
Idk I‚Äôve never had an exam done by him, but I think the way 61b is taught greatly benefits people who have been exposed to advanced math and that type of problem solving before. It would be more fair to have a more theoretical approach to the class if you are going to have those types of problems, instead of making it look like a more hands on engineering class. Obviously this only applies to the exams, but yeah there seems to be a gap between what they expect you to know and the way things are taught to you in class. Tbf I think this is also a problem in other cs/ds classes I‚Äôve taken. 

In my humble opinion, I would have the lectures and assignments be more theoretical and keep the projects and labs for the hands on experience.
Thank you for clearing it up‚Ä¶ there has to be a bin shift considering the fact 50% of the exam was absolutely heinous
Something about order of growth of a type of sorting algorithm that was only taught to us on the exam itself. But honestly I don‚Äôt think the problem was quite as unreasonable as it sounds, definitely solvable. Pseudocode problem was kind of annoying though‚Ä¶
For real, the tests are very reasonable imo
I don‚Äôt think hate is ever really justified, but that man has made me question whether I‚Äôm in the right major and I will be actively trying to avoid classes he‚Äôs teaching. I think moreso than bad exams, he doesn‚Äôt teach at the same level. 

Take De Nero for example, he writes insanely hard exams but I don‚Äôt think anyone complains about his exams because he teaches to the level of the exams. However with Yokota he doesn‚Äôt teach to that level and most of the exam questions feel like they don‚Äôt make any sense
Yea
Good luck soldiers
Pls tell me this doesn‚Äôt include summer sessions im already behind I don‚Äôt need a psycho professor making it worse üò≠
To get an A in 61A iteration that I took, you needed 290/300. To get an A in 61B, you need 914/1000 and 61B exams are curved. Far less effort and precision needed for the A.
‚ÄúTheres obviously a bias on how they frame the class‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúidk I‚Äôve never had an exam done by him‚Äù haha
That does sound reasonable
idk how summers work tbh, good luck tho i read that he still writes exams for stuff he‚Äôs not teaching
Summer sessions is usually taught by past GSIs
i agree
I was saying I haven‚Äôt had an exam written by Peyrin, but I‚Äôve done exams written by Yokota."
Justin Yokota exams,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1aocau3/justin_yokota_exams/,2024-02-11 08:45:12,anyone have any idea about Jutsins exams? What to expect in terms of a curve,"There is always one glaringly tough question with a title along the lines of Greek mythology and symbols, such as ‚ÄúLambda, Hippolytus,etc.‚Äù Save this problem for last and expect everyone on Ed to be clowning on its difficulty after the exam.
Exams are denominator shifted until 65% mean.
He technically doesn't curve. His policy for 61BC is that the average for exams has to be 65% or higher, else he adjusts the denominator until the average is 65%. His exams aren't too bad imo, and he's taught long enough that there's plenty of practice exams now"
why is justin Yokota teaching 61b?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12qc1nb/why_is_justin_yokota_teaching_61b/,2023-04-17 22:33:36,in fall 2023,"Hug will be on sabbatical and Hilfinger is retired. Additionally, since Hilfinger retired there has been a need for another person to start teaching the class.
he‚Äôs a cool a dude, but god when he writes exams he‚Äôs a bitch
Isn‚Äôt he pretty good tho ? I‚Äôve not taken anything with him but tbh I prefer the young ones like Peyrin and Michael Ball etc ‚Äî they have a refreshing vibe
Why not?
Because berkeley has driven away every real lecturer and professor.
Did hug give a reason for sabbatical? Just curious if he has plans that he's talked about
will this be a good thing or a bad thing?
Just found this out the hard way
""the young ones""
Clearly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the content, but he is inexperienced as a teacher and lacks a flair that Denero or Hug both have. That being said, he is quite capable and it should be interesting to see how it turns out.
from how he lectures 61C i‚Äôd say he‚Äôs good
I don‚Äôt think he was able to teach very well in the few lectures he has given so far
Damn why so many downvotes. Fox literally was driven away by Berkeley‚Äôs shitty treatment
I heard he was going to the Netherlands for some period of time? Maybe
61b‚Äôs infra and resources have largely been flushed out so imo it boils down to a pretty subjective answer - if you like justin‚Äôs lecturing style it‚Äôll be a plus for you, if you don‚Äôt, then there are tons of hug‚Äôs vids for you to consume
Give it some time for some of these younger and newer instructors. I had Ranade the first time she taught 16A and she wasn‚Äôt all that great, but heard that she‚Äôs excellent now.
nah bro def got that brazilian flair
Yep. Same with a few others including weaver. Weaver was so good.
Going to take in that sweet, sweet, lack of automotive noise, pollution, and risk of being hit by a car every 5 seconds while going for a stroll.
ooh same and I wonder how she is now.

she pretty good imo
Happy to hear. Cool to see the growth of a professor in real time."

CS61B With Hug or Justin Yokota,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17kfouk/cs61b_with_hug_or_justin_yokota/,2023-10-31 00:45:45,"Hey, so I'm a freshman (CS major) interested in taking CS61B in the spring next semester, but I found out my only option would be Yokota. I've heard some pretty bad things about him, like how his exams are insanely difficult and that he isn't the best at lecturing. 

&#x200B;

I am thinking to just not take it this semester and wait till Hug finishes his sabbatical. Will he be done with that by Fall 2024? Or should I just take Yokota?","People used to have this debate about Prof Hilfinger as well, and in the end, it probably doesn‚Äôt matter that much.  Realistically, most people don‚Äôt go to lecture and many wind up watch Prof Hug videos anyhow.  I know very little about Justin, but my feeling is that you shouldn‚Äôt delay things on account of a prof, especially on a class that is a prereq to a lot of other classes and in this case internships and other activities since it‚Äôs such a core class.  The little ‚Äúnegative‚Äù that I‚Äôve heard is more on difficultly of exams, which shouldn‚Äôt be an issue especially since there‚Äôs no more 3.3+ gauntlet to worry about, assuming you‚Äôre a freshman.
tldr: just take it when you can, don't worry abt who is teaching

in the class right now. there are a lot of alternatives to listening to yokota lecture live, such as watching hug's videos online. even in class, i've rarely seen yokota lecture, most of the time, peyrin is lecturing, and yokota answers questions in the zoom chat. from what i have heard, everyone generally agrees he is the stronger lecturer. the downside is that is may seem weird that the person writing the exam is a different person then the person lecturing, but it also seems that yokota isn't the sole writer. 

in regards to exams, yes they are hard and pretty demoralizing to go through if you get stuck. however, the course has a little curve (they don't call it that but that's what it is) where they make sure averages are at or above 65%, and so far, averages have been well below 65%. just for reference, ive seen a person in ed complain that because of the ""adjustments"", too many got curved up to full score, so take what you think about that.
Thanks for the insight -- good point! I forgot that we don't have to worry about the 3.3 GPA and it was really holding me back. I think I'll take the class!
Thanks for the insight! I didn't know there were curves, so hopefully the tests won't make me fail the class.  And hopefully peyrin continues lecturing next semester then!"

Almost everything along those lines is just a joke, and imo he gets a lot of flack for stuff that is really isn't warranted. Last year, he always co-taught classes with other professors and works with TAs regarding exams/academic dishonesty. He's mainly a scapegoat for any gripes students have with those classes because he's known for handling more backend stuff.
Thanks for the reply. Jokes aside, he has achieved a lot in a short period of time, I respect and admire that. Maybe If I took his class, I'd be singing a different tune. Anyroad, it seemed all in good fun. They took an exceptional person and gave him a super power called extreme eccentricity, then turned everything up to one-hundred.
Wow, while the fiction is funny, the reality isn't. I'm sorry to hear that he is being treated in such a disrespectful manner. What you have told me makes me root for him even more.

First off, I am always really nervous on tests and tend to look around. And second off, I studied really intensely for this exam (rewatched all lectures, redid all worksheets, learned solutions to literally every final from the last 5 years) so to be accused of cheating is quite an insult.

When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Failed both midterms and got a B. I recommend just keep pushing through and focus on your major weaknesses. Make sure to do all the surveys and assignments. Try your best to go to all the OH and Labs.

How difficult is it to pass CS 61B if I take it Pass/No Pass (as a non CS or Data Science major),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/195j9vw/how_difficult_is_it_to_pass_cs_61b_if_i_take_it/,2024-01-13 00:17:18,I'm an MCB major and took Data 8 and Data C88C (can be taken instead of CS61A) for fun/to add skills to my resume.

if you got an A in those classes you‚Äôd be fine. ngl you could probably be a CS or DS major lmao. last semester i was an AI and i‚Äôd like to say that they changed the grading system in fa2023. typically if you completed all the work you‚Äôd be guaranteed a C- , but this time around they changed it so that even if you finished the work you‚Äôd be at a D (500pts) where you needed a 609 to pass. take that info whatever way you‚Äôd like.

JUST to pass is piss easy as long as you aren‚Äôt scoring 10-15%< on exams. 

tldr: you‚Äôll be fine
Out of the CS classes I have taken, 61B was by far the easiest, especially in terms of grades. Passing should be pretty easy
You‚Äôd have to do extremely extremely bad to not pass. Given that you got an A in Data 8 I think you‚Äôre good. Even with no prior experience youd probably be good

It depends on your situation, what your major in, what class are you, and what you are shooting for for a grade. In general, when these types of posts are done, you have to give full disclosure.
20 units is a lot but besides that u should be good. Just stay on top of the course work.
(lol i would personally drop physics cuz Ronnie sucks ass and the course staff is wack too) 

Lisa Yan is the best professor i have ever had so it might be worth it to take 61c just for that (imo better than Dan). and if you don‚Äôt need to declare then i would drop 70 (cuz of workload) and/or do what i first said (cuz of personal opinions lol)

New Course: CS61,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10oeogm/new_course_cs61/,2023-01-29 10:30:41,"New course suggestion:

Course Code: CS61

This course would have the contents of 61A, 61B, 61C and 70 combined, with four midterms, one for 61A, B, C and 70. The final exam would be comprehensive.

Alongside Python, Java and C, students also get the opportunity to explore other languages such as R, Scheme, SQL, JavaScript, CSS and html. 

There will be eight projects, with project 0 (or mini exercise) as gitlet.

There will be daily small ‚Äúquizzes‚Äù with leetcode hard level questions as a small exercise.

The highest quiz score, and two highest lab and homework score will be dropped when computing the final grade. 

Is this course a good idea? What should the name of the course be?","Sounds like a chill class, mainly for programming noobs.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Architecture Data Structures Programming & Discrete Mathematics & Knuckles
What have you been smoking recently? Whatever it is, it seems to have very high quality.
There should be just one course called ‚ÄúEECS‚Äù.
I think the only suggestion I'd make is to split it up kind of like EECS151 but into 4 semesters so students would rotate from 61A to 61B,etc.
Add in **1**61, **1**62, **1**64, **1**68, and **1**69 and you got yourself a proper course.
I mean if DeNero teaches it then sure, why not, sounds reasonable
what could go wrong
""leetcode hard level questions as a small exercise.""
Computer Science speedrun any%
Fax. And we should also have EECS16, which combines all the content from 16A and 16B into one, since they don‚Äôt really cover that much on their own anyways. I‚Äôm thinking we do 3 hr lectures followed by a 2 hr discussion, to really absorb the information. We can also do a 2 hr lab to get some hands-on experience with circuits, but to make things go smoother, i‚Äôm thinking we just make it one big Gradescope assignment. 4 hours can be dedicated for homework and whatnot, and a 30 minute group therapy session at the end to wrap it all up, for a total of 11.5 hours daily. I think this would be a very worthwhile course, so we could even try bringing it back as a requirement for the l&s folks as well!
This course would be for people who can get a job and are just doing university because they need the paper due to not having any luck applying to some their senior year of high school.

But I can‚Äôt see 70 or C being apart of the course because most people aren‚Äôt going into that content without being forced to through classes. Even out of the ‚Äúbeen programming since I was in the womb‚Äù kids. This is my opinion of course.

The only logical combination would be 61A and 61B, but they already have ways of letting more experienced students do the course on their own quickly if I‚Äôm not mistaken.

Theory: Lower Div CS classes are getting harder because of past exams,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1awvo5l/theory_lower_div_cs_classes_are_getting_harder/,2024-02-21 18:58:51,"Based on convos with friends, the new 61B midterm seemed a LOT harder than it was when I took it, and it was apparently way harder than past exams.

My theory is that because more practice exams become available each year, and the common advice is to just practice on past exams, the curve gets harder and harder because students are able to prepare better.

Thoughts?"," I've more often witnessed people say it was much harder when in reality it was about on par.
Hilfinger 61B was lowkey a free A/A+. Yokota probably makes it harder, and his exams  tend to be more difficult in my experience (I got cooked by the 61C final a year ago lol)
Nah it might be the person writing it üòâ. But I guess since most people don‚Äôt need a 3.3 anymore to declare they don‚Äôt have to balance the exams
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true at all. No one really does all the midterms except maybe the latest 5. Even then, most ppl do like 2-3. That‚Äôs not even counting the crammers who don‚Äôt do any. By that logic the class should be getting more difficult each year which it doesn‚Äôt. What‚Äôs more likely to have a statistical effect is the prof which has recently changed.
My theory is yokota writes hard exams
The main problem of this 61B exam is HOF. It is an interesting brain teaser but really requires more than what is done in class about programming in general. Yes everything about that problem is technically covered by the course material, but I would not call it a fair question to give. They are clearly trying to cut the curve down with that particular question which I don't believe existed in previous exams, though I do believe that the rest of the questions have their counterparts in the past two semester exams (SP23 and FA23), since these are the two semesters that Yokota starts writing questions. 

[got yokota'd](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16p17go/i_lost_my_virginity_cs61b/)
It seemed about the same as the past midterms that I practiced on.
Its been like that since forever. Exams are converging towards IQ tests, which is not bad for people like me because I didn't have to put in much work to get good grades back in the day.

Long term, I think this problem would fix itself in 2-3 years where class size would be *much* smaller.
I think a lot of classes have to get harder because people cheat.¬†
> Hilfinger 61B was lowkey a free A/A+

If true, he's come a loooong way.
Agreed, wasn‚Äôt good with CS my freshman year (studied REALLY HARD, ignoring every other class for dead week, and only got a B for 61A) then got a A with Hilfinger because I was able to sit down and really grind the projects out and get the extra credits.
lol true the Justin effect is real as well
man had hard-ass projects but you could slog through them, and he was pretty fair with his exams so as long as you had enough time for the class you could bag the A. That said its probably a good thing for him that he dipped right before the ChatGPT era. spending every single night for 2 weeks as a baby CS major trying to understand Enigma is legit one of my favorite memories here.

Sounds selfish now actually. Thank you for making it worse
I could say the same about striking TAs who are not looking out for their students. The point is everyone is free to do as they please and coming after people for literally doing their job is counter-productive. 

Also if your definition of ""selfish"" is spending 54 hours grading students' final exams, you have had the privilege of meeting some really awesome people I'm quite envious.
Bro you‚Äôre literally talking about someone who selfishly decided to grade stuff most people didn‚Äôt want graded bc of the strike.

"Background on the strike, why I'm on strike, and why you should be too",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yy57d9/background_on_the_strike_why_im_on_strike_and_why/,2022-11-17 15:38:00,"Hi folks! I'm Liam, a member of CS 170 course staff.

We are currently in the midst of the largest academic strike in US History ‚Äì as many of you have likely heard by now, over 48,000 academic workers are currently on strike. As of today, bargaining teams from all four academic bargaining units are attempting to negotiate with the University, and this small window of time will prove to be a crucial moment that must be capitalized on. The contract we decide on will govern us for years to come.

**Why you should strike/picket/support your staff:**

Students:

We are fighting for funding, specifically a more livable compensation for our teachers and a dedicated increase in EECS staffing from the UC. This will lead to a better learning experience for you as students, giving you advantages such as:

\- shorter OH queues

\- more small group tutoring

\- with more staff, you will be able to get into the classes you want to take

In addition to this, the students who are most vulnerable are those who were not privileged enough to receive extra academic preparation beforehand; students with less experience often have a difficult time in computer science, especially here at Berkeley, and it frequently results in them being turned away from it. This manifests itself in the following ways:

\- students are expected to do exceptionally well in our massively sized and difficult lower divs, yet are left to drown, lacking adequate course support

\- if students cannot pass the GPA requirement, they cannot even enroll in CS classes

\- non-majors, e.g. CS-cluster applied math majors, are not allowed to enroll in CS upper-divs period

\- the poor compensation and long hours make the (u)GSI position much less attractive to those who have to pay for school themselves(they could engage in private tutoring instead, or some other job that pays market rate), reducing the diversity in course staff and limiting access to these important jobs(which can be a stepping stone for an academic career) for underrepresented students

It is not hard to see that it is those students who are the least groomed-beforehand for CS (i.e. underprivileged students, the backbone of our diversity) that end up suffering the most; *if the University of California wants to continue to lay claim to its storied diversity, it must deal with the fact that it can only do so by diverting funding to the aspects of the school that actually serve to constitute and nurture this diversity.*

**Background on the strike for EECS:**

EECS has the largest population of academic workers on campus. Teaching quality has suffered. The way we've adapted is by resorting to more ""scalable"" options that aren't very productive for your learning, or for our assessment of your learning. We have created mass auto-graders to check your code instead of having a TA present to help you go line-by-line; the latter is how it should be, especially at the greatest public university in the country. We've resorted to multiple choice and short answer questions, discouraging creativity and stripping away from students the ability to explain why they chose what they chose ‚Äì  we've increasingly taken away the human aspect of teaching, the aspect of teaching that leaves permanent, endlessly inspirational impressions on students. Personalized feedback and guided assistance is the most effective way to learn. Without this, we might as well all go on coursera to learn from Andrew Ng and search up practice problems on our own and grade them on our own ‚Äì keep in mind how much you‚Äôre paying to be here. Is it so much to ask that courses be adequately staffed, in a non-exploitative manner? Because we cannot afford to hire more TAs, the quality of teaching in our department has really suffered. I‚Äôm sure many of you can attest to this.

In addition, lower division courses often have to rely on unpaid labor to adequately support students. Since they don't have enough money to hire more tutors and TAs, they often will rely on Academic Intern labor just to serve the course. I was both an AI and a volunteer for computer science mentors; Computer Science Mentors (CSM), a volunteering club, is also heavily sought after for assistance in the lower divisions. *To put it bluntly, the University of California is relying on unpaid volunteers in order to provide only the most basic academic infrastructure for their students*. It would be hard to call this anything but abhorrent and exploitative, and it has the stark consequence that the more vulnerable students who cannot afford to provide unpaid labor cannot get the experience they need in order to be competitive for a paid position; again, we claim to be committed to diversity here.

**Why I'm on strike:**

This is my 4th time on course staff.

OH queues are ridiculous. For example, the course I'm currently serving has 2-3 people staffing an office hours that regularly draws 30+ students, each of whom is different and deserves their own individualized assistance. This is all that we can afford. The homework in my class is hard, and more likely than not, each person needs a lot more time than the mere 10 minutes we allot to each student to understand the material. But there are more people in the queue, and unfortunately we just have to move on to the next person before adequate assistance can be given.

Here‚Äôs some simple math: in each block of one hour, each staff member can talk to 6 students on average. Since we have 2-3 staff, that means 12-18 students get help in an hour. There are 30 students and people are continually coming into OH for help. We simply cannot reach everyone in a timely manner. *I have friends that are discouraged from coming into office hours due to what is regularly a 2-3 hour long queue.*

I was a student in an upper division EECS class last year. I was at office hours once with 20+ students. There was one TA, who was there for one hour. Nonetheless, when that TA left, most of us were left no better off than we were before OH started. There were simply not enough people to staff that OH.

What would we do with more money? Staff OH properly. Hire more tutors for group tutoring! My course (CS 170) is difficult and people would benefit massively from small group tutoring, such that we can go through the algorithms and strategies together, and provide personalized feedback. We could afford to hire more people to read through your code and suggest best practices ‚Äì who doesn‚Äôt want this? We could get rid of the rubrics for design docs that make it hard for you to really learn. We could make exams that actually test your knowledge, in a manner that‚Äôs far more equitable and far more thought-provoking than a small fill-in box, or bubble-in circle.

The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring. This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. *This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.*

**There's another, arguably more important side to it:**

GSIs, ASEs, and lecturers are heavily overworked and underpaid. Due to a lack of staff, we often have to take up extra work ‚Äì we have to choose between our students and our own personal well-being. I've been forced to choose between a break in between my discussion and my office hours after a long day of work, or helping my students. This is tortuous because every single one of us feels a genuine, human obligation to our students. There are so many great things about teaching, and the university expects us to quietly bear the unnecessary hardships (overwork, underpay) just so we can do what we love. We as an academic community deserve to work with dignity ‚Äì we should not be told to keep our heads down and suck it up. It is a job.

Lecturers often have to cover for the lack of funding and it hurts them immensely, not to mention the fact that it just isn‚Äôt fair. For GSIs in particular: GSIs are rent-burdened, overworked, and especially underpaid. They are people like anybody else, and should not have to be living paycheck to paycheck, if they‚Äôre even managing that. They deserve a living wage, especially here in the bay where everything is just unthinkably expensive.

**What you as a student can do:**

\- Show support for your staff on Ed. Tell them you support them. Heart their strike posts on Ed, it means a lot

\- Make a post on Ed encouraging TAs who are on strike to keep striking, ans TAs who aren‚Äôt on strike yet to start striking

\- Show up to the picket line. Visibility is super important in a strike.

\- [Sign the community support petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/uaw-undergraduate-letter-of-support?source=direct_link&).

\- Tell your friends who are indifferent about the strike why they should support the strike, and engage in proactive dialogues wrt the strike among your acquaintances.

**For those of you that feel that you have a duty to your students:**

Students are currently suffering, have been suffering, and will continue to face the consequences of understaffed courses until something changes. My heart sinks when I hear that my students are discouraged from coming into office hours because of 3-hour queues; I know, we all know that students greatly need more individualized support. Without any change, we will not be able to provide that which we know our students need. They deserve a better education than they are currently being provided, and in my opinion, fulfilling your duty to them means going on strike and picketing until UC can meet our demands. Only then will we be able to serve our students in the manner in which they should be served, as students at the #1 public university in the country.

**GSIs who are still going into work:**

\- You are likely overworked and underpaid.

\- There is little job security. For some PhD students, every semester is a new struggle to find funding, since not every PI has enough GSR funds, and GSI appointments are semester-by-semester

\- The quality of the education here will skyrocket with more funding. We will not have to resort to autograders and multiple choice questions ‚Äì this means a more fulfilling, and more importantly less soulless, teaching experience.

EECS especially has had to deal with the brunt of the UC's unfair labor practices. Classes are universally understaffed, students cannot enroll in classes that they want or even need to take, lecturers and TAs are heavily overworked, and there is little job security for researchers and academic employees alike.

**Why we need to be out on the picket line:**

*Withholding labor is only half the battle.*

Picketing is so important because it gives us the visibility that is needed to make real change at the university-wide level. This visibility goes very far in showing the University how much power we, as the academic workers at the school, hold. We do a large majority of the work in the EECS department and the University must be made to understand how crucial we are as academic workers to the everyday-functioning of the school. No academic workers means no UC Berkeley. If we just sat at home and did nothing, the university would not care or notice. By making a lot of noise, it is unambiguously shown how many of us there are, and how much we are willing to do to be treated only fairly.

Plus! Picketing is fun! There is music, dancing, food, and all of your friends there along with you. You meet new people from different departments. You connect with others who are each there for their own reason. *These are valuable connections ‚Äì anybody who‚Äôs friends with a grad student knows that it‚Äôs a great thing to have.*

**We are making history out there. There have been, there are, and there always will be many who would like to see the University of California made into a docile, lifeless machine ‚Äì in the words of Mario Savio we must throw our bodies upon the gears, or we risk being enveloped eternally within them. See you on the picket line.**

Genuine question here. I understand why it's necessary but sadly I don't know much about the financial situation of UC and I'm just wondering how the university is going to pay more once they reach an agreement with the union? Do they have a lot of extra money that they are spending on nonessential matters now (exceedingly high wages for administrators, buying random expensive things that only a few people use) or are they going to have to get the money from somewhere else (raising tuition, more funding from state gov, reallocating fund from sports or research)? If they are spending the money unwisely then they definitely need to use those money to pay our academic workers better. If they don't, does that mean researchers and atheletes will have less funding or we students have to pay a higher tuition?
OP post
I‚Äôm kinda confused on the budget for this, if salaries are increased and staffing is increased, where is the money coming from, higher tuition?
Quick question: Is my math here right? [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi_gsi_pay_gap_is_gsi_pay_really_only_16hour/)

I've been trying to understand the whole deal. Like I think right now UGSIs make $34/hour and GSIs make $16/hour. Is that right? And if the union wins that goes to $66/hour for UGSIs and $30 an hour for GSIs? 

I really hope you can get more money, especially for GSIs, but still honestly a little conflicted about the proposed UGSI pay if I'm understanding correctly. Like I can justify it that UGSIs can land really good internships, but if I'm just totally off base that'd also be good to know.
See hundreds of CS, EECS, DS and more students out on picket lines and supporting each other makes me so proud!   


The myth that engineers do not care and are uninvolved is clearly wrong!
I don't think the issue with CS is entirely due to low pay/benefits. CS is definitely overcrowded and deserve a larger share of the university budget overall, because it takes on a disproportionately higher teaching load.

What strike would do is put pressure to cut cost, which is already there. That's why CS is admitting fewer students and dropping graduation requirements right now.
The best way to support your GSIs is to post on Ed!  Make it known that you support them!
This is a really helpful post, thank you. I have a question about the $54,000/yr salary number. My understanding that is for 20 hrs/wk work. How can anyone expect to survive working only part-time? I know I am missing something so that is why I am asking, but it is unreasonable to me that people think they can take a part-time Job and that will support them. 

For examples, The literary workers in New York City are also striking right now. Many of them make around $40k/yr, have graduated from college, work full time and have to live in NYC.
This post is SO GOOD
I remember back when grad school was about school, and being a student was being a student...

...if someone referred to me as an ""Academic Worker"" I would be offended. I'm here to learn, and discover truth! I'm not here for a job. If I wanted a job, I'd have gone into industry.
Thank you Liam!!
Don‚Äôt forget defunding UC police.  You‚Äôre also on strike to defund UC police.
Fight for 66! ($66/hr and tuition reimbursement for uGSIs)
How would the strike lead to shorter office hours wait times? Higher wages would probably mean they hire fewer people right? That‚Äôs very simple microeconomics.
Stop harassing undergrads.
no on is gonna read this god damn book you just posted
I don‚Äôt go here. But what happens to your grades and Assignments? Is there concern over that or no?
Why don‚Äôt TAs just quit?

Everyplace is hiring.
Not exactly. In fact there are no discussions being held and (I believe) no OH being held either. As for Ed, the amount of support is nowhere near normal levels. Since Homework 12 is optional, I would assume most people have elected to focus their efforts elsewhere.
How does this reconcile with Justin scabbing?
I had the same question as well, as an alum who hasn't kept up with the situation. I had to re-read the post, but the OP does address it in the bottom of ""Why I'm on strike."" I take this to mean they're asking for an increase in headcount, and that puts pressure on departments / the school for higher hiring budgets? 

>**The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring.** This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.
Two separate demands at the bargaining table. Higher pay, as well as increased staffing. Also, happier GSI makes for better teaching in my opinion.
They're two separate demands. Yeah it does sound counterproductive at first to ask for more money AND more GSI positions, but honestly EECS is small compared to the entire UC system so even the higher cost per GSI is going to be irrelevant in the bigger picture.  Like increasing everyone's wages is going to cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year, so a small number of extra positions in one department at one campus is not a big deal, esp. if they resolve the UGSI / GSI pay gap issue (assuming it exists and I did my math right).
I‚Äôm honestly not optimistic about future CS undergrad exp. Waiting two hours for a 10 minute uGSI session (who barely knows the topic better than you do) does more than dissuading you from seeking help: it trains your ability to do independent work to the point where seeking help is not even a part of your mind when you enter upper div courses. The current revealed gap already seems unfulfillable, and just imagine how many hidden gaps we are missing here‚Ä¶
I think the additional hiring is for TAs, tutors, etc. not faculty.
This will come from UC central funding, not the department. UC has the money.
My worry is that if the university is forced to both pay more and hire more they just won‚Äôt offer classes every semester to balance it out
Very OP
Couple things to clear up. In reality they are working full time. They are working as research assistants, as well as student instructors. They teach, do their own research, help their professor with research, and have their own classes on top of that. They are not working 20 hours. They are working much more (Teaching + research). Next, there is a cap on how much they can work. They cannot get above 20 hours of pay. They are also in school for 5-7 years. Are we really to expect them to live paycheck to paycheck for that long? They are productive instructors and researchers/academics and deserve to make a living wage. They quite literally make this school function. I am glad the librarians are striking. The bay area is quite expensive as well. Grad students have also graduated from college. We want this to be setting a benchmark for academic salary and hopefully other schools/organizations will follow suit for fair pay.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs.

If Berkeley wants to remain competitive as a top grad school, it needs top talent. To obtain top talent, it needs to get as close as it can to what other schools can offer. If top graduate students stop coming here, Berkeley very quickly devolves into a teaching school. Without good GSRs to do the ""grunt"" work for them, PIs would be less productive. Without good GSIs that can alleviate the effort of teaching, faculty would have more work teaching, and be less productive. Faculty choose to remain at Berkeley, despite the lower pay, because of the human capital: other faculty and high quality graduate students.

So it is ok for you to think that Berkeley shouldn't pay grad students for ""part time work"", just understand that it would just lead to destroying grad programs here and improving grad programs elsewhere.

From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge. Knowledge creates technology, which has massive spillovers/positive externalities. Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.
why does this subreddit has so much astroturfing

there honestly needs to be a limit on karma/account age before you can comment or post outside of the main Q&A megathread
Fuck off, and stop posting in bad faith about the most obscure corner of the proposal that 99% of people don't care about.
come back to reality
Context: This is for 20 hour GSI/head TA. This amounts to 54k a year, which is calculated based on the cost of living in the bay, as well as to make sure GSIs are not rent burdened, which is defined as spending more than 30% of income on rent.  This is the GSIs primary income. They are capped at 20 hours. They cannot get paid for more than that. For all their research and teaching, 54k what they should receive.
Holy fuck uGSIs are asking for A LOT more than what grad students get paid if true.
Ok, if you want to make more money than what a google internship pays, better become a C++ cow and work for Citadel.
Two separate demands. One for higher wages. The other specifically for increased EECS staffing. The increased staffing will lead to shorter OH wait times.
I personally haven't seen this behavior on my own picket line, but I personally have experienced jeering from some other picketers while walking to the library when I took a shift off. I really hope this isn't the norm for most picket lines, and I don't think it is. I'll make sure to talk to the people on my picket line for sure and some of the union leaders about this issue!
Fucker Carlson strikes again
Ah gotcha is this an eecs specific point?
Question for you, realistically what is the chance that both demands got fufilled? I wholeheartedly wish that can happen. I can definately see that EECS enrollment is impacted by short staffing and budget cut, and there have been lectures asking for more budget to the department as well. Hiring 50% more will improve undergrads experience, but bring this up under a post that advocate for GSIs higher pay is confusing as these demand conflits with each other.

It's not librarians. It is people at HarperCollins - literary workers in the publishing industry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html)

Well, I really want to support the strike so need to keep learning and will continue to do my best in that. Right now it seems you have lots of options, including coming back to school to get advanced degrees. Are they not allowed to work outside of the university? People like me worked 3 jobs just to be able to go to college and get my undergraduate degree. After college we worked 2 or sometimes 3 jobs to be able to afford to live where we live, had roommates and ate at happy hours. I am not unsympathetic, sincerely trying to understand but at the moment it doesn't sound like slave labor to me.
I'd be really interested in the net cost differences between Cal and similarly ranked programs because for instate undergrad there is a huge difference in cost vs. similarly ranked (mostly private) schools. Is that not the case for grad school?

And do note, I don't think Berkeley should not pay their part-time grad workers, but in my ignorance, I don't think $54k/yr is gawd awful pay. Median income in Alameda County is $45,882. Thank you for taking the time to give more food for thought. I appreciate it and do hope working conditions improve and a fair wage is worked out.
It's not obscure and it's abhorrent. Get the union to take it off so we can stop getting distracted by it. People DO care about it and it worries people that the union would be so stupid. What other stupid things might they do in the name of caring for their workers. For better or worse, members need to keep their leadership straight!
I‚Äôm just stating what the union is asking for / what the strike is all about
Devil's Advocate question. Why is it expected that GSIs be able to earn a living wage off of a 20 hour position? Both undergraduate and professional schools expect you to have negative net income, with the assumption future salary more than outweighs the costs.
Why would it be for 20 hours? My understanding is that you guys often put in 40 hours of work per week, so why not put in for reclassification as 40-hour per week full-time employees with the same salary? That is what I presumed was being advocated for this whole time, as it makes the most sense.
You have to keep in mind that the UC relies on the legal fiction that grad students only work 20 hours per week.
Unless things have changed since my day, uGSIs with 10 hour appointments make bank (well over $50/hour) thanks to the fee waivers.
So shorter office hours for EECS and longer for other classes?
That would really help the perception of the strike I believe.
Yes this is EECS specific but, to my understanding, it is the first time the UC has ever allowed bargaining over staffing for any department so this is a step in the right direction for everyone else
Sounds like it
The raise would bankrupt the department, but the union is saying the university should fund the increased staff levels AND the raises. The union site says the total cost of the whole thing is only 3% of the UC budget.
It‚Äôs super common for PhD students to be restricted from having any other jobs or if generous be limited to say 10 hrs/wk. For masters students it can be different, but PhD students are limited to the salary the UC and their department set for typically 5-7 years of their 20s and/or 30s.
You're missing the main point: grad students are not like undergrads. They're not like students at all, except for the first year or two of the program. PhD students in particular are expected to work extreme hours on their research, with teaching being something they fit in as they can. This research is not generally some self-directed thing for the educational benefit of the student. It is actual directed work necessary to maintain the universities standing, and continue to bring grant funds in. 

When I was a PhD student, my advisor made it very clear that he expected 60 hours of work a week. The fact that this is recorded as a 'part-time' 20 hours a week job is just a legal fiction that allows the University to avoid labor laws. GSRs and GSIs are direct employees of the university, and they are absolutely expected to work more than full time for that employer, regardless of what is put on paper to avoid paying benefits.
I think the point is we don't want grad students workers to have to work 2 or 3 full time jobs to survive. Again, they don't have much time on their hands after doing their own research, helping their professor with research, taking classes, studying for qualifying exams, as well as running EECS classes. I'd say they barely have enough time to do all that I just listed. Given that, finding outside work isn't that feasible in my opinion. For more perspective on understanding this, talk to some grad students and hear them out directly. I personally can only say what I've heard grad students tell me, but I'm sure if you talk to some yourself, you'll find some answers.
Nobody is getting 54k a year today. Mine is 30, many programs pay 24.

What do you mean by net cost? Tuition is funded by the departments.
It's about a lot more. You are focusing on literally the most controversial sounding piece of the proposal. UGSIs aren't that common across the whole system and you are trying to shoot down the whole strike because some relatively tiny group of people is going to make $66/hour under the current proposal (which is subject to change). You are totally ignoring the other 47000 people going on strike. See [https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/](https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/), like people literally cant afford to be grad students at Berkeley despite working 40 hours or more per week.
As a grad student I struggle with this question all the time and I don‚Äôt have a good answer. Because we do get tuition covered as part of our compensation package. One issue is that if we can‚Äôt afford to live here we will just go somewhere else where pay does have better correlation to cost of living. Another argument is that we should actually restructure graduate education as whole since PhD programs in other countries are considered jobs. 
If someone has a better answer I would love to see it! Because I support a lot of these initiatives and would love to get paid more but can make sense of UC‚Äôs ‚Äúlogic‚Äù
Because graduate students after the first year or two are basically working full time for the university for its benefit. At the beginning I think they all take classes, but eventually they're either in a lab 40 hours per week or they're teaching 20 hours a week and doing 20+ hours of research. 

I don't know much about professional schools, but I assume that students in them are mostly taking classes and doing assignments, rather than providing 40+ hours of valuable labor to their school.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs.

So it is ok for you to think that Berkeley shouldn't pay grad students for ""part time work"", just understand that it would just lead to destroying grad programs here and improving grad programs elsewhere.

From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are *producers* of knowledge instead of *consumers* of knowledge. Knowledge creates technology, which has massive spillovers/positive externalities. Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.
What I'm saying is, according to what the union proposed on the salary adjustment, uGSI will get much more than grad students if the union won(66 vs \~30). So the pay gap between undergrads and grads will look even worse if you are implying grad students typically works more than 20 hrs.
Here's the thing. The UC budget is almost entirely salaries. The budget is also siloed, the medical centers/hospitals operate under a separate budget then the teaching parts.

What the union is proposing is firing/layoffs for probably 5% of the non hospital people (5% of the salaries, really) and taking that money and using it to up the pay of the people on strike.

It's not a bad idea, but it's just hard to imagine the university actually doing it 

I mean Elon musk just cut 50% of Twitter and that seems to be still functioning. So maybe the UC could do something similar.
So how is being able to get a PhD not a privilege? Who gets to go to school that long and not have to save money in order to do it? Doesn't getting a PhD generally increase your earning potential? I am not saying that I don't value education and in fact, I value education for the sake of it, but I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system. Which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing but perhaps someone should say that instead of saying they are rent-deprived.
Sooo, what I am hearing from you is that these employers (advisors, etc) are massively breaking the employment laws in California. It is interesting to me you would strike before reporting these horrendous breaches. Has that route ever been taken?
Will do. No one is suggesting 2-3 full time jobs, part-time jobs. Its sounding pretty privileged to me. I will keep asking and learning...
Nope. The most controversial is the defunding, deactivating of any police allowed on campus.
Wait, in what countries? Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc, and it's not like that up north...
So in some programs, the grant research directly tied to the dissertation, but sometimes the paid research might be different from the research for dissertation. Since 12 credit hours of research for a degree is separate from the 20 paid hours. 

Yes I support the strike and the initiatives being bargained for! I am not trying to undermine it with this. I just think the big picture of grad students as students instead of workers needs to shift at the university level across academia in general and thats a much bigger task.
>From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition.

Honestly, I'm really skeptical of this argument.  Competitive industries do not have labor strikes -- pay disputes are resolved by workers switching companies and not accepting offers at underpaying ones.   I'm guessing UC does not actually see that effect or they would have already been incentivized to act.

>From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge.

I think this is a more relevant argument to my question. It does seem to be a systemic problem though (UC if anything is put at a competitive disadvantage paying so much above market); I guess you need to start somewhere though. GL.
We are also advocating for 20 hour GSIs to be compensated at 54k yearly as well.
Ah, I missed the 'u'. Personally, I've always felt that it doesn't make sense to have undergrads receive the TA stipends with fee coverage, but I guess the department does need TAs. It does seem like a bit of a disservice to the other undergrads, though...

But yea, $66/hr plus fee waiver is kind of nonsensical for undergrads.
Sure it‚Äôs a privilege. For me personally, I didn‚Äôt feel like I could do it until I worked for a few years after undergrad and had some savings to fall back on because the pay is so low. It really depends on the field and career track as to whether it increases earning potential. For me, I‚Äôll make the same or slightly more (will take a long time to make up for these years if ever), but I hope it‚Äôll bring me a livable wage doing something more intellectually challenging than my previous track. Those who end up as adjuncts within academia, a path academia created for PhDs, may be on a worse salary trajectory than without a PhD. 

However, the UC has a stated goal of promoting diversity and inclusion within higher education. Right now, the pay is a huge barrier to that goal. Lower income students are less likely to get there in the first place, and they‚Äôre also much more likely to drop out due to financial hardship bc their stipend doesn‚Äôt cover the cost of living. After you graduate you‚Äôre encouraged to then go make low pay/minimal benefits for additional years as a postdoc in the hopes of landing one of the few coveted tenure track roles. Anecdotally, it‚Äôs obvious to me that a lot of students in my program get frequent/monthly parental support to supplement their income, which means their families are in a relatively comfortable situation. If the UC is serious about bringing a broader range of people into academia, pay needs to be higher. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just talk and academia will continue to be a place dominated by people with wealthy and/or professor parents.
>I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system.

They ARE trying to change the system, they see the current system as exploitative and unfair, and there are merits to that argument (see OPs post).  It varies department by department,  research lab by research lab, and class by class on whether it actually is exploitative, and if so, how much.

Some grad students have to be a GSI most every semester because they don't have any GSR funding, yet are still expected to do research.  If the research is advancing the status of their lab and furthering efforts of research grants (rather than themselves), that strikes me as quite exploitative.  If they are doing independent research on an esoteric topic that no one is willing to fund, the question is why should that be supported by taxpayers or tuition or.... ?  (Where else is the money coming from?)

Grad students who are primarily paid as GSRs, and whose GRS appointments from their PI's grants/funding are bumped to 100% in the summer months (this is allowed and happens in some engineering departments), and who have reasonable career paths in and outside of academia after graduation... These people probably deserve a raise too (hello inflation!), but they don't seem exploited.  There is zero recognition by the union that there IS training going on beyond just first year classes.  Grad students are generally much much less productive researchers than post-docs.

GSI's who are working more than 20 hours a week average on instruction tasks should immediately raise this to the instructor and more staff should be hired - this is not OK and is exploitative.  Extreme expectations on research time for GSRs is also not OK.

The demand for fully subsidized childcare really gets to me, even though I generally support subsidized childcare.  There are programs for low income people to get childcare grants and these should be expanded / easier to access / less waiting.  But there is no special reason a grad student (who could be married to a high paid tech worker) deserves free childcare more than a retail employee, and no reason UC should be responsible for implementing this huge social benefit (that democrats tried and failed to pass).

A sizable wage increase and some other things, I support 100%.  Not to ""both sides..."" this, but.... there is a side to it beyond the reddit narrative.  
(edit, typo)
You'd think so, but nope! The UC has explicit exemption from many of the employment laws that apply to all other employers. Neat, huh?
Graduate student positions are created as half-time appointments to enable students to spend the other 50% of their time on independent research. To encourage this, many graduate students are contractually prohibited from taking a second job  during the 20 hours/wk that we not compensated for. We are stuck in a position where we are only compensated half time, but not allowed to seek outside employment. This is what is causing a lot of the disconnect between public-facing UC messaging and graduate student demands. There is no way they will give us full-time appointments, so we have to push for higher compensation for what is on paper a half-time appointment but is in reality an all-consuming job.
The 50% threshold is actually because it‚Äôs a requirement for international students to be on student visas, not because PhD students are expected to work only those hours
>Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc,

Where are you getting this?
Most PhD programs in Europe pay very well with less teaching load, actually.
Interesting! Hmm, yeah if someone is getting funded by a grant from the government or however that works, it does seem complicated if all of the sudden they are twice as expensive.
If you are skeptical, go around a group of grad students and ask them where they had offers from and why they chose Berkeley.   


Competitive industries most certainly have strikes, but even if you assume that they don't, there are several reasons why grad school acceptance is not a perfectly competitive market, most importantly the fact that it is something that you can only choose once and switching costs are incredibly high. Your argument is basically ""I won't take a 100 dollar bill from the floor, since if it was real, someone else would already have taken it"".   


UC did not see the effect because grad students just accepted it quietly. Several departments pay an extra stipend to try to compete with other schools, but since the majority of pay comes from GSI/GSR appointments it was not enough.
Apparently few other ppl in the comments and them are referring to this post, and it's literally 66/hr vs half the amount for GSI instead of same pay.

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/
This is THE best post on this I've seen. Thank you. Helps so much!  And for the record, I did state that changing the system is not necessarily a bad thing but I was just looking for someone to say that instead of complaining that people can't pay their rent. Thank you again.
I'd heard the Regents are an entity unto themselves and somehow incredibly powerful. Maybe this strike should be the beginning a tearing that corruption down.
Exactly! It‚Äôs complex accounting. In stem especially we are often paid out of fellowships or grants, with GSI positions filling in gaps where needed. These grants are often funded by government, and the university takes a cut of the grant for admin costs while another portion goes to the student and student‚Äôs fees. As a result the university doesn‚Äôt pay much for GSRs at all but reaps the benefits of the work being done. So when it‚Äôs sold to us as educational experience and a degree, instead of a paid job, it‚Äôs a little bs. I imagine there are logistics that would go into how grants would have to be allocated to cover these costs without just having to ask for more money in grants, if the university continues to take a large percentage of them, but that is research I‚Äôll get into another day.

The GSI budget comes from the university/dept and so that is a whole issue that I rely on the union for because I have less experience on that front."
