Bio 1al gsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l94xps/bio_1al_gsi/,2021-01-30 20:54:03,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone who has taken bio 1al has had Helen lew as a gsi before? Her first lab lec was hella long and I was just curious how well she prepares for exams and how she is as a grader. Thank you!","[deleted]
Helen is the best!"
How to Survive Bio 1A + 1AL,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6h1868/how_to_survive_bio_1a_1al/,2017-06-13 10:02:35,"I heard this class was hell! I did pretty well in 1B but of course I heard 1A is a whole other beast. I have Baxter and Helen Lew for lecture and lab, any tips? 

Thanks! ","Holy shit, Helen Lew is still leading Bio 1A lab???

She was my lab TA when I was there. I took Bio 1A in 1999!!! She wasn't new then, either. She's brilliant, but terribly allergic to the rats you have to dissect at the end of the semester.

Helen can be a demanding GSI but she'll prep you well.  Above all, just study.  Bio 1A had an irritating (for me) amount of pure memorization in it, but the upside of that is you can get through by brute force.  I never really found any of it conceptually challenging, just detail-heavy.
The lab manual, written by Mike, is horribly written and very confusing. Too bad almost all the bio 1al test questions come from there. =( 

Also genetics is the toughest section, you really need to understand mitosis, meosis, and recombinance
Holy shit, she‚Äôs been doing Bio 1AL for at least 18 years? That‚Äôs crazy. 
Hahaha oh shit
> scientists update that shit for funsies

I laughed really hard at that, just imagine a group of scientists in a lab fact checking their research with the article LOL
Very helpful. Will follow

Especially when they're fried, they taste great
Thanks! Could you elaborate a little on the lab section and the quizzes? I heard the labs themselves were tedious, but the quizzes were pretty hard. Are they based on the last lab or the lecture? 

Also, was the book even helpful or should I just pay attention to lecture really closely
Ah shit :( what was the al test like?
I'd wager she's been at it for at least 20 years. She was already head TA when I was in her section.
I gorge on these at my local buffet, so good.
It's been about a year and a half, so my memory of the specifics is a bit fuzzy, but I'll do my best.

The labs could be tedious at times but I found them to be less so than the chem labs were.  It really depends on your level of interest in the subject matter.

The discussion section quizzes weren't particularly hard or easy, and if I recall correctly they're written by all of the GSIs as a group, so that should have a stabilizing effect on the difficulty year-to-year.  They're based on just the regular lecture and discussion section.

I don't remember if there were quizzes in lab, but if there were they were never a major thing.  They would have just been small things to attach points to reading the lab instructions ahead of time or something, which you should do anyway (having to constantly check the instructions is a major contribution to tedium, in my experience).

The book is okay, but I didn't use it a whole lot.  Unless you really want it, you'd be fine with using the copies available in the library (just be proactive about getting one ahead of exams) or sharing one with a group of friends to bring down the cost.  The lecture slides and your GSI are going to be your best resources.
all the tests are multiple choice, but some of the questions are quite tricky and/or test on obscure detail from the lab manual that you will just have to memorize. The upside is that they give like 2 hours per test so there is no time crunch, unlike the lecture exams.
Thank you for writing this out. Much appreciated"
