Yeah, those unknown professors like Michael Pollan who has given a TED talk, been on national television numerous times, and authored 5 New York Times best sellers. Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.  Truly, he deserves some sort of award to signify the important contributions he has made.
Most if not all of these are extremely well-known and have won many awards.
Robert Hass is excellent. He writes a lot about human connection with our environment. So does the other poetry professor next semester (John Shoptaw).

is good, as well as

His poems also have themes of semiotics, for the linguistics/philosophy/literary theory people out there.

That is, (my interpretation), if we see a blackberry and describe it as a ""blackberry"", as in ""I saw a blackberry today,"" we've essentially destroyed that blackberry's uniqueness and identity, unified it with all the other blackberries in the world. Just saying the word ""blackberry"" at once marks the funeral of that specific blackberry and sings its final elegy. There is, I think, the value of silence: in appreciating some Thing without putting a name to it, that clouds our judgement with our memories of all the other Things of that name (ever met a girl with the same name as your ex?).

That last line just struck me as particularly beautiful when I read it, as a sharp upper bound on what humans are able to communicate with each other.
What a BS article. That is not a list of *unknown* people.
At least as famous as a critical theorist, especially one focused on a field as specific as gender theory, can hope to be. I think all of us humanities people pray to be even half as notable as her.

Perlmutter too.

At least article writer can take solace that the Nobel committee agrees  with them that these guys ""deserve an award""? :P"

DAE feel like this enrollment this semester seems more difficult?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k1rnt/dae_feel_like_this_enrollment_this_semester_seems/,2011-09-01 14:54:00,"I'm currently a senior and haven't had any issues enrolling in any of my classes for the past six semesters. This is the first semester where I've had issues getting into classes (I'm still waitlisted, even with a bajillion units). Does anyone else have this issue? Or was I just lucky all this time?

Perhaps this is the effect of budget cuts. I'm enrolling in EECS classes and it appears their offerings have greatly reduced as well.","[deleted]
I think it all depends.  I'm a junior and this is the first semester that I haven't had any problems getting into any classes.  (Except the Pollan class..  Damn you Michael Pollan...)
To the newly enrolled Freshmen: WINTER IS COMING
I don't go to UC Berkeley (I'm going to apply this fall as an incoming freshman), but I read a lot about how the lack of funding for education in California has put a lot of stress on schools like UC Berkeley. So some of the issues include more out-of-state enrolled and other issues involved with enrollment.
You gotta prioritize, man. Sign up for the really important classes first phase. I've had to sit and wait on waitlists, but never for my actual major classes.
aaww then I won't get to be your GSI this term

yay stats (and biostats)
Seriously, he should just teach on Memorial Glade and project his lecture slides on Evans or something.
HOLY FUCK. I did not know Michael Pollan was a UC Berkeley professor!
It's kinda hard when all the classes you take are actual major classes (I'm a double major).
I don't think he teaches classes really.  Even for the Edible Education class, he wasn't there on the first day, and I feel like he might just talk at only one of the lectures.  It seems like it's all for the publicity...
Ahh I see. That sucks then. :(
Aww, that's too bad."
