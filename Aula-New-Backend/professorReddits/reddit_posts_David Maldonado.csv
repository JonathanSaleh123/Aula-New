"14 formerly incarcerated Cal graduates were honored at the first ever graduation ceremony for formerly incarcerated students Sunday.

""diversity"" 
> After obtaining his GED while incarcerated, Maldonado attended Berkeley City College and then transferred to UC Berkeley at the age of 40. Since then, he has earned a bachelor’s degree in Chicano studies and a master’s degree in education from UC Berkeley, the latter of which he received this year. He plans to stay on campus with the hope of acquiring a doctorate in social and cultural studies from the Graduate School of Education.

None of these is a serious degree that can get him a job. Dude still hasn't grown up even though he's in his 40s.
This is an incredibly naive and ignorant comment. UC Berkeley is not a vocational school whose purpose is to get people jobs. It's a university whose mission is to educate the public so that its graduates may be informed and productive citizens. If you are a Cal student or graduate, then sadly that lesson has been lost on you. Of course, one important way to be a productive member of society is through the work you do, but the fact that you see those academics subjects as an impediment to a job says less about the quality of education to be had and more about your failure of imagination. Not everyone wants to work in computer programming or management consulting. There are plenty of opportunities in government, law, education, social services, and philanthropy for such graduates. And yes, even business. Take Laura Bush for example (I mention her only because I just recently heard a radio program about her). She graduated with what you might deem a ""non-serious"" degree in anthropology. But she went on to found the company FEED, which sells reusable bags and donates a portion of the profit to help feed hungry children around the world. She is making a difference in this world, and the company is doing quite well. Moreover, not only did she succeed in creating a job for herself, but she also creates jobs for other people, probably people just like Maldonado. So get off your high, if extremely limited, horse and try to see the potential in people's passion rather than tear them down and disparage their noble accomplishments. 
You don't think he will be able to find a job in education?
Yes, because people should only be allowed to study things that will make them a lot of money and/or translate directly into a lucrative career.  Who needs to follow their passions and study stuff they might relate to/deeply care about?  That's crazy!

You must be referring to Lauren Bush (George W. Bush's niece), not Laura Bush (his wife).

Lauren Bush co-founded FEED. Are you seriously using a privileged member of the Bush family to say you can major in whatever you want and be successful? If you are privileged and have the connections like Laura Bush, you can major in whatever you want.

If you're not privileged, majoring in useless degrees and getting into a lot of debt for them is a really terrible choice.

Check your privilege.

Who would hire a guy who served multiple prisoner sentences to be an educator?
The check your privilege thing is so bullshit. It's an excuse by minorities

First generation Mexican here. Grew up low income and graduated from Cal in Anthropology. I now make over six figures and I'm under 30. You don't need to be white and don't need a ""practical"" major.
There's a lot of jobs in the education field that aren't as an actual educator - hell, he could be involved in prison education policy, non-profits, etc.
> I now make over six figures and I'm under 30. You don't need to be white and don't need a ""practical"" major.

$500 says you're 27-30 years old, making $100k-$150k at a startup in the Bay Area, and think you're on a high-earning career track when there's 23 year olds making more $$$ than you.
> First generation Mexican here. Grew up low income and graduated from Cal in Anthropology. I now make over six figures and I'm under 30. You don't need to be white and don't need a ""practical"" major.

What kind of job are you doing to make over six figures with an Anthropology degree?
I'm a project manager at a tech company. I don't utilize my major, you just use your major to get your first job. Many companies don't care what you major in for an entry level job.
Good that it worked out for you.

People always say major in what's your passion, but if you then get an unrelated job that's not your passion, then what's the point?

If project management was your passion, you would have majored in business.
My career is deifnitely not my passion, I only do it for the money so I can do other things in life.

I majored in Anthropology because I enjoyed and I knew I just needed the degree in anything to get a job later "
