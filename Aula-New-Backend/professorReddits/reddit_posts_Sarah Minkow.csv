Hi I submitted the application, and when will the result come out? Is there any chance that I get declined?
is it pass/fail?
You can email the instructor at [sminkow@berkeley.edu](mailto:sminkow@berkeley.edu) to get information about the syllabus.
Students will know if they are in the class in the next few weeks.
I also have the same concern. Will we know if we get in before the semester begins?
Of course there’s a chance you can get declined.  A popular class like this can easily get 500+ applicants for a few spots.  I have zero knowledge on this class, but in the past not so long ago, the Poker decal one semester a while back had 50 slots and 500 applicants, and the Baking Decal usually has like a <5% acceptance rate.  I would just prepare for the worst and hope for the best.
The course is graded but can be taken pass/no pass if desired."
