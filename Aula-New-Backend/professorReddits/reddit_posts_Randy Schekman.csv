Nobel laureate Randy Schekman will give 2022 commencement address,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uhrtfg/nobel_laureate_randy_schekman_will_give_2022/,2022-05-03 15:29:31," [https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/04/29/nobel-laureate-randy-schekman-will-give-2022-commencement-address/?utm\_source=Berkeleyan&utm\_campaign=419b8e57cf-berkeleyan&utm\_medium=email&utm\_term=0\_99ee3800d7-419b8e57cf-389846113](https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/04/29/nobel-laureate-randy-schekman-will-give-2022-commencement-address/?utm_source=Berkeleyan&utm_campaign=419b8e57cf-berkeleyan&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_99ee3800d7-419b8e57cf-389846113)

This year’s commencement will also feature a speech from the  soon-to-be-named University Medalist, the top graduating senior from the  Class of 2022. And California State Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) and  Assembly Member Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) will be presented with the  Chancellor’s Citation Award for their efforts in passing legislation to  allow the admission of thousands of Berkeley students this year.

Schekman, a staunch supporter of public schools and universities,  said he hopes to encourage Berkeley graduates to stay engaged with the  UC system even after they leave and to always remember the campus  community they came from.

“I would only hope that they look back and reflect on their time  here,” said Schekman, “and whatever field or profession they pursue,  take full advantage of the opportunities they are given — for  themselves, for the communities they come from, and for the  institutions, like Berkeley, that want them to succeed.”","his address will be the most interesting moiety of the commencement, that's for sure
Haha took me a second to get the joke lol"
Randy Schekman's Nobel Morning!,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRADDqc_D3M&feature=youtu.be,2013-10-07 17:12:36,,"Pretty adorable that his high school biology teacher contacted him today to congratulate him :)
Glad to see that his grad student was on top of it; first question is ""when do you get your Nobel [parking spot](https://www.google.com/search?site=imghp&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1252&bih=540&q=berkeley+nobel+laureates+parking&oq=berkeley+nobel+&gs_l=img.3.0.0j0i24l2.32.2338.0.3840.15.12.0.1.1.1.222.1666.5j4j3.12.0....0...1ac.1.27.img..7.8.671.tMWkosazCCo)?""  Great!
Can anyone explain to a non-science major exactly what Schekman did to get the award?
lol everyone knows that a lifetime parking pass is the most valuable thing you can get out of this. ;)
Proteins are the most important functional molecules in the cell. It was known that DNA coded for proteins and that they were assembled on ribosomes, but nothing was known about how the proteins were directed to their destinations. The proteins include enzymes that need to be directed to certain organelles, receptors that need to be inserted into the membrane, and hormones that need to be secreted from the cell. Schekman's lab studied this system in yeast and was able to figure out a lot of the pathway.
I understood some of that.
If that was difficult for you to understand, I think you need to take a basic biology course."

I was being facetious ;) But seriously, I used to go to office hours regularly, and I'd often be the only person there.
that's seriously so amazing. i think many of us just try to get our grades and dont realize we're being taught by some of the smartest people in the world and have so much to share."
"Unknown UC Berkeley professors who deserve an award: Joyce Carol Oates (she teaches the short fiction course in the creative writing department), John A. Dracup, Randy Schekman, Laura Nader, Saul Perlmutter, Oliver Williamson, Judith Butler, Yuan T. Lee, Michael Pollan, and Robert Hass.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/27/unknown-uc-berkeley-professors-deserve-award/,2017-10-29 21:54:04,,"[deleted]
Yeah, those unknown professors like Michael Pollan who has given a TED talk, been on national television numerous times, and authored 5 New York Times best sellers. Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.  Truly, he deserves some sort of award to signify the important contributions he has made.
Most if not all of these are extremely well-known and have won many awards.
Robert Hass is excellent. He writes a lot about human connection with our environment. So does the other poetry professor next semester (John Shoptaw).

is good, as well as 

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/06/27/the-problem-of-describing-trees.

His poems also have themes of semiotics, for the linguistics/philosophy/literary theory people out there.

That is, (my interpretation), if we see a blackberry and describe it as a ""blackberry"", as in ""I saw a blackberry today,"" we've essentially destroyed that blackberry's uniqueness and identity, unified it with all the other blackberries in the world. Just saying the word ""blackberry"" at once marks the funeral of that specific blackberry and sings its final elegy. There is, I think, the value of silence: in appreciating some Thing without putting a name to it, that clouds our judgement with our memories of all the other Things of that name (ever met a girl with the same name as your ex?).

That last line just struck me as particularly beautiful when I read it, as a sharp upper bound on what humans are able to communicate with each other.
What a BS article. That is not a list of *unknown* people.
At least as famous as a critical theorist, especially one focused on a field as specific as gender theory, can hope to be. I think all of us humanities people pray to be even half as notable as her.
> Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.

Perlmutter too.

At least article writer can take solace that the Nobel committee agrees  with them that these guys ""deserve an award""? :P"

I thought you spelled his name wrong.

Skipping Bio 1A/Bio 1B with AP Credit?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yjyvgw/skipping_bio_1abio_1b_with_ap_credit/,2022-11-02 00:49:06,"Is skipping Bio 1A/1AL and/or 1B with AP credit recommended as an MCB major? Not sure if I want to go into premed yet, but I'm thinking about double majoring and want to skip as many general courses as I can.","I know nothing about bio or premed, but I know Jennifer Doudna (Nobel prize winner) is teaching 1A next semester which is pretty cool
for mcb majors, i think you can go head to skip bio1b because the content is less relavent or even not relavent at all. i would still recommend taking bio1a/1al, because it does cover some more concepts than ap bio, and taking it gives you a holistic overview and  preparation for  upper classes. but feel free to skip too, if you are confident enough and/or wanna take more classes. 

premed is another story i believe. if you wanna do premed, you have to take bio1a and bio1b for the general bio requirement. you cannot skip and use ap scores. pls correct me if im wrong
i agree! but actually in fall semesters randy schekman is teaching. he is a nobel prize winner too. but ive heard that neither of them are very good lecturers. i can def agree with randy
former peer advisor, current med student here

Hard agree. If you’re premed, don’t skip lmao adcoms know the tech. They’ve seen people do this and some don’t like it others don’t care, it’s often never a “good” sign tho."
Commencement Speaker,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ugb8a2/commencement_speaker/,2022-05-01 15:36:12,Does anyone know who the commencement speaker is this year?,"Fr… don’t tell me it’s Carol, again
I just checked the [commencement website](https://commencement.berkeley.edu), and it says the speaker is Dr. Randy Schekman who was the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2013"
