"Berkeley Chemistry professors Peidong Yang and Carolyn Bertozzi received the 2014 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award last week during a ceremony at the Department of Energy in Washington, D.C.",http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/07/28/yang-bertozzi-receive-lawrence-award/,2015-07-28 19:54:39,,"Bertozzi got hired away to Stanford. Big loss for our bio dept.
Damn, that's very unfortunate. She's basically one of the legends alongside Doudna and others. 
She and Doudna are definite Nobel candidates. 
Agreed, either for the next one or soon after. There are whole labs devoted to CRISPR right now so it's definitely the game changer that the committee looks for in candidates. 

Thankfully they've also brought on a ton of new faculty in the last 2-ish years from some great places so hopefully Bertozzi's move to Stanford can be healed, even if just a little."
"Six professors were elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), one of the nation's most prestigious scientific societies: Steven Evans (math/statistics), Susan Marqusee (MCB), Ian Agol (math), Robert Glaeser (MCB), Krishna Niyogi (plant and microbial biology), and Peidong Yang (chemistry).",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/05/05/uc-berkeley-faculty-members-elected-national-academy-sciences/,2016-05-07 23:11:22,,Ayy my nigga Agol back at it :\^)
"Peidong Yang, a UC Berkeley chemist who is trying to capture carbon dioxide from the air and turn it into a sustainable transportation fuel, has been named a MacArthur ""genius"" Fellow. The 24 new 2015 fellows each will receive $625,000 to use in any way they wish.",http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/09/28/chemist-peidong-yang-receives-macarthur-genius-award/,2015-09-29 20:23:52,,"Hey I'm a genius, but they didn't give me an award.  WTF?
For those who took chem 104A: ""sigama etch""
625k can buy a lot of rare pepes... 
But are you a ""genius""? 
Did you try posing with le smug face in front of your computer?"
