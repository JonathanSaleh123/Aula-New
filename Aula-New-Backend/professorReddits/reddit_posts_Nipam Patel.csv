This is an international march, not just a Berkeley thing.  
Clearly not from Berkeley so why are you here?
Newly accepted freshmen. Don't mind him, if he decides to come to Cal he'll act much better after freshmen indoctrination class. 
Ugh. I was lost before the mandatory freshman indoctrination class. So glad I'm past that phase of my life. 
confused about why he even wants to come to berkeley if he seems to hate everything that happens here...
Probably academically and prestigiously the best school he got into for a major that will make him bank. There aren't many undergraduate programs better than Berkeley EECS to make that sweet, sweet green right after graduation."
