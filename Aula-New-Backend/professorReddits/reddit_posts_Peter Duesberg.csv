Does Peter Duesberg still actively research or teach at Berkeley?,https://i.redd.it/jjn67nk0mdxa1.jpg,2023-05-01 20:09:11,"Based on the above Reddit comment, I went on a little deep dive. Is he still working, researching, or teaching at Berkeley? There was an academic misconduct investigation by Berkeley in 2009, but he was found not responsible (because they said he had the right to publish the article and they did not evaluate the research itself). I found he co-authored a paper in 2018, but it seems like his research substantially decreased since 2010. He is currently 86 so that is most likely a major a factor. 

Berkeley obviously talks up its researchers and professors that are pushing boundaries, changing our understanding of their field, helping people, etc. That’s why it was shocking to me that a professor here has very recently been deeply involved in spreading harmful and false misinformation. I get that this is what he believes and has focused his research on but it still has actively hurt a lot of people.

I also wonder how this might have impacted his ability to research at Berkeley. Do all of his team and coworkers believe the same thing or do they just ignore it? I’ve never been in a remotely similar scenario and have no idea how I would even approach this.

I don’t want to start a witch hunt. I’m not trying to cause a negative response towards this individual. MODS feel free to tell me to take down the post if it is or is causing the rules to be broken.

TLDR: I’m curious about Duesberg’s current relationship with Berkeley and how dynamics like this might play out in academia.","I might actually have some rare insights to answer your question. Back in Fall 2018 when I was a first semester freshman looking around for research opportunities, I came across the [faculty page](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/peter-duesberg) of Prof Duesberg  and saw that he was researching cancer. I was also really interested in studying cancer, and back then I had no clue he was so extensively involved with AIDS denialism. So I cold-emailed him and asked if I could possibly work in his lab.

He replied back and invited me to meet him for a chat in his lab. This was pretty exciting to me, as I had sent out a lot of cold emails to different faculty members and few, if any, ever responded. So one November afternoon I made the trek over to the third floor of Donner Laboratory. I remember my first impression of him was that he seemed polite and mild-mannered. He told me that not a lot of people come to visit him. As we got settled he offered me tea, which I politely declined. But as I looked around his laboratory, things seemed a little odd. First off, the entire laboratory space looked very old and decrepit. In hindsight, I now realize that his lab has basically been sequestered away in an aging building on the northeast corner of campus, away from all the other labs in the MCB department. Another thing that struck me as odd was that there was basically nobody else inside the lab except for him and one other student. I can't remember if this student was a graduate student or a lab technician, but if I recall correctly he was doing some sort of cell culture in an aging, run-down looking facility. Prof Duesberg then showed me an article he had published as recently as 2018 on the speciation theory of carcinogenesis, and started discussing some of the science behind it.

In the end, I excused myself when it got dark, as I had internally decided that this lab environment wasn't right for me. After the meeting I did a little more googling into his background, because I was curious why the circumstances in his lab seemed so odd, and I was shocked to discover his notoriety. But at any rate, in case you were curious, that's the in-person interaction I had with Prof Duesberg that occurred as recently as November 2018.
Seems he was teaching as recently as 2018 based on RMP but can't find much more about his recent work at Berkeley. And this tweet from 2021 suggests he was still working in the department: https://twitter.com/lpachter/status/1443095982334382080?s=20. The same tweeter suggests that he is still working here as of March 17th. But interestingly his faculty page on the MCB site is down. 


Also for reference of how much of a shitbag this guy is 
>Two independent studies have concluded that the public health policies of Thabo Mbeki's government, shaped in part by Duesberg's writings and advice, were responsible for over 330,000 excess AIDS deaths and many preventable infections, including those of infants.
At least until 2021 fiscal year: https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2021/university-of-california/peter-duesberg/

Looks like 2022 data will be released in August.
Well, he is a tenured professor so he cannot be fired by the university. As far as I know, incoming students are discouraged from joining his lab (if not straight up forbidden).
Fun Fact: Another Berkeley Alum and Noble Prize winner Kary Mullis was also an AIDS denialist. He's dead tho.
According to wiki he had a serious stroke in 2021, leaving him ""with severe aphasia affecting speech, reading and writing"". I saw similar reports on Facebook around the same time. That, together with his advanced age (87 years) makes it unlikely he is still actively working.

There is a great article on him from just recebtly that answers this question in a nuanced way:

[here here here](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/aids-dissident-seeks-redemption-and-a-cure-for-cancer)

Seems like he got punished through social exclusion, did not receive any more grants, and was even shunned from conferences and scientific meet ups. Looks like his other research is also still relevant and breaking new ground on cancer even today.

Cancel culture is easy (not denying that what he has done is harmful) but reality is nuanced. I think the article does a good job of explaining that.
Let’s complain to regents and get his ass fired
Duesberg was right, and has recently been validated by RFK Jr. His adversaries will stop at nothing to vilify him. At the very worst, if wrong, one could call him a kook, but to demonize him is impossible - just watch one of his old vids (he's been ""disappeared"" as confirmed in this thread.)
Peter Duesberg is correct in pointing out that HIV does not cause AIDS. If you look carefully into the first papers that claimed to have identified HIV and showed to cause AIDS, you will see that there was never any convincing proof. Consistent with this is the fact that there never was a real AIDS epidemic in the population in more than 30 years. It's not about beliefs, there is absolutely no convincing proof that HIV causes AIDS. Look it up. Take another look at Duesberg's paper without any bias and you will see that what he is saying is pure logic and entirely correct. It has never been refuted.
Unfortunately, he does not do research or teach anymore due to aging and health issues. Clearly a genius way ahead of his time. HIV does not cause AIDS. Read his book Inventing the AIDS Virus which is just pure logic destroying the whole hypothesis that people believe in without having done any kind of research or seen any AIDS subjects at all.
So did that infant develop AIDS or not?  Sounds like a good test case.
I believe he may no longer be active, and I have a feeling it's because of old age, he's in his 80s, declining health, or something like that. A few years ago I communicated with him a few times via email regarding rabies virus which I was doing research on, and he was prompt to reply. But some months later, and a year or so after that, no replies, and no mention of him giving recent lectures, so I suspect declining health means he's no longer working.

The most recent things he published on cancer were his conclusions after a lifelong of research and his recommendations for researchers coming after him.

His speciation theory of cancer is brilliant. Almost everything he concluded and/or predicted about cancer has eventually proven to be true (sorta like how everything concludable from Einstein has eventually proven true).
Thank you so much for sharing! I really appreciate your in depth response. Props to you to cold emailing professors, that’s awesome. It’s fascinating how Berkeley essentially put him in his own laboratory island. They essentially wanted to guide him out of his professor job because they can’t fire him. Huh
Peter Duesberg indeed was intentionally put up on Donner Lab in the early 2000's to be far away from the core of the department.   He used to be in old stanley hall.  He has basically self-funded his research since then and even at the time had at most 1 person in his lab, and occasionally his wife would come in and help.  I haven't heard a peep out of him in a few years.  Last time I was up there, I walked by his lab and could smell natural gas.  He had a bunsen burner on with no flame and nobody in sight.  His entire lab was filled with gas.  I shut the valve, and walked further down the hallway then knocked on his office to let him know.  At the time, he didn't seem to realize it was even on.  He was/is a very charming guy but don't let that fool you.  He was sloppy with his research and his teaching.  He ""threatened"" to intentionally expose himself to HIV to prove that it doesn't cause AIDS - but then quickly backed off that.  He also  once accused me of being a member of the ""AIDS Gestapo.""  You did well by not working in his lab.
Wow, that’s worse than what my initial research led me to believe. Holy cow.
He has a profile on the Berkeley Research page which is what made me originally curious if he worked here.

 Haha you guys are LOSERS
I don’t even know what to say besides I wish Berkeley found a way to get him off the payroll 20 years ago. Just awful. I’m definitely going to check back in August.
Seems like he has a few very cheap experiments to disprove his position, considering they’ve spent at least 150 billion on aids so far a few 10’s of thousands would be nothing to shut him up. I’ll bet a pound to a piece of shit they won’t do it. Who wants to derail the gravy train. Even luc montainier has stated hiv may be benign.
Loser behavior
Read up about tenure.
did you make a new account to comment this lol
I have read his book and dove into other sources and I agree. Peter Duesberg is right and I applaud  him for his Courage. 

It is troubling when disagreeing Scientists are being shunned and ridiculed. HIV is very profitable for a lot of people. Now they have „prep“ which is very lucrative.
why is AIDS such a sacred cow that he was made a pariah in the scientific community? One would think those concerned with AIDS would welcome any and all research into its origins to better understand and treat the disease. I've yet to find any material that refutes his claims in a logical, scientific way. He's simply branded an AIDS denialist and shunned. I don't know that he's ever outright denied AIDS, just challenged the hypothesis that HIV is the cause of AIDS. He has cited  that AIDS has different definitions depending on where in the world you happen to ask for one. At the end of the day I think the biggest issue people have with his work is that he suggest, based on documented data, that AIDS was heavily the result of reckless lifestyle choices further aggravated with experimental treatments like the lethal AZT.
Entire thing is shrouded in controversy. Coroner claimed yes, but never released an HIV serology test. And the baby had elevated  lymphocyte count inconsistent with someone who had AIDS. 

Obviously, the mainstream AIDS Narrative of the 1980's was completely wrong. I don't know that we can say Duesberg was right about everything (his popper theory was as speculative as a lot of the things he was criticizing, for example) but he was clearly right about a lot of things the Health Industrial Complex was wrong about. And they took revenge on him and everyone associated with him for that.
Yeah I saw that too, and that's what Lior Pachter references in the March 17 tweet. Seems Lior works at CalTech now though, so most recent confirmation we have is Lior mentioning that he worked there as of 2021.

The research site tho has it's most recent paper at 2018, the MCB link is dead, and his personal lab page that is linked hasn't been updated since 2010.
Yeah, tenure is a hell of a drug. You'll find this kind of thing at most major institutions though.

It's a cold calculus, but for UC it's a lot cheaper to spend ~200k a year keeping this guy quietly sequestered in a retirement laboratory, than to go through a public and messy tenured dismissal that'd throw everything into the limelight and probably damage their reputation to the tune of millions for years to come.
Yes lol
Money - it’s making many people rich.
Absolutely insane. I assume he was tenured as multiple of the RMPs suggest faculty was trying to get rid of him. Crazy to me that he taught a class on alternative cancer theories and taught students that HIV & AIDS were not connected. Researching here is one thing, but the fact that he was allowed to teach that to students blows my mind. That would be a GSI and student nightmare.
is tenure legally protected? why can't carol christ just fire him? apologies if this is a stupid question.
Fr. Absolutely BS that Berkeley still employs people like this. Can't tell if him or John Yoo, who literally wrote the Torture Manuals used post 9/11 are worse. Can't find it now but there used to be a literal page on the Berkeley Law site defending the fact that he's still employed.
Tenure is a legally protected contract. I guess tenured faculty can be fired if they commit a crime (e.g. harassment, embezzlement), but not for something that may technically be viewed as falling under academic freedom... regardless of humanitarian consequences.
Was hoping someone would mention Yoo. Although maybe ""idiot"" is less apt than ""just fucking evil"" for that guy.
Jesus Christ, this is the number one public university?"
