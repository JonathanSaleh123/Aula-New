Art 8 with Anne Walsh?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ja67di/art_8_with_anne_walsh/,2020-10-12 21:04:22,I'm a senior planning to take Art 8 next semester and was wondering if anyone knows if this is an easy class? Is she a good professor? Can I get by with no art experience?,"I'm taking it rn and I like it! as a disclaimer, I don't know how well I'm doing exactly because none of the major assignments have been graded, but it is supposed to be a pretty chill class. the professor posts 1-2 lectures to watch weekly and you spend the 4 hours of studio time (weekly) discussing the lecture and any other topics that come up. there are 3 major projects throughout the semester, so you'll work on them and have a couple of critique days where you go through and look at everyone's work and talk about it (it's fun and pretty lowkey) and there's weekly-ish mini assignments. I wrote a lot of things but tbh it shouldn't be any more than 2 hrs of outside studio time most of the time, but you can put in more if you want to get into your projects. 

the GSI emphasized in the beginning that it's okay if you don't have art experience; most of the class is art practice or similar majors but it's not a necessity. I haven't interacted with the professor much but overall I'd recommend the class if you're looking for something that's not too intense.
Hi! I was looking for a class to take next semester, how was art 8 w/prof Walsh for OP?
Thanks a lot for replying! Sounds like a fun class, I'm definitely going to sign up if there's still room!
Hi, Art 8 was one of the easiest As I got at Berkeley. However, I had to take it online, so it may be a bit different. 

Anne would lecture once a week and twice a week was with the GSI. Your time in section is where you do all your work.

There were 3 main art projects and you have to give one presentation on an artist you researched and it must be 10 mins. 

You don't need any art skill at all. YOU MUST PARTICIPATE.

They don't post your grade all semester, but if you stay engaged and participate, you should have no problem getting an A.
Thanks for the info!!! That helps a lot
No problem! Good luck!"
Art + lit breadth and philosophy + values breadth,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pxdyti/art_lit_breadth_and_philosophy_values_breadth/,2021-09-28 12:34:13,"Does anyone have any course recommendations to fulfill these breadths? I've been thinking about taking art 12: drawing foundations or art 8: intro to visual thinking and philos 132: philosophy of mind or pbhlth 101: a sustainable world - challenges and opportunities, any thoughts? Kenyatta Hinkle is teaching art 13, Anne Walsh for art 8, Marlon Maus for pbhlth 101, and Geoffrey Lee for philos 132.","I heard Music 26ac is really easy, but it's only offered in the Fall so if you need to get your arts + lit requirement by the end of spring then rip :/
im in histart 10 and love it! fulfills art&lit
What time is your registration? 

PbHlth 101 is chill
It's also offered over the summer if that's an option, was very very chill (did that myself)
9 am on the first day of phase 1
The 11th? 

You can definitely get into PbHlth 101 and art 8 or 12. Don’t know much about 12, but 8 is chill, high key boring, but chill
is pbhlth interesting and do you actually get to make any art in art 8? what’s the workload like in both?"
