Physics 7A Professor (Fall 2023),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ucrkl/physics_7a_professor_fall_2023/,2023-05-28 15:14:41,"Hi,

The professors for Physics 7A in the fall are Ronnie Spitzer and Oskar Hallatschek. Does anyone have experience with either of these professors or a recommendation on which one to take the class with?","by the end of physics 7a with Ronnie spitzer, i felt violated, her exams were hard, but the curve was nice. do the homework questions and do Lee's practice midterms because she pulls the pictures for her exams from lee's past exams.
Ronnie was my lab instructor for Physics 5BL. I don't have much experience with Hallatschek, but I can undoubtedly recommend Ronnie."
Rate my schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15f2yar/rate_my_schedule/,2023-07-31 22:14:31,"Does this seem doable? For reference, I got a B+ in 61a and took an algebra-based physics class in high school. I've also self-studied the discrete math portion of 70.

Does anyone have experience with stat 33b? Also can someone send me a recent syllabus for BioE 114? The last syllabus on TBP is from a covid semester.

Rather tough but doable. Would recommend taking an easier schedule, probably swap out a technical with a breadth.
this is definitely going to be a grind if you go through with it
Is it doable, yes. 
Is it going to be tough, yes. 
Your going to be in straight grind mode the whole semester."
