best english r1a teachers??,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cagyg7/best_english_r1a_teachers/,2019-07-07 22:24:06,"which teacher do you recommend for english r1a? Katherine Ding, Jennifer Cho, or Andrew Barbour? and why? thank you!","Barbour is the GOAT. Very relaxed class and gave most of the kids an A or A-. Def take him if you can.
I had Jennifer Cho for R1B, she's super nice, relaxed and really cares about the students learning and improving writing. I assume there would be a similar experience in R1A. Super fair grader, although the class was at times slightly boring. Depends on the topic tho"
