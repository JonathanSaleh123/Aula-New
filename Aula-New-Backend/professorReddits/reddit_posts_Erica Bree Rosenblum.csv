ESPM 152 Textbook copy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s7m5es/espm_152_textbook_copy/,2022-01-19 01:16:08,"Does anyone perhaps have a copy/ecopy of the Global Change Biology textbook by Erica Bree Rosenblum? It's so expensive and I can't find a free PDF :,/","would like to know as well
Hey! Can I ask how you ended up liking this class? Need an elective and thinking about this. I am from school of public health with interest in climate change/ environmental science.
libgen is your friend
I ended up dropping it early on and switching to ESPM 101A! I really preferred how 101A was taught (less textbook, more thought-provoking discussion) and the professor was really kind (not sure if he still teaches it). So can’t give you much info on 152 but I’m sure both are fine (easy) classes for climate change/ES. 
not for this book"
