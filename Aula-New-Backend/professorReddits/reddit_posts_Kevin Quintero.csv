How bad is this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/u59pqr8rreaa1.jpg,2023-01-05 22:28:04,,"better pack a lunch for tues/thurs
Thatâ€™s a huge L.

At least I only have classes back to back for 7 hours straight on one day of the week.

Probably better than having 2 long days of classes
Fellow BioE here, we have it horrible this semester :')
You gotta do some calorie loading before that huge block on Tuesday and Thursday. I guess that's what Monday's for.
A ziplock bag of trial mix from Trader Joeâ€™s for Tues/Thurs. Convenient, tasty, nutritious, calorie dense, and quick snack. Best of luck ðŸ¤ž
This is bad advice; however if you think you can still survive without going to discussions, I would skip some of them if they are not mandatory
â€¦ there goes your social life. Extra curricularsâ€¦ And sleepâ€¦ who needs it? Good luck though
Weâ€™re in Chem 3A & 3AL together, do you wanna start an early study group!?

You caaan dooo ittt!!!
I do all of my classes back-to-back-to-back on Tues/Thurs because I have a full time job and that's the least disruptive to my schedule. Honestly I dig it. I'd way rather have to hustle and focus and only be on campus two days a week.
I took first semester organic w/ lab, first semester calc based physics, first semester multi, and an easy elective a semester. It was hard, but I got all A's, I had a girlfriend, and I was in ok shape. The one thing is it was at community college, so maybe without the girlfriend and/or dropping exercise you could do it?
You are going to be so sore after every Tuesday and Thursday.
agree with everyone that tues/thu looks really hardâ€” just want to add that educ 182ac was an amazing class and even though itâ€™s an 8am, you should absolutely show up! i learned so much in that class and lisa is a super engaging professor :)
You might wanna drop out after a couple of months of this torture. Best of luck, and remember to eat some protein bars and fruit during those long days
Ngl, id simply kms
I actually had a pretty similar schedule last semester. Youre going to be exhasuted on tuesday and thursday! I found myself not doing studying/hw on those long days but doing a lot on the shorter days, so if thats something youre fine doing then its managebale. Ive had a pretty heavy load every semseter and it definitely takes a toll on me and usually cased some burn out in the middle of the semester.  math 53 isnt rough but physics might take a bit of time. i just finished the physics 5 series and it definitely took the most time in my schedule each semester.
Take 170 with it
Drop 3al for me. Pretty please?

it fine
Seems like a pretty hefty load
that 3A lecture is gonna go hard trust
Kevin is a good gsi, that class will be fine. Everything else, youâ€™re royally fucked
Well itâ€™s not good
horrific
i think we might have the same math class and section lol. kudos to you if you can manage this schedule and i wish you the best of luck!
Yeah ðŸ˜…
So true ðŸ˜‚. Do you have a similar schedule?
Yeah, I was already thinking about skipping math discussions (besides when there is quizzes). I think I do better self-teaching myself math anyways
Iâ€™m down. Iâ€™ll PM you my instagram!
Thanks :)
And I do pack a lunch lol!
Thatâ€™s kind of what I had in mind too! But I originally was on chem lab waitlist for Wednesday, and planned to go home on Friday evening and come back mondays
Also, Ochem is by faaar the most work. For me it was over 50% of time spent studying, and the stuff you learn first semester is so important for second.
This is nice to know. Iâ€™ve been studying Ochem and multivariable on khan academy and other Berkeley professorâ€™s notes. I also took algebra-based physics in high school, so hopefully it will help with 7A. Thanks for sharing!
Educ 182 seems like such an interesting class! Do you remember what the workload was like?
Thatâ€™s what I plan on doing. Grind hw on Monday and Wednesday , and just really pay attention to lectures/ lab on the other days. Do you think math 53 discussion section was helpful?
Iâ€™m still staying open to premed, but leaning towards comp bio / biotech industry. I guess Iâ€™ll have a better idea after seeing how I do in Ochem haha
Fellow bioE junior here who had this schedule, you will die
yeah agree with the other commenter â€” workload really wasnâ€™t too bad, most of the work is reading and a few papers, which are generally pretty straightforward if you keep up. and my discussions tended to be more interactive/activity-based but that depends on the gsi you get
It depends on how your prof outlines discussions. My prof had discussion twice a week with a quiz on the second day each week. If you have a good gsi then the discussions should compliment the course material nicely. I took 54 concurrently and found 54 discussion a waste of time but skipping 53 seemed to lower my understanding so it's dependent on the gsi tbh. Good luck! Discussions are what you make of it
That schedule's rough with ochem in it. Good luck, though! You got this!
Any advice? ðŸ˜„
Pray pray and then pray again. In all seriousness, I would mostly study for Chem 3A by doing every problem set once throughout the week and once before an exam as itâ€™s the only class where actually studying will nearly guarantee you an A (though I had Professor Robak). Math 53 and physics 7A are all up to what type of question you get on the test/if youâ€™re confident with the concept.
Did you find math 53 discussions helpful?
They were useless for me. Book helped a lot
second half of math 53 was A LOT harder so if youâ€™re the same as me then you might be able to settle a lil bit into your schedule for the first few weeks without yet having to worry about math 53 yet"
