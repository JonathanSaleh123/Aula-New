Has anyone taken STAT 134 with Vadim Gorin or STAT 133 with Gaston Sanchez Trujillo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17fnv9e/has_anyone_taken_stat_134_with_vadim_gorin_or/,2023-10-24 14:27:26,Has anyone taken STAT 134 with Vadim Gorin or STAT 133 with Gaston Sanchez Trujillo? (or other classes with them and knows if they're good professors). I'm not a stats major (I'm applied math and CS) and haven't taken a stats class since high school so leaning towards stat 133 since it seems much easier content-wise. ,"i also need to know how vadim is  as a prof, taking 134 in spring 😭🙏
sanchez is a dry af lecturer, thank the gods you don't have lucas for 134..
So anybody has an experience with vadim gorin,,
Stat 133 will be easier for sure but it is also not a well-run class (at least as of 4 years ago, unsure how much has changed)
Ur not a stats major, so why even take Stat 133 unless u need units or something or tryna learn R from scratch, data100 is basically >= 133, it’s more so j a computing class. Stat 134 is where u learn all the important stats content.
When you took the class, did Sanchez teach? And also, when you say the class is not well-run, what parts of the class did you think could be improved?"
