"Berkeley law professors signed a letter objecting to the recall of Judge Aaron Persky over his lenient sentence in the Brock Turner sexual assault case. Berkeley signatories include Professors Daniel Farber, Herma Hill Kay, Christopher Kutz, Jonathan Simon, Charles Weisselberg, and Franklin Zimring.",http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_30176987/brock-turner-leading-law-school-professors-issue-letter,2016-07-29 20:23:14,,">>This poses a serious threat to the rule of law. Naked political pressure of this kind risks undermining the very foundation of dispassionate, independent judgment upon which all criminal convictions and sentences depend for their legitimacy. If disappointed litigants can influence the outcomes of future cases by unseating judges who rule against their interests, the administration of justice quickly falls into the hands of the wealthy, special interest groups, and anyone who wants to launch a political action committee on the heels of media coverage of a controversial case.

Nailed it. I absolutely think the sentencing was abhorrent and far too lenient. However their point is extremely valid and important. 

Also mildly related: if you want judges who make decisions that you think aren't complete bullshit, **VOTE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS**!! Presidents do jack shit for your life compared to local politicians (look at how the city of Berkeley fucks students over a la large housing restrictions, etc.). People have no idea about what's on the ballot this November (including a myriad of local ordinances, such as 40+ in SF). Be informed and vote locally as well. For example, since no one votes in local elections, Wisconsin elected a judge to their **Supreme Court** who wrote a position paper stating that people with AIDS should be killed! Don't let this happen. 

To be short: **VOTE IN AND BE INFORMED OF YOUR LOCAL ELECTIONS. SHIT LIKE THIS WON'T HAPPEN, YOU LAZY FUCKS!!!**

Ok end soapbox"
