David Card wins Nobel in Economics,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q5sjz5/david_card_wins_nobel_in_economics/,2021-10-11 03:02:52,Pretty cool,"Congrats, Dr. Card! 

I think we are going to need more Nobel Laureate parking spots... (It's weird but amazing that I can say this unironically, lol.)
Man when I had Dr. Card in undergrad everyone talked about how he was due for a Nobel.  Super happy for him!

Current Cal Prof. David Card and Former Cal Prof. Guido Imbens win the 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics,https://i.redd.it/lkj2n1bhpss71.jpg,2021-10-11 03:08:10,,"yo professors gotta chill
I wonder what‚Äôs the maximum number of parking passes the campus had handed out in a given year.
My mom was so happy to read this news today and she was genuinely so proud that her kid is a Cal Bear. üò≠
Wonder how this will be played on Fox News?  (Card = Labor Economics)  LOL!

From Card and Krueger's book:

>David Card and Alan B. Krueger have already made national news with their pathbreaking research on the minimum wage. Here they present a powerful new challenge to the conventional view that higher minimum wages reduce jobs for low-wage workers. In a work that has important implications for public policy as well as for the direction of economic research, the authors put standard economic theory to the test, using data from a series of recent episodes, including the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990-91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In each case they present a battery of evidence showing that increases in the minimum wage lead to increases in pay, but no loss in jobs."
Papa Hilfy & Hug; so wholesome,https://i.redd.it/mni1nz4yhzt81.png,2022-04-16 17:33:48,,"Awww!!! How cute :)

Man, we are losing so many good profs this year. Nick Weaver, Paul Hilfiger, David Card, etc. Glad I‚Äôve gotten to take their classes before graduation.

bruh u just jacked my post lol
Im switching to DS
That necklace do look nice
This is the best picture I've seen on this sub. Thank you Professor Hilfinger for everything.
wait David Card is leaving??
Wait, these legends are leaving?
[deleted]
Is Hilfiger retiring? Is anyone throwing him a party? I took basically the whole CS curriculum from him.
Well Hug is the CS61B Successor so close enough
Is this the same Nobel prize winning David card?? Sorry I‚Äôm not as familiar
Idk if he is leaving, but this is his last semester teaching.
Hilfiger is retiring after this sem
Yea
He‚Äôs not teaching 142 anymore?? Where was this released???
Damn that‚Äôs sad
He told us in 142 class this semester."
Check out Data 88E!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s4sflh/check_out_data_88e/,2022-01-15 11:44:44,"https://preview.redd.it/b555wzqrnwb81.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=33124aefa204758939d7f9279b6ace0a9b414fce

Hey everyone! If you‚Äôre looking for a 2 unit class at the intersection of data science and economics, check out Data 88E.

Data 88E: Economics Models examines economics concepts using data science methods and techniques with real-world datasets. Through the use of Python and Jupyter, the class re-examines fundamental economic concepts and surveys economics subdomains such as financial economics, macroeconomic policy, and econometrics. The class will also feature guest lecturers from industry and academia who will show how they apply concepts discussed in this class to their jobs and research. Previous guest lecturers have included nobel laureate David Card as well as speakers from Goldman Sachs and Harvard University.

This course also fulfills the lower division requirement for Data Science major‚Äôs Economics domain emphasis!","[deleted]

Took this class this semester and was super rewarding!! Definitely recommend
Do you need to be enrolled in data 8 to take this class?
[deleted]
u/Shadowfingersss Hello, I just enroll in the class, kind of late. What should I do now?
Absolutely, seems very reasonable to me!
Data 8 is a corequisite, so it is recommended you are taking data 8 either before or at the same as this class. However, if you have other relevant cs/ds experience (such as cs61a), you can email instructor Van Dusen and he can approve you for the class!
absolutely, the course has no Econ prerequisites at all!
[deleted]
Would stat 20 and Econ 140 be ok?
[deleted]
Ofcourse, I hope you enjoy your first semester!
Absolutely, please email professor Van Dusen and he‚Äôll approve you to join the class!
Not at all! Only data 8 or any equivalent programming experience is necessary

Ofcourse, I hope you enjoy the course :)"
The Killer: ME Major‚Äôs Take,https://i.redd.it/xj71injm2zzb1.jpg,2023-11-12 11:56:47,"‚ÄúIf you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you,‚Äù remarks Michael Fassbender as The Killer in David Fincher‚Äôs long-awaited return to cinema. The Killer is chock full of these bite-sized commentaries and philosophical musings that would hang nicely next to framed ‚Äúart‚Äù like ‚ÄúLive. Laugh. Love.‚Äù Enduring boredom, you say? Hmm, how fitting. 

In the patois of the nihilistic, Fassbender describes professional killing as tedious work. Funny that Fincher chose a script whose theme best mirrors his on-set directorial style. Fincher is famous, or infamous (depending on whom you interview) for doing hundreds of takes to get a scene. I imagine that could be tedious too. Hell, maybe the opening dialogue is Fassbender on a hot mic and they just kept it.

It must be said that I worship at the altar of David Fincher.  A filmography that consists of works like The Game, Seven, Fight Club, The Social Network, Zodiac, Mank, Mindhunter, and House of Cards puts him squarely at legend status. I also fan-boy over Fassbender too. Despite my biases, the movie is just plain boring. The plot is as simple as it is predictable. It‚Äôs a mix of Day of the Jackal and John Wick, minus all the things that made those films compelling. Just because the ‚Äúhero‚Äù waxes about tedium doesn‚Äôt mean we, the audience, want to wallow in it. 10 minutes of Fassbender opening a van door, closing a van door, looking in the van, driving the van, washing the van, dropping the keys off for the van‚Ä¶ (I think you get the point) becomes a bit much and we get six chapters of it. 

The movie is action-lite, with only one major (and intense) fight sequence and an escape scene or two. This approach would be refreshing if the idea was to substitute gratuitous action for layered suspense.  We don‚Äôt get that. We get Peter Seller‚Äôs Being There with a gun. 

My final disappointment ends with the music. I have loved every collaboration of Fincher and Trent Reznor but The Killer‚Äôs score is made second-chair to constant needle-drops of The Smiths. I also love The Smiths but again‚Ä¶ the repetition.  I have been waiting ages for Fincher and Fassbender to do a great film again and it seems I‚Äôm going to have to wait a while longer. How tedious.",Still not as good as flushed away tbh
