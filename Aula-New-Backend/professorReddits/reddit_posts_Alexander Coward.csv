I know that EE has already tried to internalize the ""necessary"" mathematics for their majors in new class offerings with what I think are universally agreed to be disastrous results. 
Basically the guy didn't teach math conventionally, passionately stood up for what he believed in, and now he's raising hell over getting fired. I wish I had the courage to be a Coward.
That was interesting.
He's a Professor of the Internet Generation.

He's positioning himself.
He's starting a ""new movement"".
He's taught all around the world for short periods of time.
[His Resume tells a lot]
He's written in knot theory.
That alone tells me a lot.
Born in 1982, he's 33 years old.
He does things his own way.
You'll see him on the Science channel within the next 5 years and he will be a celebrity Mathematician. Just watch.
If he doesn't have a book already, he will.
He's gaming the system to his advantage.
I kinda admire that.
What kind of department norms are people so angry about? Are the things he does outside of them so outrageous that it warrants him getting fired?
But how will I know who to be angry at if somebody doesn't tell me!?
[deleted]
He doesn't assign homework, apparently (explains the good student reviews, maybe)

Also, he wasn't fired. His contract wasn't renewed
He doesn't grade homework, and his class averages are wonky (lots of Fs).  
Shit like this is why I don't trust voters.
Solution: use the extra money to hire lecturers to teach the preponderance of lower div math classes. It's clear that research-focused profs don't have the time or energy to teach several hundred students. Why make them?
He also gives really easy exams
In education, that's what most people would call firing.
I think none of the lower div math classes are requiring homework this semester due to lack of funding, or at least that's how it is in Math 54.
[deleted]
Each department gets X funded faculty positions. That number is determined by a lot of things, but generally if you bring in loads of research grants, that'll work. If you have huge student demand for that major, that does as well. Math generally does neither of those things, but because everyone wants their students to learn basic math, the math department gets disproportionate funding. If they could hire adjuncts to do that job, they'd lose a bunch of tenured positions. 
One of the points he made though was his students do better on future courses.
Exactly. It's just how firing works for professors. 
They should absolutely teach. I had many fantastic teachers for upper div and graduate courses. I'm just not convinced of the utility of having them teach freshmen and sophomores who, for the most part, probably don't want to be in those classes. 

If the situation was truly that the math dept asked for more money to better teach these lower divs then they should have plowed all of it into hiring good lecturers, instead of what they probably did, which was hire more tenure-track professors
His students in one section did better from math 1a to 1b by half a letter grade. How does that translate towards people who take further math classes after that or other technical classes we don't know. In his grievance report the increased grades were noted as promising but not statistically significant, so it's not clear cut that this way is better, and is against the desires of the dept which he was made aware of and choose not to address adequately.
Not at all; read random resumes which have ""lecturer"" on them. It's rare to have a lecturer position for more than 2 years.
Also some of the comments stated he didn't properly explain a concept and he just kind of showed how the problem would be solved. The example I'm referring to was about how a (dy / dx) dx = dy.
> In his grievance report the increased grades were noted as promising but not statistically significant

To be fair, the statistical analysis was simply done incorrectly. Coward pointed this out and many others have agreed with him.

The chair of the statistics department who did the analysis is to blame, but in his defense he most likely wasn't given the full context of the problem. His approach makes sense if you're just told to compare three sections of a class, but not if you're asked to compare different teachers (who may each have more than one section, as was Coward's case).
Loads of non-tenure track full-time positions. I don't recall ""lecturer"" being a super common job title in the US, but I imagine it might be the norm in some places. 
Even then the result is just a slight increase with sample size of only one year of students to the class directly after it. It's not exactly earth shattering results.
I really doubt that's true, especially at top institutions. Certainly some departments have permanent lecturer positions, but in math departments at top institutions, if you're not in the running for tenured professorship, you do not last for more than 5ish years.

And even if I were wrong, one thing that has been lost in the translation, is that AC was the first lecturer at UC Berkeley math department, ever. The position itself, regardless of whomever filled it, was experimental!
I do agree with you. He's exaggerating how much better his results are.
[76% of all instructional staff positions in the US are now held by contingent faculty.](http://www.aaup.org/issues/contingency/background-facts) The tenure-track position is the outlier today, not the part-time or full-time non-tenured one. 

Having said that, you're right that the Mathematics department at Berkeley hasn't relied on contingent faculty in this way yet, but that's not what I was saying. I was just commenting that seeing someone who's been a ""lecturer"" for more than two years isn't a particularly weird occurrence or indicative of a person who was on the tenure track and then was fired. TT professors aren't called lecturers in the US -- this is a term that almost certainly means contingent faculty, who may have that job for 30 years with no year to year security at all.
Yeah, but you can look at the CVs of professors/instructors at Harvard, Stanford, etc. There's no such thing as an old lecturer/untenured faculty member. Why? Because lecturers leave those departments shortly, either for better positions or for industry.

And yes, I agree I have no idea what happens at other institutions after say the top 20, and I'm certain you are right - though I would still be skeptical that there are many lecturers who are allowed to remain at a single institution for more than 2-5 years. Probably it's simply a lot of different people filling those 76% of positions, not the same old lecturers hanging around.

Edit: Actually I'm not sure what anyone is saying anymore, but my point is, I would not use the word ""fired"" to describe what happened to AC, because that implies there was an expectation that his contract would be renewed. To the contrary, lecturer/assistant professorship positions at top universities rarely last longer than 2-5 years.
Lecturer *maybe*. I, like you, expect the retention rate of contingent faculty to be low. But assistant professors are on the tenure track. Outside of Harvard, which has a notorious failure rate in their process, every single assistant professor in the US is being hired in the hope that they'll be tenured in 6-7 years. 

But yes, we do seem to have ventured a bit from the topic. "
"Campus math lecturer Alexander Coward sues UC regents, alleges wrongful termination",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/01/24/campus-math-lecturer-alexander-coward-sues-uc-regents/,2016-01-24 17:14:29,,"> Coward alleged that the defendants “(caused) excessive internal and external publication of defamation” in the eyes of members of the community and Coward’s colleagues in the mathematics department. 

Wasn't he the one who started the drama and wrote most of the stuff? I don't remember the other side publishing anything defamatory aimed at him.
lol the student body turned on him within 2 months lol
Correct me if I'm wrong, but since he doesn't have continuing status, they don't have any obligation to give him teaching...
This is still a thing? I thought it died down months ago 
I was with the guy when he first came out with what happened but the more it dragged on the more it seemed like he just wanted the attention. 
I haven't heard about him in a while. Can anyone fill me in on why the student community has apparently turned on him?
lol he has no case
Yeah but this totally isn't about him cashing out right? Totally about the students right?
[me irl](http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif)
this is going nowhere, dead case
[Narcisstic Personality Disorder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder)
From what I remember, basically people took his side at first. But things slowly got crazier. He would continually publish more and more stuff essentially shit talking the math department and his colleagues. More and more it came across as whining, especially when the math department refused to comment (as per campus policy iirc). Cowards claims became more and more extreme while meanwhile more and more students, course staff, etc. came forward and basically said maybe he wasn't Jesus christ our Lord and savior himself (I never had him as a teacher so I don't have an opinion but some people did act like this). Stories came out about him constantly clashing with other faculty in the department. Coward portrayed this as him trying to reform the system but I think many people saw him as hard to work with. Apparently many people in the student body didn't like him as much as his reputation seemed to indicate. I also remember a grad student on this subreddit describing him as arrogant, for example, refusing to help with exam grading, which apparently professors normally do. 

Ultimately the University had no obligation to renew his contract and chose not to, which is significantly different from being ""fired"" in the normal sense. 

I may have gotten some of the details wrong, so don't take my word as gospel or anything, but this is roughly what I remember happening. 
There's a subset of the Berkeley population which likes to get up in arms first and ask questions later.

People didn't so much turn on him as find out he had no real case to begin with.
Keep in mind, he became famous by writing a letter about how he wouldn't support his coworkers in their own labor dispute with the university. 

Now, the shoe is on the other foot, and he's crying like a baby. 
Oh the irony is killing me. I thought he was unauthentic from the moment I read his letter two years ago, he's just so full of himself.
What clued you in? A manifesto for selfishness disguised as a memo from Dead's Poet Society and Jerry McGuire?

""If you guys were older, you'd understand why I'm suggesting you not help people less fortunate than yourselves.""

But now.... ""Help me! Help me!""

Too bad.... Most people didn't notice how bad his letter was, and he could have easily fallen upwards. Now, who would want to hire him? There are plenty of other mathematicians from Berkeley who are less whiny. I know that, because some of them have worked for me. 
If you'd like to hire a non-whiny math person from Berkeley I am available. 10/10 guaranteed no manifestos about how you bully me."

"Daily Cal on Alexander Coward activism: The fact that students have so quickly and adamantly latched onto this one-sided story reveals the hypocrisy in much of UC Berkeley students' activism: support of popular, trendy causes appearing to buck the system without facts to back up the rhetoric.",http://www.dailycal.org/2015/10/16/blowing-the-whistle-on-the-whistle-blower/,2015-10-16 09:33:44,,"I can't imagine why the UC Berkeley Math Department would be wary of professors who like writing manifestos
I can't say I know much about the cowardgate, I read his letters and data dumps. He made some pretty bold claims, but provided what looked like evidence that was not disputed by the university. (IE. python code backing his statistical interpretation). I also understand the university claims not to be able to comment on most of this.

Its interesting to me that the campus newspaper advices students to ""to find causes about which they are truly passionate, which aren’t necessarily the ones accessible on social media.""

This article seems to do everything it can to advice students to stay away from coward. It claims that ""we don’t have enough of the facts to come to any such conclusions.""  but makes no comments about anything coward has said. I think its disingenuous to just announce, its all one sided there is no evidence without evaluating the plausibility of this mans claims. I think its telling that the university hasn't denied anything.  This is Berkeley, do we not have a statistician capable of authoritatively answering his charges ?

The article claims students should stay away because they 'have never taken a class with him'. I don't actually see why this is relevant at all. Every student here has an interest in management practices produce the best teachers. If the university is perpetrating injustice against talent, or honestly , anyone, students are stakeholders and member's of the university are entitled to speak. Specially in a case against talent.

The article pushes students to avoid causes that make UCB look bad, and instead pursue a variant of that cause that doesn't single out UCB. And Cynically, is even politically unobtainable. It really feels like the paper is a shill for the administrations opinion begging students to leave it in the alone with claims this is all ""social media activism"".  The students who wrote it, didn't even put therename on it. It ""Editorials represent the collective opinion of the Senior Editorial Board as written by the opinion editor."". Who is that???
It's called slacktivism
It's fucking hilarious that the *Daily Cal* of all institutions is calling students out for pursuing activist causes. Talk about extreme lack of self awareness. 
Kind of interesting how the subreddit was overwhelmingly in support of Coward last week, and this week is overwhelmingly rebuking that support.
[deleted]
That was slick! Had a good chuckle
I wonder how many people have no idea what you are talking about.
The senior editorial staff is listed [here](http://www.dailycal.org/about) (scroll down a bit). Also, I think it's quite unfair to say that the Daily Cal editorials push students away from causes that make Berkeley look bad given that literally a few days ago they had an editorial criticizing the administration over its handling of the Geoff Marcy situation.
> The article pushes students to avoid causes that make UCB look bad, and instead pursue a variant of that cause that doesn't single out UCB.

The article does not do this at all.
The university has no reason to comment, they have nothing to gain from it, and they're not going to do just because students like coward.
Wait, why is this hilarious? The Daily Cal has certainly published a lot of op-eds that call for activism but I think the actual editorials written by the actual editorial staff (as opposed to op-eds which are written by third parties) are generally tempered and moderate.
The point is not that students are pursuing activist causes, it's that students are doing so without thinking.  We have only ever heard Coward's tale of events, which are bound to make it look like he's been wronged.  We have no idea what the math department thinks, and we should certainly hear them out (though it is taking quite a while for them to say anything). 

As a parallel, would you be supportive of activists pushing to ban vaccines because they cause autism?
I think the regulars are much more likely to be skeptical then the people who got linked here in the fervor.
Yeah the idea that there wasn't a huge math dept conspiracy such a contrarian view
The Unabomber was (briefly) an assistant professor in the UC Berkeley math department.
Well with myself being one of those people, what's this about? 
I looked already. The opinion editor is ""Holly Secon"" who is a cal alumni it appears. I still think its interesting she didn't sign her name but instead her job tittle. The op eds are signed with names. 

You could be right, it could simply be university students defending the administration. Even if it is just the opinion editor, her defense seems not well formed. It feels like a combination of ""there's no evidence to discuss ""  and ""this is lame, your not real activists, you should be active about REAL things"". 

I don't think the criticism over Marcy is compelling. University had is 'trial' and said there wasn't enough evidence to issue a disciplinary action. Cynically, the criticism even serves them. They claim their hands are tied because they don't the power to do anything. And we all know how to fix that. 
""What would be valuable is advocacy on behalf of all lecturers, not just ad hominem arguments for and against faculty members and the leveraging of one’s popularity.""

The article spends a while saying the coward activists arn't real activists but instead ""social media activists"", then suggests the lecturer cause without coward as better.


[They tend to avoid confrontation](https://youtu.be/zqjQDP9KX6E)
Do they really have nothing to gain?

They have a reputation to maintain, and someone is accusing them of pretty serious charges. Why doesn't the teacher whose statistical interpretation was attacked defend it ? Why don't third party statisticians step in and mediate ? The university may not be able to say we are not renewing the contract with coward because of his imcompetance, but can someone in a way that is not speaking on why coward will not be renewed, discuss the statistical interpretations?  
Unabomber reference
I think almost all newspaper editorials are signed by the entire editorial staff rather than the individual authors. (See [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/opinion/a-grim-decision-on-afghanistan.html?ref=topics&_r=0) for example.) That's just how newspapers work.

I don't want to get into a discussion of the editorials actual validity right now, but I really don't think that the Daily Cal is just a shill for the administration. I've been reading it on a regular basis for several years now and the Daily Cal has its own independent voice (not that I necessarily always agree with them of course).

Finally, I honestly don't understand your point about Marcy. I see no way in which the Daily Cal publishing an editorial criticizing the administration (along very similar lines as many other students) serves the administration. Yes, the administration has made the argument that their hands were tied. But its not like the Daily Cal's editorial buttresses this argument in any way.
Also, I'm not sure what makes you think Holly Secon is an alumni. Her LinkedIn page lists here as being in the class of 2017.
Well overall as an employer minimizing comments on employee relations is almost always the best way to go, but in this specific case coward has no leg to stand on. As a contracted employee he has no reasonable expectations to be rehired, so the university needs to give no reason for not doing so. As for his claims against the math dept, most people involved with the dept realize how outlandish his claims are, at the math peer advising session I went to yesterday everyone openly made fun of him for trying to claim he was being fired for being too good of a teacher. This incident and its notoriety will die down in a few weeks, the high praise of the math dept has been built over decades and won't be changed by the questionable words of a single disgruntled lecturer.
> Do they really have nothing to gain?

They have a lot to lose in lawsuits, and a lot of time to figure things out still.
Ah thanks mate
I think it makes the case that more needs to be done while the university makes the case that there is nothing we can do.
> Holly Secon

I thought she was because he linkedIn lists her as ""Cal Alumni Student Association"" but your right about under that being probably a better indicator of her undergrad status.
I agree with you somewhat.  I thought it was not quite right to say he was 'fired'. They have no obligation to recontract. 

But, his enrolment statistics, student reviews, faculty reviews and subsequent performance of his students are very compelling evidence for his narrative.  The man claims to have the highest student reviews of all time. 

I'd like to hear the university or several statistics professors say  his statistical interpretations are flawed. Or I'd like to here them say, we are letting him go for something no one has mentioned, that we can't comment on that is unrelated to his excellent performance as a teacher.
Stating any reason in particular opens up the university to potential liability where they had none and could easily be misconstrued to just provide more fuel for the fire.

His evidence shows he was be a good lecturer, not that he was let go for being one.
> we are letting him go for something no one has mentioned, that we can't comment on that is unrelated to his excellent performance as a teacher

There's been a lot of reasons floating around that are plausible explanations for why he isn't being rehired, and almost none of them have to do with student ratings. Anyone who stops and thinks about it realizes that there's a lot being left out because we're only hearing one side. 

[Also I believe one of the other math professors straight-up said something](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/11230026_10101328767456529_7918446921085968996_n.jpg?oh=d5d3d131627c0c1f81866f77b1f7cfdf&oe=56D224B0) - (from [this post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/berkeleyclassof2018/permalink/1643179372620452/)).
As far as I can tell, not a lawyer, the university can say ANYTHING it wants about coward. It may be liable for defemation or libel or those things are untrue. Which is why I can imagine them not saying much. The university could come out and completely confirm his story - say his statistics and evaluations are 100% great, unfortunately we are letting him go for something unrelated. It would build some credibility. Right now he is slamming them with a combination of they are lying , and incapable of statistics. The elephant in the room is his performance statistics. Somebody address that. 
I think Coward answered that charge when he asked ""What does it mean to adhere to department norms when one preforms better than the department"".  If the reason they are not contracting him again is because he doesn't adhere to dept norms and preforms better then essentially cowards charges are right.
Still, it's not worth the risk."

Are you fucking serious I knew this guy was only out for himself before, but now he's trying to get money from people? This is unreal.
Sorry but what is the purpose of waiving his confidentiality? Because his personnel files are purportedly full of faked lies and letting the public see the files for themselves will bring them to his cause?

This guy sounds like an asset as a teacher in being enthusiastic about teaching students...but he doesn't seem to have a grasp of much outside of his passion.
He isn't asking people to pay for a lawyer for him. If he can't get a lawyer to do it pro bono, he'll pay for the lawyer himself.
> or raise a pot of money to pay what is likely to be a hefty legal fee

Doesn't sound like it's coming out of his pocket to me. Plus I severely doubt he'll be able to find anyone willing to work on his wrongful termination suit where he was never actually terminated for free."

> You are hired to make stop signs, on a temporary contract which may be renewed if your performance is satisfactory. You make the stop signs bright colors such as hot pink, fluorescent yellow, etc., adapted to local preferences. Your employer tells you that you are expected to make red stop signs. You argue that your stop signs prevent more accidents because their brighter colors attract more attention, and surveys show that your stop signs are more popular than red ones. Your employer says that your stop signs are indeed very nice, but the tradition in this country is that stop signs are red. Your employer believes that unannounced color changes are in fact less safe because they confuse people, and in any case, you were hired to make stop signs according to your employer's specifications. You continue to make stop signs the way that you are convinced is best. Your employer does not renew your contract. You claim you were fired because your employer felt threatened by your superior stop signs. Really?

His response was kind of silly IMO.   Doesn't address Hutchings argument at all but instead just tries to make a thing out of the particular analogy he uses.

From what I hear about Coward from his students, I don't think he's making new and shiny stop signs as much as he's building roundabouts (or new ways to approach math). After all, don't his students still understand the concepts of math he's been hired to teach? Is the point of making a stop sign to teach drivers to associate red with stop or convey the broader message that they should be driving more safely in the area around them? Just like how roundabouts have been shown to be capable of keeping drivers safe, Coward should be able to teach if his students are learning.

I guess it didn't sound like he was pointing out that it's a bad analogy, but merely trying to say something like ""Education should be about GO-ing, not STOP-ing"".  But the comment was short so it's open to interpretation.
Do you really think if he used a ""better"" analogy coward would have actually addresses the substance instead of just trying to paint these people negatively by the virtue of them using an analogy, or should they just find new things to compare this to that he might like?
Coward didn't actually say anything. He basically said ""this is the thing you're comparing department policy to,"" and then followed it up with the punchline ""wow,"" as if that somehow invalidates the analogy.
[deleted]
Like it or not what happened is simply what happened in his analogy, he did not listen to his employer, as so was not renewed. Coward may have problems with the analogy, but he's trying to sell ""these people think of you as like a hamburger/stop sign, where I think of you as people""

While he has some leeway, as a lecturer he has to listen to the Dept, he does not get to teach however he wants"

> Dear Students of UC Berkeley,

> Here are some updates:

> 1) Thank you so much to all the Senators of the ASUC who unanimously passed a bill calling for an investigation into the matters I reported on October 11th. The most important thing right now is that there is a transparent investigation and that's exactly what the bill calls for. Everyone deserves to know exactly what's been going on inside the UC Berkeley Mathematics Department regarding teaching, especially large lower-division courses. This bill makes it more likely that that transparency will come to pass. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

> You can read the ASUS Bill that was passed last night here: 

> http://alexandercoward.com/ASUCBillUnanimous.pdf

> 2) In less good news, my Union told me today that they were no longer going to represent me. The reason they gave is because I am insisting, against the Union's advice, that the University responds to my grievance within 10 days of the grievance meeting, as set forth in the Lecturer contract. The University wants an extension.

> Why am I insisting that the University respond within the 10 days of the meeting, rather than allowing them an extension? Well, for one thing, the University has had my grievance since March 9th, which is more than half a year. That's plenty of time to answer two 'yes' or 'no' questions - am I going to be considered for renewal and are the contents of my personnel file going to be corrected? For another thing, it states on Interim Dean Philip Stark's webpage for one of his courses that:

> ""No late homework will be accepted, for any reason, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, theft, and your pet's dietary idiosyncrasies. Don't ask.""

> It seems to me that if Interim Dean Philip Stark demands that undergraduates turn in their homework on time whatever the circumstances, he should be holding himself to those same high standards.

> The Union disagrees with me about this, and they advised me to allow an extension. Maybe they are right, but I'm going with my instincts here. I'm very grateful to the Union for everything they've done for me and I don't hold their decision to not represent me against them. They are in a tight spot because they have to represent the interests of all members, and at the same time represent the interests of individuals. The necessitates a bit of horse-trading back and forth, and I guess they felt that it wasn't worth insisting on certain aspects of the contract being followed regarding me in view of the broader relationship they want to maintain with the University, especially since there's a contract re-negotiation going on right now. It makes sense.

> I'm obviously disappointed that the Union is cutting me loose for insisting of a response in a timely manner, but I'm also glad that the ASUC is standing up for me and for your education. Given the choice between this and the other way around, I'm happy about how things are.

> One consequence of me not being represented by the Union is that this matter now cannot be taken to arbitration, which is the only independently judged part of the grievance process and can only be initiated by the Union. For this reason I rate the chances of me carrying on teaching at Berkeley beyond June 2016 as quite low, certainly less than 50-50. On the other hand, I rate the chances of there being a bright light shone on the UC Berkeley Mathematics Department and there being some improvements coming about as a result as pretty high. The important thing is the later, so let's not get caught up in a distracting argument about how good of a teacher is Alexander Coward and should he stay or not. I've got other opportunities and will be fine, even though I would love to stay if possible. Instead let's focus on driving up the quality of your education by demanding some answers to some questions, starting off with this one: What exactly are department norms at the UC Berkeley Mathematics Department?

> In case there is any doubt left regarding the excuse about confidentiality, see the letter I have posted here: http://alexandercoward.com/WaivingConfidentiality.pdf

> I'll send along news of the University's response to my grievance tomorrow, when I receive it, unless, of course, they decide to breach the contract once again and not respond.

> Thanks for reading this far. Remember, just by reading this you add to transparency. Please share this with your friends. If you want to watch a Cal TV video about all this, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx5abLaE9HQ.

> Thanks again to the ASUC for taking the time to draft, debate and vote on this important Bill these last couple of weeks.

> All best wishes,

> Alexander

> I unfortunately think (and I mean this very objectively) that your chances were already zero the moment you posted all those private conversations and documents publicly. I'm surprised you were thinking otherwise.

Alexander Coward replied:

Man this guy is kind of a renegade.

Even if he leaves, I'm glad he's blowing the whistle. The department needs to be held accountable.
thank you /u/Samses94
Man who doesn't support a union job action is surprised and hurt when his union doesn't support him unequivocally. 
""It's not really what I'm optimizing for""

Could his head *be* any farther up his own ass?
> I'm very grateful to the Union for everything they've done for me and I don't hold their decision to not represent me against them.

Never does he say he is ""surprised"" or ""hurt.""  Stop making shit up.
Maybe not surprised and hurt, but you're basically right. The shoe is on the other foot here. After that email encouraging students to excuse themselves from political conscientiousness by appealing to the mere fact that they were students, it's hard to see, by his own logic, why anyone should care about Coward's complaint.
Haters gonna hate..
Obviously you don't hang out with mathematicians at all - this is how they talk, and it is kinda your fault for not being able to speak their language.
Exactly. That is the point I was trying to make. "

And I agree with them...Coward doesn't seem like someone who has realized that things are more complicated in a system as large as Berkeley's than just achieving the purity-of-teaching-and-learning.

Is it the case that the university is letting him go because he's too radical, too passionate of a teacher? Or is it because he flouts the rules in such a way that makes things more difficult for everyone else in the department? The way he crossed the strike line in 2013 --   and then wrote a self-aggrandizing massive email about it -- makes it seem as if he truly believed he's the only one who cares about teaching, as if all those assistants and staff who create the groundwork needed for a good teaching environment were just peasants and bureaucrats...It's possible he has a very narrow, self-serving view about things, back then and today.
Two more articles about Alexander Coward:

2. http://fusion.net/story/213033/coward-berkeley-letter-math-cal/
Thanks for linking the first article. I was thinking about that yesterday - about how he didn't think too much about how his actions in 2013 might be undermining the labor strikes a bit while at the same time coming out against the uni because of its labor practices that affected him. Apparently he still hasn't thought about it much since in the California article that you posted he said that he'll have to think about it some more. I still think he is right about what he wrote about the Berkeley's math department but it still seems he's kind of ignorant about the general assault on labor that's been affecting him, which has also affected the general population.

It was the planned protest to keep Coward as a lecturer. Not sure why this specific time/place. 
Viper knows
take a lick
The time was to coincide with his appeals meeting
Why was he getting fired?
elderly scale versed public nutty snails languid sort snatch chase

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
Upheaval in the department. He refuses to follow some of their norms because he believes them to be bad for students. The department obviously dislikes this. According to Coward, they don't want to be forced to raise their standards.
He's not getting fired his contract just isn't being renewed as a lecturer. It's up next semester.
