Psych 130 w/ JD Allen,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/198rs1h/psych_130_w_jd_allen/,2024-01-17 00:24:04,I‚Äôm considering on taking psych 130 or psych 156 please let me know which one is a better class ü•πThank you!,"I can‚Äôt speak on psych 156 but I took Psych 130 in fall and midterms were heavily based off memorization. At first, he‚Äôd say something wouldn‚Äôt be on the exam and it ended up being on the exam. The first midterm was the hardest, second was made easier for us and the final wasn‚Äôt too bad. I ended up getting a B+.

Also, exams were closed book, closed notes. It‚Äôs doable, but there was so much information every lecture that it became pretty overwhelming. The modules and tests we had for that class also had nothing to do with our lectures so towards the end he made it optional. Overall, he‚Äôs a good professor, but the class can get overwhelming. Lmk if you have any questions!
Professor Dacher is great. I had him for human happiness and now for human emotion. You do read a lot, but you don't need to complete any actual assignments. The study guides are so helpful and prepare you well. Like all classes, his class feels heavy, mainly during midterms/exams and finals. Other than that, you won't feel stressed or overwhelmed during the semester, though. One tip to cut down on study time is to buy the book as an audiobook. I listened to the whole book in one week.  I recommend this to everyone. Vitalsource sometimes has our course book, and you can play the reader. It saves you so much time. Added bonus is you can highlight the chapter and make flashcards. It's great for studying.
thank you so much!
Thank you so much for the advice ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
