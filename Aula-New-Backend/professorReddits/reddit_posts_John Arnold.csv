How do you study for English 45A? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/t7lvw/how_do_you_study_for_english_45a/,2012-05-04 16:11:57,"I'm a first year intended English major, and this is my first course in the 45 series. I was expecting a final paper as the final for this class, but the final exam puzzles me. 
According to Professor Arnold, our lecturer, it will have a quote/historical event and persons/lit term ID section; one ""close reading"" passage response essay, and one synthesis type essay that involves the discussion of at least two texts. 

I did most of the reading for the class (Canterbury Tales, Faerie Queen, the Tempest, The Rover, Paradise Lost, assorted sonnets and some John Donne), but is it worth re-reading them? The test is on Tuesday. If I just reviewed the timeline for the readings, the styles of the authors, and went over the themes and the general plots...shouldn't that be okay? 
TL:DR: How the heck do you study for an English 45 test? ","third year english major here, while there is variation as to the format of English finals, they will mostly all be like this. 

For the ID section, re-reading notes and re-reading the specific passages addressed should be enough, they only choose key concepts and passages that were discussed at length to have on the final. 

Close reading can again be boosted by rereading notes and picking out themes that were emphasized frequently, tie your analysis into that. 

Synthesis: draw connections between the texts based again on topics that were brought up frequently in class, the big themes that the professor emphasizes a lot tend to be the ones that show up on the finals. Also for this one, don't be afraid to reference the passage ID's from the earlier part of the text, there may be some helpful tidbits that you can quote if necessary.

Think themes and analysis over straight plot. Knowing the plot can help you to make a better analysis, but I really doubt you will get a question asking you to name characters of places from the works. 
Quotes are generally really straightforward and easy. Since you've read the books, you should be fine on that front. They won't pick anything to trick you - they're not AIMING for you to fail, after all.

Close reading will usually involve a passage talked about in class, and they'll want you to say something interesting about it. It is okay to recycle whatever the professor has said already.

Synthesis essay just means to forge some sort of connection between two or more of the texts - think major themes here, and how they might relate. It may help you to actually sketch this out before hand, looking at how major concepts like Man's relationship to God play out in Faerie Queen versus Paradise Lost, for example.

Had Arnold, but can't remember too much for what happened... Did get an A though, even after A-'s on all the papers, meaning that I must've done well on the final.

Arnold's exams aren't that bad, sounds like you have a good study plan! gypsiemagic's response is spot on. Definitely skim through some of the reading before hand, be familiar, but you should be able to pretty easily tell those writers apart, he'll ask you about key passages you've gone over in class. Good luck!
Didn't do jack shit the entire semester (including readings or attending) and got a B+ in the class.  I'm not a great test-taker either.   So, you'll be more than fine if you're even stressing about how to study for it, haha :)

You just really need to know the themes and motifs touched upon in the class. That's all they'll really ask you to elaborate on for the exam - it's nice to know the specific plot details, but for the most part the professor will just want you to reiterate the overarching themes of the course thus far. 

Get to know one or two of the texts really well, enough to pick out a couple of points that you can BS about in the longer essay portion.  You don't really need to memorize much, you'll seriously be fine.  45s are a piece of cake.

Good luck (although you don't need it)!
Thanks, 
I ended up making a big google doc with some friends from the class with historical backgrounds for the authors, a list of major characters, and some themes for the readings. I won't look back on the readings too much then--hopefully I'll be able to discern the styles of the authors. 
I've gotten one A- and consistent B+'s, so I would like to see if the final bumps me up a little. 
I had a feeling that I shouldn't freak out about this... "
