Chemistry 1A Special Section,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cjrf00/chemistry_1a_special_section/,2019-07-30 05:59:14,I've been accepted into section 4 (special section) for Chemistry 1A with Professor Angelica Stacy. What's the difference between this special section and all other sections of Chem 1A?,"During the lecture time, you work on worksheets. Lectures are posted online and you listen to those at home.
one of my CoE friends took chem 1a with stacy and said it was god awful. Her grade distribution was definitely less forgiving than those of the other profs teaching alongside her."
