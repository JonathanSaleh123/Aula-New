Has anyone taken a class with professor Busisiwe Nsele ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/179f2p5/has_anyone_taken_a_class_with_professor_busisiwe/,2023-10-16 12:57:24,"I'm interested in HISTART (History of Art) 190H. And I wonder how her class is. Any information about assignments, midterm, final?","She gave a guest lecture for my 101 and it was ok. I’ve heard from friends in her seminar that she’s not the most accommodating and her lesson plans are pretty disorganized, so I personally have no interest in taking her classes."
