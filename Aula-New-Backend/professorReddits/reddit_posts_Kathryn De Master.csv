Need Advice!!!!!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ch1ls8/need_advice/,2024-04-30 12:35:41,"Hey guys, So I am a recent graduate( graduated - May of 2023) from UIUC with degree in civil engineering. All my professors and mentors from UIUC suggested that I should get a master degree, so I applied for my graduate studies right after I graduated and got into Berkeley's SEMM program(starting Fall of 2024). 

After I applied for my Master degree, and as I working for structural engineering firm(MKA - had the worst summer of my life, so many people got laid and I simply hated engineering.) , I realized that I  I'm drawn to roles in finance, consulting, or analysis, particularly those focused on sustainability—an area I've been passionate about since my college days, even founding a non-profit related to it.

Currently, I'm exploring opportunities such as the Fundamental Research Analyst positions at DE Shaw and Citadel, both of which have renewable investment teams. What's intriguing is that these roles don't necessarily require prior finance experience, which aligns well with my background.

Question for the thread: 

1. Should I pursue this masters degree in structural engineering if my goals are aforementioned. Plus: Berkeley branding that might lead to cool Internship opportunities (WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON I MIGHT PURSUE THIS DEGREE) delta: employers at these funds think I am an incapable analyst, and have no finance experience. 
2. Has anyone in this thread(recently, in these market conditions) been able to break into consulting/analyst positron with an civil engineering background. 
3. Do you think graduate department at Berkeley would entertain a request to switch major? If so, which major should pivot to or what classes are good for such PE/research based roles. 

Thank you so much to everyone who helped. I really appreciate any advice. Going through a dark tunnel in terms of my career(which is mostly my life).

&#x200B;","1. No. Do not get a masters in structural engineering if you do not want to be a structural engineer. The SEMM program is a 1-year masters and is intended for people who are going to go straight into a professional engineering job, not get an internship after graduation. The only exception might be if you want to work in green building construction, in which case you can take the required SEMM courses and then diversify with your electives.
2. A bachelor's in civil engineering is great for lots of consulting, analyst, and sustainability roles. You can apply broadly to both private-sector and government jobs. However it can be difficult to break into sustainability-related work without prior experience and you may need to look for less-than-ideal opportunities to build up your experience and expertise.
3. Since you've been admitted to CEE, you could ask about a change of major to the [Energy, Civil Infrastructure, and Climate program](https://ce.berkeley.edu/programs/ecic) (ECIC) if you want to do sustainability-related work - that would likely be your best bet. The ECIC program is much more diverse than SEMM and would actually be good for getting into analyst and consulting roles related to sustainability. Changing outside of CEE or engineering may not be feasible without re-applying."
Norwegian Exchange Student (NTNU) : Housing/Pricing/Roommates Advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bvabs4/norwegian_exchange_student_ntnu/,2024-04-03 18:15:02,"Hey there!

28M Here from Norway and currently studying for my bachelor's degree. I've been accepted to study at Berkeley this fall through the BISP program, Hopeing to focus on AI, Deep Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and a bit of Quantum Computing to meet my course requirements. I've been self-studying AI and even made it to the finals of a hackathon in Switzerland recently, which was quite an experience competing against Ph.D. candidates and master's students in AI from universities like München University and Politécnico de Milano.  
Hopefully that gives me a leg up.

Right now, I'm in the midst of getting my papers sorted, but I can't help but worry about the cost of living in the Bay Area, especially finding a place to stay. To give some context, a pretty spacious apartment in Norway go for about $1400 a month. I'm currently sharing an apartment where my share of the rent is $600 for a fairly small room, and that's considered on the higher end here!

From what I've seen on Zillow and other housing guides, it looks like the average rent in Berkeley is around $3000 a month. That's a bit more than what I'm used to, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. I've visited the US a few times before, and on my last trip, I stayed at a Universal Resort for three weeks for less than $3000, food and drinks included. It makes me wonder if a hotel might be a more economical option, atleast temporarily.

I've noticed some housing listings are for shared rooms, which isn't ideal for me since I value my privacy and need a quiet space due to mild autism. A studio apartment would be acceptable as long as there's some separation between the bed and kitchen area.

Also, I've come across some listings that seem incredibly high, around $5000-$6000 a month, and I'm aware that there are scams out there, So how do I make sure a place is safe and the pricing realistic? Would it be wise to bring a parent along for apartment hunting?

Also I am interested in potentially finding some American flatmates for the semester; I just don't want to cause any inconvenience with only staying 5-6 months.

Any advice or suggestions on navigating the housing situation in Berkeley would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","Congrats! UC Berkeley is probably one of the best schools for AI in the world right now. The International House (https://ihouse.berkeley.edu/) should be a great option for your semester abroad. The vibe and dining there are great, and many exchange students choose to stay there too. Be cautious of housing scams online, especially those on Facebook groups. It will be very challenging for you to find off-campus housing since most leases are for one year. Good luck!!
I want to second I-House! It's a great place to find community, especially if you are an international student. There are also a ton of Norweighan students living there. I would say that the building is more ""historic"" than old/moldy. IIRC they also recently renovated parts of it.  Also, the website says that only grad students can get singles, but the year I stayed there, there were a couple of undergrads living in singles. If you email them and tell them that you have a documented disability, I think they will be able to accommodate. Hope that helps!
Thank you! I'll look into it, possibly the cheaper and safest option it seems.  
Too bad i can't seem to find any good pictures of the rooms though. The building seems old, and I have an allergy to mold and dust, and the few pictures I can find seem to indicate old furniture.  
Also if i understand the fine print correctly undergrads, which i belive include me, are forced to get shared rooms... Something I don't want.
Thanks for the informative reply <3  
I took your advice and have sendt them an email.
Does it get really loud at I-House? I have also heard the rooms are really small, is this true?
The room I lived at was pretty quiet. It was only loud occasionally. The rooms are small if you live in the standard sized rooms. You can also get a bigger room which is much larger but costs more.
When you stayed there, were there more undergrads or postgrads? Also, how did you find the food and dining plan? I'm an incoming exchange student so I want to be able to try different restaurants around Berkeley, but I feel like the all-inclusive dining plan at I-House won't be worth it if I skip quite a few of the meals there.
Majority are undergrads but there are a sizable amount of grad students. When I was there, the dining plan was not all-inclusive. For the price (when I was there at least), I still think it was worth living at I-House, as long as you used the dining hall 80% of the time."
Major in something I love (English/History) or major in something that brings in the money (CS)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2sd1r8/major_in_something_i_love_englishhistory_or_major/,2015-01-13 19:36:58,"I'm an L&S freshman. I took CS61A with John DeNero last semester and got a B+. I find computer science not as interesting as English and history, which I love. I took a history class and an English class and got A's.

My parents don't think English and history are very practical majors. They point to my cousins. One graduated with master's degree in English five years ago and is still working as a barista. The other graduated with a psychology degree two years ago and is working retail.

I was reading *Cracking the Tech Career* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (who wrote *Cracking the Coding Interview* and founded CareerCup) and got to this part:

> **Majors**

> Although some well-meaning people will advise you to find a major that you love, that isn't the best career advice.

> If you want to get a job at a top tech company, some majors will simply make it easier to get in. The more directly applicable your major is, the better. Computer science, marketing, finance, and accounting majors will have a much easier time getting their resume noticed than, say, a history major. After all, they have academic experience, and possibly other work experience, that lends itself to a specific role.

> Even majors that aren't necessarily directly applicable (like mathematics, in most cases) can still show rigor.

> But there are all kinds. Paul landed an internship at Microsoft as a music major from Berkelee College of Music. Not a dual computer science and music — just a plain old music major. And even he had a directly applicable role: making sound effects for Xbox. He spent his days using ordinary household objects to mimic sounds like a golf ball hitting the grass.

> **Minors**

> If you choose to major in something less applicable, like history, your minor is your opportunity to add an applicable skill to your resume. Seek out a relevant minor that complements your path, whether that's finance, marketing, computer science, or one of several other career majors.

> A minor is also a great place to prove that you're quantitative. A minor in math or engineering will do that, but so will a minor in economics, finance, or accounting. Whether fair or not, many techies associate the ability to work with numbers as a sign of intelligence (as well as an important job skill), and a minor is your chance to show that.

I'm torn between majoring in computer science and something like English or history. English and history assignments are relatively easy and enjoyable for me to do because I love reading and writing. Programming on the other hand is doable though takes a lot of time and effort.

Thoughts?","[deleted]

You could play around with the idea of double majoring or minoring in one of them and majoring in the other. Just the CS minor gives you enough experience to land a entry internship that can lead to a career!  (for the minor: along with the lower divs, you'll be taking 3 upper divs, as opposed to the 27 units of upper-div technical courses + EE16A for the major). My friend majored in linguistics and minored in cs and works in software now. You could consider that as your backup, if you want to get by with a decent amount of experience but not tooo many technical courses. Or you could major in CS and minor in English/History and take the classes you find interesting. 
You're still a first-year. (You probably hear that a lot.) But as a first-year, you still have plenty of time to take classes that interest you. So take 61B and 70, because they teach skills useful for many programming jobs, but also take some English and History classes. (I'd recommend upper-divs over something like the English 45A/B/C series, since they better resemble the things you'd be doing in the major, plus you get a chance to choose classes that more closely match your interest. Plus if you decide to go with the minor, the 45s won't count toward that.)

Then, when it comes time to declare, choose the major that gets you out of Cal the most painlessly, while continuing to take side-classes either for your own edification or for career, or both.

I think that the choice of majors and minors *as a resume-building tool* is overrated. Woohoo, you have a line on my transcript that says you're an English minor, so you can clearly write better than anyone else I hire. No.

In my opinion:

> many techies associate the ability to work with numbers as a sign of intelligence

Probably true, judging on my limited experience with said techies. But not necessarily intelligence, per se, as much as problem-solving competence. For instance, a lot of techies have a better opinion of engineers than of math majors, even though the latter are clearly better at math.

> and a minor is your chance to show that.

Probably *not* true. What, when you apply to a job are they going to look for that one line in the ""memoranda"" section on your transcript that says ""completed a minor in applied math""? Probably not--they're going to focus instead on what sort of specific math skills you know. I think it's more important to have coursework in those areas than to have a specific minor. For instance, say you want to get a job in high-frequency trading. ""Major in econ with a minor in math"" means much less to a hiring manager than ""studied economics and business, with an emphasis on quantitative analysis."" (You can tell I know nothing about econ; just using it as an example.)
Why not do both? Also there are plenty of people who don't major in CS but program after college. Zuckerberg wasn't a CS major but he obviously ended up fine in tech. 
I'd recommend majoring in something you care about, it'll make college more enjoyable. At the same time, take the CS 61 series, and if you enjoy it consider minoring in CS. The skills you'll get from a minor will be more than sufficient for most programming oriented jobs.
Don't major in English unless you're going to double major or pursue graduate study.
I'm a dad with a student at Cal. She wants to major in art. I support her choice. She worked hard to get in to Cal. She deserves to make her own choices. I'd have to be a real dick parent not to let her pursue her natural interests and talents. 

Part of me thinks you're conflicted between what you want, and what your parents want. Nothing you've said makes me believe you enjoy programming. 

McDowell is right... Doing something you love, won't prepare you for a successful career in something you don't love. 

The real question is what do YOU want? As a loving parent, I will support you and encourage you in any field you choose to study at the best university in the world.

If you can't use an English degree from the best university in the world to build a career, you're not trying, or you have unsupportive parents. I believe my daughter will succeed in art. Why don't your parents believe the a same about you? If I were you, I'd ask them that question specifically: why don't they believe in your talents and judgement?

Another thought, If you're going to be an English or History (or art) major, you may need more support and encouragement in a career than if you majored in C.S. Are your parents up to the task? Doesn't sound like it.

Finally, I'll give you the same advice I gave my daughter: choose the major you want, and seriously network with your professors and classmates. Build relationships with the movers and shakers. At worst, you'll have a network for job opportunities in your field. At best, you'll learn from them how to become a mover and shaker in your field yourself. 

Don't let other people make your choices for you. 
TLDR: If I were you, right now I'd plan on dual majoring in English and CS, but only consider that a tentative plan. That lets you put off the decision for about 3 more semesters while keeping both majors available to you, which is great, because with only one college semester under your belt, you are Jon Snow (""You know nothing"") with regard to what you want. You can narrow that down later, or major in both.

There's two ways to look at college, neither one of which is better than the other: 1) using college to educate yourself and as a finishing school for being an informed and educated citizen, ie classical liberal arts. 2) stepping to stone to a career that pays well.

Neither of those are mutually exclusive; you can totally do both. An English degree, by itself, pretty much falls into category 1, and a CS degree, by itself, pretty much falls into category 2. The trick to college is it should be more than just a degree. You should use it to network, both with classmates and with prospective employers (esp. cal Alums), and to get relevant industry experience via internships.

English (actually any prototypical category 1 major) isn't a bad major for being employed after graduation, but unlike the more tradeschooly majors in category 2, there is no easy-to-follow path into a career or non-dead-end job. That means you have to forge your own path, which means internships and networking. Start thinking about what you'd like to do with our life. Marketing? PR? Sales? HR? Pretty much every company has those 4 jobs and they don't require any sort of technical degree. Perhaps you can think of an industry that interests you that doesn't require a technical degree either, like attorney (though that requires a JD) or paralegal, teaching (you'll need a cert, but not a full-on education degree), journalism, etc.

Then after finding a field or two, look for people in that field with a Cal degree and use/abuse your Cal network to network with them and maybe ask for an internship. Make sure to mention in your intro email that you are a Cal student when you fist make contact. Don't ask for an internship right away. Ask them if you can chat with them over coffee (if they're local) or over email about their career field, because you are thinking about what you want to do after you graduate and how to prepare yourself for being a competitive applicant when you graduate.  What do they like about their field? Dislike? Where is it going? What challenges will there be in the future? What do they look for in successful applicants, for both full-time and internship? What don't they look for or what do they ignore? If you find a few people you like, ask them if they know of any relevant available internships you could apply to. This is how you use your network. Most good jobs are never actually advertised, because people use their network to find someone qualified.

This is how you get a white collar job with a 'useless' degree. Sidenote rant: it's not fucking useless because there are lots of jobs that require a BA/BS of some sort even though you never actually use the degree directly for the job and because a degree is more than just a job certification.

For CS, if you take the required classes to apply to the CS major, you will be good enough to hustle your way into a programming job after graduation, even without the CS degree. You'll still need to do a bit of networking and you'll need a side-project or two to show off your skills, but its not impossible or even very hard, if this is what you want to do.

The CS minor is less than useless right now, because of how impacted the major is. As I'm sure you know, even declared majors are having trouble getting their classes. CS minors get about as much priority as undeclared L&S students (ie none). Either just take the required classes to apply to the major (and then stop) or take the major.

Regardless of what you choose, use college to get internships doing something you could see yourself doing as a career. Decide what you want to do and start working towards getting there. The two big things will be networking and relevant experience. Use your internships to get both. Even a CS degree isn't super helpful without an internship or two.

Good question I saw once and you should ask yourself: ""Do you want to live to work or work to live?"" I've been asking myself this a lot recently. 

I'm just going to very briefly plug the incredibly vibrant Digital Humanities scene on campus. If you are interested in the humanities, and know how to program, there are a TON of very rich opportunities for you. Check out the [Berkeley Center for Digital Humanities](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/) to get a sense of what it is all about.
You can become a lawyer with a history degree, which can potentially make more than a large majority of cs majors.

There are non software jobs by the way that aren't baristas.
Honestly, I would recommend majoring in CS, or double majoring.  It's still early for you as well, so take your time in exploring it.  It's very possible to start as an engineer and transition into other roles once you're in a tech company as well, and having a background is always helpful.
Do what you love. But take enough math/science to minor in a technical subject. Then go into banking
people hire cs, because its hard. 

Because its hard, its in demand.


Anthro major now product manager at large tech firm checking in. College is where you learn how to learn. Money will come, but this is your only time in college. Do what makes you happy!
I'd rather program than work as a barista or in retail. I'm aiming to work for a tech company so I'm reading Mrs. McDowell's books.

I don't live and breathe programming, but I think I can do it okay.
> it's about what you do outside your major. if you do end up majoring in history or english, the most important thing is that you don't JUST do that. that's what makes it unpractical. you need to do work/internship/clubs/research/whatever helps you get on a path of what you want to do after college.

What are you doing outside of history?
Nice, thank you for the story about your friend. Did s/he find it difficult to get a software job as a non-CS major? I heard that it's hard to enter the industry without a CS degree but the CS minor must help a bit.
Thank you for the advice about taking upper-divs over English 45A/B/C. I took R1B this semester and loved it! I'll look into taking an English upper-div or two this semester.
Zuckerberg started coding in middle school and stated in an interview that he ended up taking as many CS classes as psych classes. *Before college*, Microsoft wanted to acquire a media player he wrote and have him work for them. So suffice to say that's a bad example.
You're right, I could double major in CS/English or CS/history.

One major for career purposes and the other for fun.
That's amazing that you're giving your daughter so much support for majoring in art! Kudos!

My parents would freak out and say I'd end up a starving artist if I majored in art.

Did you study something like art or English in college and make a career out of it?
Wow, thank you so much for your advice! It's very helpful!

What did you major in? Are you more English/history inclined or engineering inclined?
> As far as anecdotes, I've seen very similar results to the ones you listed. 

What majors/schools did they attend? Did they get into better jobs after a couple years?

I'm hoping that my cousins will get into better jobs once the economy gets even better...I can't imagine doing retail or being a barista until they're like 60. :(

That's why I'm willing to study something I'm not super passionate about so I can get a job like software engineering and have a better future.
As an econ grad, you probably should know better to say that it's in *demand* because it's hard. :)

brb going to declare Japanese, and also to cleanse myself for having made a supply-and-demand joke
Remember that it doesn't have to be CS. There are so many other career paths out there that you can be successful in as well. Maybe try exploring what else you could do if you enjoy it more.
I mean, saying you'd rather program than be a barista doesn't really make sense...you're comparing a career to a part-time job. Do you *like* to program?

Why not look for jobs in English or history-related fields? Contrary to popular belief, such jobs *do* exist!
Do you like working 10 hour days, 6 days a week?

If not, then tech might not be the right field for you.
[deleted]
If you have the relevant skills, people will hire you. My friend tailored his resume for the tech interviews with a bunch of programming side projects. My cousin majored in Art, didn't even have a minor in CS but knew enough programming to get a CS job after she couldn't find any good opportunities with her art degree. A lot of software engineering jobs are about on-the-job training/learning, so they want to see that you are a quick learner. It's more about the skills than what is written on paper/what your degree says. 
You don't need CS to work as a programmer, many developers, myself included, are not CS majors, there are other resources and ways to learn and if you have experience in English, or history, or something else interesting companies will value that; they like having diverse teams.
It sounds to me like you wouldn't starve. It might be hard, though. My philosophy is that if it's really that hard to succeed as an artist, she needs all the help she can get, ~especially~ from your parents.  If the world doesn't support your dreams, shouldn't your parents at least believe in you?

I was actually a poli sci major, but never really used it. I've instead taken an entrepreneurial route.

Good luck. It I could reassure your parents, I would. I think you'll do great no matter what YOU choose. 
Glad you found it so helpful!

I came in engineering undeclared and graduated EECS. I can't say the salaries didn't inform my decision in deciding EECS and engineering undeclared, but they definitely weren't the most important criteria by far (if they were I'd either be finishing law school or med school right now). EECS was actually my 'default' major if i didn't like any of the other majors, because I enjoyed the limited amount of coding I did in hs (i took ap cs junior year).

I'm very STEM inclined and I nearly tried to do a pure math or physics double major with EECS, but decided against it due to bureaucratic hoops i'd have to jump through to get through both degree and because I didn't have a good GPA.

Like I said earlier, I'd recommend trying to double in both. If you are ~~smart~~ hardworking enough to get into L&S CS right now, you can almost certainly manage a double major in English. And if you can't get into L&S, well you at least have enough CS knowledge to get a junior software engineer job and you aren't off track to get an English degree.

The problem with English degrees and the like isn't that the degree is useless, but that the main point of such a degree isn't to guarantee an interesting, high paying, and relevant job, so you won't automagically fall into a good job after graduating. People calling them useless didn't do anything to make themselves competitive in the job market while they were in college, and expected the degree to do all the work for them, like how certain engineering degrees can do. But even they aren't a guarantee. I know I guy who graduated from another college with a civil engineering BS and is now spending his time reffing high school and semi-pro soccer.
Really? My time at Berkeley has taught me that the only jobs are tech and business? All non-EECS or Haas majors are going to be baristas and the only value in education is money.
I agree so much with this! Because we're living in a time where the lucrative jobs are in tech, that's what so many of us hear about. But the ""average"" jobs in other fields very much still exist - you won't be making 6 figures out of school, but you're also not struggling to pay rent. 

I know English majors who have graduated to work in publishing, copy editing, journalism, and other related fields. Similarly, I know History majors who do museum work, or teaching. While not the most popular jobs on the listings, they're there if you want to put in the work towards landing them. 
Wow, you have a lot of good extracurriculars! What kind of jobs do you think will be a good fit after graduation?
Exactly! And to be quite honest, such jobs often *will* ultimately lead you to 6 figure salaries...and fairly quickly, too!

What do people do in entry-level administration roles that require a bachelor's degree? I'd love to do an internship or part-time job like that to see if I like it."
