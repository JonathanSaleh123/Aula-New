Anant Sahai is a funny character,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15zlazz/anant_sahai_is_a_funny_character/,2023-08-23 16:57:13,"(disclaimer that I am a recent graduate and not currently attending)

Let's take a look at the [Policies page](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa23/policies/) of the Deep Learning course he's teaching:

> We require students to not only do the homeworks, but to carefully understand the solutions. You are required to critically evaluate your homework and to make sure that you can actually do every problem on the assignment for your learning. To do this, we recommend that you redo any part of any question that you didn't get right the first time in light of what you have learned from the solutions.

Okay, fairly reasonable to expect students to follow along. But then...

> Weights (undergrad students):

> **Homework (0%)**

> Midterm Exam (25%)

> Final Exam (40%)

> Project (25%)

> Participation (10%)

> Weights (graduate students):

> **Homework (0%)**

> Midterm Exam (25%)

> Final Exam (35%)

> Project (30%)

> Participation (10%)

Does he seriously expect anyone to follow along without the incentive of it being a way to earn points in the course? Apparently so, since he includes a section titled ""pulling your weight"" (which has a URL tag of ""#slacking"": https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs182/fa23/policies/#slacking) which states:

> The course staff do not have the bandwidth to give you an individualized course or to engage in one-on-one tutoring. You are expected to keep up with the course, take notes, and do all the assignments. **At any time when you approach staff for help, you should expect to be able to pull up any homeworks that have been due or to pull out your notes from lecture and/or discussion. If you have not kept up, you will immediately move to the absolute bottom of the queue for getting help.** If you cannot devote time and effort to the course, or if you lack the background to keep up, you should not be taking this course.

While lil bro has a point, his implementation is utterly baffling. Having worked with hundreds of students at this university, I can tell you one thing: if you don't provide an incentive to do something beyond thinly-veiled scare tactics, they will not budge. Students are in for a rough time when they inevitably stop doing the homeworks. And how is a TA supposed to judge on the fly whether a student is genuinely struggling or just ""slacking""? Mind you, this is the same dude who [lets a chunk of his students fail](https://berkeleytime.com/grades/0-15465-fall-2021-sahai,-a-_-1) in EECS 16B by refusing to shift grade bins and [ending up with a 2.9 \(!!\) average](https://dailycal.org/2022/06/06/eecs-16b-removed-from-computer-science-major-requirements).

Nothing says being a good professor like trying to scare students out of taking your own course. Ffs","I find this really funny because I heard genuinely good things about his version of 182 from the last 2 semesters but now he pulls this. Lol Im glad I took this course before sahai took over.
Sahai’s policies represent a highly idealistic view of education where the student’s main focus is 100% pure learning and zero percent raw letter grade, and where, despite homework having zero direct impact on grade, students will choose to do them with meticulous effort for altruistic reasons. While theoretically viable, it is not viable in practice.
Probably because it is assumed that if you made it through all the pre-reps that are required, you are a serious in wanting to specialize in this stuff for your job or go to grad school (and not some noob in 61A). 

If you are going to be a typical software engineer, you don’t need this stuff at all (unlike lower division classes or typical upper division).
This guy takes *Deep* learning to a whole new level.
This new policy is wack but Sahai is a genuinely good teacher and the homework assignments are very well done.
still better than the m\*th department here

sahai is being a quirky boy and downvoters need to eat rocks
Is CS182 the hardest upper div CS course?
How dare they not offer incentives to encourage me to learn the material for a class I signed up for!!! Disgusting!!!
Most college “homework” doesn’t count. I think doing the problems is the equivalent of reading.
go bears
No. Used to be chill until Sahai teaches it. I got an A and my math is shit.
So with Sahai teaching it, it’s the hardest?"

This is a genuine question. A thorough explanation would be much appreciated 🙏","He gave a famous PowerPoint on why students should work 80.5 hours a week if they expect to do well in the class(admitting that a 48 hour work week should be enough to pass likely, but barely) which seemed overdone. He famously pushed students hard under the guise of maturity. That said, I hear as a pure teaching standpoint, he is effective but the cost is high. I understand why he wants to push students but it’s just too much
he's indian snape
Secondhand, I heard that he over assigns work and has unrealistic expectations of his students.  

He transformed the already difficult cs70 class to something almost impossibly difficult (CS70 is one of the mandatory classes for CS major enrollment, so thank you for limiting the number of CS majors).  

He also released a misunderstood and overmemed ppt about spending 40hrs a week on just his class.  

I heard that he is basically a genius who expects everyone else to be a genius.

Cuz he’s daddy Sahai 🥰
When theres an extremist, there are followers (and memes)
The modus operandi social science majors have is they usually riot or protest or write course evals, not geek out over the prof :))
80.5 hours... for one class? So assuming I sleep 8 hours a day, that leaves 32 hours a week to do all of my cooking, eating, cleaning, showering/hygiene, exercising, running errands, ...oh and the work for all of my other classes. God forbid I also have a job. What the fuck?
Except I doubt there’s a Harry he’s protecting. But we’re all the Harrys he’s abusing .
Facts
 I think he's smart and can hold his own in a wide variety of academic conversations (even those outside his core domain).

I've met many geniuses in EECS/Stats/Math Faculty here, but he isn't one.
EE16A/B cannot have the best students. Nobody gives a shit about those classes especially during COVID. Too bad for Sahai that nobody tried their best in there
Would be nice if you guys could help us organize a protest against sahai. I'm cs and never done protests in my entire life. Feel like I'm missing out.

No no 80.5 hours total for all your classes. He is fair yk

>To meet demand, central campus does not provide sufficient TA funding, does not provide sufficient access to rooms for student-facing contact like office hours or HW parties, does not provide \*any\* rooms for internal meetings (say TA meetings, grading meetings, or course staff meetings of any kind) to support courses, does not provide sufficient funding for readers and tutors, and essentially does not provide \*any\* funding for staff support for instructors of courses, and provides neither funding nor staff for the development of software tools to help in course operations. Campus provides essentially \*no\* funding or support for any work done to make courses more supportive or inclusive. Nor are there even any robust processes by which faculty can easily request such support from campus in the amounts required for courses at EECS scale. The fact that any of this functions at all is largely due to the amazing levels of dedication of EECS staff, TAs and Readers and Tutors who go far above and beyond the call of duty, and faculty who put in way more effort than anyone could reasonably expect --- just because all these people love and care about students so much.   
>  
>  
>  
>Students can and should look for themselves to see exactly how the campus budget (of billions of dollars) is spent. It is illustrative to compare the total amount spent on faculty, postdocs, TAs and research assistants, etc. against the total amount spent on people's salaries across campus. If you want to drill down and look at the other numbers at the level of colleges, libraries, and departmental staff, you will see that that is not where the money is being spent either. Students can decide for themselves if they value the rest of the services (not teaching, not research, not libraries, not internet, not staff support from EECS or college staff) in the same proportion that their tuition and tax dollars are being spent on them. Faculty might have our own opinions, but you are all reasonably independent adults. Think for yourselves about what you would value more?

Don't always agree with Professor Sahai, but he's 100% right.

EECS TAs tend to be ambitious and overachievers (I mean this in a good way) which helps mask the problems of understaffing and limited resources, but relying on this is not sustainable as enrollment grows.
This is what happens when you dont take EECS 126 and 127 before taking EECS 189
we really do live in a society... engineers rise up

They should really directly admit CS students or even stop the BA CS. I know it’s good to let students to declare later, but it just doesn’t work well at the moment. Even worse, it’s making everyone’s life 10x harder.

Also, for god sake, split the EECS department. I mean, why drag the EE side into this shit hole. 
[deleted]
underrated comment
Bottom Code
The most straightforward solution seems to be to just raise the gpa cap more. That'd stress a lot of people out though.
I do agree that at this point most EECS majors don't focus on the EE side, especially hardware, but there are a good number of EECS and CS majors that take some of the 120 series since those are more math based courses.

Also, admitting directly into the major might solve the crowding of lower division courses, but I'd argue that's less of an issue right now. Those courses have managed to scale to their massive size surprisingly well. The issue right now are upper division courses that haven't scaled to support the demand (160, 168, etc.), and directly admitting wouldn't necessarily solve the capacity issues for these classes.
thinking we don't have a voice is what prevents us from having a voice tbh
Funny enough, this is the most EECS thing you could say after reading the post. You completely missed the point. 
According to him there are services that he doesn’t seem to approve of that are getting too much money. He can’t think of any reason as to why they get so much funding other than people directly complain to Chancellors Christ. The main thing that comes to mind is sports. I can definitely see why, after the whole stadium debacle, he’d feel this way. 
Frankly I think the problem is that the fringe minorities are generally the most vocal groups.

Like, for instance, I support trans people and all that, but why tf are we spending $3 million on a giant new lockerroom that maybe half a percent of the student population would ever use? We'd get what we wanted if we complained more.
Then he is myopic and only cares about his department and does not see the greater whole of the University and its community, which is why his whining is being ignored.
I assume you mean the new locker room that opened in the Haas pavilion building? The locker room isn’t only for trans people; it’s for everyone. There’s changing rooms for anyone to use as well as far more lockers (which anyone can appreciate let’s be honest). The old male and female locker rooms are still there, it’s just there’s a gender less locker room anyone can use. It’s a win for everyone who uses the RSF which is a significant portion of the student population and it has the added bonus of allowing trans people uncomfortable with being in a gendered locker room. Also you can now be in a locker room without seeing a bunch of nude men or women. 
Lol
Id still argue it's not a wise use of money, but I guess I shouldn't single out that locker room. I don't understand why the whole university has to subsidize RSF for the 10% or so of people who use it regularly. 
Your assumption as to amount of use by the campus is wildly off the mark.

The amount of self-centered conservatives who attend the campus are starting to amuse me, you'd think we'd be the bastion of the Republican Party with the amount of complaints by students of ""I don't use it, so I won't pay for it!""  That is not how services work.  They are available to all because they are seen as a benefit to those who choose to use them.  If you choose not to take advantage of them, that is your own affair, even as thousands do use it.
You're making no sense here. Obviously some services should be provided and some should not. Do you think the university should start using tuition dollars to give everyone a free boosted board too? It's a service that you may or may not choose to use, after all... We just disagree on what services should and should not be funded.

It's not a radically conservative opinion to want gym-goers to pay for their own gym usage.
The RSF is used by far more than 10% of the campus population (you have yet to cite where you are getting this number) and was overcrowded to the point they started letting students use the gym up at the stadium which had been intended for athletes only.

Also, the RSF was built *by* the students.  It was a vote by the student body that saw the RSF constructed for the benefit of all students, and as such part of registration fees were taken to upkeep the facility.  This is a service that the student body deemed was important enough to support that they pushed for the construction of the facility.  For the record, the RSF and Rec Sports have had budget issues [in the past](http://archive.dailycal.org/article.php?id=1494), during which time, an individual fee was considered, but instead was not put in place, as the ASUC came back and helped to fund the building again.

Students should not have to pay to have the ability to exercise when they are attending the University, and it is something the students have been paying for since its inception.  Prior to the RSF, Harmon Gym served as the locker room, weight room, and showers for the male students while doubling as the home of its athletic teams and their locker rooms (which did include the football team, as they practiced on the outfield of Evans Diamond).  Through the philanthropic generosity of Phoebe Hearst, the Women's Gym was built so that women could have their own safe space on campus to recreate separately from the men (as was the tradition and common sensibility of the time), but still it was the ASUC that maintained and operated the building.  The RSF was built because Athletics had come to dominate the use of Harmon Gym and the space in Hearst Gym had been taken over by the ROTC units (who originally used the first and second Harmon Gym's as their base of operations).  

Since the 1920s the student body has seen exercise and well being as a necessity and have provided for it so that all students could take advantage of the equipment and space necessary for its use.  If you are asking *why* is it expected that students pay for the services and not the University, that also is a historical question that stretches back to the structure of the University and the assumptions of responsibilities at the University's founding.  In short the campus was responsible for teaching originally and *nothing* else.  Housing, exercise, entertainment, food, health - all were expected to be provided for by the student body themselves as they saw fit.  Students decided to organize to provide most of these services (the University, as has been noted, decided that housing would be something it would assist with), in the form first the Student Co-Op, later the ASUC.

Professor Anant Sahai Fighting Cheating in CS70 Spring 2013,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1jmspf/professor_anant_sahai_fighting_cheating_in_cs70/,2013-08-03 09:52:41,"I was a student in [CS70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs70/sp13/) last semester (Spring 2013 with [Professor Anant Sahai](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Esahai/)).

There was cheating on the final, and Professor Sahai posted the following vehement note on the classroom forum:

>We have received disturbing reports of observed cheating on the final --- people copying answers and continuing past when time was called.

>**If you yourself cheated, I strongly urge you to confess. We will be significantly more lenient with those that confess. If you don't, we will throw the book at you and work as hard as possible to have you expelled from Berkeley and possibly, to have your name and reputation ruined for all time. (Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)**

>For those of you who saw something, please comment (anonymously (or not) as a follow-up in Piazza, or by sending us an email) telling us a. if you saw this, b. where roughly you were in the room, c. where the cheaters were.

>If you know or suspect who the cheaters were (or can provide a description), please report that too if you can. Your accusation will not result in anyone being falsely accused as we have all the exams scanned in and will only proceed on the basis of hard evidence. It will just allow us to more swiftly verify it and most importantly, to isolate those scores from our thinking as we adjust grade thresholds.

>It is really important in this case because we are trying to be fair to everyone in adjusting the grading to compensate for the unfortunate and unforeseen loss of 15 minutes. The cheaters are going to be hurting the grades of all the honest students in the class. They deserve no mercy or loyalty after doing such a despicable act to their fellow students. Please think of the good of all of the other students in the class and help us quickly find and isolate them from the sample.

>We have tried our best to make a fair exam with a chance for students at all levels of ability to demonstrate their understanding, we let you drop questions on the final, we made a special practice exam whose difficulty was calibrated above the actual exam, we released a specially made exam skeleton to reduce any uncertainty about the format, we allowed students to bring 3 handwritten sheets of paper, and we offered ample extra credit opportunities in the class. **We created and staffed homework parties and study parties to help students both interact with each other and get attention in what would otherwise be a large and impersonal class. To have students cheat in this context is extremely upsetting to me. To do so brazenly, in view of their peers, is a shameless act that is simply shocking. I have never seen such a thing in one of my own classes in my years at Berkeley.**

>For those who saw something, do not enable this kind of behavior in others. This is not normal. It should not be tolerated. They are contaminating your environment by their presence.

And later:

>UPDATE: Our estimates show that the extent of the truly egregious cheating seems to have been quite limited --- less than 2% of the class. We have had confessions and detailed reporting that has helped us in the process of identifying perpetrators. Those guilty really should confess if they know what is good for them. **As Brian Harvey has eloquently put it, cheating is fundamentally a violation against yourself.** Character is built out of habits, and cheating is a very bad and addictive habit. **Cultivating good habits and shunning bad ones is absolutely critical in your life, especially your youth when your character is most malleable. The violence cheating does to your intuitions of right and wrong is a terrible thing.** It is not too late. If you come forward without prompting, it'll be like stealing something that was in a sealed package and returning it without it being either opened or missed. We will be lenient and your character (and grades) will benefit greatly.

>For those of you who know something, please do step forward and report what you know to us. We've got lots of info, but your corroboration is very important. This is a matter of solidarity with your fellow classmates --- unrepentant cheaters have violated all of you. They must be rejected.

>Original Post: We have received disturbing reports of observed cheating on the final --- people copying answers and continuing past when time was called.

>If you yourself cheated, I strongly urge you to confess. We will be significantly more lenient with those that confess. If you don't, we will throw the book at you and work as hard as possible to have you expelled from Berkeley. **(edited to remove a stronger outburst of anger at the foolishness of provoking the wrath of Berkeley faculty.)**

I took CS 70 in Fall 2011 with Satish Rao.  During the second midterm the fire alarm was pulled.  We were told to leave our exams in the room, but there was a group of 20 or so people who took their exams with them, and started looking on their smartphones for answers and talking to other students about the questions.
This was my first semester at Berkeley, and I was appalled at the behavior of these students.  I never even saw close to the amount of cheating at my community college as I do here. 
Good, people do the same in the larger Economics courses and it's pretty embarrassing.
> cheating is fundamentally a violation against yourself.

this couldn't be any truer

when you cheat, you cheat yourself out of an education
I was in this class.  I reported people who were writing almost 10 minutes past the call deadline and collaborating answers, esp the easy to re-write true false questions on that exam.  

Kinda pissed me off that people were cheating.  It was a fair exam and all.  

>(Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)

When I read this, I then realized that Sahai was pretty pissed.  I am kinda glad that he redacted his statement in a later edit because i'm pretty sure he was somewhat emotionally compromised in the beginning of this entire debacle. 

Well, it's good that they finally call people out on this shit. This happens all the time and normally for simplicity, profs and gsi's look the other way. 
Well, guys I suppose the moral here is to not get caught cheating.


What if someone doesn't happen to check their inbox for a few days; only to find out now they're being accused of not turning themselves in leading to their expulsion.

(Devil's Advocacy Group, LLC)

I realize that's unlikely, but the professor's reaction seems a bit over the top. ""I will ruin your entire future! Because you cheated on one test in college!"" 

Not that I condone cheating, but this just seems like too much. Also why is this only just now being announced? If this was a Spring course, why is he just now doing anything about this? 
It seems pretty unfair that they did not get the full time on the exam. 
Oh please, cheating on the exam? Happens every time, at Cal and everywhere. The system is outdated, students are incentivized to get good grades so they can get into Grad program. If that's your only incentive,  ofcourse you are going to cheat. And who cares, it's not like Cal or any other university is preparing you for real jobs. This is a money grabbing, degree manufacturing machine. Why is there 400 people in one class. GSI's have no way of educating or in this case controlling that many students at one time.
I had similar feelings; I felt bad for Satish (or any other instructor, really) that he had to deal with this. He seems great teacher (stays behind to answer questions etc) and researcher and it's just a shame, I dont think he was really prepared to deal with situations like that (and shouldn't have to). Wish people had more integrity.
I really wish we could crack down on that crap. 
Happened a lot in Math 110 it seemed like, too.
lol so was anyone dumb enough to confess to cheating? What was the punishment for the cheaters?
lmao. just a random outburst of threats. people are always writing past call time. seen it happen too many times and there's usually no way to stop it, especially when it's stadium seating and everyone else is in a mad rush to go down and turn it in. 
> Not that I condone cheating, but this just seems like too much.

Academic dishonesty is.. kind of a big deal. 

People who cheat now, will hey falsify their results later too?


If nobody got full time, does it really matter?
> students are incentivized to get good grades so they can get into Grad program.

Well gee, maybe you should fucking study and learn the material. I have no sympathy with people who cheat and distort grades for everyone else. 
snowflake_princess, you are so right. You have what it takes to become an accomplished grad student in today's society. I can see you now, among all the GSIs and TAs at Cal CS or even MIT's PhD program. You are cultured and intelligent and will lead a meaningful life worth infinitely more than those of most other people. I believe you are the next Alan Turing of research.You are a genius; honestly, and in a world where the only sin is to be dumb, you have risen to truly godlike status. Think of it: an international student thrust into the din that is the English-speaking world, snagging a spot at the pinnacle of academia, assuming a position coveted by all her peers! This is all because you knew how to navigate the world. But why am I telling you all this, when you know it all already. You must excuse me for not being a genius like you. 


...Fuck you, cheater. It's people like you who give me homicidal ideations. But I have no need for ideations. By cheating you lie to yourself, and your true ego decays underneath the facade you create. Your true life is meaningless, and though nothing's stopping you from worming your way into Cal or MIT grad school, you will probably never be a very interesting or cultured person if all you care about are appearances. It's no wonder none of your close friends are very interesting people to be around. Fuck, you are most definitely NOT an interesting or cultured person now, it's evident by the beliefs you hold. You will do many things in life, but you will never say anything new that's worth caring about. You are only as beautiful and creative as your character, and yours is a pus-filled decaying corpse of a thing at the moment. Enjoy the futility, you lowlife worthless scum.
>it's not like Cal or any other university is preparing you for real jobs

Lol, tell that to all the EECS/CS grads making six figures right out of undergrad.
\> cheat for good grades

\> get into grad program

yeah, good luck passing quals you'll probably wash out super early
Redditor for 2 hours with a suspicious username and these are your only comments? I smell a guilty conscience.
If you get called in for cheating, and don't confess, the penalties are far worse. Trust me.
alot of people did, because the penalty for confessing was only losing points on problems you cheated, and the penalty for being caught without confessing was zeroing out the final, effectively failing the class. 
Yeah, but 10 minutes?  thats just wrong.  It just took forever to collect the tests.  
There was a lot said and done in the moments and days after cheating that was a bit over the top, but I completely respect Sahai for trying to do what's right.
>Academic dishonesty is.. kind of a big deal.
People who cheat now, will hey falsify their results later too?

[Which is why why everyone knows that anyone who has ever committed a crime ever will continue to repeat that crime for the rest of their life.](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1psjcyZgK1qgcra2o1_500.gif) 
 
Yes, they might falsify their results later, but they might learn from their mistakes and grow as a human being after having had to repeat the course due to a zero on a final. Attempting to ruin someone's entire future for cheating on a final is an extreme response.

And from reading the above comments, it seems like this professor really needs to work on how he administers tests. Having everyone wait for 10+ minutes for their test to get collected is just idiotic. ESPECIALLY given that the students should have had an extra ~15 minutes allotted for taking the test. 

Get outta here.... Talkin that nonsense...

well if you are going to enforce the time limit this hard then yeah. 
that was...beautiful.
but how would they be able to tell who cheated once everyone left the room? Don't they presume everyone is innocent until proven guilty?

If someone said you cheated and you said you didn't then it would be your word and against the other person's. And it's impossible to know everyone's names in a 300+ person class.
Other than losing points on the final, did they also get reported to the Dean or receive anything permanent on their records?
how'd they even get to 10 minutes? normally gsis are scrambling around, grabbing tests....you've got to be desperate if you're still writing 10 minutes after. 
There's little difference between giving a 45-minute test and giving a 1-hour minute test that's cut off by 15 minutes when you know beforehand, the material's hard enough that many people won't finish the test, and there's a grading curve. The only unfair thing is that some people cheated for extra time and still received the grading curve (and also collaborated on answers but that's something different). 
There are ways to tell. It's not that hard. And no I won't elaborate because fuck cheaters.
I think it can be pretty hard to find a cheater. It would really have to depend on what the test looks like. I don't know what cs tests are like so I can't comment on them. 


the one's that confessed did not, the ones that did not confess may have been, I have to check.

There was this requirement sahai had where a gsi had to sign off the coversheet of your exam with you and your ID present, so GSI's had to sign each exam before you could turn it in, leading to a long amount of time required to turn in the actual exam. Also, Our exam was cut short by 15 minutes because we were in haas pavilion so another class was taking a final at the exact same time and the prof for that class was proctoring the exam and we ended up starting almost 15 minutes late and we didn't get that 15 minutes back at the end. 


Yeah it wasn't handled very well, they did this thing where they told everyone to stay put in their seats while GSIs went around and individually checked each person's ID before collecting their test... I was near the front and it still took them like 3 minutes to get to me.
The collaboration is obviously wrong and they should be punished for cheating, However, can at least feel some empathy for the people who wanted the extra 15 minutes. As we all know, college is serious business and if you are allotted a certain amount of time, it should be given to you. This is a huge fuck up by the department and they should at least realize that they have some culpability. I see that our opinions differ, but that is just my perspective.  
Agreed with that_pj, it's not terribly hard. Honestly, it's better to confess than get caught. And, having been in that class, people did turn others in. There;s plenty of ways to tell.
how do you check? Did sahai post what happened on Piazza? Can you copy over what he said?
Ah I see. If the prof's gonna do that, should have had everyone hold their tests in the air. lol thanks for the explanation
I'm not one of those who downvoted you, but why do you think everyone deserves the full amount of time? The professor changed the amount of time allotted at the beginning of the test. It's just a revision to the test. I do agree that they should've had better enforcements though. Giving people at the back 15% more time than people at the front definitely makes an impact.
>Anyway, we've got multiple leads and those guilty who have not confessed already are facing a ticking clock. They should confess very soon if they know what is good for them. At this point, it is still like someone who has stolen something in a sealed package but hasn't opened the package. Give it back and significant leniency can be achieved. The instant grades start to come out, they are in deep trouble.

and

>For those who fully confess, our vision of leniency isn't failing you in the class or even on the final. It is a much more measured response in keeping with the ""stealing something and returning it unopened and unmissed"" analogy that I used. It is a much better deal. By our calculations, at this point of our ever tightening noose, a person who has cheated has a larger than 60% probability of being caught. At this point, even from an Expected Value point of view, it is in their self-interest to confess. 

He didn't really say what happened to those that were caught and didn't confess. 

> If the prof's gonna do that, should have had everyone hold their tests in the air.

And wave it like they just don't care!"
Professor Anant Sahai as a Berkeley undergraduate,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/24x0d9/professor_anant_sahai_as_a_berkeley_undergraduate/,2014-05-06 18:49:21,"[Professor Anant Sahai](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/) is teaching [CS70 Spring 2014](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/sp14/).

Sahai as a high school senior: http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon

A student asked on the classroom forum Piazza:

> **Sahai -- what are your daily rituals?**

> From the very beginning of the semester you've stressed the importance of time management and many times have both implicitly and explicitly stated that after eating and sleeping we should be working.

> For a source of inspiration, would you mind sharing what an average day of being Prof. Sahai is like? I'm sure me and many others would find it interesting.


> EDIT: Or maybe even a college version in the past when you were a student vs nowadays, if you're so inclined.

Professor Anant Sahai replied:

> College Anant Sahai:

> I didn't keep detailed records of my time, so this is from unreliable memory.

> Took a nap pretty much every day. Aaah Foothill La Loma dorms --- so close for naptime. (I moved into Foothill the first fall it opened.)  And the lounge space around Sibley Auditorium --- perfect for napping. Later I lived essentially across the street from Tolman --- also close enough for napping.

> At the beginning, called home every single day. I missed my brother tremendously. Also wrote paper letters to folks back home --- long-distance phone calls were expensive! And there was no widespread email.

> Lived freshman year in Clark Kerr in a suite. The building was rather antisocial back then, and my suite was close to the entrance. So me and my suitemates would order a pizza every night (I hit my lifetime quota of Fat Slice in about a semester and a half) and prop the door open. It was a salon of sorts --- late night pizza, random philosophical conversations, and playing some cards. (The Monty Hall Puzzle came into it when it was sweeping the country. Main card games: speed and 24.) People paid their share of the pizza, but my suitemates and I put in the effort to make this happen. Lots of discussions in the evening about the material we were learning in courses, life, religion, philosophy, and political speculation. That kept happening throughout undergrad. We also played a rather grotesque variant of 20 questions in which you had to guess how someone died and why. 

> Took Math H50A (the then equivalent of Math H54) and H50B (the then equivalent of Math H53) as a freshman. Immensely challenging homeworks that really made you learn the material. It was also amusing to watch a class start with 50-some students and end the year with just 5 of us. Great fun. I learned everything in Math 110 as well as the usual 53/54 content, as well as a chunk of Math 128. This is the course that, more than any other single course, impressed upon me what Berkeley was really about. Why this is the greatest University on this planet. Oh by the way, H50AB was taught at the time by a faculty member who was joint Math and EECS. (He is now retired.) 

> Took Physics H7ABC. Also great fun. Loved the hard homeworks and fun exams. Enjoyed hearing stories from older Physics faculty reminiscing about the Manhattan Project. Had entered Berkeley unsure about EECS vs Math vs Physics. Seriously considered Physics before realizing that EECS really had the theoretical depth that I wanted.

> Spent many hours on the Math and Physics problem sets. And enjoyed every bit of it. Had study group sessions with others in the course. In general, throughout undergrad, I learned a lot by helping others. It really is the best way to understand something.

> Enjoyed 60ABC (the names then for 61ACB) a lot. Made it a ritual along with his friends to climb to the roof of Pimental before any midterm or exam and dance around. (DO NOT DO THIS.) Found these courses mostly quite easy --- although 60C with Prof. Hilfinger took some time and was great fun. (As was 60A with Stuart Russell and 60B with John Ousterhout, both fun but not very time consuming.) 

> Attended a great mini-course by CSUA and XCF on advanced Emacs Lisp. With his best friend (who he met in H50A and H7A, took most classes with and who came with him to MIT for grad school), wrote an emacs lisp program to help automate playing DikuMUD (a text-based multiplayer role-playing game).  Fun. We did this in the evenings of freshman year first semester while taking 60A.

> Used to watch Anime every monday evening at the Cal Anime club. (With that same best friend above --- who used to take Japanese courses.) 

> Spent countless hours in the Eta Kappa Nu office just chatting with people and tutoring folks. And learning by osmosis. You'd be surprised what all you can pick up just by watching people tutor others in upper-division courses! I believe my friend and I might have been the founding compserv officers and we were one of the originators of the ""challenges"" tradition that candidates have to do. 

> I ate food in the dorms at meal times my freshman and sophomore years. After that, I moved into an apartment when my brother also came to Berkeley. Then I used to enjoy cooking. 

> I tried to sleep a good amount every night, and following my parents general rules, no studying the night before an exam or in the near vicinity of an exam. I could help others though --- so final time was always great fun. Lots of spare time to enjoy myself! Dead week started later while I was a student.

> Never took an American Cultures course --- that requirement started after I had joined. My brother took it though, so I learned a lot of the material in the linguistics one indirectly. 

> Took lots of Math courses: I think 104, 113, 185, and 125. 

> This was before 70 and 126. So I took Math 55 and Stat 134. It was before 127 so I took an IEOR optimization course. 

> The classes that kept me up late: EECS 192 (I believe I was in the inaugural class for that), 150 (It was a big class then. In my year, the project was essentially a trick. If you tried to solve it directly, you were doomed. My group [with my best friend again] and a group of grad students were the only ones who finished the project. Both of us realized that it was easier to solve a harder problem --- design and make our own computer, write our own compiler for it, and then write a computer program to solve the given project.), and a special Engineering course that taught us everything you needed to know to start a company. (This was before the dot com boom.) We proposed a company to deal differently with email that we had called SpectralMail. One of my cofounders (also one of my best friends and fellow HKN officer) went on to found HotOrNot while a Berkeley PhD student. Another has also had a bunch of startups. 

> I took 221A and 222 as an undergrad. That was fun. Grad courses were a lot more work. And intense. No real study group though because I was the only undergrad in the course. 

> Spent my summers at research internships. Back then, Berkeley had a formal internship program for top EECS undergrads. Lots of places like Xerox PARC and HP Labs and so on would only take undergrad interns from MIT and Berkeley. Grad students only from any other place --- which made sense I guess given how our curriculum is so out of everyone else's league. 

> Anyway, for the most part, I always made sure to eat, sleep (including daily naps), and have fun. It was a lot easier to be focused on study-relevant fun in the days before Facebook, laptop computers, mobile phones, and the world-wide-web.  As far as I can tell, the only really good thing that has come from the internet age for education is Wikipedia. Not sure if the others actually help anyone learn anything better given the amount of time they suck up. Computers are nice, I guess. But even back then we had things like Mathematica and programming environments. So, we could explore things on our own even before the Internet. 

> EDIT TO ADD: Forgot to mention that I was on the Berkeley ACM Programming contest team. My year, we didn't do so well. When my brother was on the team, we won the International competition. Best in the world.

A student asked:

> Have you ever bombed an exam, or had moments where you felt you couldn't keep up with all your classes?

Sahai replied:

> Unfortunately, I never really had those kinds of feelings personally, at least not in a way that is real --- in that I felt bad because I really did do badly. But I did have close friends who felt that way so I have some empathic experience with them. I know that it can be hard to walk out of high school a star and then find yourself in the middle of the pack here in Berkeley. I've seen enough tears from my fellow students when I was a student, and tears from my students as a faculty member.

Another student asked:

> I'm asking these questions because I was thinking a lot about it and I'd like to see your input about it, prof. Sahai:

> 1. question: Have you ever felt that you are missing out on life's opportunities (say, backpack through Cambodia for 6 months or move to another country) by basically sacrificing everything to Mathematics or science? Not to say that they aren't worth sacrificing for, but to me this seems to be a curse for talented people (which makes me happy that I'm a mere mortal)...

> 2. question: How do you perceive brain drain? While you yourself were raised in California, I believe you (and advisors in general) are very influential in the development of (graduate) students, many of whom are international.. And I have noticed on your website that basically all your students stayed in the US. Is brain drain just a necessary evil on our path to evolving towards a global community or is it a real issue that should be counteracted?

Sahai replied:

> These are easy to answer:

> 1) No. Serving learning is a wonderful calling, and it is no sacrifice to spend time and effort on what you truly love. Are there tradeoffs? Yes, but they're due to the nature of time and space, not learning. Is the world perfect? No! But when people say that academia and learning will break your heart, they aren't referring to the nature of Math, Science, and Engineering. They are referring to the flaws in an economic/political system that blocks talented people from doing work they love that also truly needs to be done while helping humanity, just because they have to eat and take care of their families and the powers that be refuse to let them do so.

> 2) As an American, I like things that help the people of the United States. Having smart people coming here and staying to contribute, well that just makes good sense. Does it hurt other countries and other populations? Not really. If the other country wants to support them, they are free to do so. Most people would gladly return to their home region to contribute there. Look at Europe. Lots of people go back there. But I have seen far too many cases of places that basically refuse to do this. They know what needs to be done (give people freedom and create decent paying jobs with autonomy) and refuse to do it. Because in most cases, the local powers that be want to keep the rich and powerful rich and powerful. So, a person doing research in the USA is actually doing more for the people of their home country than that person would be doing back home.

> Lots of people contribute charitably back to their countries of origin --- and many I hope also contribute to help support the kinds of reformist and revolutionary organizations/social-movements that are needed to actually make real change happen.  (I'm not saying that the powers that be have any better motivations in the USA --- hierarchical power is inherently corrupting. It is just that social movements in the USA have, in the past, helped tame those forces at least a bit.) It is the will of the people and the blood, sweat, and tears of activists that matter. They made a better life for people and the ones active today are planting the trees that future generations will enjoy.","I think Sahai really hit it home regarding his opinions of how ""weaker"" students are treated at cal. During my time at cal, I saw many weaker students who were probably well better off at another university. I went from a high school star to being just a tad above average in engineering at cal, and even that kinda hurt. I can't imagine the kind of pain students go through who end up well below average even after giving their best efforts in their exams. Not only does that destroy their confidence but it also hampers post graduation dreams, which ride on the marks you received at cal. 
[deleted]
I have tons of respect for Sahai, and he clearly does for all of his students, but I will never enjoy theory even nearly much as he does. His CS70 class was by far my least favorite CS class I've taken so far (except for 161 with Tygar, but that was for a whole other set of reasons).
Sahai as a high school senior: http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon

Sahai's comment about the *Los Angeles Times* article:

> I'm surprised you folks were able to pull up a news article from back then.

> When you're a senior in high school, you attribute things to whatever is cognitively most available. I had spent 2nd and 3rd grade in India where I walked into classes being horribly behind in Hindi and multiplication/arithmetic. The numbers had always been friends, but I needed drill to catch up. So my mom helped me. Pilani at the time was a little neighborhood around the research center surrounded by sand dunes. (Seriously, we had sandstorms and everything!) My memories from then are mostly of riding my bike around the neighborhood, playfully planning the (purely theoretical and theatrical) destruction of my school, and the gorgeous night sky filled with stars (in summers we used to sleep outside under the stars). And following the ants around to see what they were up to.

> Looking back, the real special advantage I think was just my family and upbringing --- especially having a brother so close in age to me. We had so much fun together doing math, programming, legos and (yes) playing video games and writing our own ""kid's constitution"" and playing all sorts of make-believe games involving everything from TV cartoon characters to the lives of subatomic particles.

> Also, I now think that my elementary school education in Thousand Oaks was actually very good --- I was just an arrogant little kid at 17 who dismissed it in high school looking back because it had seemed very easy by comparison. But it built confidence and encouraged a love of learning and curiosity --- e.g. my 4th grade teacher put up with my childhood fascination with nuclear weaponry (I shudder to think of what would happen today to a kid who was fascinated by nuclear weapons) and fusion reactors. My 5th grade teacher let me do my own thing vis-a-vis math and reading. I also learned great lessons in macroeconomics, taxation, and public spending from an elementary school experiment of trying to create a class-room-sized economy. In junior high, I remember one of the highlights was trying to simulate trials for figures from history and writing our own constitution. And learning how to do research papers (I did mine on the works of Isaac Asimov) in English classes --- the first place you get exposed to scholarly thinking. At those ages, I think it is good to focus on actual learning instead of worrying about some absurd attempt at measuring performance. I never thought about any standardized test. Ever. It is sad that many of you can't say the same.

> Anyway, the cusp of high school and the years of college are a magical time. You feel your powers coming in, and it is exhilarating. Especially at a place like Berkeley where every hard homework makes you stronger. The joy of actually feeling the magic flowing through you. It is simply indescribable. You all should enjoy it. All the tiredness will fall away and leave your memory. You'll just remember the fun.
Anant's a real prodigy and he really really loves Cal. Even when he was a grad student at MIT he told everybody who would listen that his dream was to be a prof at Cal. Provably, he did choose Cal among all other places he could have joined as professor. 
The most important question and answer:

Q: What was your favourite anime? I bet it was Ranma 1/2.

A:
>This was before Miyazaki's work was mainstream in the USA. So, for me, I would have to include his great films at the top of the anime list back from those days. In particular from back then: Laputa, Nausicaa, and Totoro. Other works that I still remember (which I guess makes them my favorites from back then) were, in no particular order: Vampire Princess Miyu, Record of Lodoss War, Ranma 1/2, Kimagure Orange Road, Oh My Goddess!, and yes, Urusei Yatsura (which I remember not liking quite as much as Ranma 1/2). I, of course, watched many many more including lots involving big robots. But those blur together in my mind after 20+years.  
 
>Watching anime at the Berkeley club was particularly fun back then because a lot of the subs were actually fan subs --- many done by the active club members. So we were watching things that simply were completely unavailable to anyone else.

-weaker student
I'm transferring to Berkeley Engineering in the Fall and this terrifies me.  And I was just starting to convince myself that it's normal to feel intimidated by the rigor of Cal.  I can't say that I've ever ""fired on all cylinders"" though, so maybe that's a good sign. :/
I'm graduating this semester then starting a PhD program in option II EECS in the fall and recently I've been going around thanking all of the professors that helped me get to where I am. I want to express my gratitude to Professor Sahai because I would be nowhere without the three courses I took with him but I'm scared that he'll ask me what I'm doing with my life... I know he will say the same thing to me D':  
You don't think that getting into MIT for grad school might be an indication that you had what it takes to compete at that level? 
Will be taking his class in fall, any tips on how to do well? I heard the practice problems are tedious, is there anything else I should be expecting?
A student asked:

> ""Sahai has been accepted at the University of California, Berkeley, and has also applied to the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University.""

> http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon

> Why did you and your brother choose Berkeley instead of some other school? What about Berkeley stood out to you?

Sahai replied:

> Berkeley is the best, of course! Why else? Berkeley essentially has more top ranked departments than anywhere else in the world. That was true then as it is true now. Berkeley is the number one choice of winners of the National Science Foundation fellowship for graduate study. Despite being smaller than MIT as far as science and engineering go. This is true now, but I didn't think about this when I was in high school. I just knew that when it came to academic reputation, nobody really tops Berkeley. I had also heard the reputation of Berkeley as a place that didn't pull any punches or coddle students. It expects the best and doesn't care if people suffer. That no-compromise stance appealed to me as compared to places like Stanford. 

> I also was drawn to Berkeley's comprehensive excellence. It isn't just the best in Engineering and Science, it is a powerhouse in the humanities, social sciences, and the arts. In my mind then, that was one of the main negatives of MIT. CalTech was just too small for my taste. In hindsight, I think that I expected too much interaction across the humanities and engineering. So while I took a full year of Sanskrit at Berkeley and attended a few courses outside the Northeast Quadrant of campus, my connections to the rest of campus were mostly through attending the occasional seminar or evening talk. (MIT has those too and when I was there, I actually took Sanskrit literature courses at Harvard for a bit before deciding that I was too busy and riding the #1 bus a few times a week was too much commuting for me.) Stanford is also well rounded but I didn't perceive it as such when I was in high school. 

> I had visited both Berkeley and Stanford in the summer --- and the intellectual vibe and intensity at Berkeley really hit me. The city around campus was also different for me --- having grown up in SoCal suburbia. 

> Honestly, I don't think there was ever a day that I ever regretted going to Berkeley as an undergrad. I got the best possible education in every possible dimension. And looking back, it made sense. I was Berkeley's type. 

> As a faculty member, I have come to increasingly feel that while Berkeley is spectacular for super strong students like I was (and most of my friends who were all in HKN, etc.), **lots of weaker students would be better off elsewhere at places that are generally more supportive.** Our EECS model (and 70 in particular) of high expectations tempered with high levels of support is a bit of the exception on this campus. And even our support presumes that students have ample capacity in reserve after doing very well at high school. (Again, like me. In high school, studying schoolwork more than an hour or so per day after school was rare. I studied other stuff for fun, hacked computer programs, did origami, etc.) **The student who was firing on all cylinders and only then able to hit high marks in high school --- the pain that awaits them here makes me shudder at times. It isn't the party line, but I have to say it out of compassion for students: I think that this university doesn't always support all the high-striving students that it admits. And that isn't fair. If we take someone on striving, we should have supportive paths for people who are striving. But we largely don't. So students make heroic efforts. And maybe that grows their character and makes them better people. But there is a pretty wide stream of tears that flows through Strawberry Creek into the Bay.**

A student asked:

> ""The student who was firing on all cylinders and only then able to hit high marks in high school --- the pain that awaits them here makes me shudder at times. It isn't the party line, but I have to say it out of compassion for students: I think that this university doesn't always support all the high-striving students that it admits.""

> +1. I studied my hardest in high school to get into Berkeley, which has been far harder than my high school. I try my hardest and frequently score below the average (sometimes a standard deviation below the average) on tests.

> I sometimes wonder whether it would have been better to study somewhere else. Less rigor and less pain, more support and hopefully better test scores.

> What would you recommend Berkeley do to support students in this situation?

Sahai replied:

> It is because of students like you that I wrote what I wrote. 

> I think that for students in your shoes, the most basic thing that Berkeley can/should do is provide an on-ramp. A recognition that not everyone gets through material at the same pace and that some people just need more time to get up to speed. Firstly, the unit minimums are just insane. Why not let someone take 6-7 years through the system? If they aren't just taking lots of courses, then who are they hurting? It's not like they are taking seats away from someone else. This way, students can choose whether they want to take the slow and steady path where they could work hard to build themselves up. Yes, it's a few more years of your precious youth and $100K or more in lost income. But for some, the sacrifice is worth it. For others, not so much. Let people make that choice. Second, the campus should support the development of self-paced companions to core courses --- this way, there would be a more structured set of resources available for students who want to spend more time on a course. Third, students should be able to self-declare an incomplete in a course if they want to take it spread out over two semesters --- or a semester and a summer. Since this does take up extra seats, instructor permission should be required. But looking at the distributions in 70, we would be talking about at most 30% max of the students taking this option. This could be compensated for by giving such students lower priority in their choice of section times, etc. 

> More controversially, I think that Berkeley should offer two options that are not offered now. (1) Slow-start admission --- where students are told that we would love to have them here, but only after they complete a couple of years of courses somewhere that can help bring them up to speed in an environment that is a better transition. This could be a CC or it could be another UC or a CSU or even a place like Harvey Mudd. As long as they meet the required grades at this less competitive place, we should tell them that they are in. We know how to deal with transfers, but some people should be pre-emptive transfers. This combined with the on-ramp ideas above should probably take care of many cases. The transition will be smoother for many if it is less abrupt. For many, it could simply be a matter of style. There are plenty of other ways to teach people the basics.

> (2) Berkeley should have a system that is the equivalent of the ""minor leagues"" in baseball. For many students, they don't know that they would've been better off elsewhere until they actually show up here and experience it. But by then, all their other offers have evaporated. They're stuck. And if they leave, there is no clear way back. I think that at the very least, the other UCs should participate. A lot of students who struggle here could be stars at Riverside, Merced, Davis or Santa Cruz. Confidence matters and if there was an easy path to another UC, a lot of people would/should take it. Then, after they have built up their basic skills and rebuilt their confidence, let them have an honest shot at transferring back if they want it and feel they would benefit. Let them visit for a semester. Try it out again. Then (if they do well), let them decide if they would rather complete their degree here or back where they were sent.

> Basically, the system needs to be built to help people succeed rather than just giving them a shot. 

> What I would actively oppose is simply reducing the intensity of the Berkeley education in an effort to be more inclusive or supportive. The world needs many different kinds of places just like it needs many different kinds of people. Harvey Mudd exists. They have a kinder gentler approach to CS. That is good for many. Kudos to Harvey Mudd for supporting that. But I think that Berkeley's style of uncompromisingly intense education is also something that is important to have in the world. What does ""access"" even mean if you take away the very thing that people want to access?

A student asked:

> ""I think that at the very least, the other UCs should participate. A lot of students who struggle here could be stars at Riverside, Merced, Davis or Santa Cruz.""

> Wouldn't this be offensive to those other UCs though? It's like saying if you can't make it at MIT, you should go to Berkeley. Those other UCs would become the ""backup schools"" and serve like CCs that you try to transfer out of rather than institutions where you get your full undergraduate learning.

Sahai replied:

> If someone can't make it at MIT, they'd get wiped out here. MIT is better at supporting weaker students. For many students who are struggling here, they would be better served at MIT. For others, even MIT's support model can't help them. Many of those would be better served at Stanford which has yet a different model. Harvey Mudd is another place that is very good about supporting students who would struggle here.

> What I am saying is that there are different styles of teaching that work well for different students. Intensity is only one dimension. We believe it is very important for making the ""special ops ninjas"" that we like to train. But not everyone wants to be a ""special ops ninja."" When they were choosing Berkeley, they had no idea what that even meant. Many people had very little idea what they were getting into. (Not everyone has PhD parents and family friends who know what different schools are really like.) There are even people out there who (shudder) actually believe that the US News and World Report rankings for undergrad places overall mean something. (They don't realize that most of the faculty members in the most of those places would rather be at Berkeley than where they are.) What matters is how well students do in terms of getting something out of the courses and how well they contribute to the campus community. 

> If someone is mismatched at Berkeley and finds a better learning environment at Riverside, that shouldn't be bad for either Berkeley, the student, or Riverside. Nobody should accept slackers. I am talking about the hard-working students who just find themselves mismatched. Helping students is more important.

A student wrote:

> I keep hearing that Berkeley doesn't support students, but professors and TAs have weekly office hours and student groups like HKN have tutoring sessions. There doesn't seem to be a lack of support here. You and a lot of other people say MIT, Stanford, Harvey Mudd, and other UCs provide more support than Berkeley.

> What kind of services/support do they provide that Berkeley doesn't provide?

Sahai replied:

> We in EECS support students pretty well. It is not clear other departments here do as much as we do. But as I said before, all of our support is predicated on students being able to put in the time. We currently have no real mechanisms to support students who are simply hitting their maximum waking hours limit. At most of our competitors (MIT is a possible exception for certain courses where they are pretty much like us), there is simply less stuff in the courses at less depth. So there is more headroom in which support can be activated. That is the main advantage that other UCs can provide. A pace that is more manageable for many people.

> I love Berkeley. But it isn't for everyone.

A student wrote:

> Oh, so you're saying that Berkeley covers material at much more depth and at a faster pace while other universities don't? Is there any hard evidence or studies for this, or is it just anecdotal? It's difficult to believe that MIT, CIT, or CMU (for example) aren't as challenging (or more challenging) than Berkeley.

> Is it also because Berkeley is on the semester system so covers more material and most of the UCs aren't? Would changing to a quarterly system make the pace more manageable for more people?

> ""there is simply less stuff in the courses at less depth. So there is more headroom in which support can be activated.""

> What kind of support do they activate that we at Berkeley can't activate because of more depth? Andrew of 61A and Mona of 61B do Guerilla sections. Is that the kind of support they activate—more help from the TAs at a more individualized level?

Sahai replied:

> I know only from courses that I have taught personally as well as from courses that I saw when I was an undergrad vs when I was a graduate student, and conversations with my colleagues at other schools. MIT, CMU, and CalTech are pretty close to us in general. But for example, compare the old 126 (before 70 became a required prereq) to MIT's 6.041. There was a pretty big difference in depth. (And there had to be --- 6.041 serves more majors than just EECS.) New 126 has 70 required so the comparison isn't even fair anymore.

> But in general, the following is a representative comment from faculty elsewhere (not MIT/CalTech/CMU): ""I wish we could teach that here, but we don't have Berkeley students. Our kids won't put up with that sort of intensity."" as well as ""I don't have the TAs that could pull that off.""  

> Like I said in the first lecture, I like Berkeley students. :-)
lol @ no dragon ball z. What a joke of a list.
It's been cancelled?!? Do you know why? I heard Professor Sahai is teaching CS 70 again in the fall, but I assumed EE 121 would be pushed to Spring. 
He said on the first day of CS70 this semester that he only applied to Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT for both undergrad and grad school, and got into all three both times.
[deleted]
Read the published lecture notes before lecture and work out the proofs yourself after reading through them. Then read through the notes again. Then start the homework, and finish at least before the weekend so you can re-do everything you did wrong. Repeat every week for a semester. 

Or just skip Sahai's semester and take it with an easier professor.
Same as elephonky said. I also highly recommend finding a group of people to work on the homeworks together with. Sahai also runs weekly homework parties (basically large group office hours) where you can get help from TAs if needed.

The most important part is start early. Each problem set can easily take 10+ hours.
A student asked:

> What would you say the top things are that an EECS student should ingrain and do these next few years going through college + grad school?

> We missed out on developing the iron man work ethic you got as a young child, but what can we do now to be the best we can be?  What kind of habits should we develop (and how!) and what kind of character traits should we build?  What should we live by?

> If it matters, I feel that my interests match very closely to your interests as a college student in terms of loving the applied math + theory in EECS.

> How does a strong student, who you say can really benefit fully at a place like Berkeley, take themselves to the next level?

Sahai replied:

> Help others. This will help you understand the basics. The basics are the most important.  

> Take challenging classes. This will make you spend time. And spending time is the key to affection.

> And finally, eliminate the emotional barriers that separate yourself from the material. You need to let yourself live and breathe it. To feel it flowing through you. To understand the nature of its existence. It might seem corny, but you have to let yourself truly love the subject.

Another student wrote:

> Hi Professor,

> I really loved the response. Quick question though - you mentioned that your parent had ""general rules, no studying the night before an exam"". Did this always work out for you and your brother?

> Also, were there any other study routines that your parents enforced that you found particularly different than other students?

Sahai replied:

> The idea was simple: studying is an integrated part of our existence, not some sort of weird exceptional activity. So, if someone has a birthday party, you go to the birthday party. Studying or homework or an exam is not an excuse not to go. Family obligations come first. Because, first and foremost, you are an integral part of your family. 

> My parents grew up in joint families and felt that we should have some approximation of that family feeling of having many kinsmen. So, they concentrated on making sure that we had a group of family friends who were as close as kin. Family values must be lived to be shared and propagated.

> I think that the biggest difference that I see between my upbringing and many students today is just the vast amounts of unstructured free time that my brother and I enjoyed. (Maybe we took swimming lessons when we were younger.) All of summers growing up were largely free time. As were essentially all afternoons and weekends. We did whatever we wanted. Explored whatever we wanted to explore. Dug holes. Read about bugs. Made lego armies. Decided to make origami cranes. Played cards. Wrote our own little computer programming language interpreter. Whatever. My parents believed that childhood is for being a child. And the essence of childhood is playing and curiosity. We had close family friends and would get together every week at least, and with some family friends, every other day. Then us kids would play. Free-form make-believe play, as well as the usual suspects of tag, hide-and-go-seek, etc. Little to no adult supervision. Sometimes, we would just read. Or tell each other stories. Or puzzles. One of my family friends (she was also one of my co-valedictorians from my high school and also came to Berkeley) did Rubics cubes and taught herself card-tricks --- the great thing was when she went from having a finite number of card tricks to having an infinite number. (She would never repeat the same trick twice unless we forced her too.) 

> I feel sad for students today whose lives are so structured or who are under the tyranny of their mobile phone. 

> Anyway, our parents weren't really in the loop overtly. As the Tao Te Ching wisely says:

A student wrote:

> Hi Professor Sahai!

> It's been very intriguing reading your responses in this thread--I really appreciate you taking your time to answer these questions for us! :)

> I've noticed all semester that you have a disdain for social media and cell phones. This definitely makes sense in the context of a college professor and a college class--Students waste time playing Candy Crush or chatting on Facebook when they should be studying and therefore do worse on exams. But after your response here it seems like your dislike for procrastination-prone technology goes past studying and work ethic. The line, ""I feel sad for students today whose lives are so structured or who are under the tyranny of their mobile phone"" is really interesting for me. Can you explain what you mean? One could argue that last decade's card games are this decade's Words with Friends. And, in what ways (besides cell phones, social media, etc.) do you think students' lives today are more structured?

Sahai replied:

> There is a huge difference between a card game, where we can all decide to change the rules mid-hand, and ""Words with Friends."" In one, you are in charge and empowered. In the other, you have to follow somebody else's rules because the silicon serves only one master --- and that isn't you.

> But I was referring mostly to kids whose parents plan out nearly every hour of every day --- maybe giving them a couple of hours of freedom per day. That is horrible! And then, to see that kid trade that precious freedom away to just wear the pretty shackles prepared by someone else?!? Even worse. A golden cage is still a cage.

A student wrote:

> Do you think a kid's time is better spent exploring on his/her own rather than going to after-school programs or team sports?

> I think it's interesting that you emphasize free time so much when you spent the first lecture showing us guidelines for planning out the 24 hours of our day :) Do you think free time is still beneficial to college students?

Sahai replied:

> I think that free time spent in curiosity-driven intellectual exploration is beneficial to everyone. 

> Free-time spent on Facebook, Snapchat, etc. is not. 

> My point was that exploring stuff related to your classes is a kind of free time when it comes to college students. Because you choose your courses freely.

A student wrote:

> I don't consider 10-15+ hours of 70 homework every week to be free time. :0

MIT thought you have what it takes. I doubt they are wrong. You could have more faith in yourself.
Thanks you for the tips. I'm planning to prepare over summer too, any advice on how I should approach it?
thank you!
how you do at mit
Enjoy your summer. Make an app. Get a job. Go camping. Get drunk.

Seriously, unless you have absolutely nothing better to do, wait until the semester starts to deal with CS70. You could read lecture notes from this semester and do the homeworks, but I would be really impressed if you got past the second or third homework. They were an ungodly amount of work. 
thank you :)"

What is this thread? It is seriously disrespectful to Professor Sahai. Moderators should really take a look at this thread. This is going too far. I know that Prof. Sahai has become a meme, but this thread and its comments are unacceptable.

To answer the question in the title, no Professor Sahai has a perfect American accent.

Yeah the dude's a Californian through and through. To the other extent, I'm sure Sahai loves the bitching and moaning of these low-level folks as he chills with DARPA money and the hottest GPAs
What is an American accent
I don't know. I'm no linguist, if I used a term I shouldn't have used I apologize. I myself am international, I just wanted to express that Professor Sahai speaks just like people whose native language is English and are not from England or something like that, and not like me whose native language is not English and sometimes pronounce words wrong.

My intention to write that sentence was mostly because Prof. Sahai is a very eloquent and clear speaker. Unfortunately, due to some disagreements I don't really like him as a professor (with all due respect), but if there is one thing that's true, Sahai is a top notch public speaker."
I just had a discovery about Prof Sahai,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s9tp1u/i_just_had_a_discovery_about_prof_sahai/,2022-01-21 20:08:29,"First and foremost: if this is well-known information, I apologize for wasting your time. But this was very interesting for me.

Ok so I was browsing Youtube today procrastinating work, and then this guy called Amit Sahai turned up on some ""Explain ... in 5 levels"" video. He was a CS prof at UCLA. I thought to myself hmmm, I know another Sahai that's a CS professor and they looked a bit alike - are they related?

So I set off on my research journey. First thing that came up was Prof Amit Sahai (from UCLA)'s wikipedia page and from there I learned that he's 47-48 years old, and was born in Thousand Oaks, CA. Went to Cal for undergrad, MIT for grad and PhD. On the other hand, our Prof Anant Sahai also went to Cal for undergrad, MIT for grad & PhD, as per his EECS page. Through some other website that contained perhaps too much information, I learned that Prof Anant Sahai was born about 2 years before Amit. Across both space and time, so far evidence seem to confirm my hypothesis. However, it could all be a coincidence and information could be wrong, so I have to have solid proof, so I wasn't 100% convinced.

Then, I stumbled upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/24x0d9/professor_anant_sahai_as_a_berkeley_undergraduate/) reddit post, where a LA Times article back the 1990s was linked. In the article, we know that Prof Anant Sahai was a \*Thousand Oaks\* HS Senior at the time of writing. and in the AMA Prof Anant Sahai referred to his \*brother\* multiple times. He mentioned that his brother came to Berkeley a little later than him, confirming the aforementioned age difference. He also mentioned winning the ACM with him (very impressive), and guess what? The wikipedia article says Prof Amit Sahai also won that too. Very cool stuff.

So yeah I spent half an hour of my life to comprehensively prove that Prof Sahai has a younger brother that teaches CS at UCLA. Looking back at it I think the conclusion is already fairly conclusive just because they look alike but what do I know. Also, if one of the Prof Sahai's reads this and doesn't like it, I'll be happy to take it down. Thanks for coming to my TED talk","yeah they're brothers. he's brought it up when he was teaching CS70.
So what do they call EE 16B at UCLA?
Yeah, I saw the same video and remembered from
an old piazza post where Sahai did a Q&A that his brother was a professor, so I put two and two together. 

His brother has a significantly higher h-score and (from some course reviews I found) seems to be much less unorthodox as a professor lol.
They do look alike, that’s crazy 😭
Thanks for this. Needed a good distraction this lonely ass Friday night
man's got an h-index of 85 sheeeeesh
I was recommended that same video and went down that same rabbit hole. lmao

The text here is too small.","
Throughout the semester our readers have been flagging homework submissions for potential academic misconduct. Over the past week we’ve reviewed all the cases brought up so far and have found a non-trivial number of cases of academic dishonesty on the homework, including use of solutions from past semesters, and copying directly off another student’s work. 
Given our generous HW policy of multiple drops, allowing collaboration, hosting HW parties, counting 75% as full credit, and allowing resubmissions where you are allowed to look at solutions, we are quite disappointed that some students chose to cheat anyway --- when simple sincere effort would have gotten them full HW credit even if they were far behind in the course.
Given the volume of cases this semester, we’ve decided to open up a form where you can confess to cheating on one or more homework assignments. 
If you have never looked at past official solutions, copied off someone, or let someone copy off you, you can stop reading here. We have a process in place which makes sure you will not be falsely punished.
We expect some degree of collaboration - collaboration is totally okay (and encouraged) as long as you did not copy solutions from someone (or let someone copy off you). We will not accuse you just because you have similar solutions to someone you worked with.
We also do not consider looking at official solutions for doing HW redos as cheating so don't worry about that.
EDIT: Using online resources to solve problems (as long as you are not copying verbatim) is fine and permitted under our course policies, as long as the resources are properly cited. If you used external resources and properly cited your sources, you do not need to worry. Similarly, if you used external resources and did not cheat, but forgot to cite, do not worry about it at this point – we will not punish you for forgetting to cite, but please remember to do so in the future. If you insist on telling us that you forgot to cite, we have added an item to the form so that you can do so, without punishment – feel free to submit if it helps you stay calm.
If you cheated and you confess to every incident, we will record this and simply apply the penalty of a 0% on each impacted homework assignment. Nothing more. With the P/NP policies in place and homework being a relatively small portion of your overall grade, this is really not that big a punishment to bear.
If you cheated and you do not confess, we will give you a score between -200% and a 0% in the entire homework category depending on how many homeworks you cheated on. We will also report you to the Center for Student Conduct with a recommendation for dismissal. Depending on the severity of the case we may also cap your overall grade at a D+ and convey a block-on-declaration if you are an L&S student. (The special policies for declaration this semester will not apply to you vis-a-vis 70.)
We saw several cases where students attempted to cover up the fact that they were copying official solutions. Rest assured that this is pretty easy to spot. Changing notation here and there, replacing a couple words with propositional logic or other symbols, summarizing some English but having the exact same solution structure on many, many problems, etc. does not do the trick. You do not see what we see - the widely varied approaches, the messy tangents, the quirky notation of every other student who did not cheat. We also saw that if a student was flagged for one submission, it was highly likely (>90%) that evidence for cheating would be found on other submissions. A body of evidence and pattern of behavior like this, even if each individual instance is not a direct copy of solutions, is enough to build an academic dishonesty case.
If you cheated, you have until Friday 4/24 at 11:59 PM (PDT) to confess at this form."

Spring 2013 cheating thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1jmspf/professor_anant_sahai_fighting_cheating_in_cs70/

Anant Sahai said that the punishment for egregious cheaters who are in the ""tens of students"" will be severe:

> **Egregious cheaters who do not confess fully and completely will be reported and recommended for expulsion from the university. They will also fail the course. Instructions will be disseminated to all other instructors for CS70 recommending that they fail the course forever unless completely cleared by the student conduct process.**

> **First, an important point of fact: We actually have had readers look at essentially every single part of every single problem that you have submitted. (Not just a random sample.) So, we already have enough information to convict all cases of blatant grade-inflation. Quite frankly, there aren't very many. Most of you can take a deep breath and relax.**

Anant Sahai's full post on the classroom forum today:

> **Official decision regarding cheating and self-grades**

> **TL;DR version: Blanket amnesty for all ±1-point-per-part shadings of partial credit. Reader-scores will be used to autocalibrate minor variations among students to keep things fair in light of the amnesty. Partial reader-scores will be released to you so you can compare. Full confessions prevent recommendations for expulsion for actual cheaters. Nobody needs to resubmit grades preemptively. Honest students can rest easy.**

> Thank you all for sharing your thoughts and ideas. We have taken them all into account and are going to adopt a policy that is designed to be fair to everyone, and hopefully, to reduce your stress levels considerably. We are particularly sensitive to concerns that lots of innocent students shouldn't be stressed or inconvenienced on account of a few folks. We also want to make sure that the honest-but-scared people don't unfairly undervalue their work with unnecessary regrades. Berkeley shouldn't be a terrifying experience for those who are honest. We feel bad that many of you seemed to get panicked.

> After reading this post carefully, please ask any questions below -- our goal is to reduce confusion and stress as much as possible at this point.

> First, an important point of fact: We actually have had readers look at essentially every single part of every single problem that you have submitted. (Not just a random sample.) So, we already have enough information to convict all cases of blatant grade-inflation. Quite frankly, there aren't very many. Most of you can take a deep breath and relax.

> In terms of process:

> 1. Before Wed Apr 30th (till midnight on Tuesday), we will accept confessions and explanations of context from anyone whose conscience is bothering them. **Anyone making a full and complete confession will not be recommended for expulsion from Berkeley.** If you confess and we did not have you on our list already, you will not be any worse off for confessing. So if your conscience is bothering you, just send an email to [a TA's email] telling us what you did (which homeworks, which problems, etc...), why you did it, and so on. Include your CS 70 login (cs70-??) and put the phrase ""homework discrepancy"" somewhere in the title.

> 2. If you weren't on our watch list, we will simply thank you for your confession and you can get on with your life without worrying. Unfortunately we may not be able to respond to all of you quickly, so please do not interpret the lack of a quick response as a sign of guilt or innocence. **This also applies to the many of you who have already contacted us in some way.**

> 3. If you were on our watch list, we will work out what needs to happen as appropriate penance or accept your explanation and just make sure that your homework grade reflects your level of confusion (that made you make grading mistakes that look like egregious cheating).

> 4. There is exactly one case that will provoke our wrath --- a tiny confession when what actually was perpetrated was much bigger. We are not interested in you sounding us out to see if you are suspected. If you have a confession to make, make it fully. This is not a game.

> 5. So you can see what kinds of records we have on you, we are releasing redacted versions of the reader grades for everyone for HW1-7 (half the assignments). For half the parts, we will simply omit our scores completely. For many of the other parts, we will just show you a low-fidelity view of what we have. For other parts, we will show you a detailed view of what we have. This should hopefully help. We have heard your calls for more feedback. You are free to compare against these scores to see how you did vis-a-vis reader scores. See details in a follow-up below.

> 6. **On Wed Apr 30th, we will use glookup to tell the vast majority of you that we do not suspect you of cheating (at least not on the homeworks we have seen so far).** For some, we will still be processing you. Very soon thereafter (ideally mostly on Wed Apr 30th itself), we will use glookup to inform people on our watch-list of egregious cheaters to give them a final chance to defend themselves.  We will also continue clearing people as fast as we can --- because we are manually cross-checking to make sure that nobody is accused only on the basis of an algorithm.

> In terms of what constitutes egregious cheating:

> * For homework submissions themselves, egregious cheating is copying entire assignments or individual problem solutions --- basically not writing them up on your own as you are required to do.

> * For self-grading, egregious cheating is repeated (a couple of isolated mistakes isn't enough) grade-inflation that doesn't stand up to the smell-test. Examples include: giving yourself a 4 on a problem part for an answer which cannot possibly be perfectly correct by any stretch of the imagination. (Absolutely egregious: the problem wasn't even in the submitted pdf file but you gave yourself a 1,2,3, or 4.) In general, a 3 point shift is almost certainly egregious (giving yourself a 4 when you deserved a 1), and a 2 point shift could very well be (0->2 is pretty bad, and 1->3 and 2->4 are suspicious, but need to be looked at individually.). **This isn't a game of ""gotcha"" where you can just accidentally fall into being suspected of cheating.** We carefully examine the full homework record of anyone we suspect before contacting them.

> * The one-point shifts are going to be compensated for by an internal recalibration procedure to prevent anyone from gaining an advantage. We will use the reader scores to properly interpret your scores and shade them up or down. So, if you tend to inflate, we will simply deflate your scores. E.g. If you give yourselves a lot of 2s when you deserved 1s, your 2s will simply transmute into 1s for grade calculation purposes. And the same thing for those who tend to be too harsh on themselves. If a lot of your 1s actually deserve 2s, we will upweight your 1s to compensate. So in a sense, this sort of non-calibrated behavior is simply going to be addressed using normalization techniques, and not disciplinary measures or punishments. You don't need to confess for 1 point shifts about partial credit. Another way to think about this is that there is an effective amnesty for 1 point shifts that is going to be silently compensated for by using reader scores.

> * Again, the main message here is: **Relax. We are not out to get you. We are not cruel and we don't expect you to be finely calibrated master graders. We never did. All we ever wanted and expected was sincere and honest self-reporting.** We will take care of fairness among students on the back end.

> In terms of punishments:

> * ***Egregious cheaters who do not confess fully and completely will be reported and recommended for expulsion from the university. They will also fail the course. Instructions will be disseminated to all other instructors for CS70 recommending that they fail the course forever unless completely cleared by the student conduct process.***

> * Egregious cheaters who do confess fully and completely will have the relevant homework assignment zeroed out completely as punishment. (In special cases, we might even do less than a complete zeroing out.) A temporary note will be placed in their file, but this will not go onto their permanent record as long as they never do this again. We will not recommend expulsion.

> * People who just really want to correct an inflationary bug in their self-grading but who haven't been flagged as suspicious cheaters will just have the bug fixed. (Most of the time, this will have no effect on anything except making some people feel better.)

> * People with reasonable individual variations in how lax or strict they are in giving partial credit, these will simply be properly calibrated to the right place by use of reader-scores to better interpret their own scores.

> * When you confess, you are never telling us something we don't already know in terms of what you did. You are only providing us with a context and showing good faith.

> In summary. There are two cases.

> **Case 1 (You're not already on our list: most everyone in the class --- hundreds of students)**

> Is your conscience bothering you?

> If so, send us a detailed email about your situation. What happens? You feel better. Nothing bad happens.

> If not, do nothing. What happens? Nothing.

> **Case 2 (You're already on our list --- tens of students)**

> Is your conscience bothering you?

> If so, confess fully. We talk with you to work out a fair punishment for your situation. Most likely, this will be a zeroing out of the relevant homeworks. In some cases, it could be less. You will sign a statement saying that you accept this punishment and we will not recommend expulsion.

> If not, do nothing. You will receive an email later this week (or later, in case you cheated on some of the later homeworks). You will have a chance to talk and explain, but the penalties will be much harsher if there is actual cheating (as opposed to such deep confusion that you honestly couldn't tell that your answers were wrong despite seeing the solutions --- in those cases, the relevant homeworks will simply go negative in score to honestly reflect your honestly deep lack of understanding). Actual cheating penalties will begin at grade reductions of 2 letter grades or more (nobody is getting higher than a C- with unconfessed egregious cheating), and default to failing the course plus a recommendation of expulsion from Berkeley. This will go on your permanent record unless you are cleared through the official student conduct process.

> We believe that the above process balances interests in the right way. Most importantly, it allows the vast majority of people who haven't been substantially inflating their grades to just move on without being stressed and having to do a lot of work.","So a lot of people don't care about CS or this scandal, but I don't see why they take the time to look at the thread, downvote, and then leave a comment. Talking about any sort of scandal is healthy, and I think it has led to some interesting discussions in this subreddit. Even though you may not be a CS major, the actions of students in any department will affect you as a Cal student, especially if academic dishonesty is involved. 
A student asked:

> Professor Sahai: in your opinion, were enough people cheating that it was a serious problem? I know it was in 61C last semester and in 61B this semester, but in this class it seems like only a few people self-inflated grades to the point where it was cheating.

Thanks? I assume this went out to all the affected students already, so I'm not sure why this needs it's own thread.
Sahai posted an update at 12:45AM on Monday, April 28, 2014:

> UPDATE 12:45AM on Monday

> It seems that a lot of people are a bit confused about what to do. So let me give you a suggested student path.

> 0) First, take a deep breath. Ask yourself if you think that you have graded yourself honestly and fairly, and not just lazily marked down lots of credit for anything that you sort of did. Allow yourself to feel what your conscience is telling you.

> 1) Take a look at the redacted reader scores that we have released. Compare them against the scores that you gave yourself. Discrepancies that should catch your eyes are ""0"", ""Wrong"" or ""No File"" being given credit by you. Also discrepancies where you were 2 or more points away from the reader. If this is not happening and your conscience is clear, just go to sleep now. (Even if it is the middle of the day, you probably need a nap. So just relax.)

> 2) Take a look at those problems in detail where you have a discrepancy between the reader score and what you graded yourself. Look at the actual file you submitted (and hopefully didn't overwrite) from your account. Look at the solutions. Try to understand what could result in that error. There is always the chance that the reader made a mistake --- they're only human after all. But in many cases, you should ask yourself what kind of error were you making. Were you not showing any work (almost never permitted in this course)? Were you just giving yourself a ton of credit for problems you barely did? Were you just being sloppy and giving yourself a 4 for no reason? Here, expand to look at 1 point discrepancies too to help you understand the kinds of mistakes you were making. 

> 3) If you are certain that the specific discrepancies are just few (say 2 on a particular HW), isolated, and one-off events and most of your grading did not contain such errors, then great. Relax and go to sleep. By this point, the majority of you should be asleep since our analysis shows that the great majority of students are just fine. No reason to suspect them at all.

> 4) If not, then you need to take a fresh look at all your homework grades. Because you might have a pattern of errors that looks like cheating and might very well be cheating/academic-dishonesty. (Remember, being lazy about self-grading is like being lazy about citing sources in a term paper --- no excuse for misrepresenting the nature of your work.) Look at all of your assignments, the corresponding solutions, and your self-grades more carefully. Are your grades correct and proper evaluations of the quality of the work that you actually submitted? If not, start recording this. (This might also be a good time to ask yourself if you copied any homework except for code within your study group --- that is also dishonesty, as is not listing the people you worked with --- with the exception of people at HW party whose names you don't know.)

> 5) Prepare a full confession email to us detailing what you did wrong and on which homeworks and which problem parts. If this email only talks about HW1-7 and/or only about those parts that we have given you feedback on, it is almost certainly incomplete and likely to provoke our wrath. What are the odds that the only places where you have made this mistake is exactly in those places where we made it easy for you to see that you made this mistake? Be serious. People make the same mistakes over and over again. Find where you did so and make sure that your confession is full. Tell us what happened and why. Be honest. 

> 6) In rare cases, all you will see are some bugs in the reader scores. That can happen. If you feel compelled to tell us, go ahead. Or just ignore them. There probably aren't that many.

I had worked so hard on HW XX and XX+1 that I couldn't bear to give myself all 0s or not turn in grades. So I just quickly filled out the form with a random mixture of grades. I don't deserve any of them. 

> > Something like this happened again on HW YY. I was so swamped that I didn't even read the solutions. I just eyeballed my homework and gave myself the score that seemed right to me.

I was in CS 70 Spring 2013 (last year) - I never really understood why they had us grade our own homeworks. What's the point, since it sounds like the readers have had to grade all of everybody's at this point anyway?

Anyway, after the cheating scandal last year, this is interesting to see unfold again.
This is an update for the Berkeley reddit community from the previous thread http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2401hc/cs70_selfgrading_dishonesty/ (which is about to fall off the front page) to show how much care and thought Professor Sahai put into dealing with the self-inflated grades.
Sahai posted an update at 11:15AM on Monday, April 28, 2014:

> Update Monday 11:15AM

> I (Prof. Sahai) feel like I am in the Star Trek Next Generation Episode: ""All good things..."" 

> I cannot help but feel that somehow, the student freakout sentiment filled with fear is being caused by the things that we are doing to try and calm it down. 

> So, here goes a last try:

> Some people seem very confused and think that a computer program gets to decide their fate. This is not true. Everything happens in stages. Computers simply help seed the process. But it is humans (with sympathy and compassion) that use their judgement and decide what is going to happen. 

> Process:

> 0) Algorithms generate lists of people who might be suspicious. These are flagged. (Not accused, just flagged. This is what the homework problem was asking you to look at. The point was simple, cheaters cannot hide in a crowd. They will with high probability be filtered into a smaller more manageable group.)

> 1) We go through these people by hand looking at where the algorithms tell us to start, but then looking at the big picture. This lets us tell who might be in deep trouble and which cases are different.

> 2) We contact people who have been confirmed by a human and talk to them. Give them a chance to explain, but with the understanding that very little sympathy can be given to people for real cheating that they confess was bad and they will never do again, after they have already been caught.

> People keep asking us why we don't just send out emails. That was always our plan. We were doing it at our slow and steady pace because we don't want to send out mails to people on the basis of a computer and just say ""defend yourself."" That seems cruel. So we want to clear people before we send out emails. **It sucks to get an accusatory email. I know: some poor saps stole my printouts when I was a student in 61B and copied my code. I got called in. It was annoying. The others confessed before I actually had to meet with Prof. Hilfinger. (They really chose the wrong person to copy off of --- I had all these jokes and allusions in my code with my choices of return values and variable names.) But the experience stuck in my mind and reminded me that measure-twice-cut-once is not just for carpentry.**

> For us in 70, suddenly people started freaking out. (For no apparent reason. The plot was the exact opposite of a freak-out-plot. It was suggesting that there are only a few outliers and a small number of people near the border that we need to look more closely at.) And then this freaking out started snowballing. So we tried to calm people down by saying that you had nothing to worry about and that if you really were worried that you had done something wrong, you could just tell us why you were worried and we would be more lenient not more harsh. That made people freak out more because now they started to wonder if they should try to get on our good side. But we don't have a bad side. So there is nothing to worry about. We aren't cruel monsters. Just stay calm and do what your conscience tells you to do. 

> **NOBODY IS GOING TO BE EXPELLED ON THE BASIS OF AN HONEST MISTAKE.**

> Relax. How can I say this more clearly? Relax. Take a deep breath. 
So why not post it in that thread? Sahai made nearly the exact same post last year when this happened, so this isn't really anything new.
These posts are completely different (cheating on the final exam versus self-inflating homework grades).

Professor Sahai's nuanced approach to each is well worth reading for those interested in how professors can deal with academic dishonesty.

I did not post it in the previous thread because it is falling off the front page."
Professor Anant Sahai Fighting Cheating in CS70 Spring 2013,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1jj7z5/professor_anant_sahai_fighting_cheating_in_cs70/,2013-08-01 17:48:03,"I was a student in [CS70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/sp13/) last semester (Spring 2013 with [Professor Anant Sahai](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/)).

There was cheating on the final, and Professor Sahai posted the following vehement note on the classroom forum:

> We have received disturbing reports of observed cheating on the final --- people copying answers and continuing past when time was called.

> **If you yourself cheated, I *strongly* urge you to confess. We will be significantly more lenient with those that confess. If you don't, we will throw the book at you and work as hard as possible to have you expelled from Berkeley and possibly, to have your name and reputation ruined for all time. (Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)**

>For those of you who saw something, please comment (anonymously (or not) as a follow-up in Piazza, or by sending us an email) telling us
>a. if you saw this,
>b. where roughly you were in the room,
>c. where the cheaters were.

>If you know or suspect who the cheaters were (or can provide a description), please report that too if you can. Your accusation will not result in anyone being falsely accused as we have all the exams scanned in and will only proceed on the basis of hard evidence. It will just allow us to more swiftly verify it and most importantly, to isolate those scores from our thinking as we adjust grade thresholds.

>It is really important in this case because we are trying to be fair to everyone in adjusting the grading to compensate for the unfortunate and unforeseen loss of 15 minutes. The cheaters are going to be *hurting* the grades of all the honest students in the class. They deserve no mercy or loyalty after doing such a despicable act to their fellow students. Please think of the good of all of the other students in the class and help us quickly find and isolate them from the sample.

>We have tried our best to make a fair exam with a chance for students at all levels of ability to demonstrate their understanding, we let you drop questions on the final, we made a special practice exam whose difficulty was calibrated *above* the actual exam, we released a specially made exam skeleton to reduce any uncertainty about the format, we allowed students to bring 3 handwritten sheets of paper, and we offered ample extra credit opportunities in the class. **We created and staffed homework parties and study parties to help students both interact with each other and get attention in what would otherwise be a large and impersonal class. To have students cheat in this context is extremely upsetting to me. To do so brazenly, in view of their peers, is a shameless act that is simply shocking. I have never seen such a thing in one of my own classes in my years at Berkeley.**

>For those who saw something, do not enable this kind of behavior in others. This is not normal. It should not be tolerated. They are contaminating your environment by their presence.

And later:

>UPDATE:
>Our estimates show that the extent of the truly egregious cheating seems to have been quite limited --- less than 2% of the class. We have had confessions and detailed reporting that has helped us in the process of identifying perpetrators. Those guilty really should confess if they know what is good for them. **As Brian Harvey has eloquently put it, cheating is fundamentally a violation against yourself.** Character is built out of habits, and cheating is a very bad and addictive habit. **Cultivating good habits and shunning bad ones is absolutely critical in your life, especially your youth when your character is most malleable. The violence cheating does to your intuitions of right and wrong is a terrible thing.** It is not too late. If you come forward without prompting, it'll be like stealing something that was in a sealed package and returning it without it being either opened or missed. We will be lenient and your character (and grades) will benefit greatly.

>For those of you who know something, please do step forward and report what you know to us. We've got lots of info, but your corroboration is very important. This is a matter of solidarity with your fellow classmates --- unrepentant cheaters have violated all of you. They must be rejected.

A student wrote:

You do not have to do L&S breadths for a minor. Alternatively, you might also want to look into the engineering math/stats major, which is in the college of engineering.

It is slightly true, but I do think that it shows commitment to learning that you would not get by just taking a smattering of classes. In my case, I was in EECS and taking a bunch of Math upper divs simultaneously. It just so happened that double majoring required only a few more classes, so I did it. I don't regret that at all. 

Sahai is right that grad schools may not care since they see your transcripts anyway, but I think it could give you a leg up when applying for a job. Especially if it is a job which requires greater mathematical understanding than your typical engineering job, e.g. Deep learning. 
[deleted]
Sounds like he's bad at math.
math 127 was not well thought out
the US cares.
What's formality and why do we care? Is there a level of rigor that officially declares something to be now formal? Did we construct it as a badge? If it's the case, then those who present an argument for understanding Godel's theorems should be lauded as being one of the most educated in the field of math. (I think this should never happen).
She's not wrong
He's a 45 year old computer scientist in the bay area barely making $130k/year, he should be advising anyone.
In terms of cost:benefit, it's one of the worst choices you can possibly make.

Instead of investing all that time in a double major, you could instead get (more) research experience, do more extra curriculars, work on notable personal projects, or do any number of things that are infinitely more valuable to a resume or application.

Research experience is probably the most obvious choice; there are lots of options and you'll get a really solid letter of rec out of it (assuming you're not lazy or an idiot).

I served on my dept's admissions committee; we literally don't care about double majors.  If anything, it demonstrates that you don't understand what's a valuable use of your time.
Yes. The only time it would be important to double major in math instead of just taking a lot of math classes is if you wanted to apply for grad school in math.
I think it's true. I had a lot of friends with and without double majors and I don't think it really made a difference for anyone in terms of job or grad school success. I've also participated on an admissions committee for incoming MS and PhD students and no one on the committee cared about double majors. In the context of grad school admissions, at least, your GPA and what you do outside of class matter much more. 

The classes in a different subject definitely help people expand their breadth of knowledge, which can be helpful depending on their career goals, but the extra ""degree"" itself doesn't seem to make a difference. Just hand-picking relevant electives would have probably been just as effective. 
It definitely is. Double majors are only useful for signaling on resumes. If you want to do anything that requires higher level math, your transcript becomes much more important than your resume. 
To be fair, as an EECS major, there are 5 classes you need to take for the major (aside from 7 breadth) -- Math 110, 113, 104, 185, 128A. As someone entering grad school next year, among these, I only felt like 185 was a waste of my time.

On the other hand, if you're just taking these courses just for the sake of taking them, Sahai's advice rings true.
Absolutely true.  Nobody really cares that much what your exact major is, either.  On the other hand, the badge collecting aspect of it can help some people stay motivated.

I feel like it is definitely true, but to an extent. 

The decision to double-major, from my perspective, depends on the person and the reason as to why they want to pursue it. No one can decide a student's educational path except themselves. 

A lot of the times people double-major not to ""collect badges"" but to take coursework in something they genuinely love/are interested in, supplement the current major that they are in, gather more knowledge about a topic they are curious about, and then get rewarded for it. 

Some other times, they do it to, yes, add a little pizazz to their diploma or their resume. (What exactly is so wrong with that though?)

But from my personal experience, most people do it because they have an actual interest in their studies, not because they want to reach a certain checkpoint, if that makes sense. 
[deleted]
also they’re well thought out given the time
False; Proof by contradiction: I care. Well, who am I to say it matters that I care? Me @ the very least. Don't care? Well, see.
I'm happy Sahai cares about education and lauds those with degrees at the end. Don't question it now.
He
As Talex mentions, given Sahai's contributions to the field, he can probably rake in a 7 figure salary if he decided to enter industry, but that's not what he cares about.

I hope you don't judge people solely based off of their annual salary :)
he can choose to get paid more EASILY, but he chose to pursue his passion in teaching students.
> I served on my dept's admissions committee; we literally don't care about double majors. If anything, it demonstrates that you don't understand what's a valuable use of your time.

This.

Source: Decades of working and hiring in the real world.
Why do you feel that way about 185? Im asking cause I also want to go to grad school and was considering taking it.
I agree with this. I think it's a little unfair to imply that people double-majoring in a different subject are doing it solely to ""collect badges."" I, for one, kept taking math classes because I really enjoyed them, and I followed the math major coursework largely because I wanted to explore the various foundational aspects that Berkeley teaches. At some point, I just needed one more class for the major, so it seemed silly not to just declare. I'm trying to figure out whether Sahai is tailoring his response specifically to math -- because otherwise one could make the argument that there's no point in majoring at all (which is probably true), yet you still need to obey the rules at Berkeley to graduate. Is the implication that math double majors are specifically especially worthless? Idk, this argument just seems a little pointless/unnecessary in my opinion
got a copy? i remember hearing he took every honors class he got his hands on lol
[deleted]
I was really looking forward to it for two reasons - one was that my friends at other schools were telling me how beautiful and elegant the theory was, and the other was because I had a really good experience in 104. 

However, when I took it, the course was so computational and dry. We didn't prove anything... I didn't gain any mathematical maturity NOR learn anything that I needed for research. If I were to do it again, I would take H185 instead.

What type of program are you applying for? If it's something more applied (like robotics and controls) where you could benefit from learning how to tackle complex integrals, taking regular 185 may be useful.

But as with any advice, this is purely anecdotal, so your mileage may vary

[deleted]
FWIW I had the same experience as you with 185. I think it's just very poorly taught at cal
Oh I have a while before I apply, it's just something I was considering. It sounds like you might have just gotten a bad professor, that doesn't sound like a normal 185 class. Thanks though! 
he scares me too much
[previously deleted comment] if the degree you are signed up for matters, taking the same course(a) isn’t truly the same. what you feed is what you follow, what you follow is not only what you feed but rather a combination of what’s related as well. collective failure to recognize deference towards an embodiment of ideas, processes, and identity is a failure to recognize the kind of game you're in with education. I'm not sitting at a second commencement with everyone. The badge causes a transformative experience one has in forming opinions about their own self-identity, whether that's enforced upon their own will through technology or even dedicating an entire career out of it who phase shifts...rather constantly...
[previously deleted comment 2 i.e. unspoken truths and unspoken thoughts] “prospective spouses”: please tell me why WE (speaking on behalf of a lot of people - though perhaps not) need to include this & also - why not - derive all the reasons why this could possibly come to mind after spending years in academia as a wannabe professor of math. why would math 170 have to be talked about as a supplemental course and a course that can be replaced by a cs course rather easily when inquired about to someone who does not have a degree in math? (Not taking mathematics as philosophically as the mathematics major.) Period. DO NOT DISCOUNT THE INTELLECTUAL PROCESS. otherwise we’ll be stuck trying to figure out what the degree truly stands for (such as access to a different part of the cortex). Erdoes & Berkeley will forever make me imagine if I decided to attend school closer to home & my parents (away from Berkeley's madness - my reasons for transferring and taking summer courses)…albeit taking an easier route towards becoming weaker person. A dichotomy I digress, && AM STILL open to discussion. && STILL, you can't hide especially when it may be your own fault. A general theme that's been taking shape, forcing others like myself to take unorthodox approaches to further reinforce my point in regards to patches (not badges) having an effect on all things self. Not sure what all this stands for, & still the public may continue to shoot itself in the foot for these reasons time & time again. All I know is that it's happening & for better or worse I say thanks, for opening the flood gates to a well-ordered alternative sequence between mesh grids & the monolith. The monolith will never be the penultimate. I'm out. 🦈🐬🦈🦈   🦈🐬🦈🦈"
(SERIOUS) Do only geniuses survive Berkeley cs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i5h5d2/serious_do_only_geniuses_survive_berkeley_cs/,2020-08-07 09:39:33,"Using a throwaway account here. Anyways, my friend and I got into a debate. For background, we are both incoming freshman studying cs in the fall at Berkeley. 

So he texts me last night and starts to freak out. He starts going on about how everyone in Berkeley cs is a crazy accomplished genius that’s on a whole different level. He says that this program is only for coding gods, and that it’s not meant for anyone else to succeed. He even says that (his words) “70% of the students in Berkeley cs are Anant Sahai’s”. 

I tell him that he is overreacting, and that the people he is referring to are a small part of the overall cs population. I say it’s more about work ethic and the motivation of the student, rather than whether or not they are a “genius”. 

He doesn’t agree with me, and states how cs is way harder than we think and you need to be a “perfect student” to succeed. He says that he would be “barely average at [less prestigious cs program]”.

Again, we’re both freshman, so everything we’re saying is based on anecdotal evidence only. I am now a little worried that he may be right. So, could who has graduated from/is currently a Berkeley cs student provide any insight to this debate? 

TLDR: Friend thinks it takes a genius to survive Berkeley cs, is this true?","Nah, it is your friend's imposter-syndrome talking.  You don't need to be perfect or a genius.  And if you don't believe me, I'll show you my undergraduate transcript in the after times.

if my IQ were any lower you'd probably need to water me.

came in with no experience, graduated berkeley EECS, now working as a software developer. i did fail a number of classes on my way there, but it was never because i was 'too dumb' - more 'too depressed,' lol. if you don't spend all your time moping over whether you're smart enough to do CS, you'll do fine.

i did lab assist for CS61A for a while, though, and there's definitely some people who 'get' concepts faster than others (i.e. recursion is a big one). this isn't really 'genius' so much as your thought process aligns better with CS logic, lol. but there's nothing you can't do with just hard work.
Yall be fine.

I'm glad the legend of Anant Sahai has spread to the prefrosh, though.
Your friend has no idea what they are talking about, and that's fine because it's very stressful entering a new school.  But don't listen to it at all.  The best recommendation I can make for both of you is to look toward a less intense schedule for the Fall semester and to focus on 61A if that's what you're taking, and to not do stuff like take 61A and CS70 together in the first semester.

Yeah, things can get rough some days and you won't always know how to finish every exam problem.  Neither will anybody (except maybe a very very small percentage of students who are those ""geniuses,"" there is absolutely no reason to worry about them).  It's about not expecting to have the best grade on everything and knowing that you're doing really well for yourself if you're keeping up with material, studying, and taking care of yourself and your academics.
Nope. While many people in the major are geniuses who've done so much, there's lots who arent. So many have no CS exposure going in as well. As long as you put in effort and you're genuinely motivated to learn you'll be fine.

It really is 99% work ethic 1% not sniffing glue. A lot of things in life are like this, actually
Nahhh, once you come here you realize that most classes can be grinded out. I dropped Stat 134 my first semester because I was so scared and thought I had to be a genius to do well in it, but after gaining perspective during my first semester, I realized that you can do well as long as you put in the work and the actual material really isn't that daunting.

 I think it applies even more to CS, where the only way to do well is literally grinding. Natural talent can only take you so far on a Hilfinger 61B project if you don't put in the time.
Like others have said, no you don't need to be a genius. 

One thing I will add that most people didn't touch on or mention is **being average at Berkeley, doesn't mean you're average in real-life or at work**. Remember, it's already hard to get into Berkeley so you're definitely not ""average"". It's just because so many amazing students clump together in 1 place and most classes are curved, you feel like shit compared to your peers. It's really all about perspective -- it's easier to see the bad side than it is to see the positives. I urge you and your friend to look at what Berkeley has to offer rather than it's downside. Learn from your peers who you know are better than you. Make friends with people -- the people here are often great teachers, willing to help, and are amazing people to hang out with outside of class.  

I'm pretty sure average students graduate Berkeley with a \~3.0 GPA go on to do great things in life or become successful in their own way. Why do you think hundreds of recruiters come to recruit at Berkeley every semester in the hot sun for HOURS? They know its hard, and students graduating from Berkeley is more than ready for industry work.
Back in the day my HS didn't offer any AP CS classes so beyond a very bad intro to java class where I made a blackjack game I really didn't have any background in CS before undergrad. Berkeley can genuinely be overwhelming at times, it's a big school where it's hard to know many people especially if you're not socially confident (and I certainly wasn't) and there's not really anyone checking in on you to make sure things are going ok. People there are super smart and there is so much to know and learn in this field that offhand comments about CS buzzwords can make you feel so dumb, but if there's one thing I've learned over the years it's that everything is learnable and everyone starts from the position of not knowing anything. Even on your worst days when you're stressed and doubting yourself, try to slow down and break the problem into as small pieces as possible and take them 1 by 1. When you know the building blocks you can always scaffold up to something bigger and more impressive sounding. 

Might sound dumb now, but make sure you go to lecture and do your homework. Even if you think you'd rather play some more league or watch the webcast later, just do it.
Credentials: CS '15; had Hilfinger back-to-back for 61A/B; squeaked into the major right before the 3.00 GPA cap started; became CS Peer Advisor to offer some guidance to others who felt the same things I did during my time at Berkeley.  
  
Don't let that feeling of not being good enough get to you -- I firmly believe everyone who gets in to Cal, gets in for a reason.  
  
Personal anecdote: I absolutely *hated* calculus all through high school and Math 1A/B at Cal. Literally could not stand the stuff. Up until my second year, I thought I was going to bomb my way out of CS because I thought the real struggle was yet to come if I couldn't even figure out some maths I'd already been exposed to multiple times.  
  
Fast forward to my 4th semester, and I cruised through Math 54 and CS 70 for the most part. CS 70 was genuinely one of my favorite classes I took as a part of CS. It helped that I was able to really sink my teeth into CS 61A/B/C and found a lot of the material intuitive.  
  
That said, it still took me hours upon hours a week to get through the coursework for all of the above classes. It's a tough curriculum on purpose -- I firmly believe my CS classes have been the most technically rigorous thing I've done in my entire career so far.  
  
Tell your friend to keep their chin up, and stop only noticing the strengths of everyone around them. You have no idea how badly someone is struggling in another course that isn't intuitive to them whatsoever.
Nah, you can do it. It might suck, but if you want it, I really believe you can do it. I don't have much of an affinity for coding, and entered Cal intending to major in something completely unrelated. 4 years later, I have my CS degree and a software job at a tech company. 

Did it suck? Yeah, I won't lie, a lot of it sucked. I studied a lot, often felt overwhelmed, cried sometimes. It sucked. I never felt ""good at"" CS, despite sometimes scoring in high percentiles on tests. If you're part of the 90% of CS students just doing their best and getting by at a normal pace, you'll sometimes feel invisible. That's just the Berkeley culture for you. 

That said, it's healthy to question why you want to do CS in the first place. I'm not saying ""don't do it unless you dream in code"" - I'm just saying you don't want to go through 4 years of that and graduate and realize you only did it for your parents, or for prestige, or for money. Doing it for any of these reasons is fine, but be honest with yourself! Your reasons might change over time, and that's fine too. Just be honest and open to opportunities. You might also find that there's another major that suits you better - possibly related, like Data Science.
Judging from the people in my 162 project group you can definitely get into CS despite your one talent being the ability add crashes to pintOS.
nah i passed im pretty average too
I think stating that ""it takes a genius to survive Berkeley cs"" is really insulting. 

There is a fuck ton of honest hard work going into these ""geniuses"".
nah lol im an lazy idiot on track to declare but obv i do need to grind at times
Majored in CS and didn't have any prior experience going in to Berkeley. I was also under a similar impression as you about more than half of Berkeley CS being ""Anant Sahai""s but after taking a few classes you realize that most of the people who claim to have been coding since they were born usually don't actually know very much *computer science* but rather just *coding*. I think ultimately coming in with a clean slate and willingness to learn helped me to get the most out of my Berkeley CS experience, and I firmly believe that anyone who has a similar mindset can also succeed!
Nah, I’ve completed the majority of the EECS curriculum with some pretty shit grades. My 61A/B/70 GPA was 3.33, my upper division GPA is like 2.6. I didn’t take APCS or anything coming in, but I learned some basics off the internet. If you turn in all your assignments and study for tests you’ll probably get some sort of a B, which is enough haha. What really matters is perseverance, like scoring 40% gonna feel like ass and you gonna really wanna drop, but if you just stick it through, you gonna be fine.
CS is all about work ethic. innate smartness will only take you so far... As long as one is  putting in 110% throughout the entire semester, even the dumbest student will succeed and earn great grades.
I’m CS and I don’t think everyone is a genius. Most people struggle imo because they think they are TOO smart, and don’t need all the allocated time to study/work on project/do homework and try to cram. Ditching procrastination is an instant 40IQ boost and will most definitely put any willing, hard working student on top in CS.
Lol no, I'm a dumbass who came into berkeley with no CS experience majored in Partying (With an emphasis on beer die) and CS, and as long as you do your work stay on top of things and enjoy the grind, CS is doable.
It's the stress talking. The people who seem like ""CS gods"" aren't geniuses, but rather people who simply had a head start--one that will quickly be evened out after a few semesters in CS. Most people simply have a good work ethic. Plus, the few actual geniuses just often happen to be more vocal than the usual non-genius grinders.

In my opinion, CS at Cal is hard, but entirely doable as long as you're willing to put in the effort.
If you are mAthHeMatEcaLLy MatUrE you r ok w papi sahai.fun
My study habits are p dog and I'm p sure that I'm going to declare. Tbh as long as you take it very seriously, you are already ahead of a lot of cocky students.
It'll be hard, but it's definitely possible. Take it from me, someone who had barely touched coding before college. I graduated CS with a 3.7! Anything is possible
Kiss him
lul
I'm a dummy and I did fine. A lot of people freak out when they start getting Bs and Cs for the first time once they come to Berkeley. 

Best advice I can give is to find smart friends to work and study with.
Yeah I'm not particularly smart or particularly good at CS or even particularly interested in most of the CS classes I took and I was able to graduate with a 3.2 and get 4 SWE job offers upon graduation. I think I got 1 A- and 1 A total amidst like 12 EECS classes taken. There are people who are able to literally figure things they've never heard of out during the final and will make you think you might be the dumbest person ever born. In my mind the key is to not compare yourself to those people --  a lot of achieving success is putting in the work but also a lot of it is being resourceful and not just bashing your head against the wall trying to learn in ways that you're not succeeding. The thing that really sucked in my experience was watching people who were trying really hard but in ways that weren't actually leading to success give up.
I am most definitely not a genius and I consider myself an imposter average CS student. Try to use that feeling as motivation to study harder when you feel lost, ask questions until you find someone who will genuinely look out for you, and focus on every win out of all the losses. Work your ASS off in the lower divs to declare. You will gain confidence one you reach upperdivs and will be able to handle all the losses better from then on. It's very hard to notice slow growth but please try to make note of each one.
If we were geniuses, we'd be at stanford....
And for context, since you're incoming OP, this post is from our professor Nick Weaver who often teaches CS 61C and CS 161!
Ahh, thank you for your response Professor Weaver!
I'm in the trades and never attended college. So from the outside in, you seem like an awesome professor.
This comment and it’s genuine and sincere validation is EVERYTHING
I know some people from Berkeley who are good, but who are not geniuses. You don’t have to be a genius.  
If you like a little math and calculate the possibility of getting into berkeley for an IQ below a certain threshold :)

In fairness, I think that even geniuses can be shortsighted in even the most simple things. One of my friends from high school was extremely intelligent, both in sciences and humanities, but if you hung out with him you would think he was a dumbarse.
I saw the data8 prof was sahai for the fall and thought it was Anant sahai and dropped it and now I am #310 on the waitlist I am a clown that is all

I think you promoted him ;)
Out of curiosity, what brings you to this sub? I honestly haven't come across many people who aren't students, parents or staff here.
It's 50/50.  Either you get in or you don't.
Lmao. The thing is, Sahai is hard, but at the end of the day, his grade distribution is pretty much the same as the other instructors.
I just had a mini heart attack there for a second 😩
If you are smart enough to get accepted into Berkeley you will be limited by grit rather than intelligence

Well its called /berkeley. I live in Berkeley,CA lol. 

Moved to the bay about a year ago. Just trying to find some places and some friends.
I had sahai 70 hilfi 61b and tbh they’re hard but i learned a lot and i wouldnt want to take those classes w anyone else. Also personality matching is a big thing
Yeah, Nick doesn't like being called a professor iirc.  Great lecturer either way.  161 was my favorite upper div.
Reading students rant about classes must get tiring lol. Wish you best with finding friends and places!

Edit: you probably alr know but r/Berkeleyca is another subreddit for the town. Through I wouldn't blame anyone for finding that one a bit boring. Nothing much seems to happen there.
Yeup.  Primary job of professor is managing a research group.  And I am a craptacular manager.  I’d much rather be a researcher & lecturer, because that means I get to actually do research and teach.
I see, thanks for letting me know!  I wish I could take 161, it sounds super fun.
Lol, actually it's a lot better than Netflix. Thanks.
any `discord/forums` for berkeley cs students?

I'm considering transferring to Cal from a CCC for EECS or CS and I'm curious about the experiences of others in managing the 5-semester timeframe set by the CoE. 

Has anyone found this time limit restrictive, especially when aiming to enroll in a series of highly rated courses such as: 

\- CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory (offered by Satish Rao or Anant Sahai)

\- CS170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (by Christos Papadimitriou)

\- CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (taught by a team including Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, and Dan Klein)

\- CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning (with Johnathon Shewchuk)

\- CS161: Computer Security (Nick Weaver)

\- CS168: Networking (Scott Shenker)

\- CS186: Databases (Joe Hellerstein)

\- CS164: Programming Languages and Compilers (Paul Hilfinger)

\- CS162: Operating Systems (Ion Stoica)

\- CS184: Computer Graphics (Ren Ng)

Would it be better to apply for CS in the College of Letters since I received most of my credits through AP or dual enrollment during HS?

I would love to take all of these courses if feasible. Would it be better to consider taking some of them (if possible) or their equivalents during graduate school instead?

Thank you!","I don’t think it matters since CS is direct admit now. It seems doable in 5 semesters.
Typically you’ll want to take 2 techs a semester and transfers usually redo cs61a and Cs61C, many do 61b as well. Also, eecs16a and 16b are mandatory for EECS, so basically junior year is for lower divs. Then with three semesters left you can take 6 techs comfortably or 8/9 very uncomfortably (or using summers). There are two CCCs that can give you credit for 61C and 61B I think.
So does that mean that CS also must be completed in 5 semesters? Is it not in the College of Letters and Science?
The 5 semester ceiling is only for CoE transfer students in EECS. 

For L&S CS, you can go as many semesters as you want as long as you are under 130 units (for a single major).  In reality, it would be extremely difficult to go over say 6 semesters without going over 130 units.
No CS has a unit ceiling policy where you can keep extending if you have <= 130 units."

It is incredibly rude to distort the learning experience for other students because the student couldn't be bothered to actually be prepared. It makes life harder for the TAs as well. Yes, there are a small fraction of students who can do this without causing a disruption. Those students also shouldn't need to ask any questions or work with anyone. For a larger fraction, it only *seems* to work but the students have gaps and holes in their understanding. Another group muddles through, knowing that they are confused, but just counting on others to help them get through it. There is a reason why lower division material is lower division --- to make sure that students master it and have a solid foundation to build upon. For every student for whom it makes sense to skip a prerequisite, there are a lot more who are caught up in an immature subculture of fake bravado and showing off. This should not be encouraged at all.

A student wrote:

> Hi Prof. Sahai, I appreciate your reasoning, but I do respectfully disagree. It really depends on the student. For motivated students who have maybe done competition math and algorithmic coding challenges in high school, this should hopefully not constrain them. And there are lots of these kind of students here, I would not say it's a very small fraction. I have taken cs 70 and 188, and the 188 probability (conditioning, total prob, bayes) is just stuff I learned in high school. More so, some of these prereqs are outdated and don't make much logical sense. For example for 189 it was a prereq in the past to take 188, but now that's gone and for a good reason.","I think a better statement would be, ""if you have not taken the prerequisite(s), then you should not be going to office hours with difficulties for those prerequisites."" i.e. if you didn't take CS 70 before CS 188, please don't go to office hours to ask about basic material from CS 70 that you should know already. But it is totally ethical to ask questions about CS 188 like everyone else.
Keep in mind that Sahai also wants you to take Math 54 + EE 16B rather than Math 54 + EE 16A (when the pre-req for 16B is 16A) by self-studying circuit stuff from EE 16A. But apparently if you do so, you can't ask any questions, join any study groups, or go to office hours.
Whenever I claim Sahai to be the most obnoxious professor around, I get down voted to hell. Thank you for this thread. The guy literally says this

> Those students also shouldn't need to ask any questions or work with anyone.

If anyone is okay with this statement, I don't even know anymore...
Keep dat Piazza drama coming, bois 👌👌👌
Sahai is just a dick
lol
There is no other morality than the good grade. What gets an A is good. What doesn't is bad.

If this prof wants to shut down questions about prereq material and instruct his TAs to do the same, that's his business. 

The idea that there is some kind of ""ethical need"" is absurd. Just fail them. 
Honestly, as someone who is currently in 188, I would not mind at all people asking the occasional question about 70 probability content.  I took 70 two years ago, and I barely learned anything even when I was in it, let alone now.  As long as you're not taking up inordinate amounts of time asking about prerequisite knowledge I have no issue with people asking the occasional question on prereq content.
That's a bit of a disingenuous representation, though. ""Self-studying"" is *not* the same as attempting to learn the prerequisite material for a class while taking that class. 

Yes: it turns out that sometimes prerequisites for a class are not strictly necessary (e.g. 188 and 189, though really I feel this was more of a result of figuring out what kind of class 189 wanted to be, given how new it is). **However** this is obviously not always the case, and yes it does depend on the student. Sahai is really just making a statement about good use of resources: you can mitigate struggling in a class if you take the prerequisite for that course.

I don't understand why everyone vilifies Sahai by posting rebuttals to statements he didn't even make. 
Sahai is the most obnoxious professor around
im from ohio
Sounds like cheater-talk...
I don't agree at all. The reason I'm in university is to learn not to get good grades. In my experience, if you learn the material well, it's very unlikely not to get an A.
Agreed. I see where Sahai is coming from in general, but his example is pretty terrible. I agree that too many students are in classes they aren't prepared for, but I mean cmon CS70 just barely even makes sense as a prereq for 188 imo. I took 188 before 70 and found 70 to be a SUBSTANTIALLY more difficult class in all ways. 
Exactly. The professor should assign grades based on learning the material. The two should be one and the same"

> What you need for 70 is mathematical maturity, not experience with probability. EE16AB are enough to raise your mathematical maturity to the right level. Math 1B by itself is almost certainly not enough. Taking Stat 134 without Math 53 is decidedly not advised, and the consensus guidance for all EECS and LSCS students is to take EE126 after CS70 instead of taking Stat 134. 
> 
> What is ""mathematical maturity""? At the most basic visceral level, it is comfort in solving problems step by step and maintaining confidence in your work even as you take steps forward. For 70, you need comfort and familiarity with doing simple proofs and derivations as well. What we observe even in 16AB is that when students come in, many are so used to getting answers immediately (which is what so much of high school and standardized testing have primed you for) that they freeze up when faced with a problem that does not have an immediately visible path to the solution. Some students do one level better, in that they start trying random things but their confidence quickly dissipates as they take steps that don't land on the answer itself. Where you need to be emotionally (at a minimum) for 70 coming in is to maintain confidence, execute simple things correctly, be able to be precise in talking about concepts, and have some intuitive sense for when progress is being made. Learning mathematical maturity is sometimes kind of painful, but this is pain that you must experience to progress. The way that 16AB inflict this good pain upon you is forcing you to confront multistep problems that you cannot solve immediately. 
> 
> Students should not rush into 70 prematurely or they won't be able to fully benefit from how it takes their basic sophomore mathematical maturity and forces them to rise to the next level (most visibly in being able to appreciate and do proofs that require strategy and not just tactics) --- the level that you need to be at to begin to grow in the manner that courses like 126 and 170 want you to grow.

> I will answer this question by speaking to what the courses 16A and 16B were designed to do.
> 
> These are courses that are designed to be taken by freshmen (both EECS and LSCS-intended) who have had high school calculus and are taking the intro computation series (61AB) in parallel with 16AB. To this audience, they are designed to help advance their skill in thinking about information and how it connects to the real world, building a solid foundation in concrete linear algebra (of Euclidean n-space and complex c-space) along the way. The 16AB series are designed to be modern and to be the right lower-division introduction in a world that has ML as an important topic that many students will engage with.
> 
> The circuits content in 16AB (static linear circuits in 16A and dynamic circuits in 16B along with transistors as switches with parasitics) is designed to do two things. First, be synergistic with the overall themes of thinking (modeling, design thinking, breaking problems into smaller parts, mapping things to mathematics, etc...) and linear algebra in the rest of the course. There is a purely pedagogical purpose here. Second, to expose students to circuits as an alternative perspective on understanding information processing, with a particular focus on the interface to the real world. We believe that this alternative perspective and the mental muscles it develops is vital since a purely imperative or symbolic-functional perspective on information processing is too limiting for a 40-year career, especially as we consider how information can be processed by things like neural networks both of the present and in the future.
> 
> The dynamical behavior perspective in 16B is also very important as we think about a future of robots, etc. and the introductory treatment of control theory is meant to convey some insight about how the combination of information processing and a physical system can result in a new combined physical systems that behaves differently. This kind of thinking, we believe, is going to be increasingly vital. It is not enough to think of a robot at the level of a physical system that obeys commands. Instead, we have to accept that the very nature of how the robot reacts to the world is intertwined with the information processing that we engineer. 
> 
> The linear-algebraic material includes perspectives on casting problems as optimizations (including linear regression and minimum energy control) and detailed discussions of things like choices of coordinates, PCA (also a kind of optimization perspective) and the SVD, along with an exploration of how time-invariant structure in linear operators creates symmetries that can be exploited in the right coordinate systems. Most of the heavier lifting is done in 16B with the preliminaries introduced in 16A. The treatment of differential equations in 16B is consequently also very linear-algebra centered, and follows the paradigm of showing how the simple 1d case generalizes to higher dimensions with eigenstructure playing the starring role.  
> 
> The default choice is that a student takes 16A and then 16B and then 70. That's how we intend students to take these courses. The introduction of 16AB in the freshman year allows upper division courses to adapt and improve because they can now count on these perspectives as well as the understanding that they provide. 189, for example, starting next semester will just take 16B for granted.

Why and how was Anant turned into a ""meme"" anyways? Why do people make all these funny parodies and videos of him? Is there a reason? Why him over other professors?

berkeleyeecs.com was also discussed on [the Berkeley EECS Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/266755646752649/permalink/988646797896860/).

A student asked [on November 11, 2015, on the EECS 101 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/hyq0br1u3kx7dg?cid=628):

> **EECS vs CS**

> Hi everyone, 

> I am a new Freshman to Berkeley and got in as Pre-CS. 

> So here is my dilemma I recently heard a professor (Prof. Sahai) and many students suggest that EECS is better than LSCS in terms of employers/graduate school. However I am really interested in pursuing a double major in Pure Math and CS/EECS. I also am currently doing very well in Math 54 and CS 61a. Is it worth starting the transfer process to COE for EECS? I think I can get the GPA necessary to transfer but I really would like to study pure math. If it makes a difference I want to do the minimum level of EE possible in either majors. I simply do not like circuits or hardware but am willing to do it if EECS is better.

> Should I stay or attempt to switch. A lot of people think LSCS is not a strong major cap or not. 

> Also just out of curiosity why is LSCS a BA but Environmental Economics and Policy a BS. It makes almost no sense!

[Professor Anant Sahai](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/) responded on November 13, 2015:

> Let me clarify in case anyone gets the wrong impression. Students who are applying to Berkeley and are interested in CS should be applying directly to EECS in almost all cases. For students who are here, it is arguably a better idea to be in EECS because the advising and support staff in CoE at the college level is anecdotally better than what we hear in the case within L&S. Within our department, we like to treat our students as equally as possible across the two majors. All our staff is excellent. Outside, nobody ever cares what you major in.

> You should make a 4 year plan under both alternatives. See whether in fact for you it actually makes a difference in terms of which classes you need to take whether you are in L&S or CoE. The reality of AP exams is that for many students, the CoE requirements can be lighter in practice, if not in theory. (Because you can't AP out of L&S requirements.)

> In addition, you should ask yourself if what you really want to do is take lots of mathematics course and do research with a Math Prof and whether being a math major in any way helps you to do this. Every person needs to have a home department. It is very unclear whether anyone needs two homes. 

> In reality, you need to further ask yourself whether the advantage you get is from *declaring* a major vs *completing* a major. If registration priority is what you need, then *declare* whatever major is required to get it. For courses in the EECS dept, being an EECS major gives you priority and there are times when this priority can matter. (Like it did when 16A was being first rolled out.) At other times, this priority does not matter. 

> Do what is right for you and your education. Nobody out there cares what you major in for your Bachelor's degree. Since you have expressed an interest in Math, I am assuming that graduate school is where you want to go next. What matters is what specific courses you took and the specific research that you do with specific professors. The only impact of majors from the point of view of graduate school is the extent to which they constrain your choice of courses. (And fewer constraints are better, assuming that you can get access to a good faculty mentor.)

> First of all, congratulations on your admission to UC Berkeley! Both of our programs are excellent. Students in EECS and LSCS take the same classes with the same faculty. As the student above mentioned, if you plan to pursue a double major, LSCS has the same breadth requirements as math, so you will not need to complete extra breadth requirements. In addition, it can be very difficult to transfer into COE. The requirements for transfer can be found here: http://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergrad-admissions/change-college

Another instructor updated the instructors' response on November 13, 2015, removing some of Sahai's post:

> As Professor Sahai states, there are some differences in priority for the two majors. If you have questions about how this will impact you, please don't hesitate to email me ([email]@eecs.berkeley.edu). As Professor Sahai and others have mentioned, it's important to do what is right for you and for your education. For folks in industry and graduate schools, it doesn't matter whether you pursue EECS or LSCS. 

A student posted a followup:

> original instructor's answer reminded me of

> berkeleyeecs.com

Several students posted ""lol"", ""eecs"", and ""cs"" as followups to the post.

One student responded:

> Does anyone else feel like berkeleyeecs.com was done by an LSCS student to troll everyone? If so this was an epic troll. 

An instructor responded on November 19, 2015, regarding berkeleyeecs.com:

> I'm removing this post because it could be harmful for those with epillepsy or seizure disorder, or sensitivity to flashing images. I also find the language extremely offensive. I will be forwarding this website on to legal council.

A berkeleyeecs.com down. fuck berkeley. No way someone would view it as legit. It was clearly parody. Why use legal team to bully students.
Removing the post is fine, but asking to remove the website is like asking Safeway to stop selling peanuts because people have peanut allergies. There's no way the website went down because of the instructor
Such a Berkeley move to complain about a harmless joke by claiming it could theoretically hurt a small portion of the population and that it is ""offensive"".  Basically, ""You were mean to me, so I'm suing you."" 
The name Berkeley EECS is probably registered and they can have any site tarnishing their brand taken down. 
It's actually quite possible. You can sue a party that owns a certain domain name on the grounds that the domain uses a specific identifier that the registrant doesn't have the right to use.

For instance, if I tried to register ""walmartstore.com"", I could be threatened with litigation. There's actually a streamlined process for resolving these disputes out of court because there are so many. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Domain-Name_Dispute-Resolution_Policy#Process

Now, that doesn't necessarily mean they would win a lawsuit in this particular case (I have no idea how satirical websites are typically handled). But it's quite possible that they had their attorneys contact the registrant and/or godaddy about this. Threatening legal action is often all it takes. It could even be that the registrant took the site down as soon as he or she saw the post about forwarding to legal counsel.
Somebody should register eecs.com or something, which isn't protected by copyright, and put the site back up. 
It doesn't necessarily have to be protected by a registered trademark. There have been cases where celebrities have successfully sued for control of domain names that use their name. It ultimately depends on how the identifier is used and what's on the website.
The point being that there's no way ""eecs"" is legally protected, so eecs.com would be fine.
I wouldn't be so sure. I agree it's unlikely, but not certain. WIPO has ruled in favor of plaintiffs who are trying to protect acronyms in the past."

## **Student's Piazza post**

A student wrote:

> **EE16A Expansion**
> 
> I see that EE16A may be expanded. If this happens I assume there will be more labs and discussions added. My questions is will the people already on the waitlist be prioritized or will it be handled poorly so that the people who happen to see these new sections first get an advantage.

## **Instructors' Answer**

An instructor wrote:

> ""Handled poorly"" is a little too strong/mean. The enrollment system has no way to prioritize students waitlisted for a full section. I assume that faculty emailed you about the possibility of expansion so that you would keep an eye out for those sections. 

Another instructor wrote:

> Please see enrollment policies here: https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/eecs/degree-reqs/enrollment-policy
> 
> If an expansion happens, which I hope it does, an announcement will be posted to Piazza and an email sent to the waitlist. The waitlist will be processed in order as per the enrollment policy.

## **Student's Response**

The student wrote:

> First of all that you for your response and for the CS department's relentless support, even before the semester begins. I'm sorry if I caused offense with the use of the word ""poorly"". I, however, stand by my decision. I was well aware even before your response that people can be exceedingly harsh even on Piazza. I could have omitted the word but I do feel that ""poorly"" directly and tamely addressed that some of the system's handling on waitlisted students seems to be impractical and intuitive. Perhaps I am naive and missing some of the challenges in implementing the system (perhaps it varies for each department), but I feel other students in this thread agree with the sentiment. Once again I do not blame any specific person or department and admire the work put in by the Berkeley staff; I simply think perhaps there is a better solution.

In general, the most important thing for a student to learn is how to deal with their own ignorance and lack of understanding --- and the right approach is never shooting your mouth off. It is almost always asking a question humbly and sincerely, while trying to learn. If you really care, offer to help. Sometimes it isn't possible for you to help, but a question or a comment about something that might be less than ideal goes over a lot better when accompanied by an offer to help. Looking or acting like an entitled person is essentially never helpful and is not something that befits a student in our department.

## **Student's Response to Anant Sahai**

The student wrote:

> I agree with every word of your first two paragraphs and in my earlier response addressed that there are multiple departments and entities at work so blame does not fall on any specific department, especially the EECS department; perhaps there is no blame whatsoever and some of these weird kinks are a necessary result. I never accused or implied any department of any wrongdoing but I acknowledged a problem with the overall system itself. You are right that offering to help is always the best solution and I would love to help out; obviously a more comprehensive understating is needed before I can have any tangible effect. Maybe a 24 hour window of adjustment when new sections are added so that those on the waitlist as well as those enrolled can switch while maintaining priority. Maybe one could list there sections in order of preference if on the waitlist as long as there are no conflicts. Lastly I want to apologize. I am clearly in the wrong here as I have offended multiple people. I have not communicated myself well as I seem to agree with everything the EECS department has to say. Sorry once again and I hope I can work with EECS and SIS rather than against to solve these issues.","I see it's popcorn season. 
Sahai is so far up in his own ass he's coming out his mouth.   
LOL imagine authoring dozens of papers, getting 2 degrees from MIT, grinding on the tenure track for 15 years and some first year undergrad triggers the shit out of you with the words ""poorly handled."" Sucks to be Sahai
This is why I always posted as anonymous on Piazza back in the day. Too easy for overly sensitive instructors to remember you for the wrong reasons.

I'm probably biased as a student who had to transfer to EECS, but I'm sure this student speaks for others in similar circumstances. Prof. Sahai's response is the result of two words—and only two words—""handled poorly."" If he won't even allow an essentially two-word criticism on his course Piazza, this sets a bad precedent imo for not allowing *any* criticism of EECS whatsoever.

Then, what's the point of having EECS town halls?
Gat damn can't we just along

Isn't anonymous only to classmates, not to instructors?

I don't agree. Many students are too entitled. Criticism is allowed, but you need to first understand what the staff is dealing with. I've worked for the school, and it is just way too understaffed and overworked. There's so much to get done in so little time with so few resources helping. It's stressful. 

We should give the staff a break. If you see a problem, respectfully point it out and offer solutions for how to better address a situation instead of labeling something as poorly handled and essentially just negatively attacking the staff. What would be even more helpful is stepping up and offering your time and energy to improve Berkeley. More student assistance would definitely help!
there used to be an option to be anonymous to instructors which got disabled due to excessive trolling

I implore everyone who feels overly stressed, depressed, or suicidal about school or anything else to seek out professional help. There is free counseling at the tang center for students.

I realize this is probably a joke, but it's not a joking matter.
I don't know anything about you, but for what it's worth your GPA probably isn't as important as you think it is. I lived in an apartment where all 5 people had been on Academic Probation at some point, and everyone ended up fine. I personally have failed a class (CS61C), accidentally skipped a final and got a D (Math 115), tried to skip a final so I could fail and retake it, and ended up with a D(CS162). Your GPA isn't a measure of who you are as a person, and it won't even be a significant indicator of your career in a couple years. Some people just don't do well in academic situations, but really thrive once they go out into the real world. 

Also, if getting a better GPA is something that you really care about, there are a ton of resources out there for you. Take advantage of all the office hours, free tutoring, etc. that's there for you.
It will get better. 

I took a break from Cal 2 times... entered in Fall 2006, left in Fall 2007, came back in Fall 2008, left in Spring 2008 after, finally entered again in Fall 2010, graduated in Spring 2013 with a degree in EECS.

I flunked quite a bit of classes; I have F's on my transcript, because I just didn't bother to retake them. My final GPA from Cal was like a 2.5... major GPA after 2010 was around a 3.2.

No company asked me for my GPA. I am doing quite well right now (make 100k+ as a data engineer). You will too.


As a college graduate fresh in the job market, you will find that almost no one asks for a gpa. Grad school cares but unless youre failing your classes they dont care either. Stay strong and get through it. 
since you're eecs, gpa doesn't matter at all once you get into the real world. employers look at your experience and your performance in technical interviews. If you were a english/sociology/psychology/ethnic studies/gws major, then gpa is all you have because you didn't learn any marketable skills in college. but then again, if you did major in those fields, you have no excuse for a low gpa.
thinking about grad school ?
thanks fam. terrifyingly serious (except for sahai part).
I've been in the same boat. Sub-3.0 GPA, had to retake 2 classes, but I still worked at one of the hottest startups in the Valley as well as a Big 4. You can do it!
[deleted]
^this. lib arts gpa is everything, but i have many many many engineering/cs friends with amazing (100,00k+ salary jobs) who barely cleared a 2.5. Make sure you actually learn the material and can nail technical interviews and you're most likely completely fine.

also, the berkeley bubble (aka a whole bunch of stressed out overachievers) is nothing like the real world. the vast majority of people are way way chiller than even your below average berkeley student and once you graduate thatll become  suer apparent. 

also, don't be afraid to consider other majors. eecs isn't the only thing that will get you employed and tbh if it's causing you to consider suicide, it definitely isn't worth it. i got a ton of very well paying job offers with the dreaded english degree, so haters can hate, but employers sure don't.

I believe in you!
Who is anant sahai
You can get in touch with counselors at the Tang Center that u/nickpeaches mentioned here - (510) 642-9494. Stay safe.
really touched that you apparently made an account just to post this. appreciate it. your story makes me reassess.
You do
Depends on how good your letters of rec are and the programs you're applying to. Anecdotal evidence time: friend worked in UC berkeley grad school admissions, every applicant admitted (for Evolutionary Bio-related programs) broke one of the so-called ""requirements"" for admission.
For what it's worth, I don't even think GPA matters within humanities or social science disciplines unless you're grad school bound. Anecdotally: I majored in English and history, and in the six or so interviews I've done (in public affairs and political campaign work) I've never listed my GPA on my resume and have never been asked about it. Friends have had similar experiences.
He's an EECS professor
That's fair. I list mine, so I can only really speak from my own experience. Also, the fact that you simply GO to Berkeley gets you pretty far. Just yesterday I had an interviewer who was pretty stoked on me since he was also an alum. This is a fairly common experience if you're in California (and maybe out of state but I've applied to only CA jobs)

Just try to insert references to your identical twin brother whenever you get the chance, to maintain plausible deniability.

Alternatively, just be normal. It's not a big deal unless you make it so. She might not even recognize you.
That’s hilarious man, just own it and be confident. (But don’t continue hitting on her LOL) I think she’ll respect the grind
She has seen this post. Good luck my guy :)

Love, boyfriend
Shave your head, grow a mustache, and wear shades.🥸
Is this 16A
As a girl who (sometimes) gets hit on and has a boyfriend. It’s more flattering than anything else and I usually appreciate the initiative. You have no reason to be embarrassed. She’ll forget about it pretty quickly.
Well as long as the boyfriend isn't the professor, I think you should be good. Maybe she'll forget?
I think this totally depends on what your definition of “shoot your shot” is.  
If it was a polite asking out, you’ll be fine. 
If you were all creepy about it, then perhaps it’s time to consider transferring.
This can’t be real 😭
If she’s really cute, she probably gets hit on all the time. I’d forget about it. She’s probably forgotten already.
>	I just checked my class enrollment and realized that she’s going to be my lab TA

How do you know her name if you only saw her?

Or did the class enrollment show pictures as well
You are ok, really don't worry. If you had approached her drunk in a bar or you continued to insist after she said no, then it would be awkward, but this is a normal adult interaction.
switch lab sections then cuzzo
Women are more likely to be complimented than offended by being asked out.
What!? Cute girl in Cory?!
Boyfriend won’t prevent her from finding her husband 😎get that rizz bro u got this
just act like you don’t remember
LOL.  Man, play it off - i'm sure its happened to her before.  Act confident - you asked her out and she declined.  No big deal.
If she’s not interested, it won’t ever come up. Don’t be weird about it.
I'd drop 💀💀💀
she wont gaf unless u hit on her again
Give her boyfriend an invitation to study or work very far away at a famous institution that comes with guaranteed 6 figures pay, prestige, and all the connections. We’ll see how that relationship will last then.
They all already have a BF bro. It's called a shit test. She'll monkey branch some day to a higher value guy. Be that guy.
Ok. And?
I can’t make the connection between her saying “no” and you getting graded unfairly.
be confident & be close w her bro honestly. take the chance yk i mean
so in that short conversation you somehow got her first and last name....? or did you get first name only but she mentioned she was a ta for ur class...?
Honestly concerned that I’ll be graded worse now😬
Naw bros a super villain
Jesse we need to cook
yee lol
This totally. As long as you weren’t inappropriate in the first flirtation and if you are completely professional going forward, this will work in your favor.

lmao the professor that's jokes
That's just terrible insight
Saw the picture when looking through last semester’s website
There’s only one rational move to make to fix this mess:

Hit on her boyfriend to assert dominance.
Don’t be. That would be both bias & retaliation, making the grader subject to scrutiny
are you honestly honestly concerned? why would she grade you worse based on this? 😭
Lmao she was the one who shared it with me
yeah that's our head lab
Ahahaha. I hate that I know exactly what you are referring to.
Ahh I see

> 
> I go to every discussion- don't skip out on these! It gives you two extra hours a week to tackle problems with other people around you- you may find yourself learning about a new approach, or explaining your approach to a classmate. And the TA is there to help clarify anything you feel shaky on or guide you to a solution. Don't sit in the back, fill in answers and check your phone for the rest of the time. Work with your classmates on every problem in the sheet. Ask your TA for help whenever you need it. They are there for you, you should be demanding their attention. Shoutout to Ben Kha for being a phenomenal TA this semester- he and his section are a big reason for why I've done as well as I have.
> 
> Later in the week when I'm down to the harder problems, I meet up with friends. We work together. None of that ""hey can you show me how you did this"" BS. Get up, pick up a whiteboard marker or whatever and help your friends put together a solution. Stay with them while they're brainstorming stuff. Don't be that kid who spaces out for 20 minutes and then asks someone to explain something from the beginning. Chip in when you can. If you see a problem in your friends' solution, tear them apart for it. If you think of something that will help push your group towards a solution, mention it. You should be going back and forth for an hour on some problems. Even if it doesn't get you any closer to a solution, you're still ""exercising"" the CS 70 muscles in your head and it'll be helpful later on.

> The student answer is very good. The following strategy is the basic one that works: (In order)
> 
> Ahead of lecture: PRINT OUT THE NOTES. Read them and use a pencil to make marks on the notes. Put question marks where you don't understand or are confused. Write questions in the margins. If you are understanding, try to work out the examples and proofs on a separate piece of paper after reading them. Don't copy, but just reconstruct after reading. But it's ok if you don't understand something. This is still before lecture after all.

> 
> PRINT OUT THE HOMEWORK. Look over the homework and ask yourself if you can do each problem or at least know how to start. If possible, start in on the easier problems at least. Make marks on the homework printout to indicate your thoughts.
> 
> ATTEND DISCUSSION SECTION AND PARTICIPATE. At appropriate opportunities, ask about the questions you still have regarding the notes. 
> 
> If you have access to the online problems, do them. Make sure you understand the very basics. If you get stuck somewhere, go back to the notes and read them. If you are encountering a difficulty that you can't overcome, bring this to your study group later.
> 
> Really attempt to do the homework on your own. Spend about 3 hours solo. Try each problem, but if you get stuck, concentrate on writing out potential approaches that you could try, even if you are not sure they will work. Try to formulate the problem mathematically and take some steps if it is not already formulated in that way. If it is formulated in that way, take some steps without worrying about whether these are getting you to the answer just yet. You need to explore. Don't bang your head against the wall for more than 15 minutes on any one problem or problem part without moving on. It is important not to have any distractions: this means, no texting, no Facebook, no videos playing, etc... Just concentrate on the homework.
> 
> Meet up with your study group for another two hours for the first group attack. Explain to them where you are stuck. If you are actually not stuck, but just ran out of your 3 hours, then it is fine to work solo side by side for a while. Ask them for their thoughts about the problems. Share your approaches and listen to them. This is the point at which you can also teach each other the concepts and techniques that they have questions about. Brainstorm angles of attack for a problem. Then sit and try to do them on your own for a bit. Then return to a group dynamic. Set a 30 min limit for banging your head on any particular problem or problem part in one go.  Explain the relevant parts of the notes to each other as you teach each other. It's alright to joke around with each other, but don't use electronic distractions when studying as a group. 
> 
> Attend HW Party and continue the study group dynamic above, except now, you can also ask TAs and tutors for advice. Between HW Party and a second study group session, you should aim to have sketches of solution strategies for every problem. 
> 
> Go back and write up all the solutions on your own. (Again, no distractions. Although in this phase, if you want to take a short break after finishing a question, go ahead.) Ideally, you would write the solutions to the problems without any reference to your notes from the study groups --- that is, you would rederive them based on your improved understanding. If you get stuck, consult your notes. Then start on a fresh piece of paper without your notes again for that problem. In general, spending 12 hours per homework total on average (during regular Fall or Spring) is a reasonable amount. With bursts that go higher if something is more challenging for you. 
> 
> Come up with your own problems and share them with your study group. Variations on existing problems is fine. Ask yourself if you can come up with problems that exercise specific concepts. If you can't come up with a problem or a variation on a problem, you probably don't understand the material as well as you need to.
> 
> When the solutions come out, read them carefully. Once again, printing them out is probably a good idea. Understand the way that the solution approached the problem, even if your approach was different and also correct. After you read the solutions, look over your own approach. Did you actually get it right? To what extent? If you got it wrong, redo the problem without reference to the solution. If you can't do it without looking at the solution, you clearly have a gap in your understanding that needs filling. You need to read the solutions before starting the next homework set. Don't put this off even if the course doesn't force it.

> The research on education is clear: taking notes on paper/pencil is superior to typing. Having the ability to spread notes out spatially on a desk or the floor allows you to keep more context in your visual field --- that isn't possible unless you have multiple tablets even with a tablet-based system.

> Remember, every single thing in the lower division is something that you need to master. ","I really struggled in 70. I scored nearly a full SD below on MT1, but I was able to earn an A- in the class.

If you don't get it -- and here, I'm speaking chiefly to people who have minimal math experience (I took 1A, 61B and 70 in the same semester, yikes, do not recommend), attending the live lecture probably won't help you very much at all. And if you're anything like me, reading the note by itself won't help you either.

I needed to break things down into smaller chunks to get retention.

1. Watch one topic in the webcasted lecture (e.g., go over the planarity proof in the lecture on graph theory).
2. Read that subsection of the note, CAREFULLY, taking notes.
3. Rewatch the example problem of that topic in the webcast. Pause the video, try and work out what your professor is going to do next on paper, and then play the video to see if you got the step right. If you didn't, correct and move on.
4. Look in the discussion worksheet for the problem which is specific to that topic, and try to work it out.

THEN move on to the next topic. It's a pain in the ass and it takes forever, but I swear it works if you're willing to put the time/effort in.

Also, Vazirani is the bomb. I know a lot of people didn't like him, but I actually liked his lectures a lot. (He's no Shewchuk when it comes to mad board skills, but he's not slouch either!)
this man makes it seem like studying for 70 is like going to war 

""first group attack""
""brainstorm angles of attack""
So so, homework or test option?
What you described is more-or-less how most mathematicians learn new subjects in math, especially the part about ""try and work out what your professor is going to do next.""

I would also add the following general piece of advice about learning math: when you see an construction/definition/proof, there is usually some main idea and then a lot of details about how to make things precise and about how to make that idea work. Try to first figure out the main idea from the notes and then try to work out the details yourself, looking at the notes if you get stuck. Usually if you remember the main idea you can work out everything else later or use the main idea in other contexts. It's much harder to remember and adapt to other scenarios if you just remember every detail without knowing what really makes all of it work.

As a metaphor, it is more important to have the seed of a tree than to have all the branches.

> Going forward, the requirements for LSCS are to take EE16A and EE16B. Math 54 is not required. Because we understand that some students might have a double major or other concerns that make them want/need to take Math 54, the combination of Math 54 and EE16B is also accepted, even though it is not recommended. 
> 
> For the group of students that had declared LSCS already, they are in an odd position because there was originally a *bug* that we had introduced into the LSCS requirements of requiring both EE16A and Math 54 --- a course combination that doesn't really make sense from an educational point of view. But although that bug has been fixed in the requirements, students who are in the position of having those be the requirements when they declared will be allowed to complete under those requirements. However, we encourage those students to actually take EE16B since that makes much more sense from an educational point of view. (i.e. It is important for someone who is planning to have a multi-decade career involving CS to know the basics of control theory, the SVD and PCA, and to understand the basics of the dynamic behavior of systems and circuits. The future is going to involve robotics and learning and information-processing by dynamic systems --- if not in the next decade, almost certainly by the decade after that. Foundations are important --- that is what an undergraduate education is really about because Industry won't build them. Instead, Industry just discards people who don't have current foundational understanding and replaces them with fresh graduates instead. Brutal, but true for most of the industry.)

Because you have no guidance or study group or any other resource that is normal during the semester, there is nothing to stop this.

Therefore, since CS 70 is part of our declaration requirement, we anyways end up taking it before EE 16A and EE 16B, which makes it useless. In regards to prepping us for other courses, a majority of CS upper division courses either don't require any knowledge of circuits or require a knowledge of circuits that runs tangential to the course material. This can be seen from the fact that 16a and 16b are very sparsely, if at all, listed as prerequisites to any CS upper division course.
> 
> 2) A basic amount of knowledge of circuits is essential to a proper CS education.
I disagree with this entirely. There definitely do exist fields within CS for which a knowledge of circuits would be useful but there also exists numerous fields in CS (esp. with industrial application) that require absolutely no knowledge of circuits. And if this is the case, it seems that imposing a requirement that ALL students must know a basic amount of knowledge on circuits would be unfair to those who have no need to use it in the future. This is the same point that I would make as to why CS 170 and CS 162 are not required for all CS majors, even though they are extremely useful in a large proportion of fields within CS.

> Hi, I will write a more detailed answer later but first will say that I encourage you to come and talk to me to understand this better. 16AB were designed to be fundamental to the needs of all of our students in preparation for a 40-year career going forward, and L&S CS students in particular. We in the faculty have a bit more experience than you do about both how fields are evolving intellectually as well as just how much things can change with time. As a student, you don't really understand the bigger picture, especially the scope of change and the need for a robust development of different ways of thinking. Which is to be expected --- otherwise, you wouldn't need the university and could just go and read books and do projects on your own to learn. The answer so far (I have to go to a meeting) is basically of the ""trust us"" variety, and there is a strong case that such trust is actually fundamental to the student/teacher relationship. Everything we say will always have a dimension of ""trust us"" to it, because you do not understand or appreciate what you cannot yet fathom. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, it's the unknown unknowns that get you.  One of our goals is to make you more ready for them.

The OP wrote:

> OP here. I disagree with the first student response. Breadths make sense because all L&S majors are fundamentally part of a liberal arts school, which stresses a fundamental understanding of a variety of subjects that don't relate to our traditional technical curriculum. So that requirement makes sense because that's the fundamental teaching philosophy behind the entire school; this is why breadths reqs. vary between schools. On the other hand, EE 16a is a major requirement, which means it should (in principle) relate to our specific technical curriculum.

> Prof. Sahai: I appreciate your quick response! I'd love to hear your more detailed answer and maybe follow up in person if necessary, but I just want to point out that my post doesn't come from a point of conceit but rather from a point of relative frustration. That is, I agree entirely that professors would have a much more thorough understanding of the fields and understand what is and isn't useful to teach us, but often times it may be frustrating from a student's perspective if we're told to learn something that seems tangential to everything else we learn when we don't have an understanding of the bigger picture in mind. I especially see this a lot with 16A since there are many CS majors (myself included) who find it frustrating that we have to learn about circuits. Maybe some of your detailed perspectives on this issue may resolve our concerns! Looking forward to hearing your response.

This is why we absolutely urge 16AB to be taken by freshmen.

> Within (2), there are many aspects to analog information processing. In 16A you see a little bit as well as how it connects via constraints to optimization-oriented thinking. However, in 16B the dynamic aspects also come into play. While today's deep neural networks tend to use circuits for information processing (circuits emulated by programs running SIMD cores for now, but more specialized cores in the future) in a way that doesn't involve time, there is every indication that biological neural networks do indeed invoke time dynamics in nontrivial ways. So it would be absolutely irresponsible of us to not give students some inclination of time-dynamic behavior of circuits as a part of their foundational training for a 40 year career. This is why the department wants everyone taking 16A and 16B.

It's our job to give you the foundation so that you can do so.

## **Elad Alon's reply to OP**

 I think that Anant largely hit the points that I would have made, but I'd like to also offer to speak with anyone in person about why I believe the material in EE16A and EE16B are indeed fundamental to your education as a CS student.

> To follow up on one specific aspect that Anant hinted at however, if you look at where the major innovations/advancements have happened in the last decade (starting arbitrarily from e.g. the iPhons), almost all of them have involved optimization and co-design among multiple levels of the system stack (from applications and algorithms all the way down to the circuits and devices).  Even if you end up as a purely ""software"" engineer, our goal at Berkeley is to try train you to be one of the ninjas who has at least a basic understanding of how issues at layers both above and below where you work can not only influence what you are doing, but provide opportunities for optimization of the system as a whole.
> 
> Another point I'd like to make is that many of the skills you exercise in circuit design are actually essentially identical to skills you would exercise in software or system design as a whole (as well in linear algebra).  I can dive in to the details if you'd like, but debugging, modularity, modeling, and using structured methods to do design and even analysis are all common across the board.  As a final note, there are actually many mathematical concepts underlying circuits, and gaining intuition about those same concepts but with physical quantities you may not be as familiar with is a great way to make sure you really understand the math.

More importantly, there are a number of additional (in my opinion substabtial) issues with your proposal, one of the most important of which (again, in my opinion) is that this approach will explicitly de-emphasize that designing efficient systems involves optimizing (and hence understanding) across multiple (all) layers of hierarchy simultaneously, and that often times, things you do at one level can make your life dramatically simpler (or harder) at the others.  The silo'ed approach you are proposing is exactly what I have seen over and over in my career (both in academic and industrial contexts) lead people down highly sub-optimal approaches to solving the problems that faced them.  For almost all intents and purposes, this would go back to the 20/40 model we had before (although granted it would be a very different version of 20), which was very clearly not working (both overall and specifically in highlighting the above).

Making this intellectual link clear throughout all of the modules (in 16A and 16B) is something we are constantly striving to improve, but splitting the content up (as you proposed) in to separate courses certainly won't help with this.

While we are allowing L&S students moving forward (for now) to fullfil their requirements with Math 54 and 16B (mostly for reasons that I hope will be transient, as I'll explain below), that is not the path we recommend by any means, and is not something that would work in general without the existence of 16A.

This is by no means a done deal and we can't yet make any guarantees, but my hope is that this will address some of the practical issues that are driving some students to delay taking 16 (which again, I definitely don't recommend).

That is firmly the intended audience and recommended scheduling by students, and the course is designed for that. Clearing the backlog of students during the transition who have not taken it as freshmen creates some degrees of mismatch here and there, but it is our goal that even those students should get a lot out of taking 16A. (I'll be honest, when I taught it, both me and my TAs got a lot out of it. And we all supposedly know all this stuff perfectly by comparison --- so it should reward contemplation for pretty much everyone.)

Just like students, we Profs will fall short of the high goals that we set for ourselves, but that doesn't mean that we stop trying. :-)

No, certainly not - this wasn't the way I learned things originally, and this isn't how things are taught in most other schools (at least not yet).  That's a pretty weak criteria though - as a student, I distinctly remember wondering to myself why in the world I was learning the things that I was (especially in my intro circuits class, but even well after that), and I perservered despite that.

Including linear algebra allows us to show with relatively little prior background just how powerful the tools and techniques that underly modern EE (and CS) really are in enabling real-world applications that students (particularly freshman) will not only recognize, but have a visceral feeling about/interest in.  I really can't take the credit for that particular realization BTW - it was really much more the product of Gireeja Ranade's and Anant's thinking than my own (at the time) - but having now worked this through (along with the two of them and many others), linear algebra really is the one conceptual area I can think of that finds substantial importance and use across pretty much the entire spectrum of EE endeavors (including the more physicsy side, as you mentioned).  As already mentioned, it is also something that can be taught to students coming out of high school (of course with appropriate math maturity) while simultaneously exposing them to the application (and hence making them feel ""empowered"").  
>

Physics 7B itself however requires more math background than what can be expected from incoming freshman, and so this is one of the reasons why we made the choice to partition things the way we did.  (Another reason for this is that for better or for worse, in general, students entering from high school tend to have less background in or opportunities to learn physics than they do math.)

This (currently hypothetical) course would more directly expose students to the applications/motivations for the 7B material, as well as more generally the ""physicy"" side of EECS.  This class could then also leverage the linear algebra (as well as of course circuits and basic sensor ideas) from 16A/B.  In case it wasn't obvious from how I started this paragraph, it isn't at all yet clear when or even if this will happen - the discussions are still highly preliminary.  Based on my experience from 16A/B, standing up a course like this will take (tens of) thousands of hours of work, and so it's not a task that anyone will be taking on lightly.  I do believe it's an exciting possibility however, and am doing what I can to help support this eventually happening (but again, absolutely no guarantees at all at this time).

If something doesn't seem to be working in either of those classes, please feel free to email me as well - a huge amount of thinking and work has gone in to these courses, but that doesn't mean that there aren't still improvements to be made.

Anant Sahai responded:

What material in 16B is not relevant to 120? At the moment, I think that the SVD and PCA-related material isn't likely to make an appearance in 120. Everything else can be built upon to different degrees depending on exactly how 120 realigns.

I thought the meat of it was not financial but rather the want of a fresher more accessible version of ee 20/40 that could be ee mirror of cs61a/cs61b such that students could get a more balanced initial education in eecs and get freshman more interested in electrical engineering. "

So far I have been flying through 61A, but I'm sure it will get more challenging. I had taken java at my community college but I considered it a joke (the class not java). Anyhow, to be able to intern and take upper div next year, I need to finish my lower div as soon as possible.  

I know for sure I will be taking 61B and CS70 since that's the pre req for every upper div. However, I'm stuck on what my third class should be.. my choices are either 16b(I'm in 16a right now, that's the new ee20/40), 61C, or a upper div humanity.

here is a good layout:
My current schedule is ee16a, 61a, psych167AC
Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), CS61C(Randy H. Katz; Vladimir Stojanovic)

OR: Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), ee16b(Michel Maharbiz)

the 61b teacher looks good, cs70 is going to suck either way, but which is the better teacher between 16b and 61c?

","Its ok to take 61b/61c/70 together because they don't overlap that much, but you might have multiple projects due on the same week... which will be hell week for you. I took 61B with Hug, and he is one of the best professors I had at Berkeley. Sahai for 70 will be tough, but you'll learn a lot
I've heard some pretty bad things about Maharbiz for EE20/EE40, so I assume it'd be similar for EE16B. I don't think that schedule will be easy but if you have a good amount of programming knowledge and experience then it's possible. I've known some junior transfers that have taken similarly rigorous courseloads and done well.
I did something similar. I spent basically 7-10 hours in the library every weekday working on homework/projects. If you're okay with that, go for it.
A friend of mine did 61B, 61C, and 70 all in one semester, with no other classes (except a small decal). It's doable but you'll probably have to spend a LOT of time working on projects. What she did was aim to finish all projects the week before they're due so that she has buffer room to deal with other things. 
I took EE40 with Maharbiz last semester, and honestly the memes and whatnot are incredibly exaggerated imo. It's a pretty straightforward class, and in terms of work you'll be fine as long as you start on stuff as soon as it's assigned. It's a prelab that takes 2 or so hours a week and hw that takes maybe 4-5 hours."

> If you feel like you are horrible at math, then this is a real warning sign for 70. Self-studying is a very hard way to build mathematical maturity. Classes are better for that. You need to take something that will take you from where you are, and improve your mathematical maturity. EE16A might help you in that direction (assuming you have already done the equivalents of Math 1A and 1B). As freshman-oriented courses, they are more gentle with their slope of mathematical difficulty.

That is something that most humans can do, even if some people might be really out of shape when they start. They just have to train for longer and at a pace that will let their body adapt to the rising difficulty.)  Without talking to you, what you described sounds like someone who was stymied by the difficulty slope in 70 relative to your mathematical equivalent of athletic conditioning. Take EE16A and 16B first. Then the slope in 70 should be more accessible. There's no getting around working hard, but you have clearly shown that you are willing to do that.

However, when it came to the first two or three homeworks I was a mess- couldn't even get started on some problems, and the ones I could do I ended up getting completely wrong.
> 
> In your post you don't mention office hours, homework parties, or study groups so I'm not sure if you tried those at all. If not, my advice would be to lean on those heavily next time you take it. What I found helped the most was a large amount of time face-to-face with someone who knew the material well- may that be a TA in OH who was going through the notes with me or a friend in my study group who was working with me to construct a solution to a HW problem. This really benefited me because the other person was able to gauge my understanding real-time, help me understand the stuff I was missing, and correct any misconceptions that I had. It worked really well- I ended up getting +1 std dev on the midterm. IMO learning CS 70 is a dialogue- you learn by bouncing my thoughts and ideas off other people and listening to the responses.
> 
> I agree with Prof. Sahai on the problem of self-studying- reading the notes and doing the HW in a vacuum allowed me to form these misconceptions that went unchecked until I talked it over with someone else. Perhaps you can find resources this semester to help you prepare even though you're not in the class. I know there are clubs that offer tutoring for CS 70 (HKN comes to mind).

> I had a different issue than the student response. I did the homeworks and spent a lot of time on them, and was getting everything, or so I thought (scored high on the homeworks). But I spent so much time on the homeworks that I wasn't prepared for the midterm, as weird as that sounds. Though I really enjoyed the homeworks, I wish I had more time in the day to explore and work on hw style problems. But I have to now be realistic with how much time I actually have and I have to allocate it towards doing well on the test. After keeping up with hw I ended up not having much time to really review and practice the faster style of the midterm, i.e., less in-depth but more questions, and time limited. I tend to be more methodical and slow-thinking but enjoy solving hard problems. Fast-style test taking isn't my forte but I hope if I prepare more for that I can do better (I've done better on other exams that require that kind of style before, but never had weekly homeworks for those classes that required so much time -- I'm doing the homework option). 
> 
> I ended up doing close to the mean on the first midterm, which for me was a huge disappointment. I feel like you have to ""deeper"" on the homeworks, and for more specific scenarios than the midterm requires, so I wasn't ready for the midterm. The Bieber hw problem did boost me from doing even worse though, because it was similar to one of the midterm questions. I plan to spend more time doing old exams in prep. for the 2nd midterm, but would welcome any tips or advice from others who have taken the course, or especially from Professor Rao.

> The strategy on the midterms is to give more smaller problems. This is for a few reasons, first is that more questions increases the amount of data from which to ""measure"" a students knowledge and ability to work with the materials, another being that a ""large"" question like what you see on homework is problematic in that the piecing together of various concepts at that level is too much to expect on an exam and very noisy in that even for the same student on some days the insight comes quickly on another it just doesn't.      We do try to design them to capture the pieces of the
puzzles that you put together in the homeworks.  For example, testing the proof of Fermat's theorem may unwind into smaller questions about inverses, bijections, and reorganizing terms within a modular arithmetic framework.
> 
> The idea is that you worked with all of these pieces in your homework, so the time spent on your homework should be helpful for exam.   Still, the pacing for homework is truly very different than what we can test on the exam; read problems, digest, play with the ideas, be creative, etc.   Measuring student performance fairly is a difficult problem that Professors constantly struggle with.
> 
> As for advice, perhaps the above context is useful.  In some sense, knowing the design principles around the exams may well help you better understand how to approach the exam.
> 
> Studying old exams is good.  Other instructor exams are great for content, but maybe to attune to my style use my exams perhaps later in your studying cycle.  Discussions have more smaller idea problems that are akin to exams. Study those. Finally, do at least understand the solutions to homeworks.  We do have difficult homeworks in that it is difficult to come up with the solutions, but often the solutions are short (annoyingly so, I would imagine) so do at least try to scan over and understand the solutions to the homeworks; I wouldn't try to come up with them again necessarily though as that would likely take a lot of time.","I think the issue a lot of the professors are missing is that this might just be this person's first exposure to real math.  At least in the US, high school math classes tend to be the cookbook approach to math: you learn how to use a bunch of tools to solve textbook problems (which are carefully formulated to be easily solvable by direct application of those tools, and tend to have minimal relevance to the real world).  There is minimal exposure to how and why these tools actually work, where they came from, etc.  In particular, proofs or rigorous mathematical derivations are almost never seen or performed; when they are done, even the teacher usually has trouble with it.  I've seen the same thing happen in a linear algebra class full of engineers.  This was literally the first time many of these people have been exposed to actual math, and it was disastrous for many of them, even though linear algebra is generally fairly easy and intuitive.

Satish is the man.
I think your point is what Sahai was trying to get at when he suggested the student take ee16a and 16b first. The math isn't particularly difficult so it's a gentle introduction to the realm beyond calc a/b. "

[EECS Professor Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html) replied:

> Getting into Berkeley for a PhD is incredibly challenging. There is a very high absolute quality bar that is applied for graduate students. This bar is not something that really varies by much across the department. However, in areas (like AI/ML) where there are lots of applicants that cross the very high quality bar, hard choices have to be made because there is limited faculty advising bandwidth. In general, these choices are made on the basis of ""fit"" and depend significantly on the specific mix of interests and needs of the faculty at the time admissions decisions are made. From the perspective of a student applicant, this can appear arbitrary, and to an extent, it is. After all, students' underlying research interests and inclinations tend to be broad and flexible and a snapshot taken in a November application doesn't necessarily predict all that well what they really want to do the next September when they start working on potential research projects. Oh well.

This means potentially doing research with multiple faculty who associate with the area, not what you might think the area means based on its name.

Hiroshi Murayama. I took his intro to quantum field theory class and it kind of made me fall back in love with physics at a point when I was pretty burnt out. He's super kind and an amazing lecturer, really skilled at explaining complex concepts in a comprehensible way.
Sofia villas-boas
Darren Zook! You will not regret taking a class with him
I was a physics major so here’s my opinion. By far the two best professors I’ve had were Professor Irfan Siddiqi and Professor Michael Crommie. I had them for Physics 137A and Physics 137B. Even though it was quantum mechanics, those were some of the classes I ended up doing the best in. They’re both funny, entertaining, and explain unintuitive concepts in an accessible way for undergraduates. All professors could learn from them.

I’m probably just being picky about this, but in my time at Berkeley I had a lot of classes, including Paul Li, with outstanding professors and lecturers, but only a few which I would elevate to GOAT status.
I have Pete marsden for chem 3al this sem and 3b next sem so happy he’s my favorite professor so far
I had Grace Gu for solid mechanics. That class moves at the pace of a snail and the material is incredibly boring but she's a good enough lecturer to almost make up for it.

Crystal clear lectures and presentation, even for some of the more advanced topics. I don’t think there was a single lecture where a large portion of the class seemed confused en-masse. My understanding is that this is uncommon among professors who teach 126/127.

## **Anant Sahai's Answer**

[EECS Professor Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html) replied:

> The point of the classes that EECS offers is to, collectively, help you become a better engineer (and scholar, should you go on for graduate study) over the course of a 40+ year career. Ideally, a Berkeley style engineer who can work on things that push the boundaries and not just filling in the blanks.  Engineers who can contribute to make society better and advancing the state of knowledge, while learning. How classes do this is by helping you think about things more clearly. When I was an undergraduate, there were things said in lecture that were never on an exam or a HW that still ended up helping me years later. If a student thinks that a class is about doing well on the homework or on exams or getting a good grade, the student is missing the point. If the student thinks the point of the course is to teach them a particular tool that they can use in industry, they are also missing the point. They should be paying attention and trying to internalize how we are thinking.
> 
> A Bachelor's degree is meant to prepare you for being an apprentice --- to learn productively from masters who are working in the field. There are going to be many practical skills associated with both software engineering in general as well as particular application domains that you will have to learn in the field. In general, the time at Berkeley is precious and what you could learn better in industry should be left to be taught to you there. Details (and particular tools) are easy to learn in industry, but big pictures are harder. This is because real life has lots of details. Knowing how to remove the details and see the essence is the skill that is hard to learn in industry precisely because the essence alone is never enough. But the essence is critical for making strategic decisions. However, when people start out, they don't usually get to make strategic decisions. So there is a gap --- a time during which you are learning a lot in industry and not seeing the full advantage of your Berkeley education. This is fine from our point of view --- we are teaching you with the time-scale of decades in our mind.

But two obvious goals are the UCB CS graduates should be competitive candidates for top engineering jobs and graduate schools. However, the path to graduate school is not necessarily the same as the path to the software industry (that really depends on a lot of factors). Ideally, students should feel comfortable pursuing their dreams. (Which is admittedly cheesy, but I believe accurately so).

Each course (i.e. CS161) has a syllabus that's approved by campus that covers the basic concepts that are expected to be covered, but each offering may adapt as course staff want to try different approaches or make adjusts for what may be changing goals. So, if you're curious about a particular course--just ask! Faculty (typically) love waxing poetic about their course designs and aspirations for their courses. It's no easy task, and it's always nice to hear from interested students.

> Finally, I want to caution you (or anyone), that your personal learning and a life goals may not match up with those of a particular course. I took plenty of courses during my time as a student where my goals were somewhat different than the courses. In those cases I focused most strongly on the aspects that aligned well, and learned what I could from the other stuff. For smaller courses or project based ones, I made sure to take any flexibility I had, and adapt it to my interests. For example in non-CS courses I would explore problems by using small programs and data to make an argument. Naturally, writing code to finish a writing reading response isn't necessary (or something I recommend for everyone), but at the time it was a fun way to be personally and academically productive, and whenever I've done things like professors are almost always receptive.

A student replied:

> I was interested in your comment that you wrote code to write a reading response for you. Am I understanding this correctly? You wrote a program to write an essay for one of your classes. How did you do this project?

The TA replied:

> I didn't mean to imply a wrote a program that could generate english. That would probably be beyond my abilities (at least, if I wanted it to be coherent....). The course was History of Information (a great course overall!), and we were talking about the effects of the dictionary on the development of language and how that affected word choice. I was in 61A at the time, and we had just learned to use dictionaries (the Python kind, of course) and so I though it would be fun to do things like word count on a couple texts we were given as well as some basic statistics and to find data to explore the same topics. It was nothing super rigorous, but I found it to be a good way to practice Python  (of which I needed lots of practice them!) and to explore the topic in a way that I figured most people would not. Based on what I learned from messing around I used that to write the reading response which gave me a bit more depth and thus made the word count thing easier. :) I mean, I can BS my way to a word count any day [hello AP courses!] but assignments are much more fun when you can complete them without needing to do that.","I mean Mr. Sahai.. I do think getting good grades is sort of important because I didn't and I'm no longer CS *shrugs*  But I guess for me that aligns with the whole ""goals being elsewhere part."""

Lmao everyone confess to cheating on everything
Wow. Tbh if it was just a few HWs flagged even if I didn't cheat I'd rather admit than deal with the beurocracy to prove innocence.
It has been serious before, so it is likely to be serious now.

My friend's roommate was flagged for copying on a CS 70 problem set, and he didn't ""confess"". He actually did get reported to the OSC. He did not get expelled, but he did fail the course and had to retake it. This was also back when you could retake a failed course to declare CS.

Empty threats are not useful, because if people know that the threats are empty (or even suspect they are), then they no longer have power. Threats of consequences are only useful if they follow through, at least in some capacity.

Personal opinion no one asked for: people who cheat deserve to be caught and face the consequences; cheating affects the grading curve to directly impact everyone else, and it cheapens the hard work of honest students. If this is you, 'fess up, take the relatively minor hit, learn from it, and move on.
If I were to confess, could the course staff back out of their claim that they won't report us to the Center for Student Conduct? Also, would this case be on file for readmission into Berkeley for Grad School, etc. ?
""Using online resources to solve problems (as long as you are not copying verbatim) is fine and permitted under our course policies, as long as the resources are properly cited. If you used external resources and properly cited your sources, you do not need to worry. Similarly, if you used external resources and did not cheat, but forgot to cite, do not worry about it at this point – we will not punish you for forgetting to cite, but please remember to do so in the future. If you insist on telling us that you forgot to cite, we have added an item to the form so that you can do so, without punishment – feel free to submit if it helps you stay calm.""

I'm a bit confused by this. On homework 0 there was a scenario where ""Erin finds a solution to a homework problem on a website. She reads it and then, after she has understood it, writes her own solution using the same approach. She submits the homework with a citation to the website.""

And the answer was ""No, this is not a violation of course policy. Using external sources to help with homework problems, while less encouraged than peer collaboration, is fine as long as (i) the student makes sure to understand the solution; (ii) the student uses understanding to write a new solution, and does not copy from the external source; and (iii) the student credits the external source.......so...looking at a past online solution is considered cheating?""

So by this particular scenario, are they saying if you looked at the solution, did NOT copy it verbatim, and used it as a guidance rather than copy it straight forward, and cite it, you should be fine? What do they mean by external source? Like is coursehero and Chegg considered an external source? I feel like this is a bit misleading...
A recent follow up to the piazza post:
“Hi, I'm not in this class currently but I took it in spring '17. I'm a part of the Student Advocates Office and we handle cases of academic dishonestly all the time and work closely with the center for student conduct. By and large, you cannot be dismissed for cheating on your homework - if it is your first/only offense with the CSC, you will just get a ""Non-Reportable Warning"" which is a punsihment completely internal to the CSC (grad schoo/employers, etc) can't see it. Second time offenses can be more tricky, but generally just disciplinary probation. I think its incredibly disingenuous and stress inducing for Sahai to cause students to believe they could conceivably be dismissed in a time as stressful as these. I'm not here to talk about the academic sanctions for cheating, but I just want students to know that they have no risk of being dismissed.”

Can action be taken against Sahai for straight up lying to his students and essentially coercing confessions?

**edit: course staff has taken down the post and a student has reposted a screenshot. One of the lead TAs has disarmed the situation without an actual response of substance. All seems very shady to me.

***the staff now claims they’ve been contacted by the conduct office to take down all of this guys’ posts as he was misleading students. Conspiracy?
[deleted]
To be frankly, I think a better way to stop cheating in these problem set classes is just giving problem sets that have no official answer floating online (a lot of upper div math classes that I have taken before assign problems from books that have no official solution manual and you can’t find solutions online at all for most of the problems because the questions are so specific. If those upper div math classes can do it with just 1 professor, 1 reader, no gsi, 20ish students, I see no reason a eecs classes can’t do that with support from a supposedly much more resourceful department behind its back)

Or better, come up with new problem set every semester. 

I know both are more time-consuming than just catching a bunch of cheaters at the end of the semester, punish them (and sorta ruin their academic prospects to some extend) and call it a day, but for a university I believe the purpose is to educate people, not try to filter and catch all the potential cheaters. 

Besides, as long as there are solutions out there you just can’t entirely count on people’s integrity to not cheat, that’s just unrealistic.
Someone should seriously get every single person in the class to list every single transgression they've ever made.
Hey I wouldn’t worry about the dismissal. I work at the student advocates office and we get tons of cases of academic dishonesty. For first offense you get a non reportable warning, and second offense suspension. Dismissal is generally not on the table. I also want to clarify that this statement is my own opinion and not from SAO. Thanks.
Wonder what Nick Weaver thinks about this. He’s my go to man for anything CS related.

[deleted]
He was actually petitioning to hold public executions for cheaters at the end of the semester. scary stuff!
You joke, but in the past he SERIOUSLY threatened to put you on a blacklist on his website so that companies and grad schools in the future will deny you.

>(Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)

If murder was legal in the US he would go over to your house and end you if he could.
Anant Sahai?
How would that help tho? Cheaters would get dismissed by the OSC anyways
[deleted]
Right? I don't think I cheated but I definitely worked with my roommate/HW party people to get all of my HW answers
The cheating filter has very high specificity, not very high sensitivity (i.e. false positive rate is very low, false negative rate is very high), so it's very unlikely that someone who didn't cheat gets suspected/accused.

As someone who used to be on course staff for CS 70, I can say that at least when I was there, we were very careful to only flag someone if we were highly confident. There's a reason why these cheating notices only get posted near the end of a semester; it's because a lot goes into this. In my time, I have only come across one situation where someone was flagged for cheating when they didn't actively cheat, and it was because someone else copied their homework without their knowledge.
>prove innocence

what has this world come to?
What kind of evidence is typically presented when staff accuse someone of cheating? Is it just similarity of answers or something else too?
Isn't the course not graded on a curve this semester? I agree cheaters should face consequences, I'm just not sure if they impact anyone else
There’s no way to say for sure. I’m not a part of the course staff, but I guess you’ll have to trust in what the course staff says.
Certainly more harsh than the standard CS course approach, but that doesn't mean Sahai was lying or unwilling to do that.
Oh boy. You have no idea how 70 works... This isn’t really a CS class but a math class. While there may be few overarching approaches to solving a question, the notation and explanation are 99% of the time wildly different between students.

2 correct answers may also have very different correct explanations, but the same general approach.
First of all, you've asked a very complicated question that has different answers depending on the course. CS70 in particular is a more mathy proof based class (discrete math), so there are some problems where you don't have numerical answers. It's very difficult to ascertain cheating in this particular instance.
CS70 is about tracing n-dimensional cubes and sorting balls into bins. It was actually kind of a mindfuck. But, for example: how would you visit every vertex in a cube in one path without revisiting any edges? Even though there is a ""correct"" solution, it can be worded in so many different ways.
Cs 70 is a discrete mathematics class with proofs so the situation is a little different. Otherwise, there’s usually some similarities and differences in the code. They aren’t going to be completely unique
I don't think you understand how difficult it is to come up with new, unique problems that are _also_ able to be solved by an average undergrad and are instructive about the material. And then, once you do, it's up on chegg and stackoverflow the next day.
[deleted]
Because in a *curved class, cheating affects other students, not just your personal grade. When declaring a major like CS requires a certain GPA due to department limitations, then why would you want to let in the cheaters over the honest students who did almost as well without cheating? 

It’s not like individual hw scores matter in CS70 anyway, especially when you can take it P/NP this semester, so I actually think they’re being quite lenient. I flunked every assignment when I took it 3 years ago and still got a B.

Edit: it’s effectively a curved class. They set bins to target a certain grade distribution and adjust the difficulty of exams to correct for students doing too well or too poorly.
Maybe not libel, but pretty clearly a FERPA violation: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html
Severus Sahai
That’s just not true. The CSC for first time academic misconduct offenses only gives non reportable warnings.
the CSC conducts an investigation, meeting, and hearing, and the [SAO can help anyone accused of cheating](https://advocate.berkeley.edu/conduct/) (whether they actually cheated or not) navigate that process, and appeal the CSC's decision
So I assume you’ve taken CS70 with Sahai and spent 15 hours a week on homeworks?
whatever their method is of not falsely accusing people. I have my doubts
Working with your friends to understand and solve the question is okay. Mindlessly copying answers is what Sahai is trying to catch, I think.
Can TAs/Instructors see when we looked at specific assignments on gradescope? I looked a bunch of my assignments on gradescope out of anxiety and now im not sure if that makes me look guilty...
[deleted]
Not in this class, but a down side of this method is for people who didn't cheat but are highly anxious or worked with people but didn't necessarily copy, it might provoke false confessions. Especially this semester with PNP in place and looking at the giant difference between confessing and not
It varies. Similarity of answers is often the initial seed of suspicion. As the semester progresses, we might notice similarity on exams to other students, similarity to online solutions, etc. Another thing that often comes up is if a student usually does poorly on exams and homeworks, but does incredibly well on one particular assessment. That can also rouse suspicion.
This semester might be different, I'm not sure. I'm not in CS 70 (or even Cal anymore). Regardless, even if there is no curve this semester, I don't think it should excuse any cheating in any way.

Edit: There's also the ""unofficial curve"", wherein future homeworks/exams will be written to be easier or harder based on how students perceive past assessments.
He might’ve been willing but can he actually?
Yeah I was more curious about lower level classes like 61A
>I'm an incoming freshman

> Oh boy. You have no idea how 70 works...

Yup
Oh thanks for explaining! Do you have any idea how it would work in a lower level class like CS 61A?
I can’t say for eecs classes, but I have helped with upper div math class to come up with weekly quizzes or homework that’s about 4-6 questions, and it’s not that hard at all. 

Just like NP-complete problems reduce to each other, many problem are testing the same essence with different way of presenting and that can be conveniently changed like the reduction problems in 170. 

When I took 70, 170 and 126, all the problems are like some kind of mini novels or mini stories, and I believe this part may be hard to come up with every semester, but I really don’t see any point doing this. My 188, 106 series and some others are all just like test your mastery of the concept directly with a few sentences.

Which is better for educational purposes? Reuse wordy problem for several years that every one can easily find solutions online vs. some simple-wording problem that you absolutely have to rely on yourself to finish(or you have to understand it well enough to associate it with some other problems that you can find solutions online)? Personally I prefer the latter.

Or you can just use problems from some textbooks that have no official solution manual online. I found my 126 borrowed questions from some stochastic process book and it worked out great

And lastly, I really don’t think you need to worry about stackoverflow and chegg that much. Many problems don’t get answered in a limited timeframe of a week (many problems on math stackexchange get answers years later), and sometimes answers on chegg are completely bullshit (from my experience in a differential geometry class). It’s like: questions definitely with solutions online vs. questions that may get posted on chegg and have a correct answer (I would say the probability that this happens is significant lower than 1).
what did the deleted comment say?
The class isn't curved. It's by bins. They've stated multiple times other students impact should not impact your score. They should be more worried about teaching students better so that they do not have to resort to cheating. Not saying those who cheated are validated, but the homework is very difficult.
Yeah but he could just have the student's transcript show that information somehow

>However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31): Other schools to which a student is transferring
[deleted]
Not only do we track this, we also track your anxiety levels through the speed of your clicks as you navigate the course website and the Piazza posts.

JK. Gradescope doesn't show that information at all.
Its exactly because the FN rate is so high that they send it to everyone. That way, they are able to induce confessions from people who cheated but did not pass the stringent threshold. It's a pretty good system, to be honest.
It's a bit unfair to judge like that. There are some people like me who have a short memory. Always do well on the midterms because I remember stuff and do soooo poorly on the final exam because I remember nothing and even reviewing for a whole week won't save me.
Makes sense
Can he make a recommendation? Absolutely
I feel that in 61A cheating on projects is almost never caught. Honestly there are barely any approaches to solving their questions. Most 61A cheating incidents are typically on the midterms
61A gives you so much skeleton code, and the classes are so large, that I doubt they could justifiably call you a cheater even if you have _exactly_ the same code as a few other people. However, for other programming classes, where you're given less starter code and more freedom of how to solve the problem, the chances of two people having exactly the same code goes down by a lot, so false positives become more and more rare. By upperdivs, if two people have a high MOSS score, it's very likely they cheated.
61A changes assignments ever so slightly semester to semester, so if you copy/paste from solutions, it's pretty obvious to the staff but not to the students.
Yeah start by reading up on the MOSS score. 

I think this is less complex, but it could also be because I'm more familiar with this. Once you compile code or simplify it and cross-compare, you'll find that solutions that were copied are pretty clear.
\^ if you confess for one homework and catch a 0 on that, can that 0 be dropped as part of the 4 hw drops
The bins are adjusted if the average scores are too low. It’s effectively a curve. If many people cheat and inflate the average grade, they may not adjust the bins accordingly. 

I agree that they should put more effort into helping students, but that still doesn’t mean they shouldnt punish cheaters.

Edit: moreover, exam difficulty is also adjusted based on how the class is doing overall IIRC.

The core CS lower divs have a grade distribution that they aim for. While it’s theoretically possible for everyone to get an A, that will never happen and they make sure of that by adjust difficulty of exams.
Bins are curves in disguise. If the class is doing poorly, then they move the bins to create a better distribution. If the class is doing too well, then they make the exams absurdly difficult (and the shift the bins later to make up for it). Because CS classes are so big, the grade distributions fall into a predictable enough distribution that they can use binning because they predict the percentage of students that will fall into each bin.
He is not the school.

Edit: IANAL but I don't think this FERPA exception would cover a professor's retaliation against cheating. I think the only thing he could really do is grade penalize and refer it to the proper committees. Also, I didn't mean for the comment to imply that I thought he's not a part of the institution and can do what he wants; he can't, FERPA still applies. There are guidelines that I don't think this disclosure case meets: 

https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/99.31
So on a probability homework question, which is a take home assignment, if I were to google the question, I should be immediately expelled? Seems absurd to me.
Also helps generate lots of new training data for Moss

Believe me, the difference is obvious. Once you grade 300 exams, you'll also start to see the distinction between someone who knows what they're doing but has trouble remembering or has test anxiety, versus someone who coasted their way through the problem sets and has no idea what is going on.
61A cheating is only ever caught if you (a) copy exactly, including variable names, and/or (b) you usually get 0s on homework and get a perfect 2 on one, for example.
He's a school employee, so I don't see how he's not bound by the same rules. I'm sure a lawyer would love to get their hands on such a case.
I think he would be considered a representative. Might as well say that the clerks at Sproul that could release student records ""are not the school"" so its okay
MOSS is for code, Stanford manages it (but Berkeley invented the algorithm), and it doesn't use machine learning
If someone does something bad and they're afraid of getting caught, I don't think we should blame the system for causing extra stress. Not that cheating should be equated to crime, but the legal system in most developed countries also tends to give more leniency to those who confess. I think it's a very reasonable thing to do.

Furthermore, I think a pandemic or other crisis merits certain clemency, such as late drops and easier grading, but it does not excuse cheating, which harms the performance of other students and the integrity of the institution. Leeway should be given for a lot of things, but it doesn't include conduct violations.

After the semester is over and they are not your student anymore and assuming this happens when classes are live/school is open again. We are close in age (I am a year younger) as well as have common interests. Are there rules against it? If you are a uGSI what do you think about it?","I don't think there are any rules against it after the semester's over. Just make it clear there's no pressure and you'll understand if they don't feel comfortable with it.

My two cents: Was a GSI, not a uGSI, but I started grad school right out of undergrad, so I was often only a year or two older than my students. Would still have felt very uncomfortable with it, but other people might not be.

lol if a student asked me out after the semester I'd be very flattered and would probably say yes. Only real hesitation would be wondering if other TAs/the prof would judge me for it.

frankly I don't see anything wrong with it. doesn't seem any different than dating a former coworker. it's wrong for TAs to date students because they might have some control over their grades, but there's not really a ""power dynamic"" of the sort that would exist after the semester.
In the bcourse class you have to take as a uGSI it's not allowed while they're taking the class. You're not supposed to accept fb friend req's for ex. while they're taking the class. But after is ok.
