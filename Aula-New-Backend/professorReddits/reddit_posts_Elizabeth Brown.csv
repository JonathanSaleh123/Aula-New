"East Bay buyers using 'every trick in the book' to snag homes. Josh and Elizabeth Brown recorded a video letting the sellers ""know why we loved the house … and how important it was to us to be in a neighborhood that was safe for our daughter.""

"Cal's Wendy Brown to Elizabeth Abel's tenant David Peritz, an academic from Sarah Lawrence: ""It's past time for you to leave. And in case you are wondering whether there are any future possibilities of teaching at Berkeley, the answer is an emphatic no.

David Peritz must be a Drumpf supporter. Just like people in red states take more welfare than other states, Peritz is a parasite.

Wendy Brown is so progressive and strong! Parasites like Peritz are not welcome teaching at Berkeley because they will pollute our students' minds.
You read like satire, except I agree with the basic principles of what you say and your post history seems earnest
This is so progressive!
Reverse Poe's Law? When your post is so earnest it reads like satire?"
