"Minoo Moallem, a professor of gender and women's studies, teaches the class ""Objects and Commodities"". Her challenge to the class: Don't use anything made of plastic for 24 hours. Cal senior Tiffany Ma couldn't brush her teeth. She couldn't pour her cereal. Or even check her email.",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/01/09/learning-to-live-without-plastic/,2017-01-09 22:28:07,,"Cool idea.  Kinda curious what this has to do with gender studies though...

It is interesting that the student named in the article did admit to putting on make-up during the 24 hour challenge.  Make-up is very culturally ingrained in women's lives.
