Physics 137a Crommie vs Haxton,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mzz5bw/physics_137a_crommie_vs_haxton/,2021-04-27 14:30:04,"I am currently in 5c but really haven't been doing too well in it, so I'm basically going in blind to 137a. Should I choose to take the class with Michael Crommie or Wick Haxton? Haxton doesn't have any ratings on ratemyprofessor so idk anything about him.","Crommie is awesome.
I can’t choose either. I’m more interested in Haxton’s field of research but Crommie is supposedly a great teacher so idk."
