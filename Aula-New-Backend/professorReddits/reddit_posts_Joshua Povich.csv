BIO 1B Grade Bins,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kl8ct6/bio_1b_grade_bins/,2020-12-27 10:16:14,I took Bio 1B this semester and was really close to an A- and I was wondering if anybody else is in the same situation and has succesfully contacted course admin about rounding their grades? They mentioned the possibility of changing the grade bins and I've emailed Joshua Povich about this but who knows when he's going to get back to me (if at all).,"bc grades are already inputted into cal central, thereâ€™s not going to be any class-wide bin shifts. gl w petitioning though + anyone else in this situation!
so I had emailed him about a week ago and he mentioned that they donâ€™t round up percentages but they do round points (so 150.5 would be 151) for each category! However, grades have been uploaded to cal central so I donâ€™t think that they will change anything now.
Iâ€™m also really close to an A-, I emailed Povich but havenâ€™t heard back and idk who else to contact. Iâ€™m wondering if I should email the professors?
once grades are posted, i don't think they'll make changes unless there was a mistake.
so if i rounded each category up and my grade increased enough, would they change it?
iâ€™m not sure. I assumed they probably already did that when inputting your grade."
for those of u who have taken bio1b before ....,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nb6ttj/for_those_of_u_who_have_taken_bio1b_before/,2021-05-12 19:58:21,"i am a little confused on how grade bin shifts / curves work especially for bio1b. in bio 1b, the  mean on all three midterms was a 75% and the mean of the final was a 66%. In emailing Joshua Povich, he told me that for academic planning i should stick w the bins they have said (traditional grading where a 93.3% is an A etc). 

For those of you who took this class., was there any shift for you? Berkeley time shows the avg in this class is a B but our class stats seem to be pretty low? this is my first bio course at berk so i am not sure how this works... no bin shift at all seems wild. thank you.","Took the class last sem. There's no grade shift and yeah the stats were like that for us as well. It sucks because a few questions wrong basically means you're already at a B despite a week of studying in advance (like me).

And Josh is probably one of the worst head GSIs of all time.
I took Bio 1B in Fall 2019. Sadly, we didn't have any curve either. I know because a friend scored less than 0.5% less than an A and if there was any bin shifting, she would have gotten her A.
I took it summer 2020. No grade shift either. The exams were an average of 75-80
I am in the class but I doubt it will. Itâ€™s weeder class meant to torture you. Good thing I am done with it! I also saw a grade drop. Also do know when looking at bins, itâ€™s better to find the median since the grades are almost certainly not in normally distribution. My guess it that itâ€™s skewed to the left, but there the median might be much higher than the avg.
Currently in the class. Averages are lower from other semester but I donâ€™t know if they would curve it much given that a large part of the class is based on labs and lab quizzes (which have higher averages). I guess it all balances out :( 
Best hope is they add like an extra percent
what were ur averages on exams if u recall?
what were ur averages on exams if u recall? depresso espresso vibes tn
 thank u for ur comment. im so sad bc my grade dropped after the final. the avg was a 66 on it, you'd think they'd curve a little? :((
Unfortunately I don't remember the averages, but I think they were the standard for Bio/MCB at Berkeley (roughly 60 - 70%???). Also you said that this is your first bio class at Berkeley so I just want to congrats on starting your bio journey here. Fyi, I assume you'll take Bio 1A and 1AL and for my semester they didn't curve either. I found curving to be an important factor in my lower div chem classes but not so much in bio weeder classes :(
Thatâ€™s a very mean average. I sure hope they do. That sounds like it should be curved"
Spring schedule advice (pls help ðŸ˜” ),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jhknfk/spring_schedule_advice_pls_help/,2020-10-24 18:09:25,"I'm a freshman and kind lost on what classes to take. Rn I'm taking; math 1b, r1a, and anthro3ac. I'm also intended mcb. what would you think about this schedule?

Next semester I'm thinking about

1. chem 1a/1al with alexis shusterman
2. bio 1b with  David D. Ackerly, Bruce G Baldwin, John P. Huelsenbeck, Joshua D Povich
   1. would this class fill up fast???
3. not sure any good recs? I'm thinking of minoring in human rights so maybe a class for that?
4. lastly, i do want to try to take some sort of public health seminar and see if that's something i am interested in ... would also love any recs if u have any :)

&#x200B;

Thank you so much for your help. I'm a first gen student and jesus the help i get from this reddit, I'm so thankful for <3","Someone replied to my post which pretty much asked the same thing for chem 1A/1AL with Shusterman.
