Tehmina Khan,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ehs8i/tehmina_khan/,2023-05-11 02:07:49,Hey! I'm taking the R1A course in my first semester and I was wondering what do u guys think about Tehmina Khan? I did a lotta research about professors and I found some great ones like HSU but Tehmina Khanâ€™s fits my schedule. Also their class ends at 6pm so is it worth it?,Hey! I'm taking Tehmina Khan R1A this semester and I'm pretty nervous too! I hope we have the same classes.
