Judith Butler -- Limits on Free Speech?,https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3529-limits-on-free-speech,2017-12-12 19:40:34,,"What a bunch of Bs. Back in my day you could say whatever you want. You still can now. There’s a guy who screams about Jesus and about me gong to hell almost everyday but no one throws him a pepsi. Only reason people pretend to care is because a stupid media company makes a big fuss about it.
And then some dumb teachers puts on a black costume and pretend to fight for something. My best pal Harry says that’s why he don’t fight for anything. Last time he got into a fight it was over circumcising a baby. harry used to be a rabbi and he use to have to circumcise babies with his teeth. But some of the rabbis were nasty and were  [giving the babies herpes](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/herpes-babies-jewish-circumcision-ritual-link-rabbis-infants-a7620446.html)

That’s why harry don’t do that anymore. He’s pretty much a vegan now. He hates looking at chicken skin. Gross!
Neat. A good read.

I admire Butler's work, both academic and in her activism.
Thanks for posting uncle.  Butler brings up a number of issues I'd like to discuss.
Butler says: *the problem was that he [Milo] brought cameras into his lecture hall on several occasions, and projected images of members of his audience on a screen against their will and then proceeded to shame and berate people for being fat or for being trans or, indeed, for being ugly in his view.*

I've watched a number of Milo videos and have never seen him do this.  Most of his stuff is online so it should be easy enough to find an example of him spotlighting a random audience member and calling them out for ridicule.
Yeah, me too. I only have a semantic qualm with her comments regarding free speech (as I've read them in a few different forums):

She tries really hard to not make it an issue of ideologies-- no matter how repugnant that ideology is (e.g. fascism, racism, all forms of bigotry)--, but rather an issue of 'free speech' as such clashing with other certain values. In doing so, she never analyzes two things: 1) what establishes a hierarchy of 'values'-- what makes the values enumerated in codes of conduct in any way above those of free speech? And if they are not, how can we reasonably assume that any set of values, without demonstrating their hierarchy, is above any other? These values are obviously contradictory; how do we resolve that without any understanding of their relation? (2) She never questions the origin of these values. This particularly seems like a 'dumbing down' of her points, given her Derridean heritage. How could she leave unquestioned the genealogy of either system of values, without realizing that this affects the different responses to the values espoused by something which is an ideological position-- namely, free speech.

I think she's a good voice to bring into this community, however, no matter my qualms.
I think that might be a misprint. He doesn’t  put up pictures of the audience, but rather other students at the school who may or may not be in attendance.
Yoh me secy time now. 
""semantic qualm""
Why don't you move to Cuba you communist.
Misprint?  Would you settle for intentional misrepresentation.  
Again, I can't recall seeing other Milo videos where uses pictures of students (who may or may not be in attendance) in his presentations; he does identify  faculty who embrace coercive  ideologies or don't allow for viewpoint diversity.  If he does this regularly with students, there should plenty of video evidence.   Please post or link. I am not above correction.

[Justin/Justine/Adelaide Kramer](https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/uwm-student-says-shes-been-discriminated-against-at-the-klotsche-center) is the only student that I know of who has been part of one of Milo's presentations.  I don't agree with how he handled it. I do agree with his point, though, which challenged the idea that a biological male can declare himself a women and be granted free access to the woman's locker room.  For the record I am for non-gendered single stall restrooms and Cal's new non-gendered locker room annex.  I am against compelled speech and recognizing 70 different personal pronouns.   Obviously, YMMV.

You can’t say that you don’t recall videos where Milo used pictures of students and then immediately bring up an instance of him doing that as if it doesn’t count. Furthermore, Milo’s active encouragement of online harassment is well documented. You’re trying and failing to pick at semantics here. Whether you agree or not with censoring him, and I don’t, you have to acknowledgement that harassment is part of his modus operandi or you’re being disingenuous."
UCB Professor Judith Butler on Divesting from Two US Companies Enabling the Israeli Military,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CYhvzqD2iH8#!,2012-11-17 14:01:35,,"God I wish she taught classes instead of just brilliantly writing.
So surreal to go from cutting cards by her in high school speech and debate, to realizing that she's an actual person who is at your university.

"Unknown UC Berkeley professors who deserve an award: Joyce Carol Oates (she teaches the short fiction course in the creative writing department), John A. Dracup, Randy Schekman, Laura Nader, Saul Perlmutter, Oliver Williamson, Judith Butler, Yuan T. Lee, Michael Pollan, and Robert Hass.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/27/unknown-uc-berkeley-professors-deserve-award/,2017-10-29 21:54:04,,"[deleted]
Yeah, those unknown professors like Michael Pollan who has given a TED talk, been on national television numerous times, and authored 5 New York Times best sellers. Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.  Truly, he deserves some sort of award to signify the important contributions he has made.
Most if not all of these are extremely well-known and have won many awards.
Robert Hass is excellent. He writes a lot about human connection with our environment. So does the other poetry professor next semester (John Shoptaw).

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47553/meditation-at-lagunitas 

is good, as well as 

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/06/27/the-problem-of-describing-trees.

His poems also have themes of semiotics, for the linguistics/philosophy/literary theory people out there.

> Or the other notion that,

> because there is in this world no one thing

> to which the bramble of _blackberry_ corresponds,

> a word is elegy to what it signifies.

That is, (my interpretation), if we see a blackberry and describe it as a ""blackberry"", as in ""I saw a blackberry today,"" we've essentially destroyed that blackberry's uniqueness and identity, unified it with all the other blackberries in the world. Just saying the word ""blackberry"" at once marks the funeral of that specific blackberry and sings its final elegy. There is, I think, the value of silence: in appreciating some Thing without putting a name to it, that clouds our judgement with our memories of all the other Things of that name (ever met a girl with the same name as your ex?).

That last line just struck me as particularly beautiful when I read it, as a sharp upper bound on what humans are able to communicate with each other.
What a BS article. That is not a list of *unknown* people.
At least as famous as a critical theorist, especially one focused on a field as specific as gender theory, can hope to be. I think all of us humanities people pray to be even half as notable as her.
> Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.

Perlmutter too.

At least article writer can take solace that the Nobel committee agrees  with them that these guys ""deserve an award""? :P"
"Judith Butler, a professor in the department of comparative literature at UC Berkeley, said in a 2015 interview that ""if we jump too quickly to the universal formulation, ‘all lives matter,’ then we miss the fact that black people have not yet been included in the idea of 'all lives.'""",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/us/all-lives-matter-black-lives-matter.html,2016-07-15 21:17:50,,"She also said in 2012:

> Hamas [and] Hezbollah as social movements that are progressive, that are on the left, that are part of a global left

I'm all for BLM and equality, but Judith Butler is not a good person to move that forward and be representative.
No way Butler wrote that. I actually can comprehend what she's saying here.
Another commie professor
Nor have asians and latinos been included either. 
[Here](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/whats-wrong-with-all-lives-matter/?_r=0) is the interview, because context is a good thing.

\>media incessantly reporting BLM-related activity for past three years

\>Obama, major political party support BLM

\>Colleges across the country, especially the Ivy League, support BLM

\>Mainstream artists support BLM

\>Majority of television networks produce pro-BLM content

\>Just today, in Oakland, there were *two* helicopters out for no less than 60 BLM protesters. The protest was reported by most Bay Area news outlets, despite the fact that there are more people waiting on line at the newest bistro

\>Black people can get into colleges and professional schools while meeting fewer requirements

\>White people being killed by cops is swept under the rug in favor of reporting Black people killed by cops

\>Number of Black people killed by cops is actually lower than their representation in terms of total violent crime and homicide

\>Black cops have a higher chance of having shot a suspect than White cops

History will not look kindly on you.
Hear hear! ""All lives matter"" supporters are bigots who completely miss the point.
She's not writing for a specialized academic audience here, so the general public would obviously understand her better. Would you expect to automatically understand, for example, *Discipline and Punish*?
Grouping all people of Asian descent into ""Asians"" helps no one.  Groups like the Vietnamese or the Filipino, who have had a historically hard time assimilating into American culture and often don't make much money/live in impoverished areas and are arrested at disproportionate rates etc. are much, much different ""Asians"" than, say, the Chinese millionaires who send their kids over here to Cal to do whatever they want and have the privilege of coming to America for fun and school, not just in hopes of chasing the American Dream.  
Get outta here with your facts, dude.
True but does that mean Chinese American lives don't matter as much? 
Uhhh, nope. I never said that nor was that implied at all. Nice logical leap tho 
Well then I have no idea why you decided to give me a lesson on the grouping of all Asians when my comment is saying that Asian and Latino lives haven't really been factored into All Lives Matter. Does it really matter if you are Flip or Viet when there is still a subconscious racial attitude towards Asians? "
"Cal's Judith Butler to David Peritz: ""I've recently become aware of your scurrilous behavior—squatting in the home of my colleague, Elizabeth Abel. If you're not out of that apartment within five days time, I'll write to every colleague in your field explaining the horrible scam you have committed.""",http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/12/gender-theorist-judith-butler-sure-can-pen-a-scathing-email.html,2016-12-29 22:34:03,,"Note to self: don't piss of Judith Butler.

UCB or UCLA for English undergrad?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nmpjds/ucb_or_ucla_for_english_undergrad/,2021-05-27 21:17:50,"Hi everyone! Not sure if this is the right place to be posting, but I figured I would post just in case because I am looking for any and all advice. 3 weeks ago I was admitted to UCB and UCLA as a transfer student majoring in English. Since I am pursuing academia, research is really important for me in these next two years of my undergraduate career. I am looking to focus on 20th and 21st century Jewish American Literature and contemporary Queer Literature as well. I know that finding faculty to research with is the #1 thing when it comes to undergrad, and based on my research UCLA has more faculty who are more directly involved with Jewish Studies, contemporary queer literature, etc. However, Berkeley has a lot of faculty who I would also be interested in working with since they focus on things like modern narrative theory, contemporary ethnic or Asian American literature, and so I can apply their work to my own undergraduate thesis, and future research. 

I also really like how UCB has more academic student publications, and their English Undergraduate Association seems great. UCB also has a program called Berkeley Connect where undergraduate students are literally paired up with mentors in graduate school, so they can get help with research and guidance. This would be great for me since I am planning on applying to graduate school. Additionally, everyone I know at Berkeley says it is the most cutting-edge academically, and I am a huge fan of certain faculty at UCB, such as Judith Butler. 

At the same time, I would like to double minor and as a transfer student that is difficult with UCB's semester system. I am planning on taking Summer Sessions, but UCLA's quarter system would obviously let me take more classes. Additionally, I am looking at ghost-writing, content writing, and screen writing as back up careers and I think UCLA is better for those fields in terms of networking. 

I am wondering if anyone has advice on how to decide? I only have 5 more days and have been researching a lot, talking to lots of professors and other connections but am really struggling and want to make the right choice.","def berkeley if you are going for English. i don’t know much specifically about the jewish & queer literature classes though, but overall Berkeley is tied for #1 English program in US.
For your focus Berkeley imo
my friends who majored in english or comparative literature with a focus on english have loved their classes and opportunities here
Berkeley
I’d pick cal but be envious of Westwood and Disneyland
Westwood is boring and Disney is far away and expensive."
"In all of Berkeley's history, which member of the faculty would you most be interested in having a conversation with?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hcv0l7/in_all_of_berkeleys_history_which_member_of_the/,2020-06-20 15:21:20,"Berkeley's faculty is obviously top-notch, and yet it still pleasantly surprises me to find more and more notable members. I recently discovered that Michel Foucault was a Berkeley professor shortly before his death; I would absolutely kill to meet him and pick his brain.","Talking to Oppenheimer would be sick

Having a beer with Alex Filippenko would indubitably be fun imo
oppenheimer unabomber
Definitely Beverly Cleary. She's a god
Anyone on this list:

[List of UC Berkley Nobel Prize winners](https://www.berkeley.edu/about/history-discoveries#89)
There’s a decent book that came out a few months (maybe a year? what’s time anymore?) ago on Foucault and his time in California, teaching and dropping acid.
Daniel Kahneman (wasn't a prof only a grad student).

Herbert Simon
I talked to Oppenheimer, 

He told me that dark matter can travel faster than the speed of light. Dark Matter is what would enable time traveling. In order to time travel you have to go faster than speed of light. 

In order to see the Dinosaurs from afar, the spacecraft (Toba) needs to travel 1 billion light years in 1 solar year.
Hilfinger is apparently very interesting to talk to about any topic outside of data structures. But to answer your question, probably David Patterson
Judith butler probs
Ted Kaczynski would be an incredibly interesting conversation, no doubt
Michael Lewis teaches at the graduate school of journalism!
Oppenheimer was kinda the original unibomber if you dont think about it too hard
I knew she went here but I had no idea she was a professor too! Definitely my favorite alumni!
Kahneman was a Professor at Berkeley from 1986 to 1994. He lives in Berkeley.
Lewis has a podcast, and always ends with ""recorded at northgate studios"". Didn't know he taught here though.
I believe he has an office in North Gate Hall where he records them!"
