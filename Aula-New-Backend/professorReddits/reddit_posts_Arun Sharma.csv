math 54 with arun sharma,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cxorq0/math_54_with_arun_sharma/,2024-05-21 18:44:32,has anyone taken summer math 54 with arun sharma? how is it and how easy is it to get an A,"pretty fair class, and hes extremely caring. for every exam, he provided an extensive review sheet that was always harder then the actual exam lol. at the end of the semester he provided a pretty nice bin shift. 

the only downside is that the gsis seem to be hit or miss. i was lucky to have a good gsi, but a lot of my peers had gsis that just sat there and did nothing for the entire section. im not really sure if that was intentional or the gsis got lazy
Arun Sharma is the absolute GOAT
i agree that gsis can be a hit or miss. while i didn't have math 54 over the summer, i think just in general the math department for gsis are bad...."
1b with Arun Sharma or Emiliano Gomez?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cg7h04/1b_with_arun_sharma_or_emiliano_gomez/,2024-04-29 12:08:13,Title. Which would you reccomend more? ,"Sharma is not good at lecturing but is lenient with submitting stuff late & makeups. I‚Äôve heard his grade bins are also pretty lax but not too sure
I didn‚Äôt take precalc or calc before I got to Cal but I had the pleasure of having Sharma for 16a and now half a semester of 16b (he took over for Talaska mid year due to her medical issues, but she was terrible) and he is pretty good. His office hours are crazy, they‚Äôre daily, and he answers on Ed anything near instantly and at nearly all times. Even when he was a GSI for 16b before he took over the class, he made his own worksheets for students when Talaska failed to do so. Most people aren‚Äôt a fan of his lectures, but that‚Äôs the only criticism of him. His midterms can be a little challenging if you don‚Äôt do the worksheets, but as long as you practice and do homework you‚Äôll do fine. He‚Äôs shifted bins to be lower and he curves midterms up. So overall Sharma is very organized, provides plenty of review sheets, and is fair with grading, but you may need to do a bit of self studying
Sharma responds ed discussion posts within the first milisecond and is very helpful in general, has 3 different office hour slots every week. However his exam can be quite difficult as they don‚Äôt follow the same question format from your HW. I took 2 of his math classes and I‚Äôd say you‚Äôll def learn stuff, hes very good with answering your questions
Currently taking Math 114 with Gomez. He‚Äôs great and I‚Äôd recommend him - very available for office hours, and cares a lot about his teaching & his students. My one criticism is that he goes a little fast in lecture sometimes, though I think that‚Äôs partly the nature of the class I‚Äôm taking with him and he will probably slow down when he‚Äôs teaching 1B.

I don‚Äôt know anything about Sharma.
Sharma a cool dude, hosts lots of office hours
arun sharma is great"
Math 54 over the summer w/ Arun Sharma,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cfkj9q/math_54_over_the_summer_w_arun_sharma/,2024-04-28 16:34:05,How intensive is Math 54 over the summer.

MATH 54 with Arun Sharma,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18ht3km/math_54_with_arun_sharma/,2023-12-13 14:28:22,"Has anyone taken MATH 54 with Arun Sharma? How hard are his exams, quizzes, and homework? I was wondering about your guys' experience with this professor.","I had Math 16B with Arun Sharma ‚Äî obviously course content is much easier (I took 54 with Lott afterwards) but overall Sharma‚Äôs exams are quite similar to his practice exams which made the overall class pretty easy to score well
Arun is very straightforward and his explanations are nice. The examples he uses in class are much easier than what you would encounter on the exams. However, he does give you practice questions before exams and making sure you solve and understand them will guarantee you a great score on his exams. As a person, he is very kind and understanding. His tone is monotonic and he looks very intimidating so it's easy to have negative speculations about him. However, he is very understanding, replies quickly, and gives you chances to make up for missed quizzes and homework. I took Math 1a with him and I actually understood well.
I took 16a with him and he answered all of the students' questions on Ed within 2 mins"

Math 54 professor response to someone making memes,https://i.redd.it/wif49xnsqdzc1.jpeg,2024-05-09 03:41:54,,"Bro creates one meme and Sharma thinks he should be in art lmfao. But everyone who's been in Sharma's class knows he probably wasn't trying to sound mean
for reference this person and sharma have always joked around like this. sharma is literally a top 5 math professor is not an actual asshole üò≠

Throwback to this Sharma W when he took over Math 16b midway this semester after Talaska being so üóëÔ∏è
If you truly understand Sharma's POV and his teaching style, the humor is then no more than a piece of rare but classic Sharma behavior. As a student in the class, I'm all for the memes....

I know he's def not trying to be mean but goddamn Arun is  funny ü§£. Great teacher as well
‚ÄúWalmart version of Justin Bieber? Awww. Wish I could tell you what they sold at Walmart. Never been there. Never shopped at Walmart. But you seem like a Walmart expert. You probably shop there, don't you?‚Äù type response
sharma is the goat
Lmao is he trying to be snarky?
That‚Äôs really good advice, maybe he should consider a career in counseling instead of teaching math?
arun sharma is easily the best math prof what a goat
Omfg I love Sharma so much üò≠ he made me love calculus
He is a nice guy trusts me. lol 
This gotta be out of context
Apparently he‚Äôs a chess national master, this is his profile https://www.chess.com/member/lalu
Bro fucked around and found out, lol
That‚Äôs mean as hell
Now I want to see the ‚Äúbelow one‚Äù
Confirmed memes are art. You hear that mom? I'm not spending all day shitposting on reddit from the basement - I'm an artist and I'm developing my portfolio!
Sharma is a nice professor. IMO not the best lecturer but he genuinely cares about his student's wellbeing
I am the person who made all the memes and me and Sharma have had this type of relationship where it‚Äôs more fun and games from the time I made a long ass post convincing him to extend hw for a day to when i made a lot of troll comments about midterm 2. I don‚Äôt think he was trying to be hurtful just some cheerful end of semester yappage
Edit : spelling
Real
He basically saved us in 16b top g
What‚Äôs the tea? ü´£
I had talaska for 10A and 10B. what a total mess. i did well in both classes but i put in way more work than I should've because of her. she had health conditions going on though like brain swelling so I guess I can't be too harsh on her
nah i legit think he being honest about what he thinks he a nice guy, but sometimes words shit funny
dont think he meant it in a rude way
lmfao this. he sounds mad as hell telling a student who made a meme to get out of STEM
stick to ed buddy
So you are the famous artist üñºÔ∏è
But in all seriousness, as this professor to write a letter of recommendation to keep on file for after you graduate right after this quarter. A lot of students don‚Äôt know this, but THIS is the kind of relationship that gets you a top LOR
At the beginning of this semester Kelli Talaska (1 star on RMP) was teaching Math 16b and she was super unorganized. Homework and quizzes were 40% of our grade but she never posted homework so all our scores were weighed down by low quiz grades. She didn‚Äôt give out anything really besides lectures, even the GSIs were talking trash in sections bc they didn‚Äôt know what was going on with anything logistically. Sharma was a GSI for the class and he was answering all our questions on Ed while Kelli was silent, and he gave us his own midterm review sheet since Kelli didn‚Äôt. So then our midterm came and the mean was below a 50% as everyone including the GSIs agreed she did not give us enough time to do the midterm. 
Then Kelli just cancelled class for two days after she said she sprained her ankle or smt, but then at the end of the week Arun said he‚Äôd be taking over the class (due to Talaska‚Äôs health issues flairing up) and everyone got happy bc he was very helpful the whole time. 
Then the school tried to change the instructor a third time after the 2nd midterm (I think since he was teaching Math 54 also), but Arun and the math department fought against it since that‚Äôd be unfair to us.
So in conclusion W Arun
Fair and I assume that‚Äôs why she had to leave mid semester, but at the beggining of the class she said she couldn‚Äôt post the homework because her ‚Äúhand hurt‚Äù and she was ‚Äúmoving this weekend‚Äù, yet she had time to show us the recent cat photos she uploaded on her instagram üíÄ
Idk how you could interpret it in any other way; dude is telling you to switch entire majors for making one meme?

Edit: actually, he's a math prof, so I'd understand the lack of social cues lmao
W Sharma 

But like before that happened that sounded rough like no way you can reasonably expect students to do well and be happy. It sounds awful.
Dude I'm sorry you guys had to deal with that classic Kelli mess at the beginning of the class. Thank goodness for Arun. I had her for Math 10A/B and it was the worst. Midterm scores being graded over a month later. Grades also taking months to post. Lectures being cancelled the day of. I honestly pity Talaska. Maybe they were a better instructor ten years ago, but this recurring Talaska pattern is just so unfair to students. Their health issues seem to be pretty serious and reoccurring (at least they have been since my time with them in 2021. I seriously think they should take a break from Berkeley for their sake and also students sake...
The student who made it said they weren‚Äôt a stem major and an art major! Also Sharma def wasn‚Äôt being mean at all. The memes were memeing.
And on top of those significant points, it's not conducive to learning a lot of really important math either! Talk about failing as an educator :/

Maybe the other professor was going through something, I'm not making character judgements here. But it's undeniably ineffective education.
I'm ngl i know the person who made it and they aren't an art major. They in data science.
This hits hard if you are a irl data scientist that puts Tableau visualizations all day."
