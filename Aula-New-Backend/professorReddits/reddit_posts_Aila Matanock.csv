(Yet Another) “Schedule Advice” Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xbs5k/yet_another_schedule_advice_post/,2023-07-11 19:50:04,"Hi all! Incoming freshman here to terrorize you with another scheduling post. I am planning on majoring in Political Science, and am also interested in History or Philosophy. I’m sure you’ve seen a fair share of posts about scheduling, but I would appreciate any advice or feedback regarding these courses/professors:

POLSCI 5 - Aila Matanock

HISTORY 4A - Carlos F Norena

POLSCI 3 - Jason Wittenberg

PHILOS 3 - John Campbell

I was also interested in taking PHILOS 25A with John MacFarlane (instead of PHILOS 3) but noticed that the only seats remaining are reserved. Is it worth joining an already pretty full waitlist?

I realize it’s difficult to give advice without additional information, so any general recommendations are welcome. Wishing you all a wonderful day.","As a history major, this coursework looks a bit much in terms of reading volume and essay assignments but definitely not impossible. If you're a humanities student by heart, I wouldn't be worried about struggling. 

Carlos Norena is a great lecturer so don't be afraid to ask questions during lecture or during office hours because he is very helpful guy. History 4A is a pretty easy class but do keep up with readings or else you'll struggle with papers. 

Philosophy 3 with Professor Campbell was a interesting class but I took it during lockdown so I honestly can't recall what I learned lol
Took PS3 with Wittenberg a few years ago. His version of PS3 is more technical than the Broockman (the newer instructor), and notably has exams (Broockman's version doesn't). Wittenberg's problem sets were difficult, but not impossible. Exams were fair imo. I believe general consensus is that Broockman's version of the course is more enjoyable, but I personally think Wittenberg's PS3 is fine too.
I took PS3 with broockman this past spring and if you can hold out until taking it with him, I highly recommend it. Lecture was only mandatory for like 20 minutes bc there’s group assignments in class every day. There’s individual notebook assignments 1-2x a week, that usually are the same as the group component. Again, very doable. Problem sets weren’t that difficult whatsoever, coming from a non tech savvy person who can’t code for sh!t. Also my GSI let us submit late work, the final project was very easy, and the midterm/ final were MC and curved. Based on the negative reviews I heard from friends who took PS3 in the fall, I was so scared but it ended up being my highest grade at a 97% lol. Definitely wait to take it. Also u could always take the prereq Lower divs at a community college. Transfers for credit, and doesn’t affect ur GPA. PS 1,2,4, and 5 have course equivalents at community college.
Also, if u can in the spring take philos 2 with R Jay Wallace. Very easy, and actually quite interesting !"

You could find another late afternoon class instead of PS 5.  In that way, you can wake up well after noontime just like most of the STEM students lol. 

It’s a very easy sched.  You’ll probably want to manually fit in some time on your sched for the Stat 2 lectures, since the lecture portion of the class is held online.
easy breezy
Nice that you set up some time for TCB on saturdays
What’s the Sunday business class?"
