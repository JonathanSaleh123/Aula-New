How is Professor Glynda A. Hull? I am taking a cross-campus class with her next quarter!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5hbixm/how_is_professor_glynda_a_hull_i_am_taking_a/,2016-12-08 19:23:14,"The class is The Art of Making Meaning: Educational Perspectives on Literacy and Learning in a Global World. Has anyone enrolled in this class before or has any insight on the professor?

Thanks so much! ","Just finished taking Literacy: Individual and Societal Development with her, she is very passionate about the source material and has a lot to say about it. That being said, the class I took was in a ""flipped"" format, and most of our interaction with course staff was with the GSI for our discussion section, and instead most of her interaction with the class was with materials she put online, such as videos or readings. Those were good though. She's also very friendly, and I would imagine she's very accessible if you had any questions or wanted to speak with her during office hours, though I never did so."
Social Psychology (Brian Powers),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ko534b/social_psychology_brian_powers/,2020-12-31 20:37:53,"What are y’all’s experiences with this class/professor; did you actually learn? I’m currently choosing between this, Education 140 with Glynda Hull, and Psych 160 with Iris Mauss (if its open still).","I took edua140ac last fall. It required 30 + volunteer time, 8 field notes and one final paper. The grade was lenient but needed to spend so much time on it.
I just took it this past semester, pretty chill. I never attended lecture and got A- on both major papers.
took psych 160 w iris mauss and it was really chill; for tests they would release study guides for what exact topics were in scope. however you will need to read the textbook in addition to lecture. if you end up taking the class I have the e version of the textbook."

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"
