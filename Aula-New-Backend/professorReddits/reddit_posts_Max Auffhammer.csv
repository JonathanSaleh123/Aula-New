"Max Auffhammer from ARE ~ Jerry Seinfeld?! Looks kinda similar, sounds way similar, and is quite funny! Or maybe it's just me...",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bpj343/max_auffhammer_from_are_jerry_seinfeld_looks/,2019-05-16 15:27:06,"Here's a random talk Max gave [https://youtu.be/b3saAj8cAAo?t=70](https://youtu.be/b3saAj8cAAo?t=70). I have listened to Max only once, but can't stop comparing his style with Jerry Seinfeld. To me, they look, sound the same! Is it just me?","Oh fuck, thanks for the Nam flashback of a final I just had. I can't listen to his voice without thinking about that final.
How bad was the final?
Haha. When I read his tweets now, I hear them in Seinfeld's voice :D
I honestly miscalculated what was going to be on the exam. I guess it's my own fault.
I've heard about how badly managed Econ 100A was this semester
Oh you bet, they used last semester's section notes that covered materials that are way different from what we are taught in class.
Oh wtf, that's terrible..... I heard that midterm 2 was really bad as well
There’s a curve, so it doesn’t really matter how bad the exam is. If someone scores poorly and it’s bad with the curve, they’re just bad at Econ. So many people complaining in the 100A piazza and being super dramatic about it, declaring they were going to drop out and shit even before Max released the curve."
