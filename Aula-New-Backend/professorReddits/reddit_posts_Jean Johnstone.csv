Public Policy Minor Electives,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q3s9i5/public_policy_minor_electives/,2021-10-07 23:44:39,"what are some easy electives for the public policy minor that doesn't require a lot of reading?

also how is pub pol 157 with Jean Emery Johnstone? and pub pol 190 with David L Kirp? ty","c103 if you can get in - not that much mandatory reading and generally very easy (news articles)

also consider non pub pol classes that qualify under the minor - PH126 and PH181 weren't that much reading if i remember correctly
I took Kirp’s class and it was super chill, the classes were all based on discussion of current events, no lectures. Some cool guest speakers. Easy memos are the only assignments. C103 was also interesting and relatively chill, although the memos are significantly more involved than what I wrote in Kirp’s class."
