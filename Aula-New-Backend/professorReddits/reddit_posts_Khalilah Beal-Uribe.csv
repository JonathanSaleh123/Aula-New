Best instructor for math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y9htuz/best_instructor_for_math_104/,2022-10-20 19:54:50,"Out of Krutika Tawri, Ryan Hass, Khalilah Beal-Uribe, Mengxuan Yang, Zhuhai Ding, Olga Holtz. Appreciate any comments on teaching styles and fairness of the exams. 
I heard a lot of good things about Hass. Very outstanding. Don't if I should choose him since other smart math majors would def choose him and the class is curved.","Hass is an all around great choice. As you seem familiar, I won't elaborate apart from noting that his 104 is on the easier side. What I can say is this: absolutely do *not* take Beal. Awful and apathetic.

Holtz is the only other option who is a regular faculty member. She's known to be quite tough, but definitely thorough and reasonable. If you want to take a deep dive into analysis, she's the best option.

All the rest are postdocs/visiting scholars who are brand new.
I have Krutika Tawri for 185 rn. The lectures are easy to understand and the pace is decent. Hws are long in terms of number of problems, but the difficulty is not hard. The midterm was also not too difficult. I would recommend taking 104 with them. Dunno about the othersâ€¦
Bro hass all the wayyyy. Idk abt his being on the easier side cuz his exams are def challenging, but i can understand that his lectures and explaining concepts make understanding 104 possible. Honestly, just take Hass.
Hi! Haas's class already filled up for non-math majors :/. If I'm looking for a easier grade (because my GPA matters quite a bit to me), which one of the other professors would you recommend?

But she also j reads off the book? And sometimes she j skips proofs of important theorems. I do agree with the rest of ur comment tho. IMO she might be good at lecturing but she's not good at teaching.
Yang, Ding, and Tawri are all new postdocs, so I can't comment on their style/experience at all, sadly.
I am in the same boat as you. Where do you end up with?
Her 110 is considered challenging. You'll definitely experience linear algebra in its full force. But 110 is an amazing class, and Olga will give it the energy it deserves.
Yeah ur right. Thatâ€™s def a fair criticism. What I wanna say is that, if someone else is a solid 10/10 choice, go w them. But, they make a solid backup, and as far as profs go, you can very easily do way way worse, or so has been my experience.

I believe she uses Axler, yes."

What's with all the free space on Thursday and Friday??? Oski would be absolutely disappointed, and you'll bring shame to your family for generations.
easy! maybe add a weekend job for extra cash?
I thought you wanna have lunch with me :/
Dude is speed running college ðŸ’€
Never know there are 7am classes
Holy shit how many units is this
certainly there's a Friday PM seminar you can fit in there...
too many empty spots
No weekend classes? I hope you are doing an internship or fellowship too.
Only if you're ok with graduating later smh my head
Youâ€™re slacking off on Friday evenings.  Surely there must be a Chem 1a or EECS 16x class you could have taken with a Friday evening lab.
you forgot to  schedule time for crying
Itâ€™s enough to train a LLM
lil bro is taking math 202B and math 105 at the same time
Where are the extracurriculars? Need to join at least 5 clubs, one per day of the week
Too much free time, maybe get a job? ðŸ¤”
Rookie number
When I was at Berkeley I actually became Evanâ€™s hall. So like step it up
Too much free time Tu/Th mornings.
Looks like youâ€™ve got a bunch of lines of smarties
You forgot to add Yogurt Park to 6pm Friday.
Only one lab that goes to 10pm? Weak sauce.
There is no way you wonâ€™t have conflicting final exam times
I'm assuming your weekends are free, pls add some online classes to it
YOLO
Glad you got your r5b in
Seems a little light, maybe you should try applying yourself lol
add a few decals to cover the gaps after 9 and 10
That ChicanX studies class is gonna be tough
lol this is edited right?
where is cs70?
bro's gonna levitate to class
Itâ€™s Scandinavian so they are probably practicing daylight saving /s
itâ€™s alright I have seen people took 105 AFTER taking 202B
CS70 --> EECS 126"
