I lived in Towle when George Chang was there. Seemed like a chill life, he and his wife were at Crossroads every meal and he even taught class in Unit 2. I envy his commute.
wait is this the guy in study tips and good things
I took Classical Martial Arts Movies with Prof Chang, he was awesome! Sad he's not in the dorms anymore.

This concerns George Chang, Ph.D., formerly on the faculty of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at U.C. Berkeley.  Before joining the Dept. of Nutritional Sciences, Dr. Chang worked with Prof. Bruce N. Ames, who was one of the greatest leaders in the field of biochemistry   Chang and Ames published a paper together, in 1971, in Journalf of Bacteriology.   I was an undergrad in biochemistry at U.C. Berkeley (years, 1969-1973), and a grad student in  the Dept. of Nutritional Sciences, also at U.C. Berkeley (years, 1974-1980).   My program required that I take an oral examination.  For my oral exam, I chose professors George Chang, Mary Ann Williams, and Roger David Cole to be on my orals committee.  After giving a ten minute speech in the conference room, where I had my exam, I left the room and waited in the hallway.   About 5 minutes later, Prof. George Chang left the conference room and came over to me.  He extended his hand, and we shook hands.  Prof. George Chang congratulated me on passing my oral examination.  As a result, I was awarded a Ph.D. in biochemistry.   Well, that was a great moment, so many years ago.   George Chang was always a kind man.   He never tried to be intimidating.  I recall that his daughter attended college at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).   I've kept in touch with only one professor from my department, and that was with Prof. Barry Shane.  A month ago, I discovered that I had a few photographs of a party that my laboratory had at the faculty club in the U.C. campus.  I sent them to Prof. Shane, and he replied with a thank-you note.
He retired and I believe he moved out.
Yes it is.
he's alive smh
/u/JiForce and /u/disneycal

Yes, he moved out.

UC Berkeley named after a slaveowner - should we change the name?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hmn6ww/uc_berkeley_named_after_a_slaveowner_should_we/,2020-07-06 20:50:54,"The campus is currently considering name changes for buildings such as LeConte and Kroeber, who are named after men which were a confederate officer and an archeologist who violated native grave sites, respectively. Considering this, though, it has become apparent that the city's and university's namesake, George Berkeley, was a plantation owner who enslaved Africans. 

Knowing this, should we change the name of the University/City? If so, to what?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/hmn6ww)","I agree with the ideological reasons behind wanting to change the university and city's name but I think it'd be an impractical, logistical nightmare to undertake.
I'll say as a URM and the second person from my family to (hopefully) graduate from college that I care a lot about the Berkeley name and hope it can help me make a name for myself since I don't really have any connections anywhere. I'm sure other students with similar backgrounds feel the same.
The exact same conclusion reached at Yale.
I agree. It’s a lot easier to change the name of buildings than university itself even if I agree with the reasoning for change."
Berkeley=Job center for armed robbery!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ki8jv/berkeleyjob_center_for_armed_robbery/,2011-09-16 17:40:13,"Seen at Crossroads on a copy of the NY Times from [Papers with the Prof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Chang#Papers_with_the_Prof): http://i.imgur.com/J6a2C.jpg

""The Untold Story: In severe recessions, armed robbery and burglary become alternative professions. Right now the students at Berkeley are the new 'job center' for armed robbery. Students and their digital electronics are the prime source of 'revenue'!!""","I receive the UCPD reports as they happen.  I've watched this become the reality over the last few years on campus.  Sad but true.  

The economy is part of it, initiations are the other end of the stick.  

Most of the time, the thief is acting on concert with others who act as lookouts, fellow-assailants, but most importantly: witnesses to the newbies proving their boldness . . . sort of the internship for wannabe crooks.  

Most of the time the victim someone walking alone or in a small group with conspicuous consumption/gadgets on display.  In general, they tend to victimize vulnerable-looking people.

This is roughly 80% of the crime that happens here in Berkeley.  Keep your eyes and ears open, and if some needs help, do what you can to help them.  

But please remember: poverty is violence."
RESPONSE FROM UCPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gwoatp/response_from_ucpd/,2020-06-04 12:28:11,"Dear campus community members,

On behalf of the entire UCPD community, I want to convey my profound condolences and sorrow to George Floyd’s family and friends, and to members of the Black community who have, for generations, been the victims of racism and senseless violence. We must persevere and work together to rid our institutions of disparities and discrimination that cause grievous harm to communities of color.

I encourage every UCPD officer and UCPD staff member to think about our unique mission and role on the Berkeley campus; our responsibility to serve, with compassion, humanity and sensitivity, a diverse community of students, staff, faculty, and visitors; and our obligation and honor to do everything in our power to earn the trust of the public we are here to protect. I am also asking that we pause and reflect on the power and importance of free speech – both to heal and to advance necessary change. We support everyone’s right to peacefully demonstrate and protest. 

Our belief at UCPD is that the conduct of the Minneapolis officers involved in the death of George Floyd was reprehensible and inexcusable.  What we saw on the video is inconsistent with our training and our values. There must be change, and we must all be a part of it. There must be fair and equal treatment for all. This tragedy has weighed heavily on my soul and in the hearts of my UCPD colleagues. Such unfettered disregard for life by a police officer makes me physically ill. It is beyond comprehension and I refuse to stand silent at this total lack of care for the value of human life. George Floyd by all rights and reason, should be alive and with his loved ones today. Instead they are mourning his loss. His death is senseless, horrid and cannot be accepted by members of the law enforcement community who value their service to our communities.

Last January, in a message to the campus community, I stated my commitment to, “ensuring that our officers collaborate with and are responsive to the community; that we educate citizens on how and why we police; that we use alternatives to enforcement when possible; and that we endeavor to understand and counter the racism that has corroded goodwill between police and communities of color.” 

The killing of George Floyd at the hands of police officers has only strengthened our resolve to do what we must to build and sustain a department and a culture that recognizes and directly addresses issues of race, racism, and implicit bias; one that reflects the oath taken as law enforcement officers; and that aligns with the values we embrace as reflected in our Principles of Community. 

In the time that has passed since that message to the campus community was sent, we have taken steps toward this goal. While these steps are but a beginning, we want to share them with you now to convey to our community that we will not be complacent and that we are committed to taking concrete actions to better serve our Black community. Specifically, we have launched a new effort devoted to community engagement; we have invited community representatives to participate in the hiring of new officers; we have worked to implement the recommendations from UC’s Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing, including supporting the establishment of an independent community advisory board; and we have asked external auditors to closely examine UCPD’s policies and procedures related to campus interactions. Their report will be made public once it is completed.

I understand and accept that there is room for change in our police department, and throughout our local and national judicial and law enforcement institutions. I will continue to move our police department toward a better, more meaningful relationship with the communities we serve. I am proud of how ready and willing our officers are to work with me to fulfill this essential commitment. When all is said and done, we are and must always be public servants, for all of the people, all of the time. 

In partnership,

Margo Bennett, Chief
University of California Police Department, Berkeley Campus

 

In my personal opinion, this is a great first step to unity and healing. It does not fix the problem, that will take time and example. Actions speak louder than words. Yet, this is the initiate and leadership we expect from individuals looking for change. Again, my personal opinion. Go Bears!","I doubt anyone is going to read this, but I can say ucpd's response to crimes related to sexual assault and normal campus shenanigans has been top notch, at least in my personal experience. I have no experience regarding how ucpd treats students of color so I can't say if they don't suffer from systemic racism like other police departments, but I and people I know have been in tricky situations involving ucpd, and the officers that I have met have always been chill and very understanding.

If u guys want a personal story (I have a few haha) I got the cops called on me bc of msgs I stupidly posted on piazza about how upset I was and the professor or gsi of the class thought I was suicidal. I had to go to the ucpd department, shitting myself all the way, and they basically laughed it off and said it was really clear that I was just upset about the class and not suicidal at all.
https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/07/03/ucpd-handcuffing-of-11-year-old-boy-prompts-criticism-campus-response
Hey, I read this and I think it’s exactly what more people need to see. We can’t get rid of law enforcement, we need a restructuring. There are so many good cops, which should  be praised for their good behavior!
honestly dont know why you are getting downvoted. guess people are still desperate to uphold the status quo
One day they’ll understand that platitudes don’t mean anything
If they didn't fire anyone, they aren't serious. Guarantee they have someone in their department just itching for an excuse to jump on someone. I've met cops who are individually alright people, but I've never met one willing to risk their job for their community."
Who was actually behind the protests?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/65z1un/who_was_actually_behind_the_protests/,2017-04-17 16:02:35,"I have spent a significant amount of time researching and investigating twitter, instagram, facebook, facebook live, 4chan, mainstream media, youtube, reddit to try to piece together the true narrative behind the protest. My investigation yielded some shocking results, there is much more to these protests than can be seen at first glance. This might sound crazy at first but stick through to the end and trust me. These protests and the ensuing fight did not small organic locally organized movement but one of international conspiratorial origins. There are big players in the world who want to interfere in our politics, beliefs and lives. They don't care about us or anything other than making sure their beliefs and ideologies ""win."" This protest and clash was simply a battle in their war to spread their ideologies and beliefs further down our throats. They want us to accept their viewpoint and disregard everything else. 

Not just that, I have another shocking revelation that I have discovered. I'm fairly confident that the university itself is in on this. They have been spreading this ideology for many years by radicalizing these young and malleable people by disseminating unethical concepts and beliefs that have caused this situation. The most shocking revelation I have uncovered is that these protests are not caused by the people you might have heard before. I believe that it was not caused by George Soros, Charles Koch, President Trump, **John Oliver**, Steve Bannon, Jorge Ramos, Milo, Anderson Cooper, The Illuminati, The **Easter Bunny Spicer** or Shia LeBeouf.

The real people manipulating the media and society to help push, create and encourage protests like this weekends and future ones? **PepsiCo.** 

Now, this might be confusing for you. Why would PepsiCo want to be a part of doing such crazy acts? And how the hell has the university been working with this corporation? Continue reading to further understand the truth.

Pepsi is the official drink of UC Berkeley. In 2011 the company and the the university [signed a ten year deal to sell Pepsi products on campus.](http://www.dailycal.org/2011/08/21/campus-signs-letter-of-intent-for-new-pepsi-beverage-contract/)[ Pepsi paid for this dirty deal with the univerity with a measly 15k a year in donations for ""sustainability.""](https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/beverage2.pdf) As we all know **Daddy Dirks** is an amoral neoliberal shill. After joining as Chancellor in 2012, and noticing that we were in bed with Big Soda. Thinking that simply spreading our legs wasn't enough, he wanted to let them take our cornhole. He came in during a period terrible budget shortfalls. The UC system was put in a tough spot with the state cutting funds and so they turned to alternative avenues to find funds. They tried all sorts of paths, including attempting a secret plan to take the public universities private. See [columns like this in the Daily Cal](http://www.dailycal.org/2012/04/23/who-said-privatization-was-bad/) in an attempt to try to sell the idea of corporate (Pepsi) takeover of the UC system as a smart idea. [Their botched attempt to make a corporate logo.](http://www.aiga.org/the-uc-logo-controversy)

They chose to cut a secret deal with their already strong sponsor Pepsi to try to close the funding/budget gap. The deal was to subliminally manipulate and spread Pepsi's message to all students and general Berkeley residents. Dirks is the person who was able to run away with our public funds. You think if he was able to brainwash the UC Regents and the IRS he wouldn't be able to do the same to us? Wake up sheeple! Cal's most recent marketing hashtag is #InThisGen. Pepsi's most famous slogan? The Choice of a New Generation. There are no such things as coincidences. 

Pepsi's interest in this is to take global market share from Coca-Cola. Being #2 for so long has been rough on the company culture and morale. The current CEO is [**Indra Nooyi**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Indra_Nooyi) a person with esteemed credentials, but like Pepsi, are from the number two private university. (Yale) not the best causing her to always strive for number one. She decided, along with the rest of the PepsiCo board to push forward an ambitious plan to change the world as we know it. 

Pepsi knows that everything is advertising. Modern culture is dependent on the intersection of two things, place and people. For place, everyone looks to **America** to dictate the world's culture. America looks to California to dictate the country's culture. For people everyone looks to the young since they're the most important group there is. Where are large groups of young people located in California? **Universities**. PepsiCo believed if they took over California Universities they could overtake the world. In 2014 [Pepsi signed a deal with UC Davis.](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/pepsi-deal-bring-10-million-university/) In 2015 they [took over USC.](http://www.dailygamecock.com/article/2015/08/pepsi-wins-usc-dining-contract) 

PepsiCo deliberately released the **Kendall Jenner** ad last week because they knew people would be outraged. They times the releasing of the ad so that enough time would pass that people would get the pop culture reference it would still be quite apparent in their minds. They timed it so that it would all come to head at protests this weekend. They spread their **message** because of the ensuing publicity. From now on, whenever protests occur their brand will be associated. The reason they chose to release this in time for the Berkeley protests? 

Even though Pepsi was gaining a stronghold in California and our state's universities, our residents strongly fought back. Berkeley fought against big soda and won. [The soda tax was passed in **2014** and in 2016 proved that big soda was wrong.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/23/491104093/berkeleys-soda-tax-appears-to-cut-consumption-of-sugary-drinks) They saw that their allies, neoliberal shill Dirks, California, and Berkeley were turning their backs on them in favor of more righteous progressive agenda's and enacted an attempt of malicious revenge. Think how people were wondering if there were paid protestors? THEY WERE RIGHT! Just that these people were paid for by PepsiCo. It's definitive.

[This piece of high quality independent journalism is the kind this country and world needs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u3uhKxNPNg&feature=youtu.be) This piece of independent journalism shows how even in a time with the country so divided on what we can believe and what we cannot because of biased and lying media, we can count on ordinary citizens documenting and showing us the truth. An **inspiration** showing us the journalism of the future.

That said, watch it twice if you don't catch the bias in there. Though on first watch the video might seem like a fully independent citizen journalist documenting **the facts**, he has actually been advertising for Pepsi the whole time! Pepsi has attempted to take over the last bastion of our democracy. The integrity of all independent citizen journalists are now under attack. It is even possible that after watching the ad he himself has been brainwashed into advertising for Pepsi without knowing it. Kendall Jenner implanted subliminal messaging into his skull! The horror! 

Knowing that there will be protests in Berkeley and elsewhere for the next couple of years they have positioned themselves in a very profitable position. They are encouraging these events that undermine our democracy and way of life in an effort to sell us sweet soft drinks. PepsiCo has been planning and playing fourth dimensional chess similarly t how our president played **7th** dimensional chess and won himself the presidency. Wake up sheeple! Don't fall for Big Soda's game! If we do not wake up in time our entire way of life and world might burn because of big soda's greed!

Anyone have definitive information on union member's strike responsibilities?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1qx4ql/anyone_have_definitive_information_on_union/,2013-11-18 12:25:46,"The UAW has a ton of FAQ's on the strike, but nothing specifying if you have to strike, the penalties for being in the union and not striking, etc.

Info, particularly info backed with links, would be appreciated. 

EDIT: The GA sent this out. The answer is you don't have to do anything one way or another.

**1) Why is UAW striking on Wednesday?**

AFSCME 3299, the union covering UC service and patient care workers are going on a one-day strike on Wednesday, November 20th. They are striking to in response to intimidation of their workers by UC management. AFSCME’s  one-day strike will start at 5am to 10pm on November 20. 

The union covering GSIs, Readers, and other Academic Student Employees (ASEs), UAW 2865, has called a sympathy strike with AFSCME for Wednesday. Question 13 below has more info on AFSCME and their reasons for striking. 

**2) What does it mean to participate in the strike?**

This means that GSIs, other grad students, and undergrad tutors are asked to withhold their labor on November 20th, which includes not teaching sections, holding office hours, grading papers, or anything related to your duties as an academic worker. 

**3) Who authorized the UAW to strike?**

UC academic student workers voted 96% in favor of granting the union the ability to authorize strike actions; over 2,000 students participated in an historically high turnout. The UAW was authorized to strike under a variety of circumstances, including in solidarity with another union. Following AFSCME's call for a strike, the UAW leadership decided that AFSCME's call for a strike was a sufficient justifying circumstance for a one day solidarity strike. The UAW also held a large, public forum on November 14th with members, undergraduates and AFSCME workers to discuss the solidarity strike. 

**4) Do I have to participate in the strike?**

**It is an individual choice to strike or not. However, not striking or ""crossing picket lines"" will be interpreted as not being in solidarity with the UAW strike in support of AFSCME's action.**

**5) What happens to me if I strike? Can I be fired or disciplined for participating in the strike?**

No. The California Supreme Court has ruled that public employee strikes, including those by UC employees, are legal, and the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) protects your right to strike under the conditions under which the strike is occurring on Wednesday. If your employer threatens you, warns or intimidates you about striking, or disciplines you for striking, contact a UAW officer immediately, as this is an Unfair Labor Practice. This includes retaliation against future GSI or reader placements that are pending. These rights also apply to international students.

**6) Can my pay be docked?**

Technically, your pay can be docked for one-day's labor. However, the UAW feels this is unlikely with a one-day strike because we are salaried and it would be difficult for management to calculate and deduct pay for a day. Additionally, many GSIs and readers report working well in excess of their required hours, and the UAW encourages members to keep track of their hours worked and to pursue grievances in cases where the maximum number of hours has been exceed.

**7) Do I have to tell my professor/supervisor if I choose to strike?**

No. You are not required to inform your supervisor or professor. According to the UAW, if you feel that you need to send an email to your supervisor explaining your reasons for striking, it is best to keep it simple, with a statement along the lines of: ""I will not be working on the 20th. I will be participating in my union's legally protected strike, which is being undertaken in sympathy with AFSCME workers, who are striking to challenge the unlawful intimidation they faced from managers when they struck this past spring.""

**8) Do I have to notify my students?**

The UAW cares deeply about students and fights to promote quality public education, but feels it is important for labor to cease on Wednesday. Use your best judgement to reschedule exams, make alternative arrangements for turning in assignments, or changing office hours for this week.

**9) What if I am giving an exam or have an assignment due that day?**

The UAW cares about students and wants them to get a quality education but feels it is important for labor to cease on Wednesday. Use your best judgement to reschedule exams, make alternative arrangements for turning in assignments, or changing office hours for this week.

**10) Who do I contact in the union if I face intimidation? Where do I get more info?**

You can contact your UC Berkeley UAW reps including Zachary Manfredi (zachary.manfredi@gmail.com), Amanda Armstrong (mandy.armstrong@gmail.com), and Munira Lokhandwala (muniralok@gmail.com). Also there is a link about the November 20th actions: http://berkeleyuaw2865.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/november-20-solidarity-strike-pledge-please-sign/. 

**11) What activities are planned for the day?**

Whether or not you choose to strike on Wednesday, if you are interested in showing your support you can join the workers at the picket line at Telegraph and Bancroft throughout the day. In particular, there will be assembles at 11am on the steps of Wheeler Hall, and at 12pm there will be at rally led by AFSCME workers at Sproul Plaza.    Food will be served to strikers and supporters all day at West entrance at Oxford and Center. 

**12) What is the administration's stance?**

Provost George Breslauer issued a statement regarding the administration's stance. However, the UAW has issued an open letter (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N8JgNNJaSvfQFeNfiT5-sj4Im0mkbrpzkygn4TJawx4/viewform) stating that the administration is engaging in illegal intimidation and that the strike is a legally protected action. Peaceful concerted activities are legal and protected by labor laws. The  Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) prohibits representatives of the UC (including faculty supervisors) from interfering with any right of its employees. The Public Employee Relations Board (PERB) has held that even if the intention of University representatives is not to discourage or impede the right of employees to take collective action,  including striking, if a message is communicated that could have the effect of discouraging or impeding employees from striking, this message would be in violation of the statute. Again, please let the UAW know if you are facing intimidation or threats by any staff, administration, or faculty members.

**13) What is AFSCME and why are the workers striking?**

AFSCME 3299 is a UC union comprised of dining hall workers, janitors, hospital workers, shuttle drivers, and campus grounds keepers. AFSCME is currently fighting a 1.5% wage cut unilaterally implemented by UC management as well as threats to their pensions (to put the economic status of these workers in context, 99% of these UC employees are eligible for some form of public assistance). Specifically, AFSCME workers are striking for a second time to address management retaliation against workers that stem from their May strike. If you want to read more about how how these workers have been treated by the administration go here: http://www.afscme3299.org     ","Seconded.

This whole thing is a clusterfuck - to add to this confusion, apparently Breslauer sent out an email to department chairs and deans this morning saying that the union misinterpreted what we can and can't do during contract negiotiations and that we actually are not legally allowed to strike. 
In case anyone is curious of the (strike) context:

http://www.dailycal.org/2013/11/18/grad-student-workers-go-strike-systemwide/
Here's an equally important question. Can no GSI work on Wednesday? Should I bother showing up to section? 
I read the title as ""unicorn members"" and I got excited
I think that's probably incorrect (that we can't strike). Our contract expired. I'd be surprised if we were still held to the terms of the contract once it expired...
GSI's can choose to strike or not to strike. It's up to them.
Yes, this was my understanding, as well. I just received the actual email from Breslauer - my department sent it out along with a message saying they support our individual decisions but are not taking a stance on the issue. Which still doesn't answer your question, obviously. Meh.


>Dear Colleagues:

AFSCME, the union that represents Service and Patient Care Technical
workers throughout the University system, has called for a one-day
strike on November 20, 2013.  The UAW, the union representing GSIs,
Readers and Tutors has also voted for a strike and there is indication
that the UAW will seek to have its members join with AFSCME on November 20. It is the University’s position that a strike by GSIs is premature because the University and the UAW are still actively bargaining over the terms of a successor agreement, and the parties have not exhausted the collective bargaining process including the conclusion of bargaining, mediation and fact-finding.

The University has a long tradition of supporting civil expression of
individual views and supports fully the free speech rights of all,
including academic student employees.  So long as they meet their
scheduled teaching obligations and do not violate University policy,
employees, including academic student employees, are free to join in any
demonstrations or protests they choose.  Furthermore, classes are
expected to be taught at the assigned time and, in the assigned location
unless a change is requested by the course instructor and approved in
advance by the Department Chair. Requestors should be advised that all
student needs, especially disabled student access and assistive
services, must be accommodated if a class is rescheduled.

Please remind your faculty to ensure that University teaching
obligations for November 20, 2013 are met. For more information,
please see this website: http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/labor/strike

## Francisco I. Madero (1873 - 1913)

### Photograph: [Link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Francisco_Madero.jpg)

### Claim(s) to Fame
* Leader of the Mexican Revolution
* 33rd President of Mexico (1911 - 1913)

### Degrees Received at Berkeley
* Unknown (Attended 1892–1893, majored in Agriculture)

### Life Story:

For all the rep Berkeley gets as being the school filled with fanatic revolutionaries, few people know of the one Berkeley student who _actually_ led a revolution, _actually_ toppled a government, and _actually_ installed himself as the leader of an entire country. That one man was Francisco I. Madero, and he overthrew the 33 year long dictatorship of Mexico in 1911 in one of the most defining acts of Mexican history.

(Excerpts taken from his biography by Jim Tuck, found on MexConnect [here](http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/278-glorious-innocent-the-tragedy-and-triumph-of-francisco-madero-1873%E2%80%931913).)

Francisco Madero was a man who was too good for his own good. Naive, trusting, merciful toward those who deserved no mercy, he was in the end betrayed and murdered by those in whom he had mistakenly placed his trust. A rich man's son whose following included bandits and killers, a teetotaler and spiritualist in a society dominated by hard-drinking machismo and mawkish veneration of saints' images, he was such an odd-man-out that the terrible fate that overtook him seems almost inevitable.

Yet Madero was truly a figure who achieved vindication in martyrdom and death. Today, the plotters who laid him low are forgotten or reviled. By contrast, Madero's memory is venerated everywhere, no town or city in Mexico is without a street that bears his name and the statues built in his honor would fill an armory.

His career was filled with contradictions. A white man, he led a movement of oppressed Indians against a government representing a European-descended establishment — but headed by an Indian. Born to wealth, he led a rebellion of the poor and downtrodden against a greedy power structure many of whose leaders had been born to poverty.

The future liberator was born at Parras de la Fuente, southern Coahuila, on October 30, 1873. Though he is usually known as Francisco Indalecio, legal documents and his marriage license list him as Francisco Ignacio. Like many privileged youths of his day, Madero received part of his education abroad — at a Catholic school in Baltimore, at a lycée in Paris and briefly at the University of California at Berkeley.

In 1908 Madero published a book titled La sucesión presidencial en 1910 (""The Presidential Succession in 1910."") Hardly inflammatory, this volume didn't even call for Díaz to step down — it merely urged an honest election with the removal of Corral and representation for those who opposed Díaz's reelection. But the book sparked a firestorm of anti-Díaz sentiment. A strong anti-reelection movement sprang up, complete with anti-reelection clubs and then an anti-reelection party, with Madero as its candidate.

Díaz began to grow alarmed. At first, he had considered Madero a joke, referring to him as el loquito (""the little madman""). At a meeting between the two, he caustically observed that ""a man must be more than honest to govern Mexico."" But then he witnessed the groundswell of popular support for anti-reelectionism. On June 6, 1910, he had Madero arrested on charges of inciting to rebellion. Thrown into the penitentiary in San Luis Potosí, he was bailed out by his influential family. On October 4 the tame Chamber of Deputies made the expected announcement and officially declared Díaz and Corral winners in the rigged July election. Deciding that rebellion was inevitable, Madero jumped bail the next day and fled to the United States.

November 20 is celebrated in Mexico as the Day of the Revolution. If one wants to nitpick, it is the celebration of a fiasco. Madero crossed into Mexico with a few followers, the large force he was expecting didn't materialize, and he was forced to recross the border.

But the Revolution was alive and well. Under such authentic popular leaders as the ex-rustler Pancho Villa, the ex-mule driver Pascual Orozco, and the ex-horse trainer Emiliano Zapata, a ragtag army was kicking down the rotting timbers of the Díaz regime. Madero rejoined the revolution and was on hand at the May 1911 battle at Ciudad Juárez that sealed Díaz's fate. It was there that Madero's trusting and forgiving nature first came into conflict with those who believed in playing hardball. Villa and Orozco had wanted to execute General Navarro, the federal commander at Juárez, because he had given the order to bayonet rebel prisoners. Madero, taking into account that Navarro was eighty years old, wished to release him. Following a stormy scene where Orozco threatened him with a pistol, Madero eventually had his way and Navarro was released. Though Pancho Villa, who enormously admired Madero, begged forgiveness for his part in the mutiny, Orozco forever held a grudge and would put his thoughts into action before too long.

After the defeat at Ciudad Juárez, Díaz resigned and went into exile. Madero made a triumphal entry into the capital in June 1911. In October he was elected president by a huge margin in what was probably the most honest election in Mexican history.

But euphoria would soon vanish. In March 1912 a resentful Pascual Orozco, armed and financed by the Chihuahua cattle barons, mounted a counterrevolution. To smash Orozco, Madero called on one of the most sinister figures in Mexican history, General Victoriano Huerta. Another conspirator against the trusting Madero was an individual who surely rates as the worst ambassador in the annals of U.S. diplomatic history. Henry Lane Wilson, hatchet man for big business and apostle of dollar diplomacy, longed for the good old days of Porfirio Díaz. Then there had been a favorable climate for the global capitalism of its day and the masses were held firmly in check. Admiration for Díaz was a common bond between Wilson and Huerta, the latter having wept when the old dictator was deposed and commanded the guard train that took him into exile. Another bond between them was a fondness for the bottle. Their attitude toward Madero was similar to that of two barroom bullies who taunt and ridicule a teetotaling Sunday school teacher. ""You cannot imagine the impertinences of (Wilson),"" said Madero to an associate. ""In a few months Woodrow Wilson will become president of the United States and he is my friend ... I will ask him to change ambassadors. This Henry Lane Wilson is an alcoholic ... Madero, infuriated by Henry Lane Wilson's arrogant and patronizing attitude, was delighted by the unrelated Woodrow Wilson's victory in the 1912 presidential race and looked forward to his becoming president in March 1913.

It was a March he would never see. On February 9 a violent artillery duel broke out in Mexico City. This was in conjunction with a sham battle staged to create an atmosphere of confusion that would facilitate the removal of Madero. The ""rebels,"" secretly in league with Huerta, were led by Félix Diaz, the old dictator's nephew. Again, Madero's trusting nature would lead to disaster. General Villar, who commanded loyalist forces in the plaza, was wounded and Madero appointed Huerta to take his place. Though he neither liked nor trusted Huerta, Madero overrode most of his advisers in making the appointment. Possibly he had in mind Huerta's skilled leadership during Pascual Orozco's rising.

Though this was a fake battle at the higher levels, there was nothing imaginary about the terrible toll of civilian casualties. Taking advantage of widespread desire for the terror to end, Huerta had Madero arrested on February 18.Then he sent the following wire to President Taft: I HAVE THE HONOR TO INFORM YOU THAT I HAVE OVERTHROWN THIS GOVERNMENT ... FROM NOW ON PEACE AND PROSPERITY WILL REIGN.""

In there ever was an unindicted co-conspirator in a great international crime, it was Henry Lane Wilson. He had previous knowledge of the plot, his admiration for Huerta and contempt for Madero were well-known and — the worst blot on his record — he disregarded all pleas to save Madero's life. The day after Madero's arrest Huerta asked Wilson what he should do with Madero — banish him or put him in an insane asylum. In a Pontius Pilate gesture, Wilson replied that Huerta ""ought to do what is best for the country.""

The murderous Huerta saw this as carte blanche to deal with the Madero situation as he saw fit. On February 22nd, while being transferred to another prison by car, Madero was shot dead by one of his captors. Huerta immediately declared that the deposed president had been killed in the crossfire when a group of sympathizers tried to rescue him. To lend credence to Huerta's fabrication, the faithful Henry Lane Wilson issued a statement insisting that it was the truth. Equally sordid was the announcement of a pact between Huerta and his ""enemy,"" Félix Díaz, that Díaz would succeed him as president. (That Huerta later doublecrossed Díaz is beside the point.) There is a final grotesque touch. February 22, the day of Madero's murder, is Washington's birthday. That night Wilson invited Huerta to a reception at the American embassy. There the two conspirators poured champagne and lifted their glasses in a toast — to George Washington.

History has a way of setting events into proper perspective. In January 1954 a Gallup poll showed Harry Truman to be a highly unpopular ex-president and revealed that 50 percent of the American people approved of Senator Joe McCarthy's investigations. (As opposed to 29 percent who disapproved.) Today Truman is widely respected and McCarthy's name has become a synonym for political gangsterism. Right after Madero's deposition and murder, many Americans believed Henry Lane Wilson's claim that Madero was ""a man of disordered intellect"" and Huerta ""the Mexican Cromwell."" Today, Madero shares honors with Juárez and Hidalgo in the pantheon of Mexican heroes while Huerta is universally despised and Wilson is a figure of opprobrium on both sides of the border.

### Legacy

Though (as the previous biography mentioned) Madero's life ended in tragedy, his influence upon Mexico and upon world history in general cannot be understated. One of the revolutionaries who helped create modern day Mexico, his name now graces [one of the most important avenues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madero_Street) in central Mexico City, as well as multiple large throughfares through Mexico. [Statues](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mexico_City_2015_130.jpg) of [him](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Monumento_a_Francisco_I._Madero_frente_al_Centro_de_las_Artes_SLP_003.JPG) are found in most Mexican city centers, and his name even sits on a [Chicago middle school](https://schoolinfo.cps.edu/schoolprofile/schooldetails.aspx?SchoolId=610215). Madero was a truly remarkable man who sadly died way before his time.","If you’re interested in this topic take history 8A!!! It’s a great class on conquest and colonialism in the Americas and includes the Mexican revolution. We learned about Madero in the class too!! Highly recommend as a history breadth. 
Damn I wish I knew this before I applied. It sure would’ve made convincing my parents it was a good thing a lot easier. I heard so much about him growing up but didn’t know this
VAMOS OSOS
Damn he went to cal? TIL
Also History 8B (modern Latin American history) which covers the revolutionary periods on! Awesome class."

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There’s a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don’t do that. While I’ve visited many times, I’ve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It’s mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we’ll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you’ll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it’s remarkable how many people I know who haven’t ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley’s best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won’t be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you’ll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don’t think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you’ve ever taken the 51B down University though, you’ll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I’ll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>• Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>• Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>• Visit the Little Farm (it’s a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>• Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris’ favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There’s also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you’re here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you’re there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven’t ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha’s hand. Don’t get cherimoya fruit though—I accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can’t even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it’s the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area’s fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don’t think their parties are exclusive? I’ve never asked. It’s a tradition though, and they’d probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn’t substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you’ll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there’s no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it’s a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn’t stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they’d let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn’t interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they’re much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it’s surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day’s moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you’re further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you’re trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn’t need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer’s markets** *You’ve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There’s a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine’s Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you’re looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley’s indie bookstores:*

>• Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>• Moe’s  *If you’re looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there’s also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>• Pegasus  
>  
>• Mrs. Dalloway’s  
>  
>• Half-Price Books  
>  
>• Eastwind Books

* **Stop into a store you’ve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they’ve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you’re closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I’m going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn’t a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the “Hell Summer” that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, “the poetry reading is out of control,” uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here’s*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I’d begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It’s hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it’s now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it’s good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There’s a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber’s Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he’s inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can’t walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I’m unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you’re looking for something wholesome, this Cal student’s** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it’s so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don’t exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he’s accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country’s history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it’s spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it’s haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don’t need to listen closely.*
* Oakland—Mountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some… mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it’s worth the trip. It’s a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can’t believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they’re filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It’s gothic, but it’s also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany—Albany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I’ve ever taken--I’ve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you’re willing to do a little bit of exploration. There’s a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It’s a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany—TEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland—Lake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There’s a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children’s Playland.*
* Oakland—[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I’m mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland—Jack London Square *I’d sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you’re into that. There’s also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London’s Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There’s also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don’t be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You’ll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill

* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you’re lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There’s a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren’t an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire’s before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it’s near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I’d call it romantic.)","I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:

Check out the archives and the Bancroft Library. There's a bunch of really cool old and rare books and a lot of Cal related historical documents. You can't check anything out of the building though, you can only look at it in the reading room.
To add onto the bit about fire trails:

This section in particular (starts from the stadium, goes up to Grizzly Peak) is my absolute favorite hike in the entire area. It's a pretty steep climb but if you're a good hiker or runner then it should be very doable. 6ish miles roundtrip. When you get up into the hills you can see a huge chunk of the East Bay and into SF - and then you realize how small Berkeley is compared to the rest of the world. It's also a great place to meditate.

Walking across the Golden Gate, and looking at Berkeley/Campanile tower is an amazing perspective! Then go up the tower, and look back at the Golden Gate.
1) stay up all night watching stars at Fire Trails contemplating just how big the universe is

2) storm the field after a Big Game victory


3) eat a Top Dog after a long day of classes. As you order, think about how you’re standing right where Steve Wozniak would have ordered his first Top Dog. Don’t think too long, or the cashier/chef might yell at you 

4) Build something cool. Even if it’s stupid and you’re the only one that will ever appreciate it. It’s worth it
The pier trespassing is dangerous... Could end up with someone dying. I don't recommend.
You know, I feel like I'd appreciate this a lot more if I wasn't stuck at home for my last semester :( 

great list, though, and maybe I'll just have to come back after I graduate...
Find someone who has a code to the Essex Baths.

See a concert at the redwood grove

Meditate at the Berkeley zen center (can combine with a trip to Berkeley bowl)

Attend the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary Easter celebration hosted by the Nuns of perpetual indulgence.

Find the concrete slide in the Castro. Take a walking tour while you're at it.

Swim at the hearst women's gym pool at least once - it's covered in marble and old statues, and has a great view of the campus.

Catch the art students' semesterly print sale days. Extremely cheap awesome art.

Speaking of art, you can check out a priceless piece from the University - and switch it out every once in a while for something new.

Not quite Berkeley specific, but gaze at the stars while taking a late-night cliffside swim at the Esalen center.

Go go Land's End. It's beautiful.

Take advantage of the SF museums. They're fantastic. They also do free days every so often, if you don't want to pay ridiculous admission fees. Just get there early.

Children's Fairyland is not creepy! It's cute, and it's over 70 years old, which is cool. Rumor has it that it inspired Walt Disney when he was planning Disneyland.
A must do for any EECS undergraduate

Spend an all nighter in the depths of Soda Hall working on cs project due the next day
Wow I grew up in Berkeley and gotta say you've hit practically every spot I can think of! I personally also enjoy Panoramic Way as a walk up to a nice view, and would add Point Isabel to the list of places to visit if you're into dogs.

Really enjoyed reading this and extra thanks for sharing the 1999 blog
It's a very minor point, but ""find a strange fruit"" might be better worded ""find rare fruit"" or ""find unusual fruit"".
this is very helpful for people who havent visited campus yet cuz of covid, thanks!
Watch a football game from T1GHTWAD HILL!
Thanks for these excellent suggestions! I just checked out *American Heiress* on your recommendation. As an undergrad, my friend John used to live in that apartment - I think he said they still had bullet holes in the wall.
Adding on:

\- Read a book in Morrison Library

\- Visit Cheeseboard Pizza at least once (but probably 100+ times).

\- Get sushi at Kirala

\- Take BART to SF on a free weekday and explore the city, visit the de Young or Legion of Honor, get lunch, go to Blue Bottle Coffee at the Mint

\- Visit the Old Rose Garden at the Botanical Garden in May -- all the roses are in bloom and it is stunning

\- Swim at Strawberry Canyon pool in spring/summer

\- Visit a coffee shop so many times that the staff know you

\- Take grad pictures around campus; cliche, but as an alum, I LOVE having these
As a 2020 transfer, this is very sad. Hopefully I can stay in the area after graduating and doing some of these next year.
22. Not get rejected

~ An applicant preemptively crying over my rejection this thursday
Should have included attend the Big Game!
Underground steam tunnels should be there too
Mostly food related—

Get some food from the Buddhist temple in South Berkeley, Vik’s Chaat, Ethiopian food (Addis; might be in Oakland).  

Tilden—play golf/whack a bucket of balls at the driving range.  It’s a pretty course and the three-tier driving range is pretty cool.

Bike the bike trail along 580 to Richmond and check out the Rosie the Riveter installation.  If you are lucky, a park ranger will be present to answer questions.

Ride your bike around town at night.  It’s fun!

Frolf.

Do the sake tour (if it’s open).

Berkeley Bowl—best grocery store EVER.  Get the Odoriko tomatoes if they have them.

Kirala—chawan mushi is like an ocean French kiss.
This is the coolest post ever, thank you

-freshman at berkeley
For now, I've got one that you probably know too well by now:

Your home. 


Stay home, please? 
We need this thing to go away.
Hey, I love you and this post
This is so beautiful. Tysm <3
god i miss trawling through urban ore on a sunny day 

the south berkeley farmer's market is also amazing too and if u have calfresh u can get $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce!!!
While you're at the Rose Garden, go through the tunnel by the tennis courts to Cordonices Park and ride down the concrete slide on a piece of cardboard. There are usually a few pieces lying at the bottom. (Do not attempt sans cardboard.)

You should add in some stuff in San Francisco since it's easily accessible to us. Great list for Berkeley though- both the campus and the wider city.
Have ramen at Marufuku in Japantown :D
this is late but what’s wrong with cherimoya?
This is one of the best posts I've seen on things to do, ever. Thank you stranger! Making me reminisce on so many positive memories of Berkeley + the Bay area. Truly unlimited things to do. I feel so thankful. If I do even teeny fraction of these things, I will be happy<3
Isn't Bancroft closed to people without special access? I tried going in during 2019 but they didn't let me :(

&#x200B;

Will add to check out all the Berkeley libraries, Doe itself has at least 4 smaller libraries within it.
I adore that trail, but good god that one slope midway though is terrifying
hope you'll be able to visit someday; most of these things will probably be here once you do (: and I hope your last semester goes as well as it can!
the heart women's gym/pool is a fascinating and beautiful old building!! i had no idea it existed until i took a final in there lol
the man's had a glorious career, there is no doubt! didn't know about his involvement in UC directly though (beyond the work in Claremont), most of my knowledge only goes as far back as John Galen Howard. very cool!
children's fairyland was my childhood. no disney could ever attempt the beauty of that place tbh.
not just a rumor, that's a fact! and I should have corrected that by now haha my Oakland neighbor who reads my newsletters said the same. unfortunately I can only speak from my experience walking around it when it's closed due to covid, and that's a bit eerie. always wanted to go inside, maybe someday /:
That place is terrifying and it made me scared as shit of puppets. So I have to disagree with you
Previously WEB. Previously 260 Evans.
I hate that I did this, but also glad I did for the experience lmao. CS projects and all-nighters mix well together
updated; is ""strange fruit"" used as a euphemism on the regular? I haven't ever heard it outside of the context of the song
Because of the association with the protest / anti-lynching song?
oh whoa that's wild!! cool that they preserved the history, but also kind of disturbing, but also I'd totally pay to set foot inside and see (': and I hope that you like American Heiress! Toobin is fairly well-respected, but it's clear that he's got a certain angle and sometimes the way that he editorialized to that was annoying.  Kind of reminded me of listening to Serial honestly--good storytelling and the character of the people really comes through, but you also have to wonder what they're leaving out. I'd love to read Patricia Hearst's memoir if I ever come across it!
I also recently learned that Morrison Library loans out original artworks to students! If I were a student again I would definitely take advantage of this.
Wait how do you find these?
many of these are fine to visit in a mask, I think we all agree that we need this to go away but depriving your life of all pleasure until then is not the way to go about it
it was $11 for one fruit lol
Haha yeah - I remember the first time I went there and tried to run up it. Even to this day I still remember how difficult that was!
It's a commonly understood phrase, yes. The song was capturing a phrase used at the time, and it is used sometimes now.
Because of its association with lynching, of which that song is part. The phrase exists beyond the song.

For anyone who has not heard this Billie Holiday classic.
I'll be relieved if Toobin doesn't hypnotize me into jerking off in public.

Look for the steam
oh lol I didn’t see the word “accidentally” until now
Indeed it does. Even beyond that historical meaning. The context OP provided rendered it harmless.
As an art historian I agree with your comment completely! Glad that you were not charged. Out of curiosity, what was the work?
I totally understand your position, I didn't think it was malicious by OP"
