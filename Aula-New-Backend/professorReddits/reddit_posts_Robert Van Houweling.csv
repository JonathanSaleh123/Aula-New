Law professor at a T10 school yet she hasn't practiced law a day in her life.
Umm, no... if you actually read her faculty profile then you would have seen that she has clerked for a district judge, held an administrative role in a nonprofit group, and has numerous publications. Not to mention she holds a degree from the 2nd best law school in the US. Her qualifications seem fine and I'm pretty sure she ""practiced law"" while clerking. 

Yeah a clerk position definitely means you practiced law. Plus it's not like she's clueless about law when she's written publications about the subject, had prestigious position as a clerk for a federal judge, and is a professor at one of the best law schools in the country. 
When I say ""practice law"" I mean representing clients in lawsuits.  I mean doing things that require malpractice insurance.  Nothing in her bio suggests she's ever done anything of the sort. 
I hear you, I'm just not sure that a clerkship constitutes the practice of law. In a clerkship she's assisting the judge by writing opinions and researching the cases before said Judge. You know the attorneys litigating in front of that Judge? they're practicing law. This professor wasn't.it just seems to me that this is akin to a medical school professor having never treated her own patients before"

I expected this to be some kind of situation that got him to have to live and work in a sorority for food in shelter. Instead this is just some BS about how he hears music and some other shit I don't care about.
That was a nice start; now I think he should do an AMA.
That read was not worth my time....

I thought this was a good piece of writing. Sure it's in a newspaper, but I thought it was a neat look into a small part of a student's life. It's genuine and honest. Why complain?
