How is Philosophy 132 with Geoffrey Lee?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l0djce/how_is_philosophy_132_with_geoffrey_lee/,2021-01-18 21:53:37,"I'm taking Philosophy 132 this semester and was wondering how difficult/organized the class is. I like the subject matter but am somewhat disenchanted with bad teachers/professors that obscure and over-complicate the subjects. Is it a good class to take, or should I just P/NP it?","I took his phil 100 lAst semester. Given it’s just three papers it shouldn’t be too bad
How were expectations for the class? It seems like there will be readings every class, is it absolutely necessary to do them? Other than essays, how will he assess understanding of the material?
I mean I’m doing the first reading now and I don’t see how you can understand the class without reading. Most the grades are based on the essay so you need to get the readings to write a good one."
philos 3 vs. cogsci 180,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u7g7jv/philos_3_vs_cogsci_180/,2022-04-19 14:37:24,"i'm trying to decide between philos 3 (the nature of mind) and cogsci 180 (mind, brain, identity) to fulfill the cogsci upper division philosophy requirement

philos 3 is with prof geoffrey lee and cogsci 180 is with prof davina chan

any advice?",
Art + lit breadth and philosophy + values breadth,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pxdyti/art_lit_breadth_and_philosophy_values_breadth/,2021-09-28 12:34:13,"Does anyone have any course recommendations to fulfill these breadths? I've been thinking about taking art 12: drawing foundations or art 8: intro to visual thinking and philos 132: philosophy of mind or pbhlth 101: a sustainable world - challenges and opportunities, any thoughts? Kenyatta Hinkle is teaching art 13, Anne Walsh for art 8, Marlon Maus for pbhlth 101, and Geoffrey Lee for philos 132.","I heard Music 26ac is really easy, but it's only offered in the Fall so if you need to get your arts + lit requirement by the end of spring then rip :/
im in histart 10 and love it! fulfills art&lit
What time is your registration? 

PbHlth 101 is chill
It's also offered over the summer if that's an option, was very very chill (did that myself)
9 am on the first day of phase 1
The 11th? 

You can definitely get into PbHlth 101 and art 8 or 12. Don’t know much about 12, but 8 is chill, high key boring, but chill
is pbhlth interesting and do you actually get to make any art in art 8? what’s the workload like in both?"
Anyone want to join a startup?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/x7obv/anyone_want_to_join_a_startup/,2012-07-26 14:45:22,"We're a student-run company building a website for people to find the perfect show in their area, discover talented new artists, and share their musical world with friends.

emailed you guys, this sounds awesome
not to be another debbie downer in this thread, but isn't this what http://www.songkick.com/ does, effectively?
Apply for Y Combinator! My boyfriend's start-up is in the current class and he says its been amazing for his company. :)

edit: they are a music start-up too :)
I'm interested in joining startups, but I want to further my education first. What kinds of things to know/degrees would be useful in yours?
The Bay Area already has The List for show locations. It's great.

Hi, I'm Grayson Chao. The important part of Tamber isn't just finding live shows - as Tamber evolves, we plan to make it a useful part of your live music experience. By that, I mean that you should be able to find a show, invite your friends, and buy tickets without ever leaving tambermusic.com. We're also exploring ideas in the mobile space like concert-companion tools that could provide you with a simple map of the venue, swag prices BEFORE you leave for the concert (because it sucks to find out you can't afford a shirt and a CD at the same show), etc.

But most importantly, we want Tamber to mean something to you, and that means extensive attention to local shows and venues. I find that music suggestion services often come off like a well-meaning stranger, giving me results that just aren't quite what I'm looking for, but are in the ballpark. We want to leverage our (and your!) passion to earn your trust in that area.

I'll be reading this thread for a while, but I do tech support 8-5 to pay my rent while we work on this thing, and I can't guarantee that I'll reply to everyone or see your post instantly.
Ask a valid question, get downvotes.

And the iPod did the same thing as every other mp3 player on the market when it came out. You don't have to be first, only have to be right.
We've actually looked at Songkick and we think their service is awesome. It doesn't exactly do what we want to do, though; our focus is on a robust suggestion engine and bands you don't know, whereas theirs seems to be more on comprehensive tracking and cataloguing of bands that you do know. Also, we don't just use last.fm for artist suggestions - we actually have an in-house suggestion algorithm in production right now, but it's ever-evolving as well.
Maybe further down the road. What's your boyfriend's startup called, if that information is currently public ;) ?
Hi SuperTurtle - the most useful degrees are probably Computer Science, Math, and Physics, though your technical skill set and ability to problem solve are what really count for us.

The languages we would recommend learning are html, css, javascript, and then a backend language like PHP, Python, or Ruby.

Hope that helps!
What do you like about it?

edit: Is their URL www.thelist.com? It's down for me.
Hey Atreyue, while we are still developing our beta, we're going to need to get the word out when it's ready. Email us and we'll talk some more :)
>and buy tickets

That is going to be tough to pull off with live nation, ticketmaster et all.
Which leaves you the parts that don't touch the money. Can you at least get referral fees?

Good luck! Every obstacle is just an object lesson in how to pivot and make things work. I would like to be automatically recommended shows- I listen to obscure bands and often hear about their (small) shows only days before, KALX concert calendar etc., and by then they are sold out.
Songkick and other ""apps"" will find you live shows for the artists you listen to on spotify.
they haven't announced they are in YC yet :P 


Awesome, thanks for the tips! I'm currently an Econ major pursuing a minor in CS (where I'd pick up a few languages). Is there a good demand for people like me in startups, maybe working a little more on guiding the business side? I'm still deciding, so be honest.

Also thanks for taking this time, I know you came looking for help and it doesn't directly benefit you, so I appreciate it!
Google foopee and the list will pop up. It has every show listed and the location and you can pick what weekend. It's incredibly simple and good for people just looking for straight info. I have never wanted it to be anything else.
Sounds like you're exactly the kind of person we're looking to benefit, then. As for the ticket fees, we are in talks with ticket vendors to get you a set of tickets without selling your firstborn to pay Ticketmaster's fee.
No problem, happy to help. In terms of demand, I can only speak for us - but we're mostly interested in getting business input from people who have experience and a strong record of success, which we've been fortunate enough to receive. 

However, one of the great things about being involved in a small company that's just getting started is you can be involved with every element of the project.
Found it. This is really cool, I'll probably use it myself this summer!
Yeah that makes sense. Sounds like technical skills are the most useful coming out of college, and business experience comes in later.
Generally speaking, yeah. I would add that solid CS fundamentals are key to being versatile as a developer, if that's what you're aiming to be - at least try to learn languages that are as different as possible instead of very similar (i.e. C++, Python and Haskell, not Ruby, Python and JS)
That's a good thing to consider, you want to be broad"
