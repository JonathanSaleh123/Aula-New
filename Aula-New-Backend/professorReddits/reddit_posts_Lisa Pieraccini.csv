HISTART 10 with Lisa Pieraccini,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nxm18p/histart_10_with_lisa_pieraccini/,2021-06-11 10:54:18,"Has anyone taken history of art 10 with Lisa Pieraccini? What was the workload/assignments like? Were there a lot of readings or writings? I am trying to plan out my Fall schedule, but not sure if I could do it because many of my others classes are potentially reading heavy… any insights would be helpful! Thanks!

Edit: the course name is intro to western art: ancient to medieval","From what I remember from taking the class, there were two main writing assignments and one midterm and a final. There was technically assigned reading every class but I didn’t do that and it was fine even though it probably helps. The exams were heavily memorization based but there were essay portions too that depend on what you memorized+how clear your writing is. It would be slow some days but is an interesting class if you’re curious about art history and the professor was great.
Thank you for the information! Would you mind sharing how long the writing assignments and exams were? Like in pages and questions. Also, do you remember if there were discussion posts or stuff like that?
One assignment was 4-5 pages and the other only a page. I think exams had a couple half page short answer questions and then one or two questions that were multiple pages but basically as long as you wanted them to be/get all of your information in. Discussion was the most boring part imo because we didn’t do anything super interesting and from what I remember, any assignment related to discussion was completed in class and was very straightforward.
Thanks so much! This is very helpful ❗️"
HistArt 10 with Lisa Pieraccini or ESPM50AC or Music 26AC or Anthro2AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ny637c/histart_10_with_lisa_pieraccini_or_espm50ac_or/,2021-06-12 05:53:31,"I'm looking for an easy (hopefully interesting) easy A breadth class for the fall to take with CS61A and Math 1B.

Has anyone taken these classes? What was the workload/exam like? Was there a lot of writing?

Preferably something with less essays. 

If you have any other suggestions for easy A breadth classes this fall that would be nice :) 

Thank u!","espm50ac was one of the most easiest A as of my Berkeley career rn even tho a lot of writing. They grade really generously.
took 50ac this spring with kurt spreyer, i didn’t watch any lectures or do any readings. just went to discussion and still somehow came out with an a. was kinda stressful tho cuz i felt like i knew nothing ever. but should be pretty easy grade if you at least go to lecture. and i’m taking histart10 in the fall!
Anthro 2ac, if lowman is teaching, has no essays, just a final project. I recommend it because essays make me cry and I was relieved not to have to write one
i think i’ll stick to histart10 for now idk. it’s definitely the most interesting out of the four and if it gets hard i can p/np it right?
thank u so much i hate essays as well
You guys only did one final project? No midterms or finals??
yea if you’re just taking it for a breadth your can!! planning to do the same haha
wait sorry if it's a dumb question but if I P/NP it won't affect my GPA right? and when do I have to decide if I'm P/NP-ing the course ?
not a dumb q at all! and nope, there’s no effect it just comes up on ur transcript as a pass or no pass. i’m not sure when the deadline to switch grading options is for this fall, but that info is def easy to find and will definitely be shown on calcentral when the fall semester starts/approaches"
