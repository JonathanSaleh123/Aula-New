PSYCH C120,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17albjg/psych_c120/,2023-10-18 01:01:02,Hi Everyone! I'm planning to enroll in PSYCH C120 w/ Professor William Thompson for the upcoming spring semester and I'm wondering if anyone has insight about the course or professor himself since there's no Rate My Professor reviews at the moment. I also wanted to know if he records lectures because I may have a course conflict w/ my field study course for one of the days & wanted to watch them on my own time if possible instead of arranging around the conflict. Thanks in advance!,Idk
