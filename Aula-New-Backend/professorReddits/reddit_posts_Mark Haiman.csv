Math 1a: professor Mark Haiman or Francis Christ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nonxju/math_1a_professor_mark_haiman_or_francis_christ/,2021-05-30 17:03:18,"In terms of lectures, difficulty, etc etc","I had Haiman for Math 55 and his exams were insanely easy. Grading is generous. Also heâ€™s a good lecturer. I understood the material without having to look at the textbook.
Can't say anything about Haiman but Christ was solid.  Exams were fair, lectures were standard.  Nothing to complain about.
Had Haiman for math 55 as well, and he's great. Really good lectures + very considerate class policies
I had Haiman for 1b, his lectures were clear and engaging with lots of examples, and his tests were very fair.  I'd recommend him but idk anything about Christ
I had Haiman for Math 1b and found his lectures to be pretty engaging (for a calc 2 lecture) and extremely clear. His exams were exactly like the practice exams and in-class material (no curveballs) and he had a really generous clobber policy which saved my ass lol
Hi! What would you say the average grade was for his Math 1A class?"
Which professor is the better for MATH 1A: Mark Haiman or Francis Christ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nwlf5r/which_professor_is_the_better_for_math_1a_mark/,2021-06-10 04:37:41,I'm an incoming freshman so any advice related to classes would be appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nonxju/math_1a_professor_mark_haiman_or_francis_christ/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Zvezdaâ€™s Rate my professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13dgs2y/zvezdas_rate_my_professor/,2023-05-09 22:01:04,"When I signed up for this class. She was at like a 2.8-3.2. She is now at a 4/5. Her performance this math 1B semester was a tragic show and I do not think I am in the minority for having this opinion. RMP Rigged? 

Also like I see that mark haiman has a 5.23 out of 5. How are these scores inflating like this?","She is very strict but having taken 53 with her, I can say she teaches exceptionally well. Her lecture notes are the best notes Iâ€™ve had from any class in my 4 years here - I ended up saving all of her notes just to have because they were that good

I liked that the homework was only 5% of your grade, making it basically optional. It gave the freedom to choose what problems to do and skip over problems that I already felt confident about and didnâ€™t want to waste time doing
I think she teaches very well, but is strict and sometimes unforgiving
yeah every single written review is horrible, idk how the numbers are so inflated for her; both 1A and 1B were ass but her teaching of 1B was a  traumatic experience
Didnâ€™t take 1b with her, but I just took a look at RMP and nearly 100% of her math 1B reviews are 1/5, maybe she just had great reviews from other classes that raised the overall to 4?
Zvezda is a great lecturer/teacher hands down. The best one i had during four years of math major here. I took math 74 and 110 with her and while she IS unforgiving as fuck, her teachings stuck with me til the end and as someone who forgets the entire semester's material once walking out of the final, i think she did a pretty damn good job teaching
Donâ€™t trust RMP for math classes. Zvezda is an amazing teacher.
I had her for 10B. She's a passionate and nice teacher, but I felt at times she had a hard time explaining things in layman's terms. But this is often an issue for many of the professors at Cal who are renowned experts in their field. Also, the 10 series curriculum is just poorly put together overall.
She doesnâ€™t even allow us to save her notes ðŸ’€ literally gatekeeps materials because she says itâ€™s a privilege to even get to see previous final exams, notes, worksheets, and just any other form of resource from her"
Math 1B with Sheu or Haiman ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1302jy8/math_1b_with_sheu_or_haiman/,2023-04-26 16:00:47,"Hi guys, Iâ€™m planning to take 1B next semester and Iâ€™m trying to decide between the class taught by Norman Sheu or Mark Haiman. 
Both classes work with my schedule - which class would be better professor-wise?","I stopped going to my lectures with Sheu after 3-4 weeks. He is not bad, but it honestly felt like he was just speed running the textbook instead of explaining. Maybe he got better the later weeks Idk. Also the guy doesn't bother to properly format the notes he uploads in bcourses. He just straight up takes pictures of his notes with his phone in landscape mode lol making them a headache to read.
Haiman
Preferably Haiman since it works with your schedule. Iâ€™m taking 54 with Sheu and heâ€™s just not that good to understand the content so better not to take that option
Uh, there are formatted and typed notes for Sheuâ€™s 54 on bcourses. The pictures that he uploads are just what he does in class since people voted for the handwritten notes over chalkboard
Why? Is he a better professor?
Oh I know, but I just find his handwritten notes annoying whenever I checked them. Not much of a problem since there are the  typed general notes as you said, but if  he is going to upload handwritten notes from class, he could at least download a scanner app at least.
No, because Sheu is the worst.
He doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™s doing + he teaches like he doesnâ€™t even want to be here."
Who can I email or talk to to get out of Paul Vojta's Math 1A class? =,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wgkswl/who_can_i_email_or_talk_to_to_get_out_of_paul/,2022-08-04 20:34:28,"I'm desperate plz help. I'm on the waitlist for Mark Haiman's lecture and discussion, but I'm scared I will get stuck with the Vojtanator.","take it a  \~different semester\~ or at cc
Did you get in already? There's 20+ spots opened up for T TH 12:30-2:00 and 5:00-6:30 for Haiman
RIP....Vojta isnt THAT bad (if you like teaching yourself). Idk I mean just drop it if you dont want to take it?"
Math Help please!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ojsxf9/math_help_please/,2021-07-13 17:35:32,"I am planning to either do cs, ds, or business. I want to take Math 1A but I am scared I won't be able to keep up. I took IB Math during my senior year of high school which is basically pre-calc. I saw the diagnostic test available on the Math department website and honestly, I was pretty lost. However, I feel like with a little review I might be fine. Also, do the professors for Math 1A have a review unit to ease students back into things? If not then I can always do Math 32 but I will be behind prerequisites. Also, how is Math 1A with Mark Haiman?","Math 1A is a big class, so there is a ton of support for students taking it. There are various mentors, tons of discussions, and a lot of student resources from SLC that can help you!
I would do 32 so you can come in with some familiarity. Most 1A students have seen some form of calc before and with it being your first math class at cal it can be overwhelming. You may technically be behind but thats worlds better than floundering through a class if you do not have solid prerequisite skills. You can always take 1B over the summer to ""catch up"".

1A does have tons of resources though so you can prep now over the summer and always drop if its too much. Since you aren't really sure about what you want to do taking an easier math class may give you time to focus on other classes to find out what direction you want to move in
Can I take Math 1b over the summer in community college?
That is probably dependent on your major. Idk if Haas allows it"
Would love to get some thoughts on my schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14wbma0/would_love_to_get_some_thoughts_on_my_schedule/,2023-07-10 17:33:56,"I'm an incoming freshman doing data science if you guys could give me your input it would be greatly appreciated! Go bears!

you have a major course, your math course, and english. i'm assuming ugba 88 is there as part of interest in haas? that's cool too. your schedule totals to 14 units which is good to get comfortable for your first semester
Hopefully your dorm is close by and not in CK, and hopefully your 8am class is not far from your dorm. Your Tuesday is going to suck if your dorm is far away, as youâ€™d have to either go back to your dorm for 9 hours, or figure out how to kill 9 hours.
Thank you my eng course on science fiction was the only one available and it seemed cool compared to the regular R1B like significantly better so I thought it doesn't matter the time rather my enjoyment although I may come to regret it yk
im in unit 3 is that close by?
Thatâ€™s not too far, so youâ€™re ok there.
Got it is it bad that i do UGBA over maybe some breadth course for L&S?
Your sched looks fine to me.  Your Calc and Data 8 lecturers are certainly top-notched."
where the heck is the RSF feildhouse?? and can people actually take a final in there?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zabgb1/where_the_heck_is_the_rsf_feildhouse_and_can/,2022-12-01 20:32:40,"&#x200B;

Thatâ€™s where the COVID testing used to be, next to RSF.
so its just like a room with tables and chairs? not like wheeler?
So for the exam, do you go in through the rsf entrance? or is there another way to get into the fieldhouse?
Yes?! Itâ€™s not an auditorium if thatâ€™s what you mean
Yes there is a different entrance. There are many people around usually so youâ€™ll see it. Letâ€™s say your looking at the rsf entrance, to find the field house entrance youâ€™ll have to walk on your left until you see big doors. These are the doors youâ€™re looking for lol
thanks!!!"
