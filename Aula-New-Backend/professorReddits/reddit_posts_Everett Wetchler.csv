Psych 2 prof,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15t93ut/psych_2_prof/,2023-08-16 18:45:06,Has anyone ever taken Psych 2 w Everett Wetchler?,"I thought it was gonna be an easy breadth but man made the quizzes and tests harder than they needed to be üò≠
Had him SP23 - got an A without too much of a struggle (compared to my other classes oof), but his exams were typically purely memorization based (ouch). Quizzes were open note and resource.  

Didn‚Äôt record classes and didn‚Äôt write notes on his slides, so if you missed class it would kinda suck lol. Wasn‚Äôt a walk in the park but if you put in decent effort, should go well üèÑüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

He was a super chill and funny professor though - really recommend him on a purely personal basis. He was always super engaged and offered to help us out whenever
Can you share the syllabus?
For this prof?
Oh got it how did the rest of the class feel abt his teachings
Yup. But I think spring 23 was his first time teaching it. Maybe he‚Äôll go a bit easier this time
He has no stats in berk time for some reason
Can you share syllabus? The class was full but now widely open"
Instructor Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10ak53y/instructor_question/,2023-01-12 19:41:07,Wondering if anyone took a Psychology class with  [Everett Wetchler](https://www.berkeley.edu/directory/results?search-term=Everett%20Wetchler). He will be teaching Psych 2 so wanted to know if anyone knows about him? Thanks in advance,"Nobody cares loser
Hey! I taught in class about how and why people can be brutal behind a veil of anonymity. Here's a video and comic from lecture that convey the point:

"Course Review (F23): Public Health 142, MCB 104, Psych 2, MCB c144/IB 160",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18pez39/course_review_f23_public_health_142_mcb_104_psych/,2023-12-23 13:02:04,"The tradition of course reviews continues! Fifth semester, I feel.. old(er). If you have any questions feel free to pm. These are just my opinions and experiences, I am only one person and there are lots of other people with other experiences! Background on me: pre-med, declared MCB.

Public Health 142 - Biostats using R (Hubbard): 7/10

* From the perspective of someone who has never coded a day in my life, this was a tough class but I think a fair one if you show up and put in effort. 
* Prof Hubbard is kind, but lectures can feel a little drowsy sometimes. 8 AM lectures MWF, but on Zoom and recorded. Stay on top of them! It's so, so, so easy to get behind. 
* This course is all about putting in what you want, so please go in person, ask questions, engage. She was very transparent with us about grades the entire time and updated us often.
* Workload is on the higher end. Weekly labs (try to do them in section with the GSI) based on lecture material, weekly gradescope quizzes (open notes but still tough), a three part data project (done in teams). 
* The course website is well made. Lots of practice exams provided! Do them all! Also, there are weekly homework problem sets provided, which are helpful and worth doing (although not graded). 
* Discussion sections were helpful. You review lecture content and go through the labs. Shout out to Sylvia Song, she's a very kind and helpful GSI. 
* Course isn't really curved - I believe 89% for an A-, 94% for an A. This seems tough, but it is very possible to do well. You have to put in effort, but can do well!! 
* There are 2 midterms and a final. All exams are multiple-part, word problems with free response. You get to bring a one page cheat sheet (front and back) for the midterms and two pages for the final. This saved my ass and helped me prepare. 
* Multiple extra credit opportunities (an assignment, course evals, on the midterms and final). You will be fine. Just stay on top of lecture. At one point, I was behind on 15 lectures for this class. Not a fun time during dead week, and probably screwed me over for the next class I'll talk about, which is:

MCB 104 - Genetics, Genomics, and Cell Biology (Eisen, Martik, Dernburg) - 6/10

* I thought MCB 102 humbled me.. but 104 has outdone itself. 
* Light workload - homework assignments for each section differ based on the professor, but are all practice problems either done for completion or not graded at all. 
* 2 midterms (100 pts each) and cumulative final (150 points, 17 points each from the first two sections with remaining \~120 points from section 3, so heavily skewed towards the third section)! Discussion attendance and homework (graded for completion) are 100 points, for a total of 450 points in the class. 
* For section 1 (Genetics with Eisen), he gave practice exams that were so similar to the real thing. Do them all. This isn't your AP bio genetics! You'll learn a lot more than just punnett squares - it can get confusing, so it's important to pay attention. Eisen's great. Show up to lecture. Do the practice problems, and you'll be just fine. 
* For section 2 (Genomics with Martik), it's a little less practice problem based and heavier on the content. This was Dr. Martik's first time teaching, and I have to say that she did a phenomenal job. The lecture slides were organized so well, the topics were clear, she was really open to questions during office hours. Also, you get to learn some cool genomics techniques which is awesome. Come to lecture! Despite it being her first time teaching, she gave a practice exam that emulated (pretty accurately) what the midterm would look like. Also, problem sets were similar to the exam. Do it all and ask questions about it early on!
* Ah, section 3. Cell biology with Dernburg. First and foremost, I have to say that Prof. Dernburg is brilliant. She knows her stuff. She also made an effort to learn students' names, which is something very few professors at Cal have done. Unlike the first two sections, I will say that cell bio is a lot tougher because it's such a huge amount of details at once. Start prepping early, this is the section for which making flashcards and drawings will be helpful. It felt very similar to MCB 102 in that sense. This is not the one you want to be burnt out on. While I love Prof Dernburg, she elected against providing lecture recordings unless you emailed her or did the iClicker (which was a hit or miss even if you tried to do it). Lecture slides were a bit disorganized and there were a lot of confusing details about each lecture that made it hard to retain. Practice problems were optional (unlike the other sections), but I think a part of why I performed badly here was because I didn't start them as early as I should've. Ask questions, make flashcards, memorize, memorize, memorize. 
* I took notes directly on the lecture slides (which I downloaded to my iPad).
* Go to discussions and do the work. Shout out to Christy, she was the sweetest GSI ever and helped with my understanding significantly. 
* Here is where shit really hit the fan. Midterm 1 and 2 averages were 75 and 77 percent, respectively. The final average was a 60 percent. I got a 90 and 97 on the midterms, and a 66 on the final. On average, this made my grade about 0.7 standard deviations above the mean when taking into account varying weight of midterms and finals, assignment grade, etc. Guess what 0.7 SD above the mean corresponded with as a letter grade? It was a B. The class was curved to a C+ mean. This is worse than MCB 102, and I didn't at all see this coming (I was doing well and majorly screwed up on the final). Regardless of the grade, I was disappointed in myself because I actually enjoyed the material in this class a lot more than MCB 102. 

Psych 2 - Intro to Psych for nonmajors (Everett Wetchler) - 8/10

* Wonderful class and incredible instructor. Come to lecture. Please. Everett is so clearly passionate about what he teaches, I wasn't a fan of psych until his class and I can genuinely say I learned shit in this class. Like I'm being so real rn, it taught me about life and stuff outside my little premed bubble. It's a pretty profound class IMO. 
* There aren't discussion sections (not really necessary tbh), but Everett has office hours and is cool. 
* All that being said, workload is moderate to high. There are weekly surveys and quizzes - open notes, but still quite tough. There is a research assignment. 
* 1 midterm and a final. Both are pretty tough. Practice exams are not provided. However, the great thing is if you show up to lecture and participate, it's hard not to understand the material. I barely scraped an A (93%), but that's because I stopped showing up to lecture and then crammed 8 lectures worth of material in dead week. That's on me. It is a lot of work, but manageable and enjoyable to learn.

MCB c144 or IB 160 - Evolution (Whiteman) - 10/10

* Very chill, reasonable class. Some topics are genuinely so hard to understand and dense, don't get me wrong - but the extent of which this is tested is not so bad.
* Lectures aren't recorded - show up and learn the material then and there. They are interesting. Evolution is not my favorite topic in the sciences, but it was a chill elective so why not. 
* Workload is moderate to high. Weekly article annotations/questions for discussions, a paper presentation, a short 3 page writing assignment. The discussion section runs like a separate class because we don't really talk about the same stuff as lecture, so it felt a little unnecessary at times but still a nice experience. Katie was a very kind and helpful GSI. 
* 2 midterms and a final, include 10-20 MCQ and a few short answer questions (1-2). Before each exam, the professor gives a review sheet which literally includes all the questions on the exam. You just need to do this, memorize the answers, and then replicate. This is tedious, but so doable. 
* Like psych 2, this course had traditional grade bins (93% for an A). 

Hope this was helpful.","Thanks for doing these!! I‚Äôve been following these for a while now, since my schedules trail yours by a couple semesters but are very similar. One thing I noticed, though- mcb 104 has a B average on berkeley time. Why was the curve so bad this semester?
Thank you for writing this! I was also in MCB 104 this semester and had a similar SD for the class. It was hard to see the B hit calcentral this week. I had no clue they curved it so little though ü•≤ This post made me feel like I‚Äôm not alone in it ü´∂ 
Thank you!
I highly DON'T recommend taking MCB 104 and any other difficult classes.
Ofc. So yeah, that was the crazy surprise. Apparently the profs said that they were accomodating for covid for a while, and now they are trying to return to the normal engagement by being a little stricter. However, this is kind of bs because even in the years before covid, the distribution isnt that bad
Ofc! ‚ù§Ô∏è I definitely cried about it for a hot second, but you know what: we persevere! We got this. :3
Lol mood dude"
