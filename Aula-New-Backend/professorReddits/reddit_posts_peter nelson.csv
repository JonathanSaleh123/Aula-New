What are some classes that changed your perspective/life and why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17lh9cj/what_are_some_classes_that_changed_your/,2023-11-01 10:22:22,"Title. Have you taken any classes that were life-changing or changed your perspectives about something completely?

(Not looking for easy A classes)","Philosophy 12A, intro to logic.  I took this in Spring 2003, and for the last two decades its lessons have been the foundation any time, in any area, I've needed to engage in careful, rigorous thought.
people are gonna hate on me for this one but I would not be the same guy without linear algebra
Join BicyCal Decal last year. Now I have a new hobby, new friend/bike group, became happier and healthier!
ASTRO-10 with Professor Filippenko. It was awesome and gave great perspective on just how big the universe is, what we know about it, and how we know it.  

Ever since then I‚Äôve appreciated that ‚Äúbigness‚Äù of it all more.  Honestly a life changing class for me.
native american studies 20a- take if you want to learn the history left out of school textbooks
Honestly any non american and non european history classes. Regions like south east asia are historically looked over in highschool history classes so if you wanna learn some new stuff i'd defo take some history classes
agrs r44, learned so much about the past which we seem to have collectively forgotten
12a is a very difficult class. Philosophy Major here -- I would say Philosophy of Mind is really interesting in the age of AI. Philosophy of Religion is really interesting too. Crockett is a great prof.Aristotle can be a bit dry, but he is really applicable to modern life. It's surreal how his words resonate thousands of years later.
The Simpsons and Philosophy deCal.
Classes I never showed up for! effected my grades to a great extent! Perspective about life changed automatically, 
On a serious note, Dylan Riley at anthropology is pretty good if you interested in history and anthropology

Every CS class has made me rethink my life choices
sociology of policing -- laleh behbehanian
LS C30T: Drugs and the Brain. really cool class about all different kinds of substances, how they effect you, how they are made/grown/found. lots of cool info that I find myself referring to years later (took it in Fall 2020). The professor, David Presti, is also a stand up guy and creates a syllabus with a manageable course loadü§ùüèª
Astro C10. Really makes you feel small in the universe. Changed my perspective on life, and the world in general.

Honestly CS70 ironically also had a profound effect on the trajectory of my life and my worldview. I struggled in that class, and it taught me the value of embracing learning for the sake of learning. Also the content is kinda the foundation of a lot of the logic that makes the modern world run, so that aspect is pretty perspective-altering. 

PSYCH C126 is a really great class as well, and definitely altered my perception (pun intended) of how the human brain works, even if just from a mechanical standpoint. I think it‚Äôs one thing to acknowledge how our psychological experience may differ from reality, but that class made that distinction feel much more tangible.
UGBA 152 - Negotiations. 

Take it with Professor Schroth specifically. It is an amazing class that will teach you about social psychology, how to build trust and your reputation, and reach negotiation deals that both parties benefit from. 

The classes material can be applied to business AND personal relationships. Out of all the Haas classes I‚Äôve taken so far, it‚Äôs been the most useful and applicable for all areas of my life. It‚Äôs so fucking amazing
Sociology 3AC with prof James Baggett. Honestly one of the best professors I‚Äôve ever had and the content‚Äôs so interesting. It made me rethink how I navigate society and how its been formed‚Äîwhat we take for granted now was also actually something that used to be radical to a certain group of people, etc.

I only took this course over the summer though, but maybe a full semester would go way more in depth and dissect all the interesting pieces
Latinx Philosophy and Religion- in one unit we talked about the ways queer/non-binary/trans people have existed in indigenous cosmology all over the world and it really changed me!
the Marx, Nietzsche and Freud class, as well as the course on german propaganda during the third reich. Took them both in the same semester and it was my best experience at berkeley (cs major)
You could just hang out at the MacArthur BART as they provide a world class experience
Rhetoric 1B changed the way I write and think about writing forever. It was excellent and so valuable.
EECS126: changed the way I thought about randomness in the world
Islamophobia and Constructing Otherness with Hatem Bazian.

I only took it because my friends were taking it, but was very pleasantly surprised and learned a lot. Hatem Bazian is also the best professor at Berkeley.
UGBA 190T Design Your Life
https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/F21-UGBA190T.1-and-UGBA-190T.2-Design-Your-Life-Flyer.Kovats.pdf
Back in the mid 90s I took Slavic 134C. It is a survey class on the life and works of Dostoevsky. Great class; one of the best I took at Berkeley. Great literature, great discussions.  Conducted in English, although you are encouraged to read the works in Russian if you‚Äôre able to. Not an easy class, but definitely a rewarding one.
Black Intellectual Thought. It‚Äôs so fucking good.
Cs61b (i wanna kms)

Legal Std39D w/ Alan Pomerantz
German 256; COMLIT c221; Math 215a; Math 206; physics 105; eecs126;
CWR4B with Dr.Caroline Cole. If you think you are good at writing, you will be humbled real quickly. Also, is a great class for teaching you how to reach research papers in fields you are unfamiliar with. Not an easy A class
**Philos 11 - Philosophy of Religion**

I grew up Christian, but became a skeptic and dismissed religion as unscientific fables. But taking this course with Prof. Crockett helped me appreciate my faith as having serious intellectual weight. We read the works of Catholic philosophers like Anselm of Canterbury and St. Thomas Aquinas who gave rational warrants for faith that I had never considered before; we also looked at counter-arguments from the atheist side. Professor Crockett is a solid professor who does a good job of being unbiased and respectful of Christian beliefs (although I can't say the same for all the GSIs). This class also taught me how to form logical arguments and syllogisms.

Just one thing: be prepared to read some dense texts.
psych 161 w dacher keltner. Psychology of human happiness. As a stem major this class was a phenomal change of pace (and relatively low commitment) compared to the rest of my course load. introduced me to meditation and how to take care of my mental well being. really really enjoyed it.
CS 189 or CS 182. The knowledge you gain from those classes are crucial if you want to live in the 21st century. I can totally understand why people think they are hard classes, but if you actually try to learn the course material, it‚Äôs not that hard.
Physics and Music
Sense, Sensibility and Science
Michael Pollen's class on food that happened the year his book was given to new admits
Philosophy 2 with Prof Richie Kim
This really depends on your instructors but my R1B made me permanently insufferable.
US Housing and Urban Planning Policy, taught by 2 wonderful PhD students over the summer. It was so real and taught from a different perspective. I enjoyed it.
We had a Tupac decal class that was üî•Also took some great electives like Buddhist Psychology‚Ä¶ sociology of family, and Spanish American history
Interpersonal Communications
GPP 115 - global poverty - changed my life completely
CS 61B - changed my life. I didn‚Äôt realise the beauty in building something on your own until I took this class. It made me feel so much more capable. Definitely built my resilience too with all the projects!
EDSTEM 82 but this course has field work where you work in a classroom once a week. Absolutely incredible class if you want to be an educator or work with kids.
I was born in 2003, this makes me feel like a little kid haha
That‚Äôs great, I‚Äôm sure it helped a lot of people get a job
Why is this? Did you find that there were skills that could be translated into life?
I agree
lol what
Picked up cycling during Covid and it changed my life for the better, I bike up grizzly 2-3 times a week now
how do i join? i‚Äôm unfit as hell but been wanting to learn how to fix up a bike + plus meet new people/make new friends
Is it offered in the spring?
This 100%. I‚Äôve never felt smaller or more insignificant than after I took that class. Not just in comparison to the scale of the universe, but also in my understanding (or even the collective human understanding) of how everything works. 

It‚Äôs kinda exhilarating learning so much about something so ultimately incomprehensible.
I wanted to save this for my last semester at Cal and I found out during enrollment that it's not even offered during Spring :') will always be a regret of mine that I didn't take it sooner during college
interested! Been reading Takaki textbook on my own. any recommended professors?
[removed]
Philisophy 136 - philosophy of perception (i believe) was also quite interesting and relevant to ai, particularly the areas of computer vision, ML, and NLP. highly recommend under Alva No√´!
Our year, we got Gavin Newsome before he became governor, got to meet him face to face.
like your career?
second that! laleh‚Äôs classes are life changing, very passionate and intelligent professor
Aka manipulation?
fascinating! were the spiritual origins covered in pre Spanish studies?
I'm 98/100 on the waitlist right now :(
how
Just don‚Äôt take 182 with Sahai
i loved richie! came out of that class thinking different about myself and the world in general for sure
>Philosophy 2

Taking this right now with Olivia Bailey, great class and has me thinking
Get off my glade
No, it's called a transform
There is something super pretty about it, and once you learn it it's one of those things that you just start fitting into everything, and it pays off -- for example, you could have a procedure in which you do something. But if you express it as a series of transformations on elements of a space, you naturally start asking other questions about the properties of those transformations, which sometimes leads you to surprising realizations. This is what (abstract) algebra is about, but for many (including myself), linear algebra is the first touch of this ""structural feeling.""

In general, I would say it's a very ""suggestive"" framework of thought (kind of like when you have a set of instructions and you know exactly what to do), but an extremely abstract one at the same time (with little effort, you have a feeling of what to do/where to look for meaning in a lot of situations/problems). Not many things are like that (very effective, and very general).
most important math class
just show up to shop hours! super open club, super friendly, i <3 bicycal
Probably
unfortunately I graduated two decades ago, so I think most of my professors are retired now
Peter Nelson
yes lots of pre spanish studies mostly! its super cool there's a book we talked about a lot in class called Queer Myth Symbol and Spirit, it's an encyclopedia with everything!
a lot of people drop. It‚Äôs a hard class.
Changes the way u think
Nah 182 with Sahai in particular is the most enlightening course in the field taught to undergrads
I was born in 2007
Not really, most of the stuff is pretty easy to self learn. I'd say the most important math class would be one where you experienced the greatest learning curve, Calculus or Discrete Math for most people. Allows for a new way of thinking, Math 54 and matrices is just following instructions, doesn't involve as much critical thinking as a lot of other math classes here.
What is the probability I get hit by a car tho
Wow! Thanks for sharing!
ehh
Who asked?
[deleted]
you aren't taking into account that people think differently bro
Shockingly, people can have different opinions
I don't go to Berkeley. I live in the area
And this is my opinion lol, your point?"
