Should I take polecon 101 in the summer instead of the fall?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uckas1/should_i_take_polecon_101_in_the_summer_instead/,2022-04-26 12:15:09,"Taking 101 in the summer will lessen the work load on me for the fall, but the fall will have professor khalid kadir and ive heard great things about him. Is khalid worth it or should i just take it in the summer with richard ashcroft? Any experience with polecon 101 or either of these professors would be helpful.","I've never taken a class with Ashcroft, but I took PE 101 with Kadir and that was one of my best experiences ever at Berkeley. I would 100% take another class with Kadir, and many of my classmates there would say the same thing.
Took 100 in the summer with Ashcroft and 101 in the fall with Kadir. Ashcroft is pretty good, but Kadir is great. Imo the bigger reason to take it in the fall is 6 weeks isn't enough. The workload is pretty intense during the summer because it's condensed but also the class just covers a ton of content and 6 weeks isn't enough to fully explore and understand the ideas. Probably my favorite class I've taken in my 4 years so I'd definitely recommend taking it in the fall if you can."
