Kameshwar Poolla or George Anwar?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/108y83b/kameshwar_poolla_or_george_anwar/,2023-01-10 22:56:04,"hey has anyone taken any of their classes? I plan to take ME 100, any advice is appreciated!","Had a lot of fun with Anwar but his teaching method isn't as effective from what I've heard. But he definitely makes the class easy and enjoyable and it's super simple to get a good grade. Jokes around and is always approachable and accessible even outside office hours. You even get extra credit for writing jokes on midterm exams.
Took the class with Anwar, really cool guy and ME100 is easy with him. However, as other said he assumes you have prior knowledge about the subject so I had to go to discussions for extra help. Overall, 8/10
ANWAR, take home midterm, no final.
Take Poolla, not Anwar
I've had experience with both in different classes. The comments seem to be in line with my experience too, although overall I would put both of them above average. 

I may add Anwar might have a more generous grade distribution, but this is purely speculative and every semester is different.
thanks man, is there a big red flag in anwar lol?
