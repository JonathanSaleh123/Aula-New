How manageable is this freshman BioE schedule?,https://i.redd.it/52r7ciwgvhkb1.jpg,2023-08-26 11:04:23,"17 units, but 2 classes are both 1 unit seminar classes, so 15 units","seminars are always chill, and 15 units is fairly manageable. that being said i‚Äôm not in stem so idk how well my advice transfers here lol. good luck!
Pretty good and balanced üëç!"
Should I drop 61c?,https://i.redd.it/qjyskkz9upbc1.jpeg,2024-01-10 17:43:34,"For reference, I got an B+ in 61a and A in 61b. Is it worth finishing the 61 series now, or delaying 61c for a semester?","That 11am -2pm break

Cs70 + 61c was high workload imo.  Idk ur exact situation but if ur trying to declare cs I‚Äôd drop it since u alr have 20 units.  Otherwise it‚Äôs best to get it over with
It depends on your situation, what your major in, what class are you, and what you are shooting for for a grade. In general, when these types of posts are done, you have to give full disclosure.
20 units is a lot but besides that u should be good. Just stay on top of the course work.
(lol i would personally drop physics cuz Ronnie sucks ass and the course staff is wack too) 

Lisa Yan is the best professor i have ever had so it might be worth it to take 61c just for that (imo better than Dan). and if you don‚Äôt need to declare then i would drop 70 (cuz of workload) and/or do what i first said (cuz of personal opinions lol)

Data Science Upper Divisions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10jzjcf/data_science_upper_divisions/,2023-01-23 22:54:23,What are some easy and interesting upper divisions that you've taken to satisfy Data Science Major requirements aside from Data 100?,"Data 104
bioe 100 with dorian liepmann, best option for the ethics requirement
Wouldn't call it interesting, but yeah, it's easy. Almost an essential DS class because of how many requirements it knocks out."
