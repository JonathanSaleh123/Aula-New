Who is Yi Ma?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/udmjkm/who_is_yi_ma/,2022-04-27 21:17:29,"Yi Ma is teaching EECS 16B next sem, anyone got info on how he is?","Yi Ma is a highly qualified professor, I had him for EECS 106 series. He’s a god at CV but not sure about the material in 16B. Even so, he’s a great lecturer and really wants his students to succeed. He always talked about how he wants us to do great things and tackle meaningful issues in robotics. Prof Ma cares about his students as well: I know someone who went to his OH for hw help, established good rapport, and ended up getting research at his lab!

Overall he’s a great guy and you’re in good hands
If they are bringing Yi Ma in that is very promising. But also I am guessing CS will no longer need 16B by then
I disagree with him about a good lecturer. I took the 106 series with him too and I couldn't understand what he was saying in lecture for the most part in terms of content. I might be biased because I've had some greater lecturers at Cal (Babak, Ramchandran, Sahai, etc.)  but there are way more qualified lecturers than Yi Ma. I doubt the 16B students will like the way he lectures, especially considering this is a lower division class where the variance of students is so great.

I agree with all the points you said about him being highly qualified. But highly qualified never equals to being able to teach/lecture as with most professors here in Cal, especially in CS/EECS.
is he good? can't find any (relevant) info about him
You raise some good points! That's why I said I was wary of his ability to teach 16B material. I thought his lecture style was engaging but yeah it may be better suited to a more exploratory class like 106A/B and not a lower-level, fundamentals class like 16B. Either way, he's a nice guy and wants you to succeed so at least he won't be making the class a miserable experience."
"Can anyone look over my schedule for next sem (rising soph)? Math 53, EECS16B, Phys7A, R&C B",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/udeobb/can_anyone_look_over_my_schedule_for_next_sem/,2022-04-27 14:40:48,"Rising soph, EECS major here. I still need to take:

Physics 7A/B, Math 53, EECS16B, CS61C, CS70, and my R&C B.

For Fall '22 I was planning on doing:

Phys 7A, Math 53, EECS16B, and an R&C.

Fall '23:

Phys 7B, CS61C, CS70.

I feel like any way I slice it, my schedule's gonna fucking kill me. My freshman year's been pretty bad and I'm looking into getting therapy over the summer, so if possible I would prefer to not need to manage a class on the side (though taking m53 or my R&C over the summer might be an option). (also, I feel like part of the reason for that is because I don't know how to keep my workload from seeping into every corner of my life, so seeing my schedule laid out like this scares the hell out of me too)

Notes and other things I've heard about while researching - can anyone verify these?

* I don't think I *have* to take physics 7a/b by the end of soph year. Seeing as I'm leaning more towards the software side of things, I might just be able to push it a semester, but probably no further than that.
* EECS16B is notorious for being a tedious clusterfuck of a class, but I can't find any information on next semester's professor (Yi Ma).
* Math 53 has insanely long p-sets, but they're supposedly not that hard and doable in a day or two. Canic appears to have better grade distributions, but that's because her exams were too easy and grades became unpredictable as a result
* CS70 is super work heavy
* CS61C isn't super conceptually difficult, but the projects are a huge time sink","Wait yeah, I need to find info on Yi Ma too
53 p-sets can be completed in a day (typically 2-8 hours), but of course, they'll take longer if need be. CS 70 is a lot of work if you opt for the homework option over the no-homework option, but the former is recommended. 

7A, 7B, and the R&C class should be doable. I think for Fall, 53 and 16B should depend on your math experience, but going to office hours will help a lot. For Spring, it looks a little challenging, but the difficulty and workload of 70 and 7B depends on the amount of support you have (e.g. study groups, OH, etc.). For 61C, the labs and projects are a time sink, but as long as you're efficiently going through 70 and 7B, the workload should be doable.
someone asked about Yi Ma in a recent post, don’t have the link rn but it seems like they’re really good
