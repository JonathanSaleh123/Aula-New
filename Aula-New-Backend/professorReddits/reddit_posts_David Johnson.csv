So are there politics behind the power shutoff in the East Bay?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dfrddj/so_are_there_politics_behind_the_power_shutoff_in/,2019-10-09 19:13:58,"Trying to find out what is going on behind the scenes, without having to listen to 2000 tin foil hat conspiracies, can be difficult around here. (Berkeley)  
I do know that the man heading PG&E, William D  Johnson (Acting CEO) once headed the Tennessee Valley Association. and was voted off the board of two separate energy companies.

Others involved in the operations include:  


* Jason P. Wells (Senior VP & CFO)
* David S. Thomason (Vice President & Controller)
* Forrest E. Miller (Chairman of the Board)
* Nickolas Stavropoulos (President & COO)
* David S. Thomaso (Vice President & CFO)  


Other then the claim that there are ""high winds"" (there are not currently high winds in the east bay) could there be other political or financial reasons for the power shutoff?  
Just wondering.   
THanks.  
MB","Its priming the bay area and softening the masses so that when the Chinese & North Korean amphibious assault craft hit the beaches we'll all be concerned with Traders Joe's being open or not
More like additional lawsuit prevention.
Uh its way more than the bay, it's a huge part of central and northern California due to the heavy fire risk of shitty infrastructure + unkept brush. The East Bay has been barely affected by the power shutoffs as well.
Your guys' explanations all fall short, and I am certain you are part of the coverup, since I have it on good authority that this is an Illuminati plot to sell us as tasty snacks to  shape-shifting lizards  from the fourth dimension. Rosewell! Rosewell!  
Lol. But seriously. thanks guys. After last year it makes sense, especially with the lawsuits. That's a first, and a lot of us felt something new was in play, and that is it.

Just because they aren’t high winds right now doesn’t mean there won’t be. Current forecasts predict heavy winds tonight.
Why are you complaining? This is good for climate justice. California is leading the way with this.
Nah, the area 51 raids already proved that one wrong  The reptillians and 4th D'ers  just wanna do butt stuff
That's why I found it odd. It stands out.   
There's been periodic heavy winds in the late summer for my entire life around here, and the last wildfire we had was the Oakland Hills fire, (1991. I was there) and they've never shut off the power like this before.
Why? Obviously the threat of my air fryer not finishing my whole foods Foie gras nacho fries, in time to watch netflix with my new bluetooth headphones, and order a cafe latte in the morning from door dash, was far more than my weary soul could bear. Wait....wait... you're triggering me!   
Lol.
So THAT'S what all this ""storm area 51"" stuff is about! 

Everyone just wants to get all freeky deeky with with E.T. Typical californians. Always looking for a reason to party.  
What's that address again?
2018 was the worst wild fire year in recorded history, there were several large wildfires, paradise wasn’t even the largest one. The one in Butte county was the deadliest. The one in Sonoma county that burnt entire neighborhoods down is thought to have been caused in some way by PG&E, they’re facing like $18 billion in damages for it. I also believe the government of California threatened them in some way that is making them even more paranoid and cautious about any fire happening that can in any way be blamed on them.
It's basically just precautionary after what happened in Paradise last year.
PG&E hasn't been properly maintaining their lines for years. The 2017 fires was the first time it really came back to haunt them. Now they're bankrupt and facing billions of dollars in lawsuits while still failing to maintain their lines. They know their infrastructure is shit and they recently found out that they can get in trouble for it. PG&E shut off the power because they know how poorly maintained their infrastructure is and don't want anymore lawsuits. 
They need to be broken up.
Dunno, I was in Mexico recruiting midgets at the time, didn't get the info
Straight up information you guys. Thanks!"
