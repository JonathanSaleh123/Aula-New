CNR renamed Rausser College after $50 million donation from ARE Professor Gordon Rausser,https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/02/29/college-of-natural-resources-receives-50-million-naming-gift/,2020-03-01 11:32:13,,"Kinda makes the college sound more preppy in a way, which is funny because CNR (er, ""Rausser"") has some of the least preppy people that I know of.
How does a professor get so rich ðŸ˜³
>Outside of Berkeley, Rausser has distinguished himself as an economic and policy adviser to the U.S. government and the state of California, as a business consultant and venture capitalist and an entrepreneur. 

His accomplishments also include co-founding Emeryville-based OnPoint Analytics, which provides business consulting services specializing in expert testimony in economics, data analytics, finance and statistics, and co-founding with Berkeley colleagues the Law and Economics Consulting Group
Wahaha,

I just saw this post, had been wondering why Rausser College has a unique name.
If you look him up he's done a lot and chairs a consulting firm....
Time to change my question, how does he manage to do so much he must have some crazy work ethic ðŸ˜³"
