R1A help!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k7kn1n/r1a_help/,2020-12-05 17:58:59,I'm planning on taking Film R1a with Chi Li for spring 2021. However I'm taking 61a and Ugba 10 along with the course. What can I expect from Film R1a? Is it too work heavy or is it doable?,"That’s fine for a schedule, I’d on the light side. The nonwriting intensive department R1A are all about same workload of not that much
I took it with another professor, but I wouldn't say the workload is too heavy. Since it is not in a writing intensive department, it shouldn't be too bad. When I took it I just had around 3 papers and weekly journals."
