Stat 20 professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wkikwq/stat_20_professor/,2022-08-09 16:56:02,"Can anyone recommend a professor for Stat20 for this fall? For fall there is Iain Carmichael, Shobhana Murali Stoyanov, Jeremy Sanchez, and Andrew Bray (waitlist tho).

I'm currently enrolled for Stoyanov but I saw some comments from ratemyprofessor and trying to get some opinions from others. I'm an intended econ major so I hope to meet the gpa requirement to declare this semester :,)","Jeremy Sanchez was my GSI last semester and Andrew Bray was my prof last semester. Both of them are really nice and helpful, I would say Jeremy is really new so I’m not sure how he would teach in a big lecture class but if u attend his office hours and ask questions you should be fine with him!
Andrew Bay all the way!
i had stoyanov (asynch) and her exams were in-person and we were allowed 4 pg cheat sheets. her coursework is decently doable but her lecturing is not the best. class is curved as well so you should be fine if u can score above avg and take the time to review concepts wo being lecture dependent.
Andrew Bray for sure! If this isn't too late, I had him for Stat 20 and had an absolutely amazing time in his class."
stat20,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1733o0r/stat20/,2023-10-08 09:40:55,"bro, as someone who took data8, stat20 SUCKS. no one answers my questions on Ed, tutoring is scarce, answer keys aren't posted, each professor teaches differently, the quiz situation is like wtf...

where can I give course feedback & does anyone else agree or is my professor just genuinely bad

edit can anyone tell me which professor is good","after taking Data 8 & taking Stat 20, this was my exact experience unfortunately. Good luck
who’s ur professor?
Go to Jeremy Sanchez, he’s amazing
iain carmichael is an interesting fella for sure
Sanchez and Bray considered best 2 profs for 20 I believe.
Bro why are you taking stat 20 if you've had data 8? They're essentially the same class.
SO REAL

are you just gonna ignore my comment about him https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16xm2ee/if\_you\_can\_take\_data8\_instead\_of\_stat20/k389pc0/?context=3
econ major
i have stoyanov, and i’ve had bray for a sub. They are both very nice, and I like the class.
I did not see your reply in my Reddit notifs so I did not know about it
or Pre-Haas, but no spots left in UGBA 88
ok, fair enough, but Sanchez is a prof to avoid. (for reference, here was my comment:)

""no. He was the absolute worst professor I ever had. He never responded to anything, cancelled on late notice or forgot about his office hours, didn't respond to my Ed post until the day after an assignment was due despite saying that he & course staff would be actively checking Ed for Lab 1 that night (I filed mine \~6pm, not late). When everyone was telling him on Ed and after his lectures that he was going too fast or that they didn't understand anything, he ignored the comments on Ed and said, ""don't worry, just look over the notes"". Once he gave us a PollEv question and no one knew the answer. The TA that assisted my table with the question got it wrong too! And he gave a one sentence explanation, said ""ok everyone gets it?"" and immediately moved on. Everyone looked confused.

Another time he apologized for grading all of our assignments so late (which, by the way, included not getting our lab and quiz scores - which together made up 22% of our grade - out before the P/NP deadline despite him saying he would) and made an Ed Post saying ""I will get all \_\_\_\_ grades out by \_\_\_\_\_. This deadline is final and will not be missed."" When he missed that deadline, he deleted that Ed Post and didn't respond to questions about missing assignment grades until days later.

Please, if you want to keep your sanity, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.""
But respectfully I think it's ok to disagree with each other and that we can have differing opinions (Also I'm not sure why this didn't post this is me reposting)
Nah I just read through it. I had him last fall and I thought he was great. He did a good job of explaining everything, if you weren’t paying attention you wouldn’t get it is how it was + there were times I fell behind and reached out to him and he found time outside of his office hours for us to go over content I missed and any questions I had. That in itself is hard to find and it’s tough to find a professor who cared about his students success.
Yeah that's true & good to remember. While I'm glad you had a good experience with him, I guess (if you're debating on instructors) know that there are varying experiences. Hopefully he knows not to put too much on his plate (his teaching schedule) now, as it seemed he did my semester..."
