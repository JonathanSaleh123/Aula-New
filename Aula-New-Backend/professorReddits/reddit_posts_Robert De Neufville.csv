ECON C3 vs ESPM 15,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vziyyv/econ_c3_vs_espm_15/,2022-07-15 00:50:41,"I am an incoming L&S freshman planning to study biology and environmental science. I enrolled in ECON C3 and ESPM 15 and am choosing between the two (other enrolled courses include enrolled in MATH 1A, CHEM 1A/1AL, DeCal (total 10 units)). I've listed some attributes of each class below and am hoping that I can get advice or suggestions from people who have previously taken the classes.

ECON C3 Introduction to Environmental Economics and Policy

* Meets Social & Behavioral Sciences, L&S Breadth
* Professor Maximilian Auffhammer
* 4 units (total 14 units)
* Have never taken any econ related courses, absolutely 0 background knowledge in econ

ESPM 15 Introduction to Environmental Sciences

* Meets Biological Science, L&S Breadth (will meet with BIO 1A/1AL and 1B)
* Meets Physical Science, L&S Breadth (already met with CHEM 1A)
* Professors Robert Rhew and Patina Mendez
* 3 units (total 13 units)
* More interested in taking a course that covers both the scientific and social/political aspects of envsci

Any feedback would be appreciated.","econ c3 sucks take espm 15
really? mind elaborating?
i don’t know the professor teaching econ c3 this semester but it’s a pretty econ heavy class, if you have no econ background it would take some time outside class understanding what’s going on. also it’s not really “environmental econ” it’s just regular econ but all the examples are natural resources. if you don’t have to take it i honestly wouldnt
Heard that professor auffhammer is pretty chill and humorous, but I think I will choose espm 15 after considering your advice. Thanks a ton :)"
Has your experience at Cal been a positive one?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/20j1jh/has_your_experience_at_cal_been_a_positive_one/,2014-03-15 20:30:35,"For me personally, I love Cal to death. I've experienced the best moments in my life at Berkeley so far, and I feel a bit sad that I will be graduating soon. I've made so many new friends, all of whom are brilliant and super talented in one way or another, and are a bit quirky in their own ways (though I like that!). While my classes have been tough and rigorous (I'm CS), I feel honored to study alongside such incredible students and learn from amazing professors. Cal has definitely helped me a lot and has shaped my life for the better...and I'm really grateful that it helped me get a job in Silicon Valley (I really liked the advisers in the career center).

I think Cal's campus is beautiful, I love how there's always clubs on sproul doing stuff (even if the flyering gets a bit annoying), I love the local cuisine and culture, and I love how close Cal is to SF. I've been able to pursue a lot of activities outside of my CS sphere, such as joining political and social clubs, and taking DeCal courses on various fun subjects (I think Cal's DeCal program is extremely cool, something that the ivy league lacks). I love Cal's diversity: I've met people from varying socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds, ppl from around the globe, and have developed a deeper understanding and appreciation for people's differences. I love Robert Reich and found his course to be one of the most insightful courses I've taken in my life (outside of CS). I also loved my first year in the dorms, my year in the co-ops, and the two years I've spent in my apartment with two friends. 

I've also never felt the size of the school population to be a problem: I love that there's so many people here. Because of that, you can always find your niche of friends with whom you share common interests and create a small family, and can always meet new and interesting people every semester (with different classes, different club activities, ect). I also really like how non-judgemental and relatively mature most students are: in high school, I was an outcast because people felt I was a nerd who liked anime, starcraft, science fiction, and wasn't super good at sports. At my high school, there were a lot of cliques and I often felt that I didn't belong, and being gay didn't help either. But at Cal, most people have been really accepting of who i am, and since everyone is unique in their own way, and don't judge ppl over stupid stuff (like what music someone likes, what shows they like, what their interests are, what clothes they are wearing, whether they are gay, etc). And while Berkeley is competitive and I have heard of backstabbers in curved classes, I've never experienced that: all of my friends have been nice and took care of me when I missed class or was sick. I'm just so glad that so many people here are open to making new friends on the spot and genuinely liking others (at least compared to my high school)

If I went to another school, I would have probably just only cared about getting my degree and doing a job, and nothing more. But after coming to Cal, I learned about politics, and as a result, I am much more socially conscious than I was before, and I thank Berkeley for improving me as a person. 

Also not about berkeley specifically, but I love having freedom...i feel much more responsible and mature than I was in high school, and I thank my college experience for that. 

Yeah, some stuff about Cal sucks: telebears, a lackluster football team, mediocre campus spirit (although the RAs + rally comm + ASUC try really hard), really rigorous courses, the surrounding area can be unsafe at times, bureaucracy (although this wasn't a problem for me), telebears, inadequate policies to address sexual violence, inadequate medical + mental health services, rising tuition, etc. But I think that the positives strongly outweigh the negatives, and we are trying hard to improve in the above areas and do it a lot of them better than other schools. ","Somedays I wish I never came here. But most of the time I know I would never trade this experience for anything in the world. 

I have become a better person after being here for 4 years. Yeah, I had my share of mishaps and failures, some of them soul crushing, but nonetheless it has made me a better man. 

I have many regrets about my experience here, I have made mistakes, I have hurt and been hurt. But if my life is but a sum of my experiences, I would be hard pressed to have a better place and people to have these experiences.  
I graduated last May and was lucky enough to get a job in the bay, so I can visit Cal once in a while. I love Berkeley for all the same reasons you list. If you could define an equation of variables that make me who I am today, the entire thing would probably be to the 'Berkley'th power, because it so fundamentally affected every aspect of me. 

My economics/political science studies helped me build a framework through which I viewed the world. My tenure as an RA taught me self-awareness and empathy. The people I met exposed me to diversity, social justice, and inclusion. At Berkeley, I began my journey of food discovery, my hunger for literature, the foundation of my own independent thoughts and beliefs about the world, what I look for in a romantic partner, what real friendship meant, and so much more.

What makes me most thankful is the fact that I ended up at Cal in Fall 2009 completely by accident. The story is complex, but suffice it to say I thought I was going to Stanford until the last second, when I could no longer attend and chose Berkeley without ever having visited. 

Now working with a fair amount of Stanford graduates, I couldn't be happier that I ended up where I did.

All that being said, two things I'd like to point out:

1. Our school spirit was roaring my Freshman year, before our football team fell off the deep end. It's pretty unfortunate that our pride in our school is largely dependent on this, but I suppose that's just the way it goes.

2. The class sizes are Berkeley's achilles heel. Approaching a professor when they have to juggle hundreds of students is hard, and scary. Not all professors are friendly. It can be hard to be motivated when you are so easily lost in the crowd. What I'm trying to say is, navigating the masses (both academically and socially) requires a skill set--maybe even a personality type--that not everyone has or knows how to develop. Berkeley tries to provide everyone with the resources to overcome this (that was my job as an RA), but I know hundreds of Cal students (not exaggerating) who will tell you that it is prohibitive to their success.
While I agree with you that there are many things to love about Berkeley, I've got to say that I've been continually disappointed/discouraged by such large class sizes. CS is particularly crowded; I'm in 61C now and I'm finding that it's difficult to make connections with peers and instructors. I wish I knew professors better because, among many other important reasons, I have yet to develop any relationship that could result in a letter of recommendation. Discussions are large too. I feel like if I want to have someone talk to me about the course (peer/instructor/etc.), I have to go to office hours which is difficult when every other course is large and designed the same way.

Did you ever feel frustrated by this? I know the CS major is becoming more and more popular - is there any more involvement in upper division classes?
Ever since I first got here I've been gradually declining into depression and the beginnings of alcoholism, so no I wouldn't call it a positive experience, but I'm definitely glad I came here over any other school.
You ever have the experience at a party where someone brings up a topic, and you see an interesting, deeper question that the topic prompts, so you raise it to the group... just for them to exchange bewildered glances? So you drop it, and go back to talking about kittens or football or whatever, but you still get people telling you that you ""overthink"" things? I used to get that a lot before I came to Cal, but never since. My time here has been something of an emotional rollercoaster, but I've never forgotten how privileged I am to be in the company of people who are unafraid to confront big ideas. I know that I will dearly miss the days when I could sit down at a cafe and eat a sandwich while the people at the table next to me discuss quantum physics, or medieval literature, or whatever esoteric thing has wrapped itself around their hearts without shame or self-consciousness. I won't miss the late nights, or the enormous classes, and I certainly won't miss Telebears, but I will miss leading a life of the mind.
This is pretty cool to read. I visited the campus last spring break, I am a junior in highschool, and I fell in love with how beautiful it was. Could I DM you some questions?
I dunno, it was bittersweet for me. I think the weather really affected me negatively (from So Cal), while the courseload took a huge hit on my confidence. I'm sure my experience at Cal was more of a function of where I was in my life, but there's just something about the city that's always put me off. Not really sure. I really enjoyed SF, the classes, the students, and the greenery, though. 
Why the hell are people downvoting this? I thought it was a pretty touching story.

Anyway, glad you really like it here! Cal was the highlight of my life too...grad school (I went to law school) was a bummer
Awesome, thank you for sharing. I really hope when I graduate I'll be able to look back and feel the same way.

I'm a junior right now so not quite finished but a good ways there. Since coming to Cal, I've learned so much about myself, including what I really want from life and how to be genuine. The university makes many things difficult; it's difficult to maintain close friends and get good grades, etc, but now that I've gotten past it all I feel confident and ready for what life has in store for me next.

I'm studying abroad right now, and it's really put into perspective how lucky I am to be able to attend such a great university. The academics, people, and opportunities at Cal are truly top-notch. Others would sacrifice a great deal to be where we are now.
I chose Berkeley for the prestigious name. I came here with a purpose, to use the college name to get me where I wanted to be professionally and that's exactly what I did.

Socially I hate this place. It's grimy as hell. My car window just got smashed, I constantly get parking tickets, the homeless people sleeping on campus weird me out, most people aren't friendly in class, the competition between students is a buzz kill and it's the biggest small town i've ever been to. I'm from LA and getting used to this place has been very difficult for me. Anyone reading this make sure you check out the campus/city prior to moving here. That was my biggest mistake. It's not for everyone but what is?
you [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1u4han/is_it_possible_for_a_liberal_arts_major_with_a/), like, two months ago that you were a double major in Poli Sci and Philosophy...

Bio/Psych major checking in. You have to be strategic about the professors you pick for recommendations.

In my popular classes (MCB 104), there would literally be 30-40 people who would show up to every single office hour session (even the ones right after exams). They'd have to reserve a discussion room just to hold office hours.

Typically it's the electives where nobody cares enough to go to office hours. For me, that was MCB 103 - the professor was still excellent, but office hours were usually me and 2-3 other people.

Edit: Scratch that, in my Psych/Breadth classes nobody gave a damn and office hours were basically deserted. It's only the Biology folks trying to get into medical school that flooded office hours.
I'm constantly afraid of not getting into the CS major so for that reason it has been a highly stressful experience lately. Fun classes though.
you're not alone, i felt very similar my first year (about the confidence hits from classes but especially the lack of SoCal sunshine(its weird how important it is)) and still do.
if people don't like my post or story, that is their choice :) People have different experiences, so it's good to respect that.

I just wanted to post this to see if anyone else had a really good time at Cal. And I wanted to see if people had a negative experience at Cal and why they feel things didn't work out 
Wow man/woman, care to share why Boalt was a bummer? I work in the law library and ask students about their experience there and it's always a resounding ""It's difficult but amazing."" What do you say?
uhh, i didn't post that, and it's deleted ._.
Appropriate user name, if I knew how to label peeps on reddit you'd be ""underdog team leader that pops up at the half when the team is down with a rally speech.""
This deserves gold. thank you for this, I'm going to fucking office hours this week.
> Also, you won't get a good letter of rec. just by getting an A in a class. I don't know where that notion came from. To get any meaningful letter of rec you have to do research with a professor. I think most people in engineering will back me up on this.

Most definitely. Letters from class interactions show very little.
Well, I suppose my experience with office hours thus far has been lackluster. With the exception of Dan's office hours, I've had other professors hold discussion style OH which are often full.  But perhaps you addressed my question - I've only taken extremely crowded lower div courses (CS, Math 1A/1B, Chem 1A/3A, Bio 1A, etc.). I was really wondering if, beyond those, you're less likely to get lost in the crowd. 
Well office hours are a bit difficult for several reasons. Some professors don't show up to their own scheduled office hours, and a few years ago EECS had a problem the professors not updating the listings on their doors with the correct date/time.

They've pretty much fixed this (note that this does not apply to other departments, some of which still have this problem), but in my own experience, I've also usually had another lecture or section during a professor's office hours. Since Berkeley professors are do brilliant work, they need all the time they can get for research and this cuts into student interaction time.

For some professors office hours = office hour, and if I've got lab section during that hour then there's no way I can make it.

I also agree about the letter of rec. People ask me sometimes to help them word out their request, but all they have to work with is ""oh, I went to office hours like twice. and I got an A, so it should be good right?"" I imagine these situations are awkward for the professors.


Yeah, classes at Cal were pretty brutal. I remember getting my first panic attack while taking Biochem for Biochem majors. First and last class I've ever actually failed. The sunshine down here really spoils us, I think. I was just hanging around Venice today and just being outside literally put a smile on my face. Damn this sensitivity.
From a brief look at columbialawpolsci's history he did not go to Boalt, but Duke Law School. He probably went to UC Berkeley as an undergrad then from the ""highlight of my life"" bit
2L Boaltie here. Law school is a grind, pure and simple. I enjoy law school more than most, but it's a mind-numbing and soul-crushing process. I was having a beer with one of my classmates the other night and he remarked that one of his favorite parts of law school is that there's so much work that you simply don't have time to think sad thoughts. &#3232;_&#3232;

See you in the library!
Yes, it's deleted now that you've deleted it after the fact. "
