"Berkeley Bureaucratic Bloat: Division of Equity and Inclusion ""flourished from three people to more than 150 employees""",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2ljiwy/berkeley_bureaucratic_bloat_division_of_equity/,2014-11-06 18:47:38,"http://www.dailycal.org/2014/11/05/1st-vice-chancellor-equity-inclusion-reflects-time-position/

> After more than eight years as UC Berkeley’s first vice chancellor for equity and inclusion, Gibor Basri intends to step down at the end of the academic school year, leaving behind him a multifaceted legacy.

> When Basri first stepped into his office in California Hall in August of 2007, it was barren except for a table and desk. Now, his office is but one part of what Basri built from scratch: the Division of Equity and Inclusion, which is the entity charged with resolving systemic inequalities at UC Berkeley. 

> After he was brought to UC Berkeley in 1979 as a fellow of the Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellowship, Basri and collaborators were the first to announce the existence of brown dwarfs — substellar objects too large to be planets and too small to be stars. Since joining the faculty in 1982, Basri served on several committees such as the Graduate Affirmative Action Advisory Committee and the Academic Senate’s Committee on the Status of Women and Ethnic Minorities until eventually assuming his position as vice chancellor.

> As the division flourished from **three people to more than 150 employees**, it developed the UC Berkeley Strategic Plan for Equity, Inclusion and Diversity, from which many initiatives have come to fruition since 2009.

Why does Berkeley need more than 150 employees in the Division of Equity and Inclusion?","Using a throwaway because I want to speak anonymously about this. I have worked for a department of the Berkeley administration for 3 years and have seen the most ridiculous bureaucracy and wasteful spending. It's so bad that I think if students knew they would be up in arms.

I have never in those 3 years seen anyone fired or even reprimanded, nor have I even *heard* about someone getting fired before my time here. Roughly 75% (a conservative estimate) of the people hired for short-term projects are turned into full-time staff. I have seen bogus departments get made just to squeeze these people into the system. And although they are classified by the admin under a generic title (like Admin Assistant III) they are given totally phony titles. It's no surprise that if you walk through the admin halls you will see about half of the employees on social media, reddit, buzzfeed etc. I am of course guilty of it too. 

Sure, everybody slacks off at work. That's not even close to being the biggest problem with Berkeley admin. What is a problem is that when people do work, it's make-work, busy work, and pointless projects. There will be projects to ""assess the quality of student life"" that entails sending out an e-mail to students to fill out a survey with the promise of a free iPad, the results of which then get made into a written report and a Powerpoint that is shown to maybe 20 people who zone out during an hour meeting. Then people discuss making a new committee to do the same thing on a monthly basis (just to give them something to do) and after spending a week thinking of what to call this new committee they think of some silly acronym and print up binders and hold meetings about how to execute. Then they'll hire a few project managers.

The bureaucracy is so crazy that I have seen months of biweekly meetings just about how to reorganize the bureaucracy. ""We are thinking of merging SHP with OPO to create SHPOPO which will share its budget with TDD."" And, again, they'll hire some managers to help doing this reorganization, and people will spend a month moving to a new office, and a committee will be started to help assist with that. **Keep in mind that this has nothing to do with Berkeley research or student experience. It's bureaucratic musical chairs. The bureaucracy exists only to support itself.**

Inevitably, someone in this committee will say, ""We should get some iPads, MacBooks"" etc. And let me tell you when you request equipment as a Berkeley admin you get it. I have seen committees order a dozen iPads only for them to be used ONCE and shelved (yes, in Berkeley admin offices there is so much computer equipment sitting around unused). Then another department comes in and says, ""We want iPads too"" and of course to be fair they get them as well, along with whatever accessories they want.

All the while these people are patting themselves on the back for a job well done and they have not helped any students. BTW these people are usually over 50 and don't know shit about technology which is also slows everything down. Of course these fogies only want to hire other fogies so that their jobs are protected.

No one is a better authority on this than Laura Nader who I've spoken with and I'm sure many of you have had as a professor (she's been at Cal since 1960). She'll be the first to tell you that the admin budget has hockeysticked while professors, research, etc. has been slashed. It's just not fair to the students at all.

TL;DR Students should be up in arms about administrative bloat
Here are their program links. Check them out. I don't know if they are good or bad programs but I suspect you don't either.

The main reason behind tuition increases is not bureaucratic bloat. It's the massive cuts in State funding that have taken place over the last few decades.

You and Laura Nader are right. We need more professors and less administrators.

It will be tempting, of course, to work exclusively with the majority party. Such a practice will surely prove convenient, but this is not what California needs or deserves.

> We also ask that you make efforts to combat the massive administrative bloat of the UC and CSU systems.

These are issues that affect not just ourselves but more than a million California students and their families.

As someone who has been with the UC (not just Cal) for ten years, I think you're drawing too broad of conclusions from your anecdotal experience. 

Staff (as well as faculty outside of the professional schools) salaries significantly lag behind the market for equivalent jobs. Staff and faculty have been subject to both furloughs and reduced benefits due to austerity policies. Staff members regularly go without cost of living increases for years on end. Being a UC employee is not the bourgeoisie iPad picnic that you're making it out to be. I've worked on many cross-campus projects, and have had experiences where it was hard to get *post-it notes* because of supply budget issues.

To your point: Of course you're going to see some administrative bloat in *any* large organization. Also, yes, people are going to shirk occasionally. People are not machines and nobody is 100%. However, this isn't a uniquely UC staff problem, it's the way that humans operate in the economy we're subject to.

Pegging the problems of the UC on staff members who are working here largely because they believe in the mission of the university (as opposed to an illusion of extravagant pay), instead of properly on the politics of austerity and disinvestment practiced by the state is just misguided.

The UC is suffering now, and students are suffering because of it. You aren't going to find any (rational) staff members blaming the students and thinking they should have to pay more, or that they're expecting too much for too little. The tendency to turn it around and blame *admin staff* (of all people) for the UC's problems sounds like right-wing nonsense. Tuition has raised *not* because of more admin staff, but because of *less funding* from the state with an expectation to do the same job for more students. 

Your post is just a red herring away from addressing real issues about the UC's problems.
Berkeley does not need all those programs.

> Remember the pepper spray incident at the University of California, Davis, which was supposed to spark a revolution against the police? Neither do we, but last week the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald used it as a news peg for a National Review Online piece taking aim at a favorite target of hers. As she notes, the clash with university police started out with a protest against skyrocketing tuition:

> > UC Berkeley's Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion declared that the rising tuition at California's public universities is giving him ""heartburn."" It should, since **Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion Gibor Basri and his fellow diversity bureaucrats are a large cause of those skyrocketing college fees, not just in California but nationally.**

> > **Basri commands a staff of 17, allegedly all required to make sure that fanatically left-wing UC Berkeley is sufficiently attuned to the values of ""diversity"" and ""inclusion""; his 2009 base pay of $194,000 was nearly four times that of starting assistant professors. Basri was given responsibility for a $4.5 million slice of Berkeley's vast diversity bureaucracy when he became the school's first Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion in 2007; since then, the programs under his control have undoubtedly weathered the recession far more comfortably than mere academic endeavors.**

> > UC Berkeley's diversity apparatus, which spreads far beyond the office of the VC for E and I, is utterly typical. For the last three decades, colleges have added more and more tuition-busting bureaucratic fat; **since 2006, full-time administrators have outnumbered faculty nationally.** UC Davis, for example, whose modest OWS movement has been happily energized by the conceit that the campus is a police state, offers the usual menu of diversity effluvia under the auspices of an Associate Executive Vice Chancellor for Campus Community Relations. A flow chart of Linnaean complexity would be needed to accurately map all the activities overseen by the AEVC for CCR.

> Mac Donald's next two sentences take 140 words to list eight different Davis diversity divisions. She goes on to enumerate similar programs at UC's San Francisco and San Diego campuses and to cite a few at Harvard and Yale. 

> This ""diversity bureaucracy"" is unquestionably a worthy target of scorn. It is, as Mac Donald suggests, fundamentally parasitic, producing nothing of value to the taxpayers, students and parents who foot the bills. Resources wasted on this nonsense are not spent on actual education--or, for that matter, on other vital government services or investment in the real economy.

How can students convince Jerry Brown to stop cutting state funding when the UC can't rein in the administrative bloat?
Don't try to do anything.

This is ""Equity and Inclusion"". If you speak against a group like that, even if it is over an administrative topic and not an ideological or political one, the consequences will you bad. There'll be petitions for you to be kicked out for being a racist/sexist/transphobe/whatever else.

Why do you think the above person is commenting anonymously?
Maybe torch a few offices?
I think you make an important point, but I think both of you are probably talking past each other--from what I can tell, the problem of administrative bloat isn't so much a problem with underpaid, average UC staff and workers so much as a problem with upper/senior management.  
It's not just an anecdote, admin budgets and staffs have been ballooning. And it's not just UC, it's something happening across the country (that and building fancy campuses and luxury rec centers.) It's using the federal student loan system as a blank check.

Here I will argue in your style:

Berkeley does need these diversity programs.

According to the most recent data I could find, which is from 2008-2009, UC Berkeley spends about $71 million out of its $1.8 billion dollar budget on Administration. That amounts to less than 4% of the budget. 

Meanwhile, from 2003 to 2012, the amount of State Funding to UC Berkeley was cut from about $500 million to $250 million. Even if UC Berkeley fired *all* of their administrators, it wouldn't come close to making up for the cuts.

[Have a look](http://vcaf.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/08.22.12_UCB_Business_Case.pdf) At the UC Berkeley Business Plan. On page 3, do you see the projected gap in 2018? That's about $200 million.

On page 5, do you see how Berkeley spends about 20% less than similarly sized institutions with similar research and teaching records?

Berkeley already does a lot to reduce costs compared to similar universities with similar reputations. The problem isn't administrative bloat, which couldn't account for more than a few percent of the entire budget. The problem is the lack of funding from the state.
>a problem with upper/senior management.

Ya, I definitely wouldn't deny that...
Why? What tangible benefits do they have? 
> Berkeley already does a lot to reduce costs compared to similar universities with similar reputations.

I agree with Jerry Brown that the UC system needs to do a lot more in reducing costs by cutting unnecessary bloat.

The money wasted on [""spending money it doesn't have to""](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/16/local/la-me-brown-higher-ed-20130116) in the words of Jerry Brown would be better spent on scholarships for low-income students and increasing the number of professors.

> The problem isn't administrative bloat, which couldn't account for more than a few percent of the entire budget. The problem is the lack of funding from the state.

I agree with you that the state needs to provide more funding to the UC system.

The two positions that 1) the state needs to provide more funding and 2) administrative bloat should be cut are not mutually exclusive.

Reforms are needed because Jerry Brown will be even less willing to provide funding to the UC system if he continues to see the university wasting money."
