"Arguing for the expansion of Social Security as a policy proposal for the next president, Berkeley public policy and economics professor Jesse Rothstein says that raising the Social Security payroll tax rate by just one percent would make everyone's benefit 15 percent larger.",http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-03/advice-for-the-next-president-expand-social-security,2016-11-06 00:47:04,,"Alternatively we could raise taxes on the 1 percent.
And eliminating social security would allow people to invest their own money and a) enjoy the superior present value of money; b) regularly beat the return from social security by a wide margin; and c) not have a significant portion of their earnings subject to the federal government and the national electorate, which could decide (or be forced to due to shortfalls) tomorrow to dramatically change benefits.
Eliminating social security would plunge millions of disabled and elderly people into poverty."
