GPP105 with Talwalker?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zat218/gpp105_with_talwalker/,2022-12-02 10:10:28,"Hi, has anyone taken GPP105 with Clare Talwalker before?

I was planning on taking it to satisfy my International Studies breadth, but I don't have any information on the class.

What is the class like? How reading-intensive is it? What sort of assignments does the professor give? How difficult would you rate it overall?

Thank you very much! :)",i didnt have this instructor but i loved the class honestly. fair amount of reading couple hours a week tops. but very memorable
What YOU can do about Professor Kohler right now.,https://i.redd.it/3px12qprs3ec1.png,2024-01-22 18:48:20,"For those who don't know, Professor Kristopher Kohler taught GPP 115: Challenges and Hopes last semester, and the semesters before that. His class was structured in a way that called out multiple institutions for enabling inequality and disabling development in foreign countries, and even in the U.S. Despite outstanding student evaluations, Kohler's contract was discontinued because he ""taught ineffectively"", what he believes to be an attempt to silence him for the previous call-outs.

As a student that took his class last semester, I found his class to be amazing, especially because of his lecture style, and I couldn't imagine the class, or even my future as a student and activist, to ever be the same without him. I think he did an amazing job at inspiring leadership and activating his students to make positive change, as it genuinely inspired me to get more involved. 

In an effort to get his reinstated, we, students from the class discord, created an email template that I want to share with you all. Please, if you took his class and want to make use of the lessons he taught us for fighting against injustice, send this to the following emails: 

Khalid Kadir, Global Poverty and Practice Minor, kadir@berkeley.edu

Clare Talwalker, Global Poverty and Practice Minor, ctalwalker@berkeley.edu

Daniel Fletcher Acting Chair, Global Poverty and Practice Minor, fletch@berkeley.edu

The email template is as follows:

To the administrative staff of the Global Poverty and Practice program,

As a student of Professor Kristopher Kohler‚Äôs Challenges and Hopes class of [year] who was inspired by his teachings, I am devastated to hear he has been let go from your program. Dr. Kohler‚Äôs course has been a staple of the Global Poverty and Practice minor for 3 years, and his sudden dismissal is shocking and concerning. His ‚Äúteaching effectiveness‚Äù is evident in his glowing student evaluation responses, in the outrage his removal has sparked, and in the glaring absence he leaves behind. We believe this decision is a mistake and will cost the Global Poverty and Practice program one of its most compelling advocates. Further, we request that Professor Kohler be reinstated to his previous position where he can continue to inspire students like me. 
[room for personal input, try to be specific! We want to show how much Kohler means to the program]
This institution has cultivated a reputation as a leader of change, unafraid to push boundaries and challenge old ideas, and we hope your administration will recognize Professor Kohler‚Äôs contribution to that vision.

Thank you for your time,
[name]","I don't have a strong opinion in this issue, one way or the other.  

It did confuse me, however because a professor generally isn't just ""removed"" by a decision of their immediate colleagues after one evaluation. The campus has extremely strong faculty protections through the Academic Senate.

It looks to me like there are seven faculty associated with the Global Poverty & Practice minor program. Mr. Kolher is one of those, and is listed as a lecturer in the program.  Here's a listing of the teaching faculty including a description of his background. [https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gppminor/faculty/](https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gppminor/faculty/)

Here's an announcement from when he was hired in Fall, 2021 that describes the programs he was hired for, and his teaching activities. 

[https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/kris-kohler-joins-dev-eng-gpp-programs/](https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/kris-kohler-joins-dev-eng-gpp-programs/)

My guess--only a guess--is that this particular minor program decided not to continue him as a lecturer, and that's implied in his email reference to the program not renewing his ""contract"".  If he were a tenured faculty member, or a lecturer with security of employment, it would not simply be a matter of whether a teaching contract is renewed or not. 

That's all, just wanted to add this to the mix for those considering the issue. 

It's totally aside from the merits of the arguments pro and con on his teaching. 

If any of my comments are wrong, I very much hope one of the faculty ""lurkers"" on this Reddit sub will step in and set the record straight with one of those typically very well informed ""Prof here..."" comments.
Surprised to see that this is gaining so much traction. I took GPP 115 with Dr. K in Fall 2022, and didn‚Äôt believe his teaching style was all that impressive or, for that matter, problematic. I get that his teaching touched on sensitive issues, but so do a number of other professors who‚Äôve been at Cal for longer. 
For reasons unrelated to the material, I never really felt that Dr. K was a particularly strong instructor. His response to waning attendance was to give students extra credit for showing up. In a class that was largely graded on papers, I never got below a 95% and never received feedback of any kind (which made it feel like nothing ever really mattered in the first place). With that in mind, he didn‚Äôt submit Fall 2022 grades until mid March (obviously the GSI strike played a huge factor there, but three months late‚Ä¶?).
Idk, I thought it was an‚Ä¶ interesting move to reach out to students about this. I wish him the best, but I highly doubt that this move will ever result in any kind of action by the University.
A little reserach goes a long way:

(1) He's not a professor. He's a lecturer.

(2) His contract wasn't discontinued. Lecturers start on 1-year contracts, then get a 2-year contract, and then a 3-year contract. At the end of every contract, they are reviewed and must be reappointed. Dr. (not Professor) Koehler was told that he wouldn't be reappointed at the end of his 2-year contract.

(3) ""Teaching effectiveness"" and ""some students like him"" are not the same thing. Departments examine a range of materials and evaluate lecturers according to a variety of criteria. You refer to his ""glowing student evaluations."" Have you seen these, or are you taking his word for it? What exactly were the critiques raised in the classroom observations? What else did the department examine, and what did they conclude? You haven't seen his evaluation; you have no idea why he isn't being reappointed. 

I get it--it sucks when teachers you like aren't around anymore. But Berkeley students have an alarming tendency to jump to the defense of people who have been let go/suspended/not reappointed sometime with little to no understanding of or concrete evidence about what happened. Witness the del Valle debacle from the fall.
Even if what you say is true this email is extremely inappropriate. It is itself grounds for removal so your email idea will never work.

Be honest: are you Professor Kohler? üëÄ
They wouldn't have fired him without cause, there is more to the story then people know.
What I heard from one of the gpp faculty member is that he was not fired but was not re-hired.
Lecturers are sometimes on short term contracts. Typically if you've been teaching at Cal less than 5 years, you are on a year long contract . This is his 3rd year, so that's probably the case here. Based on his email and that context, your assumptions are likely correct: for whatever reason the department decided not to renew the contract. 


Unfortunately, universities are relying more and more on contracted lecturers and adjuncts to teach undergraduate courses. They are cheaper and easier to fire if they say something perceived to be problematic. They sometimes hold positions at multiple colleges and also tend to rely a lot more on performance and student evals for job security. I'm not familiar with that program or department and I imagine that the truth of this situation is somewhere between what the department would say and what the Prof would...unless he said something truly controversial, I doubt that the dept would essentially lay him off based on one mediocre course observation. Regardless, this trend of contract labor in higher ed is ultimately not a good thing for research or instruction. Increasingly contingent faculty are teaching under a scarcity mentality and vying for ever dwindling job security,  a trend that will continue as red states continue to get rid of tenure at public universities.

Thanks for the insights, and this is very well put.
Lecturers teach on a series of contracts: the first three are 1, 2, and 3 years in length. After that, they teach on a ""continuing contract"" which, while not tenure, has no termination date."
