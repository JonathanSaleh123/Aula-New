UGBA 10 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cfub4h/ugba_10_professors/,2019-07-20 19:48:48,"Hi! I'm an intended CS and Business double major, thinking of taking UGBA 10 or Econ 1. I was looking at the professors for UGBA 10, and searched up their reviews, and I'm really worried. Are the teachers always Omar Romero-hernandez, Judy Hopelain, John Briginshaw, Daniel G Mulhern? Will Christina Banks be returning?",yeah the teachers stay the same - I think banks and her muffins are done :(
UGBA 10 as a freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cd9yua/ugba_10_as_a_freshman/,2019-07-14 16:38:03,"Hi! I'm an intended CS and Business major! I am pretty certain I want to take LS 25 and CS 61A, but besides that, I'm really lost. I was thinking of taking UGBA 10, but lots of people don't recommend it? Could someone explain?

Otherwise, it'd be awesome to get some advice on how to choose classes. I know EE 16A would've been great, but it clashes with LS 25 which has a really cool topic this fall! There's so many good courses out there, but they don't work because of schedule conflicts, being full, etc.

In context, here are the requirements I have to fulfill:

* Arts/Lit (fulfilled by LS 25)
* Bio (eww... )
* Philosophy and Values (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Social/Behavioral Science (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)
* International Studies (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Reading and Comp B (None of the ones that still have spots sound great and I don't like writing essays...ideas? Spring?)
* American Cultures (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)

&#x200B;

And the courses I'm considering. Thoughts on courses/teachers appreciated:

* Intro to Human Nutrition (Marc Hellerstein, Joseph L Napoli)
* Human Biological Variation (Leslea Hlusko)
* Psychology of Sleep (upper-div) (Matthew P. Walker)
* Principles of Business (Judy Hopelain, Omar Romero-hernandez, Daniel G Mulhern, John Briginshaw)
* Seminar on Social, Political, and Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine (David Malcolm Potts, Darlene D. Francis)
* Design and Activism (Greg Castillo, Achvabenzinberg Stein)

&#x200B;

But I'm conflicted because I have a lot of requirements to fulfill, and I can't do most right now, but I also don't want to take extra classes and get behind...","Just do Econ 1 or UGBA 10 so you can knock out one of the business pre reqs alongside one of the CS pre reqs. I'm guessing you passed out of Math? Olney is a great Econ Professor and the course isn't too demanding/hard but I also wouldn't take it easy and push it to the side.
UGBA 10 as a freshman is totally fine - I commented on another post about it but it’s essentially a consistently medium-load class. Exam every 3 or so weeks, different professors so different style to get used to every 3 weeks. Multiple choice exams which are fine as long as you use the past practice papers available to you. I don’t think it’s that bad but if you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

In terms of the bio breadth, you could consider MCB C61 or C62. C62 is offered in fall and is called Drugs and the Brain while C61 is in spring and is about Brain, Mind, and Behaviour. I believe both are crossovers with Psych so they’re both very interesting classes, but may be a bit heavy on the neurobiology part with diagrams and technical terms and everything that goes along with that, in case you’re not super interested in that. Lots of memorisation but not super difficult classes. I found C61 was quite interesting even though I’m not a STEM major, and Dr Presti is definitely very interested and dedicated to the topics covered. If you’d like to know more about that course, I’d be happy to discuss it in greater depth."
