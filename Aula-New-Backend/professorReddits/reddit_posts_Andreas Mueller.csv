P/NP for College of Engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zgnmzx/pnp_for_college_of_engineering/,2022-12-08 21:09:40,"Hey engineering students!

Consider emailing this message to engineering departmental emails and/or your advisors, to push for a Fall 2022 P/NP policy for College of Engineering students. The College of Letters & Science recently did something similar! 

Here are some emails you can include:

Engineeringdean Departmental <engineeringdean@berkeley.edu>, Ess Departmental <ess@berkeley.edu>, Fiona M. Doyle <fmdoyle@berkeley.edu>, Sharon Mueller <smueller@berkeley.edu>, Megan Braverman <mbraverman@berkeley.edu>, Olivia Chan <oychan@berkeley.edu>, Shareena SAMSON <shareena@berkeley.edu>, Joey Wong <joeywong@berkeley.edu>, Bioengineering Department <bioeng@berkeley.edu>, Engineeringscience-coe Departmental <engineeringscience@coe.berkeley.edu>, Kendra Van Nyhuis <kendravn@berkeley.edu>, Mayra Rivera <m.rivera@berkeley.edu>, Andrea Mejia Valencia <mejiavalencia@berkeley.edu>, Catherine Bouvier Dang <catherinedang@berkeley.edu>

P/NP for College of Engineering Students

UC Berkeley's College of Letters & Science recently released a Fall 2022 Late Grading Option Change Modification for L&S students. I'm writing to urge advisors and other leaders in CoE to support a similar policy for College of Engineering students. My classmates and I have faced immense disruption to instruction, and an ongoing void of academic support. Many students are entering finals amidst a shortage of office hours, instructor feedback, and preparation material. Thank you for your work to support students, and please consider relaying student pleas regarding Fall 2022 grading.","Before I voice my opinion, I just wanted to say that we really appreciate all the professors and decision makers currently working hard to help accommodate students during this difficult (hopefully rewarding) time. It's easy for me as a student to only see how hard the strike has been on the students, but we 100% see how hard it has been on our favorite professors, instructors, and decision makers. Thank you for hearing us out. 

EECS students, just like L&S, Data Science, and Physics students,  greatly rely on TAs and GSIs to learn. I'm not sure why L&S has made the decision but not COE. I think all students should be held to the same learning standard. Learning the material in classes like 61A, 61B, EECS16A, EECS16B DEPENDS on whether or not we have OH and discussion. Or even getting our conceptual questions on edstem answered in a timely manner. Intermittent, asynchronous communication through edstem has certainly not been a substitute for office hours and discussion. 

 I think some classes have made adjustments to only critically assess pre-strike material, and moderately assess post-strike material. That is definitely helpful, but for students like me (I speak for alot of us) who can't keep up with ( 61A, 61B, EECS16A, EECS16B)  every single week due to a multitude of reasons (some being part time jobs, internship interviews, other classes) , we need the final 3-4 weeks to catch up on concepts that were taught even before the strike. We also have just formed study habits that rely on getting help. 

I've had to hire a private tutor to substitute for the lack of TAs and GSIs, and I know there are so many students who can't afford then privilege I have. I just hope a decision is made that allows EECS Students (not just ds students) to optionally pass the course as a major requirement. EECS is an academically rigorous and reputable program that I'm proud to be a part of.  However, I don't want our capabilities as students to be abused.
guys letâ€™s all do our part

Hi--I'm a reporter for the Daily Californian. If you're interested in contributing to an article on the new policy, please email aandrews@dailycal.org with your thoughts on the issue (could be the one you just expressed above!). Thanks so much.
yeah def. Will you maintain my anonymity in the report?"
