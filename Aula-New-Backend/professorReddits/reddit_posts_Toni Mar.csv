Help in choosing a P.E. class?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1p094h/help_in_choosing_a_pe_class/,2013-10-22 15:01:19,"Hi Bears!

I want to take a P.E. class next semester that will help me lose weight, but isn't too intense. I am not very fit. 

I'm looking into this one, what do yall think?

","If you're looking to lose weight, a core conditioning class won't be the most effective; I'd probably look into something with a higher cardio component. The description for the core conditioning class sounds more like balance training with a bit of muscle toning. 

Check out these instead:

*  [Aerobic circuit training](http://pe.berkeley.edu/class_fitness.html#ACT) (personally, this would be my top choice. The combination of cardio and weights is not only effective, but FUN as well. I'm not sure which is more important - the fact that it *works*, or the fact that it doesn't bore you out of your mind) 
*  [Aerobic training](http://pe.berkeley.edu/class_fitness.html#AC)
*  [Step aerobics](http://pe.berkeley.edu/class_fitness.html#SA) (this is a more choreographed form of exercise, so I don't recommend it if you have two left feet. Albeit, maybe this is a moot point, because I'm not sure if the class is being offered in the spring)
I agree with the other post. Consider swimming, tennis, and dance classes as well. They're more about using your whole body. In addition, the PE classes are pretty relaxed and aren't intense, so don't worry about not being fit enough to keep up. Look into something that looks fun, so that you can keep it up once the semester is over.
I'm planning to re-take swimming (introductory) cause I basically NP it after missing out too much to class (my fault I know). The instructor is superb and tries to make sure you actually know how to swim by the end of semester. Tell me if you're interested in taking it!
I'm currently in Toni Mar's core conditioning class, and I can tell you it's definitely worth taking. It won't help you lose weight, necessarily, like other people have mentioned, but it WILL help you strengthen not only your core but your whole body! Toni is a really nice and uplifting person, and she will work you HARD. I've admittedly been a bit of a careless eater, but even then I'm getting results. If you eat healthy, do cardio at the RSF, and take her class, you'll absolutely see the results you want.
That's exactly what I thought! But I kept listening to my friend... I need to be fit for that class. 

Aerobic circuit training was my second choice! Thanks for the advice :D
Thank you! I was also looking into swimming :)
Would you say that class is more for fit people?
You don't need to be fit for Aerobic Circuit Training. You just need to wake up on time. Source: I took it for 8AM a while back.

I've also taken Intro weightlifting and swimming - none of these classes require you to be fit. They're introductory for a reason. Swimming has been my favorite so far - amazing instructor
Not at all! I'm an average level of ""fit"", in my opinion. There are people in the class much stronger than I, and there are people who I think I am a bit more fit than. On the first assessment in her class (before we started training) I couldn't even do one push-up properly. Today, she had us do 15 asymmetric push-ups x 2 (each rep had one hand or the other elevated), 15 regular push-ups, 15 push-ups with both arms elevated, and 15 push-ups with legs elevated. That sounds pretty crazy, right? It's week 9, and in the last 8 weeks, I have gone from not being able to do 1 push-up to being able to do a significant portion of those 75 reps. I didn't do them all, admittedly, but I did a lot more than I ever thought I could in my life (probably 60 or so of those total 75). She'll get you strong physically AND mentally, no matter what your level is coming into the class. Another thing is, she'll give you exercises and tell you to do x reps, but she lets you go at your own pace. This lets you improve your technique and form, which provides you with a better experience than frantically scrambling to do a ton of reps with bad form. You learn as you go, and you get stronger with each class.
Wow, that sounds amazing! If I wasn't graduating this May I would definitely take it next Fall!"
