Anyone who had Prof. Jun Hu or have taken Histart 34?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i0v1ol/anyone_who_had_prof_jun_hu_or_have_taken_histart/,2020-07-30 14:51:44,Seems like he only started teaching in spring 2020 so I can’t find any reviews. Is he difficult/interesting/anyone have any overall thoughts/advice on this professor or Histart 34 (Arts of China)? Thanks!,"I took HISTART131A (Sacred Arts of China) last semester with him and got an A! 

Honestly did not do much in that class, but just remember to definitely keep up on the readings (i can not stress this enough bc if you don’t you will DIE) + participate in the class by answering and asking questions for easy participation points.

Exams also tend to be pretty heavily based on memorization (remembering art pieces, date of origin, materials, etc), but because of COVID all exams were completely changed to essay answers. I’m guessing this will be the case for Fall????

His lectures are also pretty lecture-heavy since the slides only have photos of the pieces in question. 

Overall wouldn’t say he’s a difficult professor, but do be prepared to put in at least some work if you want that spicy A"
