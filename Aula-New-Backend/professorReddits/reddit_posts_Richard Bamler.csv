Math 1A Midterm Richard Bamler,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17qzkj7/math_1a_midterm_richard_bamler/,2023-11-08 15:55:12,Ok so I've got my midterm for Math 1A with Bamler tomorrow and the first one didn't go good so now I'm scared for this second midterm because my grade relies a lot on it. Does anyone have tips for Bamler's tests/midterms or specific resources I should study?,"[deleted]
Nah imma try my best but like he pulled a fast one on us last time so I wanna know if there are specific things I should do
how was it
Actually pretty good! They curved it well."
Math 1A with Richard Bamler,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13s1ukl/math_1a_with_richard_bamler/,2023-05-25 20:22:18,Just wondering if anyone took Math 1A with Richard Bamler and how your experience was? Is the class really difficult in terms of grading?,
Questions regarding Fall 2023 Math !A with Professor Richard Bamler,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15jmscf/questions_regarding_fall_2023_math_a_with/,2023-08-06 03:57:47,"I have Math 1A with Professor Richard Bamler this Fall. I'm a bit apprehensive since I have a mediocre background in math and no experience in Calculus. I have some questions and inquiries regarding this:

1. For those that have had experience with this Professor (or have heard things from others), any general information would be appreciated- way the class is structured, if you felt the textbook was sufficient to learn the material and how to do well in the class, rigor of grading and curves- anything that you think might be pertinent.
2. If anyone could share a syllabus (unsure if this is against the rules, if so please disregard).
3. This is my first semester at Berkeley, so if anyone has any recommendations on how to progress through this course, I'd appreciate it. How to study for tests, or even just ways to learn the material would be appreciated.
4. If I were to brush up on things that would help with this class in the next two weeks so that I'm at least putting the right foot forward, how should I go about it specifically? I never took pre-calculus. I did do three years of math in high school which may have covered the basics, but I only just scraped by. I have heard tangentially rumors that the class is self-contained, but am unsure if this is true.

Thank you, and feel free to DM as well if that's more your speed.","Don‚Äôt be apprehensive! Go for an online math class and hire a nerd to ace the class for you . Check onlinemathclasshelp. com

Good luck with taking a nononline class after this!"
Song Sun or Richard Bamler for Math 1A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hc6rym/song_sun_or_richard_bamler_for_math_1a/,2020-06-19 12:11:02,"If anyone's taken math 1A or any other class with Prof. Song Sun, how are his lectures? His math 1A section has a really convenient time for me in the fall, and my other option is Prof. Richard Bamler.","Did you pick one? I'm leaning Song Sun but the only review on rate my professors says hes bad. Bamler is apparently super picky and hurts small errors so idk.

I think I'm gonna go with Bamler, he's got more positive reviews and I can make the timing work"
Math 1A Midterm 1 Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/172l9wq/math_1a_midterm_1_advice/,2023-10-07 17:20:28,"Hello, 

Does anyone have advice for the first midterm for Math 1A (class is taught by Professor Richard Bamler). I'm just concerned because no partial credit (for showing work, etc) is possible.",Would appreciate as well. Really nervous for the first one.
Incoming data science freshman schedule. Thoughts or Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xx9lv/incoming_data_science_freshman_schedule_thoughts/,2023-07-12 11:55:32,"1. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler (mixed reviews on RMP but seems like a hard professor), CS 61A with Prof. John Denero (not sure if I‚Äôll enroll as a DS major and with 300 waitlist max), and EPS 7 Climate Change and Computer science mentors (not sure how to enroll in CSM)

2. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler, DATA C8 w/ Prof. Swupnil Sahai, EPS 50 Planet Earth w/ Michael Manga

3. Math 32 (Precalculus) w/ Prof. Rui Wang (bad reviews on RMP but not suer if I should enroll in precalculus since I want to do well in calculus at Cal), CS 10 w/ Dan Garcia (friendlier pace than CS 61A) and some other random GE course

4. Math 32 w/ Prof. Rui Wang (again, has bad reviews on RMP), Data C8, and some random GE.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like. 

Also, could anyone recommend any easy and fun 7-breadth courses? That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",I like the first one with Data 8 instead of EPS 7
Classes: Math1A with Bamler vs Physics 8A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12ts0ri/classes_math1a_with_bamler_vs_physics_8a/,2023-04-20 22:53:54,"Planning to do Chem 3b/3bl and a breadth. For my second technical, I'm debating between physics 8A and math 1A. Did anyone take the math 1A class with Richard Bamler and have any advice (is he an easy grader, etc)? They haven't announced the professor for physics 8A and I haven't done physics in a while so does anyone have any advice on how to do well in that class too?","If you plan on taking physics 8B after 8A, then you should take math 1A first. Physics 8B requires some basic calc but they do not teach it to you so making sure you know that stuff will make it easier. If I remember correctly Physics 8A covers kinematics, dynamics, uniform circular motion, statics, fluids, gravitation, and thermo.

If it helps, I took physics 8A with chem 3b/3BL and and R1B course while working in a lab (~12-16 hours/week) and that schedule was totally manageable.
this was so reassuring to read!! Just a quick question, if you had to choose between chem 3b/3bl and phys 8a or chem 3b/3bl and bio 1a/1al which would you choose? I will also be working in a lab and having a part time job.
I skipped bio 1a/1al (I‚Äôm not premed and I took ap bio) so I‚Äôm not sure what the workload is like. I know a lot of people will take chem 3b and bio 1a together tho! Honestly sometimes I decide my classes based on which schedule has better timing/gives me more time for lab, not sure if this is the best advice tho‚Ä¶"
Math 1A Best Professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hf8vaf/math_1a_best_professor/,2020-06-24 13:33:04,I will be taking math 1A in the fall and have the choice of 2 professors: Richard Bamler and Song Sun. Which one should I take and why?,"I‚Äôve personally never heard of either professor, but I looked both up on ratemyprofessors.com and Bamler seems like the safer pick."
Math 1A Final Spring 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cmv9r8/math_1a_final_spring_2024/,2024-05-07 20:50:22,Hi Bears! I'm interested to know what your opinion was on the Math 1a final today: did you find it extremely difficult to do it within the time given? Did you think the questions were much more rigorous and demanding? ,"nothing is worse then Richard Bamler last sem
didn‚Äôt yall get a cheat sheet for it?
I mean I don‚Äôt think it was extremely difficult but I thought it would be easier ngl lol
True
It‚Äôs giving you failed 1aüòç
i did not
Then stfu
it‚Äôs okay if u did"
please rate my schedule! incoming freshman pre haas.,https://i.redd.it/16eocc4zbleb1.png,2023-07-27 16:18:35,,"Prehaas as in admitted for haas or trying to transfer in? I‚Äôm not sure what the policy is now, but  I heard they changed somethings restricting transferring. 

Either way, I recommend either Econ 1 or UGBA10, just to get a feel of the major and hit some of the prereq‚Äôs. If you took AP Econ in hs, Econ 1 should be very doable. UGBA10 may require more time in my experience, but still a very freshman-friendly class.
you should take another prereq class
slavic 45 fucks and barskova is great, excellent choice
[deleted]
Personally I didn‚Äôt take Econ 2, but I have friends who did really well in hs Econ but still struggled a lot in Econ 2‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd recommend waiting for next semester to do Econ 1. Can you try to get in UGBA10? Or if not see if you can do data8 or stat20 for the stats requirement.

Also, I believe haas opened their program to a 4-year experience, so L&S students may no longer be able to transfer in the future. Whether your class was the cutoff or the class after you, I‚Äôm not clear, so for the sake of not providing misinfo I‚Äôd recommend looking into it more, or waiting for someone who is more familiar with the topic to answer"
freshman mcb major schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14he1z2/freshman_mcb_major_schedule/,2023-06-23 17:07:19,"thoughts on this schedule?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l1upzv4uxu7b1.png?width=1958&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbc886faabae3b0a109492e12ed5703dbb2d6834","At least to me, this is definitely doable & a fairly light course load. I had Alexis Shusterman for chem3BL and I really enjoyed learning from her. I also had Michelle Douskey, she's taught chem1AL for a while now and knows how to teach it well. Usually chem1a isn't too bad. Having lab in the middle of the day is also pretty ideal. The only thing I dislike about it is the 9am lectures, but if you're an early riser you should be fine (if not, lectures are typically recorded iirc).

I can't speak about the other classes since I've never taken them. But Math1A is just Calculus up to derivatives I think? So it's pretty easy. 

Overall, I think this is a good first schedule for a freshman (13 units), you have a lot of time free in the evenings for any clubs/extra-curriculars you might want to get into, you also have the flexibility to take most decals if you find yourself interested in them. Another perk of having evenings free is that most midterms for Chem1A are at like 7pm? You also have this big chunk of time in the middle of each day for lunch, Office Hours, etc.

Hope this helps :)
Typical for very 1st semester. Have backup discussions/labs ready for chem and math. These fill up quickly during enrollment time.
extremely standard schedule
Schedule looks fine to me. I just want to mention that for some people (namely myself) I find it really hard to focus when I have random gaps in my schedule. I had a lot of 1 hour breaks in between my schedule during my freshman year and it was honestly the worst since I personally could not seem to do anything productive during that 1 hour gap between classes. So if you‚Äôre that type of person, I‚Äôd recommend trying work around that.

Also, for your math class, I know MCB prefers Math 10 series since it teaches stats and stuff, but to my knowledge Math 1 series is accepted by more majors so it might be easier to swap majors if that‚Äôs something u want to consider. Maybe take a look at the course load/topics and compare between Math 1 and Math 10
chillin
Also a freshman! How did you check your enrollment time?
Douskey is great for 1AL, the schedule seems doable but stacking math and chem may be challenging, I got a NP in 10a my first semester but I‚Äôm not sure how the rigor of 1A compares. Good luck!
Looks like you are ending up jobless after college
this helps soo much üôèüèª thank you
which class would you say is more popular, 16A or 1A? i got screwed over with a 12 pm enrollment time
if you go to cal central, you should see your time next to phase 1 under the ‚Äúmy academics‚Äù tab
how üò≠
that‚Äôs not even a bad enrollment time üíÄ
It‚Äôs not a matter of popularity, it‚Äôs major dependent.  If you‚Äôre contemplating at all being in any of any math heavy majors - CS, DS, Stats, Math, IB, MCB, Chem, Physics, any Eng or Chem major, don‚Äôt even think about the Math 16 series. You pretty much eliminate yourself from those majors once you take this series.
Depends on your major. 16a is lighter but most advise 1a being accepted by most majors and grad schools.
ah i see now, thank you! I got 12:20 üòì
Troll
i‚Äôm gonna be on a flight at 12 pm üíÄ
i‚Äôm premed so 16a works but i was asking in terms of how fast the classes fill up
Get Wi-Fi on the plane if you can
Freshman enrollment is assigned for two days. Halfway into the first day, your desired discussion & lab may be full so will have to look for different time slots. By the 2nd half of the 2nd day I believe the waitlist is available only."
How manageable is this freshman BioE schedule?,https://i.redd.it/52r7ciwgvhkb1.jpg,2023-08-26 11:04:23,"17 units, but 2 classes are both 1 unit seminar classes, so 15 units","seminars are always chill, and 15 units is fairly manageable. that being said i‚Äôm not in stem so idk how well my advice transfers here lol. good luck!
Pretty good and balanced üëç!"
