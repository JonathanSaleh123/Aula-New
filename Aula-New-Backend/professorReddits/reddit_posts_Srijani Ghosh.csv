I’m looking for an easy R1B class with no exams. Also, which of the instructors should I go with?","I took my r1b with sima and thought she was great!! Workload was super light with a final paper at the end which was basically graded on completion
Thanks, this sounds like just what I need then !
was attendance mandatory?
I think it was technically optional but it would help towards ur participation grade if u went to class"
Srijani Ghosh for R1B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gmyr4i/srijani_ghosh_for_r1b/,2020-05-19 15:24:11,"has anyone had Srijani Ghosh for R1B over the summer, and if so, how was her class? I'm just hoping to take an easy and interesting R1B class over summer... all the english classes at my CC are full and I'm on the waitlist so trying to make a decision soon ://","She's great! Had her the previous spring so I can't speak to how it might be online/over the summer, but I really enjoyed her class. Very discussion heavy and relatively light workload. The readings were pretty enjoyable too.

Really depends how well you can write and construct an argument, since the majority of your grade is performances on papers."

Help me decide course for R&C part A Requirement,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h7vxth/help_me_decide_course_for_rc_part_a_requirement/,2020-06-12 16:40:25,"Hi, I'm an incoming freshman and am really excited to be at Berkeley. Can someone help me choose between the following to fulfil my R&C part A Requirement? There are just so many options and many of them seem interesting so I'm looking for first or second hand experiences in these courses or some advice for them-

1. English R1A — Identity as Performance (**Srijani Ghosh**)

2. Rhetoric R1A — Homo Scribens, or What Is Human?  What Is Writing? (**Kirsten A Schwartz**)

3. South and Southeast Asian Studies R5A — Humans and Animals in Indian Epics (**Abhijeet Paul**)","[removed]
In the absence of any reviews, I would 1) go on BerkeleyTime and see which class for that same teacher had the highest historical GPA average 2) pick the one that fits your schedule the best 3) send a note to each lecturer, and the person with the best response wins.  Some suggestions.  

You probably want to have a few of the options loaded in your shopping cart anyways.  There’s a high degree of possibility that some of your choices will be filled up by the time it is your turn to register.
take rhetoric r1a with ikeda/Lau. super easy but rewarding class!!!

Ordinarily what you say makes sense.  There’s only one English RxA/B course that fulfills a breadth, and that is CLASSICS R44.  However, from what some people are saying and posting, it’s a pretty high workload class that isn’t worth the buy one get one free price tag.
thank you!
thank you!"
