Espm 173 (DeValpine) vs Stat 131a,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2nplb/espm_173_devalpine_vs_stat_131a/,2022-04-13 04:01:01,"I need to take one of these classes in Fall 2022. De Valpine is teaching Espm 173 and I haven’t heard a lot about him but his RMP isn’t great... 

I’ve taken Data 8 and done pretty well, but I’m curious how much math is involved in Stat 131a. If anyone’s taken either of these classes (or any class with De Valpine), how was it?",
