espm 2 or 6- any recs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wa5hxe/espm_2_or_6_any_recs/,2022-07-28 02:45:15,"I'm currently deciding on taking espm 2 or 6 next fall, does anyone have any outstanding information/experiences with either? Both sound interesting to me, so I'm not particularly biased towards either. Would love to hear input!","espm2 with dennis baldocchi? i loved that class!! he understands the majority of the class are underclassmen and he strives to keep yall engaged. he knows mostly everyone there is in CNR or L/S so he also stays on top of the cnr business when it comes to internships and fellowships! take him when u can <3
I'm also taking ESPM 2
Espm6 if you want an A
is espm 6 easy?"
