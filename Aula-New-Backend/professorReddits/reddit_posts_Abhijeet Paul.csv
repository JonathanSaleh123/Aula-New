Really great professor.
Help me decide course for R&C part A Requirement,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h7vxth/help_me_decide_course_for_rc_part_a_requirement/,2020-06-12 16:40:25,"Hi, I'm an incoming freshman and am really excited to be at Berkeley. Can someone help me choose between the following to fulfil my R&C part A Requirement? There are just so many options and many of them seem interesting so I'm looking for first or second hand experiences in these courses or some advice for them-

1. English R1A — Identity as Performance (**Srijani Ghosh**)

2. Rhetoric R1A — Homo Scribens, or What Is Human?  What Is Writing? (**Kirsten A Schwartz**)

3. South and Southeast Asian Studies R5A — Humans and Animals in Indian Epics (**Abhijeet Paul**)","[removed]
In the absence of any reviews, I would 1) go on BerkeleyTime and see which class for that same teacher had the highest historical GPA average 2) pick the one that fits your schedule the best 3) send a note to each lecturer, and the person with the best response wins.  Some suggestions.  

You probably want to have a few of the options loaded in your shopping cart anyways.  There’s a high degree of possibility that some of your choices will be filled up by the time it is your turn to register.
take rhetoric r1a with ikeda/Lau. super easy but rewarding class!!!

Ordinarily what you say makes sense.  There’s only one English RxA/B course that fulfills a breadth, and that is CLASSICS R44.  However, from what some people are saying and posting, it’s a pretty high workload class that isn’t worth the buy one get one free price tag.
thank you!
thank you!"
