Cog Sci Major Schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/103qfrw/cog_sci_major_schedule/,2023-01-04 21:16:35,"Is this a good schedule or is this too busy? Any advice would be appreciated

Both classes are proof-based! I would take 12A in a future semester and replace it with another upper div category instead. I'm taking cogsci 144 for my linguistics req this spring and i heard it's easier than ling 100 so there's also that!!
I can’t speak much to 55 or Philos 12A as I took other classes for those reqs but I have heard 12A has good fundamental logic that is helpful if you want some background for 55 or CS courses. I would guess 55 is likely to be the hardest out of all of these.

Psych C61 work load depends on how much reading you are willing to do since that is most of the work. Get ready to memorize a lot of information. I found Ling 100 to be a pretty manageable class and I’ve found that linguistics grad students and course staff are incredibly helpful.

This seems doable, especially with how much time you have between classes T/Th. Just take advantage of all the resources they offer.
Are you doing ok? alive still?"
