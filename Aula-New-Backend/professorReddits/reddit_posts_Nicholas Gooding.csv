"Considering the president of UPenn (Liz Magill) is facing calls for resignation and Berkeley is in need of a new chancellor, if she does resign should Berkeley hire her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18e3ati/considering_the_president_of_upenn_liz_magill_is/,2023-12-08 18:27:45,Or would it be bad optics if she was hired considering the lawsuits from jewish organization against this university for alleged antisemitism. Would she make a good chancellor? The last time we had a chancellor from an Ivy League institution (Nicholas B. Dirks) he was not well received.,"Lizzie McGuire is a better candidate
I’m going  with “fuck no” on this one.
Is she mentioned *anywhere by anybody other than you* as a possible candidate for Chancellor at Berkeley?  

If not, then why are you asking this question?  

Should we discuss whether Berkeley should have Elon Musk, or Volodymyr Zelenskyy, or Taylor Swift as the next Chancellor? That would make the same amount of sense. 

I feel like your post comes fairly close to violating the spirit of #2 on the r/berkeley rules, *""Abnormally Excessive and Overt Trolling.""*

(Also, ""Berkeley"" doesn't hire the Chancellor. The UC Regents--who oversee a ten-campus system--do the selection.)
You don't have to hire a chancellor of another university
Absolutely not. I think the chancellor of Berkeley should be anti-genocide.
Even though I absolutely hate what the Iserali government is doing to the Palestinians, I have to admit Berkeley accepting her is going to destroy our already small ass endowment. Sad to admit but there are a lot of rich Zionist Jews out there that basically run the world, and you're going to financial burned if you go up against them oof.
I can excuse antisemitism, genocide, and the fact that Ivys suck balls if we can keep our Berkeley emails
We can’t afford it
![gif](giphy|hds923o2jMwLK)
Did she actually endorse genocide? I'm surprised she getting all the heat but not president Gay or the MIT president who basically said the same thing.
Wow, you came to the right conclusion (not to hire her) based on — even by the standards of this subreddit — shockingly antisemitic reasoning. 

Pro-tip: just swapping out the word “Jew” for “Zionist” while espousing rhetoric lifted from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is still antisemitic.
I figured, the Helen Diller Anchor House and Weill hall aren't going to pay for themselves.
Thank you Ali Ben hatethejews
She said that advocating for genocide against Jewish students doesn’t count as bullying or harassment, and there should not be any consequences for it. And she smiled while saying it.

I think they’re all getting a lot of heat, as they should be.
That is not what she said. She said, ""If it is directed and severe, pervasive, it is harassment."" This is the standard the Supreme Court set in *Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education*.
Didn't she say it depends on the context in the sense that some may consider the phrase, ""From River to the Sea"" to be a call for genocide, while others may see it like Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter doesn't mean All Lives or White Lives don't matter.
We’re saying the same thing. She said that some calls for genocide of Jews is not bullying or harassment.
This is the same slick technicalities the nazi had when they first started lmfao. You’re fucking terrible.
They didn’t ask her about a sea chant. They asked about genocide.
Ok, I will defend your current paraphrase. Stefanik's line of questioning, much like the questioning of nominated judges, was designed to trap the college presidents into saying something that sounds egregious by posing a class of scenarios (""calling for the genocide of Jews"") and asking them to making a universal ruling on this class independent of the facts of the case. Under the principles of case law, which colleges' arbitration systems are based on, colleges look at the specific facts of the case and establish whether or not they meet previously established tests for meeting the definition of the accused violation. The colleges have not previously ruled that ""calls for genocide"" are a class of scenarios that in itself establishes a test for whether a student has committed ""harassment."" This is for good reason, since ""calls for genocide"" is an ill-defined test.

But you disagree with this last assertion; ""call for genocide"" sounds well-defined enough for Magill to answer this question. I say it is not. Suppose the code of conduct or previous rulings have in fact established that ""calls for genocide"" are punishable. Surely, this rule would go beyond someone saying the exact phrase ""I call for the genocide of [insert group]."" Then, the question becomes, how do you determine what constitutes a ""call for genocide?"" Does displaying a swastika, with no other context, count as a call for genocide for Jews? (Keep in mind, this is a religious symbol for many.) What about displaying the flag of Hamas or Iran, who call for the genocide of Jews, or the United States, which undoubtedly has committed genocide against Native Americans? I would say denying the existence of trans people is ""genocidal""; should students be punished for expressing this if is not directed to an individual? You may think there are clear answers to which of these constitutes ""genocidal speech,"" but you are not the one making these decisions. Ultimately, such an restriction on speech itself inherently requires administrators to police beliefs, and this violates the liberties of those who hold beliefs that don't align with administrators.
The ""technicality"" that determines when advocating for violence is protected speech in the US was established in *Brandenburg v. Ohio* 54 years ago. Could you point me to which genocides this ""technicality"" has caused in those 54 years?
yes and as was just explained to you she explained that context was needed as some people would consider saying “From the river to the sea” to be a call for genocide.
You’re making this way more complicated than it really is. “Denying the existence of trans people” is not a call for genocide (although I do think it’s wrong and harmful). Calling for genocide is when you want to exterminate a huge number of people of a certain race. There will still be arguments about what counts as a call for genocide, but I don’t think it’s as wishy washy as you imply. We know what genocide is, we’ve seen it happen many times throughout history.
The issue is she acted like she was in an academic setting discussing the intricacies of the first amendment when she was actually on the set of a political ad. That miscalculation is enough to get her booted.
No. They didn’t ask if “a chant that could be considered a call for genocide” was allowed. They asked incredibly clearly: is a call for genocide allowed.
It's not complicated...

Some (most) calls for genocide are not bullying or harassment. She gave the right answer.
yes… and the chancellor broke it down into cases saying direct calls for genocide are unacceptable. Stop with your victim mentality. Everything you are saying should be condemned was condemned.
“I think you’re fat”: bullying

“I think you and your family and your whole race should be exterminated, systematically executed. I will advocate for a second holocaust against you”: not bullying

That’s really how you feel about this issue?
Calls for genocide were not condemned, and I think they should have been. Advocating genocide should count as bullying, in fact it’s about a thousand times worse than bullying. Most people are in agreement about that, but elite university leaders disagree.
No it isn't. Because that's not correct, since both are targeted at an individual. If either of them were a one time comment it would be allowed, but persistent comments like that could be harassment.

And again, most calls for genocide (""Death to the Jews,"" ""Wipe Israel off the map,"" ""All Israealis should die"") aren't bullying or harassment.
Frankly it doesn't matter what most people think, under the law it usually isn't.
I think there’s nothing more to say then. You and I have very different understandings of bullying.
There’s no law about what’s bullying and what isn’t. This is about elite colleges’ student codes of conduct, it’s not about the law.
I'm explaining what harassment and other forms of unprotected speech are under the law. I haven't given you my personal ""understanding"" at all.
>There’s no law about what’s bullying and what isn’t.

There absolutely is.

>This is about elite colleges’ student codes of conduct, it’s not about the law.

It's about both. As well as their interaction with each other.
You’re totally misunderstanding the fundamentals. They didn’t ask her if such speech was illegal. They asked if it would be tolerated at Harvard, and she said yes. Harvard is not the government, the law was never in question.
What law is there about bullying? Bullying is legal. Trump does it 24/7, and that’s not what any of these indictments are about.
> They asked if it would be tolerated at Harvard, and she said yes. 

Stefanik asked if such speech warranted discipline for bullying and harassment under their codes of conduct, and the college presidents clarified that the speech in question would be disciplined if it rises to the level of the definitions of bullying and harassment in their codes; i.e. ""directed, severe, pervasive."" The definition these universities use is based on the Davis standard, in the interest of affording their students the same rights as those at public universities.

Drawing on the examples that you claim are harassment, do you think that the following examples of speech, in themself, constitute harassment?

""I believe that all states that have religious references in their names should be wiped off the map and replaced with a fundamentally different government whose constitution has a version of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Israel should be wiped off the map. The Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan should be wiped off the map as well.""

""I hope the Ukrainians kill every one of those goddamn Russians for encroaching on their territory.""
Getting rid of a country isn’t necessarily genocide, that could be renaming or changing borders. Killing all Russian soldiers wouldn’t be genocide. Killing all Russian civilians would be genocide.

Any genocide is obviously harassment. I think it’s pretty clear that the Nazis “harassed” the Jews (it feels ridiculous to say that, harassment is such a weak word for it, but still too strong for university presidents somehow).
> Getting rid of a country isn’t necessarily genocide

Yes, it isn't necessarily, but people will most often read the phrasing ""Wipe Israel off the map"" as a call for genocide. My point is that context matters.

> Killing all Russian soldiers wouldn’t be genocide. Killing all Russian civilians would be genocide.

Yes, but the example I gave didn't specify ""only soldiers."" ""For encroaching on their territory"" is merely a justification and not necessarily a qualifier for who ""kill"" applies to. I could just as well interpret it as ""kill all Russians in retaliation for the invasion."" I'm sure if you replaced ""Ukrainians"" with ""Hamas"" and ""Russians"" with ""Jews"" with the same wording, people would read it to mean ""all Jews"" instead of ""just the IDF."" My point is that, even when what constitutes genocide is clear, there is ambiguity in what constitutes a *call* for genocide.

> Any genocide is obviously harassment. 

Yes, obviously genocide is much worse than harassment. But the question was about *calling* for genocide. Calling for violence is not violence. If I say ""I support the IDF in killing Hamas members,"" I am not personally killing Hamas members.
Hitler didn’t actually kill any Jews. He just *supported* the killing of Jews. When it comes to genocide, I think supporters are guilty (morally if not legally). Obviously it’s not exactly that simple, there’s a spectrum: ignoring, tolerating, supporting, assisting, ordering, and actually doing it. 

I think we shouldn’t tolerate genocide supporters in our universities though, there are enough underprivileged students who actually value human life and would very much appreciate their spot."
CS 61C Goes Online-Only,https://i.redd.it/fzks165zjnl41.png,2020-03-09 06:53:17,,"OK, it took effectively 4 minutes between posting and someone crossposting this to /r/berkeley...  Why am I not surprised.
thanks nicholas
This instructor is a hero.
I respect the necessity of such a move for health reasons

However I must be honest for myself and some students in the class that basically lived in office hours and are heavily struggling this is absolutely TERRIFYING since I’m not sure how this might affect the capacity of help to be received since we can’t get any face to face contact or group help on concept issues.

I know it needed to happen but I’m super scared to be very real, I was already only on the cusp of passing the class :/
I think the biggest downside is if students can’t ask each other small questions because that’s one of the things that makes office hours most useful
There’s a cruise ship with confirmed COVID-19 cases that’s about to dock in Oakland. Shit is about to start.
Just wanted to say thanks, Nick. This is a good move and I think we all appreciate it.
Wish my professors were taking the same initiative to keep students and the larger community safe. Glad we still have people like you!
We should be surprised there hasn't been a bot made yet...
He's alright. 😂
We are going to try to move office hours into an online-form.  Hopefully since I'll have the same queue as everoyne else office hours will be even better for me
Indeed that is one of our biggest concerns.  I think its going to be a mass of breakout rooms and otehr things for a virtual ""project party"" this week...
[deleted]
I hope it ends up being effective, and I respect this transition as something necessary. I shouldn’t judge the outcome of how resources are before I see them either, I suppose it was just an initial reaction from fear. Thank you for looking after the health of students so seriously.
Oh that’s good"
[RANT] To the Honest Kids: Don't Take MCB 102 if it's Online or Not Proctored.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kmge4y/rant_to_the_honest_kids_dont_take_mcb_102_if_its/,2020-12-29 07:25:19,"Disclaimer: this post is not directed to ANY persons in the class as it is merely a rant.

The biggest takeaway from MCB 102 in Fall 2020 is that being an honest student only places you in a disadvantaged position.

Let's start by introducing the structure of this class: the average is curved to a B-, there are 3 midterms (third midterm = final), the class is curved, meaning that your final grade in the class depends on how your classmates do in the class (duh), and it's a class filled with premed students. Last but not least and perhaps most importantly, the class is NOT proctored (as in you download the exam.pdf and you have 2 hours to complete it with no other proctoring devices at all). There are basically 3 sections in the class, with a different professor responsible for each section

Now, let's get to the main point.

During the first section, we were given weekly quizzes on the Sapling software (basically an assignment software similar to the Pearson homework softwares). That said, all the answers are basically on Chegg (good job to those with $15/month to spare). In addition, the instructor specifically told us that the quizzes should be closed-book and NO collaboration is allowed. Also worth noting is that partial credits do not exist on Sapling. If you missed one subquestion (i.e. fill in the blank, drag this label to the picture, etc.), you get the whole question wrong. 0% credit. Now, an interesting phenomenon was observed: the first quiz had a decently low average (\~50% if I remember correctly), but the averages started to rise to around 80% starting on the second quiz (4 in total). 80% average on quizzes that offer NO partial credit in a class of approximately 450 students. Hmmm, convincing. Even the professor knew something was up, but of course, she had no way of catching who the cheaters were, let alone assigning the grades fairly. And then there's me, with a 50% quiz average lol.

On our first midterm, the average was 41%. It was an impossible test, and even cheating wouldn't have helped. This was the exam that I was able to score decently well on (\~ +1std). On the second and third midterm, the averages were close to fucking 70%, and I have only been able to score a few points above the average (not even +0.5std). ~~Now that the final grade is coming out, I already know I'll most likely end with a C+/B-, since the professors already insisted that the average will be designated as a B-.~~ (Ended with a B+).

Obviously, I am in no place of claiming how much cheating occurred. However, it would also be ignorant to claim that there is no cheating in a competitive premed-filled, curved-based, med school-prerequisite class. (Lmao, there's this girl who texted the MCB 102 group chat on Facebook Messenger LITERALLY DURING EXAM TIME (-\_\_\_-) and proceeded to unsend the message right after).

I just don't get it, why don't the professors proctor the exams? I have done very well in all my classes (even more difficult than MCB 102 imo) that require any sort of proctoring measures. Someone  suggested proctoring services to be implemented for the final, but it was ignored by the staff and dismissed by the students apparently due to ""syllabus"" issues. (The staff virtually ignored EVERY student's administrative concern posed on Piazza. The lack of communication was terrifying, and the students were literally ignored. Not exaggerating, ignored.) There are simply so many ways to cheat during the exam: collaboration with other peers, help from private tutors ($$$), friend/family with Biochemistry background, or different timezone kids receiving the tests before their designated test time. And when the professor announced that she will be conducting cheating investigations during Thanksgiving break, the same group chat mentioned above went OFF about how this is difficult for their mental health and it's unfair. Like, wait, if you didn't cheat, why are you even worried? Shouldn't you be happy that the professor is taking her time to find the cheaters so that your grade can ideally go up? What? These kids even started talking about the possibility of reporting said professor to the dean and the MCB department, like, BRO. Y'all sus as hell, just saying. Y'all sus as hell.

Sure, I could have studied more and dedicated more time to MCB 102 (although the required thicc reading every other day was well beyond the designated credits), but I simply cannot accept the grade. I can't take it. I simply cannot believe the score to be the accurate representation of my learning outcomes in this class.

Now, to all y'all cheaters who helped inflate the averages, remember that y'all can't cheat on the MCAT, and that's when the medical school admissions will realize YOUR grade is NOT an accurate representation of YOUR learning outcomes in this class. Watch me make a comeback on the MCAT Biochemistry section.

Lastly, to the 3 professors: I loved the lectures and the effort put into helping us understand the subject. It was truly unfortunate that I was not able to take this class with you in person. As stressful as this semester was, I still loved the subject. For that, I thank all of you whole-heartedly.

PEACE!

***Update***: to those taking MCB 102 in the future, the CS 161 professor u/NicholasWeaver has replied below saying that he will contact the MCB 102 faculty and share his proctoring methods ([click here for set-up demonstration](https://cs161.org/sample-setups)), which was super easy to follow and causes no stress setting up :)) Stay optimistic, all! (Ignore the CS/EECS tag, showed up as soon as I tagged Prof. Weaver, sorry xd)",">Now, to all y'all cheaters who helped inflate the averages, remember that y'all can't cheat on the MCAT, and that's when the medical school admissions will realize YOUR grade is NOT an accurate representation of YOUR learning outcomes in this class. 

Not to support cheating, but this is a somewhat rosy picture of things. The world doesn't really have that kind of karmic justice built into it. 

Especially at a competitive school like Berkeley, you see more of what I'd call ""push over the edge"" cheating. Many people *do* study, and *also* cheat. It's not an either/or thing. You study as best as you can, then you also cheat on the exams/quizzes, because it's not like getting a lower grade makes you learn more than you already could have. 

And even if you were, for some reason, doomed to have a shitty MCAT score, Good GPA + Bad MCAT > Bad GPA + Bad MCAT. 

All this is to say, it's really on the course staff to crack down on cheating. No amount of arguments to the nature ""well, you're *really* cheating yourself!"" is going to change anything because to be honest, that's not really true, it's only applicable in the extreme case where you just slack off the entire time and cheat to pass, which are also not the people you should be worrying about mucking up the curve. 

The incentives are aligned that cheating is profitable, and as a result, people are going to cheat, a lot, unless course staff make it harder.
I took MCB 102 over the summer and had no friends in the class since it was online. To be honest I found it very difficult, but at the end of the course over 11 percent of the class got caught cheating/for collusion and as a result all of our grades went up a half mark (B- to a B, for example) a few weeks after the course concluded. I know this is a frustrating phenomenon, and I feel you OP. But there’s also nothing to do about it except maintain personal dignity and be happy with your efforts
Hey, I was in the same MCB 102 class as OP this semester and what OP said is 100% legit. OP didn't even touch on the fact that the first midterm literally had a whole multi-part question on a topic that the professor said in lecture would not be on the exam. The midterm didn't reflect the content we learned for her portion and the rubric also took off points for needless shit. To give you perspective, this first midterm was out of 100 points and the staff had to make it out of 71 points because of how screwed the average was. To anyone thinking about taking MCB 102, avoid taking it with Professor Merchant. However, I will say that our final professor, Ross Wilson, was an amazing teacher and also a great person. He was the only professor who didn't give us a needlessly long or unfair exam. Anyway, thanks to anyone who read this rant. MCB 102 was a shit show during the Fall 2020 semester.
Took MCB 102 last spring as it was transitioning to online. Was a shit show then and annoyed to see that they didn't improve it after us and an entire summer. 

Some perspective, MCB 102 is a **survey** of biochemistry and molecular biology. They basically smashed MCB 100A, MCB 100B, and MCB 110 into one semester, dividing the semester up into 3 parts. So basically, you're learning three semesters worth of content in one semester. Obviously, you don't learn as much as you would if you took the three classes, but it's still an overwhelming amount of content. 

MCB 102 came about after premed starting complaining that the three courses MCB 100AB, 110 were overkill for being a doctor and wanted an alternate option. My theory is that the admin and professors were so annoyed that they had to dumb down their curriculum for premed that they decided to curve it to a B-, which is freaking ridiculous given that almost everyone wants an A-/A. +1SD would give you a B+, which is frankly does not look good for getting into medical school. 

I understand the anger of admin over MCB 102 and premed in general though. I think professors genuinely understand that doctors and premeds are important, but it must be extremely frustrating to have your students only care about getting good grades instead of actually learning their material, and seeing a lot of money and attention taken away from doing basic research to accommodate the massive amounts biology students that are premed. I think this is ultimately the fault of med schools prioritizing grades even though GPA is widely based on university and also our culture of not valuing basic researchers in both on the financial side and culturally. I hate that just because you like biology you feel that you basically have to become a doctor since becoming a researcher/academic is so financially difficult and there is like no available jobs anyways. 

I think they should ban curves for all online classes and just do bins, and make the exams as hard as they want, with the intend of adjusting bins up if necessary (like they did in MCB 112).
I think people hate on online proctoring way too much. Two of my classes had zoom proctoring this semester, and it really wasn't that bad. It's also the only way to make online exams have any kind of legitimacy.

It's honestly shocking that the MCB department won't do this for premed classes. There's much, much more of an incentive to cheat in premed courses than in CS upper divs.
Sounds a hell of a lot like Econ 101B with Prof Schoefer lmao

No proctored exams, average for the midterm was around an 85%, lots of cheating, the works...
lol imagine MCAT biochem being as hard as Berkeley biochem
Thanks for the insight, OP! I'm planning to take MCB 102 next semester and this helped me understand what I'll be up against...
I’m taking it next semester and I’m kind of worried now lol. Did the course staff say anything about how they will improve this? Do you have any tips to survive the class?
[deleted]
ah i'm so sorry op, it sounds like you put in a lot of hard work. i'm kind of scared now because i plan on taking mcb 102 in fall 2021, so i'm just hoping that classes are in-person by then although i'm not confident they will be. but yeah dw i think u r going to do great on the mcat, and i hope the mcb department starts implementing proctoring soon !
I’m sorry op. It does suck. You are very smart (hell you’re at BERKELEY) and it must be so frustrating to know your grade doesn’t reflect your ability. 

Not to sound pessimistic, but If someone really wanted to cheat, they’d find a way even if the test is proctored. I think due to remote learning, it’s just much easier to cheat. In person classes at least make it very hard IMO to cheat on tests. Tbh I think we have to deal with cheaters for this upcoming remote spring semester. 

Also think about it this way. The people in this class, like you said, are pre med, meaning they want to become doctors/vets/health care professionals. When they have their job, they will literally be working with life and death. Cheating in this class is not only dumb, but also put future patients at risk. You will be a great doctor/vet/health care professional because you are learning exactly what you are supposed to, without cheating.
Sounds like you got a dose of reality my friend. People cheat in real life. Hard work isn’t always rewarded. You had every opportunity other students did to take advantage of the resources around you and willingly chose not to use them, is that really your teachers fault? You had a level playing feel and didn’t come out where you wanted to
You're smart enough to be in a pre-med course, but not smart enough to use a search engine to commit piracy?

[https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=chegg&type=sr%2Cuser](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=chegg&type=sr%2Cuser)

[https://lmgtfy.app/?q=free+chegg+bot](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=free+chegg+bot)

(I'm not encouraging you to cheat. Just telling you there are free ways to obtain chegg answers. Not every cheater is paying $15/month.)
Why anyone who is considering pre-med, who knows GPA matters and is going to be low at Cal, would go to the toughest school in the UC system, is beyond me. You all did this to yourselves.
Yeah you're definitely right on the karmic justice. Guess it was just something I had to say to make myself feel better, since, after all, this is a rant post lmaooo. True that though, I still think the staff is responsible for minimizing the cheating possible.

&#x200B;

Just an afterthought that occurred to me: to become a successful doctor, you HAVE to be confident in your own decisions. This can be observed in the ""all surgeons are cocky and arrogant"" stereotype. As doctors, you won't have time to consult *other* doctors every time you prescribe a medicine or prepare for a surgery. This, in a way, translates to this course: whether you yourself study hard or not, as long as you cheat, it shows that you're not confident in taking the test alone, by yourself, legitimately. You *have* to collaborate with someone else. Now, it begs the question: if you aren't even confident enough to take a biochemistry exam alone, are you sure you'll be confident enough to operate on another human being in the future?
Thanks for the kind words OP! As annoying as this situation is, we should just be proud of ourselves for doing decent while maintaining personal integrity :)
I agree that the first midterm was unreasonable, but it was unreasonable for (hopefully) everyone, thereby rendering it a ""fair"" midterm. I wanted to stress on the more unfair aspect of this class -- cheating. Thanks for the input :) Hopefully the kids next semester will have a much better experience with the staff.
Yeah Merchant is not only a terrible professor with unfair grading policies, she's also unaccommodating and at times downright rude. Only professor at Cal that I've legitimately disliked.
Well said, my friend. This post would not have existed if the grades were based on bins. Keep in mind though, the bins are often adjusted based on the class's performance. Either way, your information on how MCB 102 came about was extremely intriguing as I did NOT know that. Thanks :)
Online proctoring is stressful, that's true, but if done correctly, I do think it successfully reduces the number of cheaters to the minimum.
For real, OP’s going to be in for a nasty surprise when these cheaters end up getting 132 on B/B (and possibly a 517+ on the entire thing) and walk away having suffered no consequences for their dishonesty. I go to a T20 and frankly MCAT B/B has been hilariously easy to study for because Biochem in undergrad was leagues harder. I imagine this is the same case for Berkeley, if not even more exaggerated. In general, MCAT science content is so shallow that it’s a joke to any undergrad coming from a somewhat rigorous university.

Also: I feel you on the January test date. I’m scheduled to test 1/16 and I may just have to see if I can snag a morning spot or if things are looking better in March/April. Ugh. Pisses me off because then I have to keep everything fresh in my mind.
Good luck u/trehalosebear! It's going to be difficult for sure, but if you put in your effort you will be super prepared for the MCAT, I feel. I believe in you <3
The class was with S. Merchant, M. Wildermuth, and R. Wilson. They are all nice lecturers and great professors, but the policy was what made the class unbearable. To answer your first question: they did not specifically say anything. To answer your second question: read the title haha. In all seriousness, just read the textbook mixed with the lecture notes and truly try your best to absorb the content. I'll let someone with a better grade provide better advice lmaoo. Good luck though!
I tell people to consider taking Chem 135 as a biochem class if ochem is more of their thing. I think even the faculty know MCB 102 is a mess since, when I petitioned to take it instead of 102, my faculty advisor seemed to hint that it was a much better alternative.
Honestly, the problem can be solved if the MCB professors have a short chat with the CS professors on how they proctor online exams.

In terms of cheating, I have no solid proof, but only know that it's been happening. Sad. Hopefully the spring semester will be much, much smoother and fairer. Thanks for the advice, I'll pass it on to other students as well :))
Do not be scared! A CS professor (Nick Weaver) just replied to this post saying that he will reach out to the MCB 102 faculty and regarding how CS 161 proctored the exams. That's very good news as I thought CS 161 had one of the greatest proctorings ever :)
Thank you so much for your kind words! Although online learning always contain a higher chance of cheating, I do expect the instructors to minimize that possibility to the minimum. Oh well, hopefully kids in next semester will have a better experience in learning biochemistry :D
>If someone really wanted to cheat, they’d find a way even if the test is proctored. I think due to remote learning, it’s just much easier to cheat.

Sure, and I'd accept that if these were an uncurved class, but it is curved. The more students who take the exam honestly, the more true the curve is and the more fair the resulting grades are. You can obviously still cheat on an exam that requires video recordings or zoom proctoring, but since it's much more difficult you're slightly more likely to get caught you'd see fewer people cheat.
Wooo! Happy cake day by the way :)))
This is somewhat unrelated but I’ve never had a good understanding of what a lot of doctors do or what premed involves— why do they need to take like MCB courses and chem courses and physics courses (not sure if they do)?
You sound like you think you’re smarter and more cunning than everyone around you. Well, as a reality check I’d love to have you in one of my classes next semester. As a GSI I busted several kids for cheating in MCB courses this semester, all of whom clearly thought they were being clever - and it sounds like you need a kick in the proverbial nuts to bring you back to reality, too.
And that's the kind of attitude that causes society to go to shit.

Edited to say: I'm sorry for being rude, but I honestly think your point and attitude are so stupid. Yeah, cheating is problematic because it perversely punishes the honest students. And if your goal as the ""honest"" student is to mitigate the punishment of a bad grade, you can go low too and cheat like the others, and your problem is solved. But that absolutely misses the fundamental problem.

The cheaters in OP's class are planning to become our society's next surgeons, oncologists, and pediatricians. Do you want people with those ethics, people who are willing to cut corners just to achieve a facade of accomplishment, to be operating on your brain, prescribing you medicines for cancer, and taking care of your kids? It's not just about fulfilling your own selfish desire for achievement at any cost. You have a responsibility to society too.
i read ur other comments. ur not being dowvoted bc omg cheaters exist. ur being downvoted bc u have this attitude of cant beat them join them.

with regards to quizzes and exams the rules are laid out openly and explicitly.  with job hunt analogy that is not knowing the rules of the game. corporation wants someone who is qualified enough will work for them for a while. well connected friends and family are more likely to stick with the ship for longer. overqualified more likely to be unhappy and leave early.
I mean, it is the professors' duty to ensure a fair testing environment (peep the CS professors and their extreme proctoring). I do agree with you that this is just a smol reflection of life and there will always be cheaters, though.
Please continue cheating so future course staffs catch you and you get a permanent mark on your transcript!
Lmfao what a loser. Imagine blaming people for not cheating.
""Had every opportunity other students did"" bruh even as someone who has friends who ask me for/offer quiz answers all the time, making friends who cheat isn't an equal opportunity lol. Not all of us have time during a pandemic to network for the sole purpose of cheating, pls
You're life is going to be so painful in the future. Not only for the people around you, but for yourself as well. Can't imagine being stuck with your personality. To know that everyday you drudge through your miserable life you'll have to see your own face in the mirror, or hear your own voice, or smell your own breath makes me so so happy. You are stuck with yourself forever, my guy. Maybe make it a more pleasant experience?
Ok fine, this is impressive and definitely am not smart enough to know these existed hahaha.
I am proud of you young man. You learned a very important life lesson. This kind of stuff is very common in academia. Yea, very unfortunate but, it is just kind of the way the world works. There is too much money on the line. Now when i was younger i used to raise hell and really try to do the right thing. If you do this people will sabotage you and make your life difficult.
Agreed, thanks for making this post too. Hopefully it shines some light for people taking the course next semester
Yeah. In my opinion, the lectures in the class are fine, tbh. It was the policy that failed my trust for the class.
Lmao your name checks out
Online proctoring is hard but doable.  CS161 is probably going to be a guide for online proctoring going forward.  I'll be sure to reach out to the MCB 102 faculty in particular next semester.
ugh mood gl with last few weeks of studying!!
Thank you so much!! I'll work hard haha
Thank you!
Thx! I didn’t even notice until you pointed it out lol
Basically, doctors need to understand disease enough to diagnose (meaning identify what the disease is) and prescribe a treatment plan. To do this, they need to have a very deep understanding on biochemistry and other basic sciences. There are a lot of other health care providers called mid-levels, like nurses, NPs, PAs, who are also really important, but the difference is that doctors are supposed to have a much deeper understanding of the science, which is supposed to improve their outcomes.
Specifically for being premed, it means intending on applying to and attending medical school. Most medical schools have about the same course requirements including, gen chem, ochem, biochem, physics, math, english, and behavioral science.
A lot of medical schools have prerequisite courses like gen chem, biochem, physics, etc. as a way to weed out people and as a GPA assessment (when you apply to med schools you have a science courses GPA in addition to your overall GPA). A lot of MCB major prereqs line up with med school prereqs so that's why you see a lot of premeds gravitate towards it.
Are you trying to say that cheating doesn’t happen in real life?
Well said, my guy! Bravo :D
Read your name and almost did a double take return of the king moment... rip hornyasianbro
Man imagine being this salty to someone who states an objective truth that life isn’t fair lol. Hope you can find happiness in something other than crying on the internet someday my dude
Young person
Waiting for a brave soldier to post this on Overheard on FB ;)
Thank you so much! CS 161's proctoring model was very easy and caused no stress while setting up. This makes me feel so much better! <3
Thanks! Good luck to you too.
Like I said I really don’t know anything about the field (thankfully only interacted with primary care doctors, eye doctors and general surgeons), but do they use any chemistry or physics knowledge regularly?
Yeah so I guess my question is why do the med schools have those requirements then?
Not at all. I’m just saying that someone as brazen and cocky as you seem to be is going to get their comeuppance one day, and I’m sure you’ll think it’s “not fair” when you do.
Calling out people who suck is more fun and invigorating than you think. Try it on yourself sometime. And if you want, it doesn't have to be over the internet! 

I'm up here in Berkeley so we could always do it in person!
They have [https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2463747343921321&set=gm.889712348512928](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2463747343921321&set=gm.889712348512928)
Solid chem background is nice for bio stuff--allows you to not just handwave everything away as vague""molecular/chemical interactions""

Physics isn't as necessary except for maybe medical imaging but the requirement is sort of tradition at this point. More of a ""are our students not completely numerically incompetent"" requirement than an intellectual ""you need this to be a good doctor"" requirement
I think the given reason is that the courses are supposed to assess applicants' understanding of fundamentals like with bio and chem, though since this varies by institution the MCAT is supposed to be the equalizer. Not everyone who applies is a bio major either so it's helpful to have at least some basic benchmark. And like I mentioned earlier it's probably just another way to weed out people and bring down the potential number of applicants to a more manageable level.
So on a serious note, do you genuinely think that people don’t cheat in real life? Like in an actual business setting do you truly think that everything is fair 100% of the time? You’ve never been passed up on an internship for someone less qualified who was better connected? You’ve never been turned down for a job because someone wanted to hire a family member? If so you are a lucky dude indeed
That makes sense thanks!
It's funny how much of this ""iS cHeAtInG NoT reAL?!"" argument you have going is completely one-sided. No one said anything about that. You've made that the focal point of the argument because it's all you've got. Sometimes people are dicks. Sometimes those people get called out. You got called out. No amount of logic or rationale will make that aspect of your comments go away. 

It's like me coming up and saying ""wow it's hot today"" and you spewing and venting about how the sun is a bajillion degrees and too bad because the sun is hot and then you try and ask ""well do you think the sun isn't hot?!""


You were a dick. Got called a dick. Plain and simple. You can brew in your own version of the truth and you'd still just be a soaked asshole."

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: ~4-5 hrs per week, ~10-15 during exam weeks and proj2.

Pros:

• Probably the lowest workload upper div CS class

• Fun and interesting projects, 1 and 3 are not time consuming at all and can be done in a night. Project 2 is a large time sink but it was also fun and the class gives you a ton of time to do it even if you start late

• Amazing course staff - the course staff this semester was super accommodating and honestly the best I've seen in a CS class at Berkeley so far. Helpful extensions during stressful weeks, letting slip days carry over Thanksgiving break, extra hw drops, flexible exam procedures, quick piazza response times, discussion TA

• Reasonable exams - if you do past exams and make notes of the textbook/lectures on your cheat sheet it's on the easier side to do well on the exams compared to other upper divs (no weirdly hard exams compared to content like CS 188, past exams have questions that are slight variations of each other)

• Great online textbook, super easy to catch up with lectures by using it if you fall behind or don't want to watch lecture.

Cons: 

• Personally I wish the class went more in depth on some topics, but it is a survey class so it can't be faulted that much here

• Sounds weird, but the projects might be TOO easy. Projects 1 and 3 could be more in depth and I think it would be fun to have harder challenges than the ones that they currently have. (Project 3 in particular has easier questions than many intro level CTF questions on web security). Considering project 2 requires probably 30-50 hours compared to the ~6 for project 1 and ~4 for project 3, I think there could be a better balance especially when each is weighted equally. However, I still think that project 3 should be on the lighter side given that it ends up being close to finals week. 

• The midterm exam felt kind of pointless this semester. So many questions were thrown out that it seemed like it didn't matter at all and the scores ended up very samey. The course staff (again, amazing) did make the final clobber the midterm though so it made this less of a problem.

Overall, a great class and would highly recommend especially if you want to round out a busy schedule without adding too much extra work.


CS 162 (Ion Stoica)

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: ~20 hrs per week

Pros:

• You will definitely learn a ton. Probably the single class that has increased my computer science knowledge the most at Berkeley so far but also conceptually difficult.

• Adding onto the previous point, really interesting topics if you care at all about performance, systems, design.

• Rewarding - once I got a concept in this class or figured out the homeworks and projects it truly felt rewarding and I could actually say I learned something significant for pretty much every assignment.

• Good lectures - a bit boring and slow, but easy to follow and 2x is your friend.

• Good exams - studying definitely pays off, although a lot of it is just knowing terms + concepts (make a good cheat sheet) 

Cons:

• TONS of work - this is basically a 6-8 unit class. With the additions to the 2nd project, the workload  is even higher (proj 2 is definitely now the hardest one). Projects are all long and you constantly have one the whole semester, HWs are long and some are pretty much projects in other CS classes (spent more time on average per hw for this class than projects for 161).

• Course staff could have been a bit more accommodating w/ regards to projects. Proj 2 now has a new part which is basically 1 to 1.5 projects on its own. The project could have used a bit more guidance considering it's new and some parts required some tricky solutions that were quite confusing to grasp using just the spec + design review. Additionally, some extensions to proj 2 definitely would've helped considering it was during the busiest time of the semester as well. They did mention at the end of the class that the curve was adjusted to compensate for proj 2's increased definitely so that was great of them. 

• Discussion was mandatory and required camera on (some may not see this as a con, but it was annoying to me), some sections had participation that wasn't just based on showing up (? Could be wrong on this) 

• I would consider having a good group as a pre req for this class since the projects are a huge part of your grade, extremely time consuming, hard, and must be done in a group of 4. Make sure you have people you trust to work hard(at least 3/4) in your group or it will be a bad time. I was lucky enough to have 2 friends taking this class w/ me which helped a lot and our fourth group member(found through class) was also great.


CS W186 (Lakshya Jain)

Rating: 6.5/10

Workload: ~8-12 hrs per week

Pros: 

• Good transition to upper div CS classes, projects and topics use and build upon many skills and concepts from lower divs like 61B, 61C

• Lots of resources - web lectures, review lectures, discussion, class notes (really good class notes)

• Balanced workload over whole semester, can expect to spend the same amount of time each week and it's a reasonable amount of time even though you will always have a project going on.

• Exams are straightforward and similar to past exams while still testing knowledge

• Projects help you learn the material well

• Accommodating course staff - respound quickly, helpful extensions.

Cons:

• While it's a good intro to upper div classes, most of the concepts are systems concepts and are honestly just taught in a more general and better way in 162. So it might be more worthwhile to take this class before 162. 

• I personally thought the content was pretty boring.

• While exams are straightforward, much of it is calculation bash for I/Os or trying to figure out what some SQL does. This makes the exams straightforward, but long and tedious. 


CS 194-277: Decentralized Finance (Dawn Song, lots of profs from other universities)

Rating: 8/10

Workload: ~8-10 hrs per week. Weekly lecutre quizzes (completion), 2 labs, semester long group research project.

Pros:

• I loved the course content. Super new and exciting field and the class definitely hooked me into it. Lectures gave an overview of many DeFi topics and it was cool to hear lots of different professors speak.

• Great course staff - gave lots of help and extensions on the tough Lab 2 and helped w/ projects.

• The class has 2 labs, the second lab was really fun content wise and taught a lot about writing smart contracts (more of this later)

Cons: 

• This class is only 2 Units!!! It is far more work than a 2 unit class should be. At minimum thisshould be 3 units but I probably spent more time on this class than 161 and 186 (could be due to choosing and working longer on a harder project though, not sure how much they were expecting in the end)

•Lab 2 could have used a lot more guidance from the class itself. There was only one lecture on smart contracts and the lab required us to have a lot of underlying knowledge to complete that wasn't really available from the single lecture. To complete the lab, tons of documentation had to be scoured along with a super helpful guide a classmate wrote.

•i wish there were more hands on assignments scattered over the semester rather than 2 labs, the first of which was basically a small math assignment. Of course, this would mean more work but this assumes the class is now 3-4 units.


Math 128A: (Per-olof Persson)

Rating: 6/10

Workload: ~6-10 hrs per week, weekly psets, ocassional programming assignment, biweekly quizzes

Pros:

• Easiest required upper div applied math major class

Cons:

• HW length varied drastically, some later hw were easily 3x the length of some previous ones and I wished the use of my drops was in my control earlier in the semester. 

• slow grading of assignments, not too transparent with grades. Didn't really know my quiz grades or where my grade in the class stood at all the whole semester besides exam grades.

• I thought the topics were fairly interesting, learning how some numerical methods work, implementations and proofs, but overall still very boring compared to all of the other upper div math

• MATLAB","loving all the review threads!

thanks for sharing :)
I think for 162, maybe op didnt explicitly say, really rewards hard work you put in. 3 projects weigh equally as 3 midterms. I also took it this semester and I got full marks on HW, projects and discussion attendence with only +0.4, +0.5, -0.5 on the 3 midterms (no finals in this class) and still came out with an A. The curve is pretty insane I would say for a upper division CS class.


I will say theres a slight learning curve in the beginning of the class because they do throw a lot of concepts at you about OS without you understanding OS. It will all start making sense through HW and projects eventually.

One other tip on the group projects is have each other at least contribute code that passes -some- tests they give. Initially, you will spend more time understanding the given code base than writing code and getting 1 test they give to pass is a BIG deal. Plenty of friends I know who slacked on Proj1 and say they’ll contribute in Proj2/3 never did because they never understood how everything works together. Since all 3 projects build off each other, theres no “restarting” after a project finishes. So get each other to write code that works even if its minor because the understanding it takes to write code that works far exceeds the time to write the code


One thing OP didnt mention is OH for this class, especially projects (and sometimes hwk) is almost useless. Yes you can get general guidance but if youre asking “why isnt X working with my implementation”, chances are they dont know it since your solution varies so greatly with the staff and other students. Debugging on your own (or with your team) is by far the most essential skill to succeeding in this class.
How do you square what you learn about block chain in 161 with taking a DeFi class?
You mention that the workload for cs162 is \~20 hours per week. Is the course workload just a plateaud level throughout the semester? I.e - same amt of hw/disc/proj workload every week. And i guess this also depends on what grade you were aiming for(guessing an A)? Would love to know cause im taking this class next sem :)
Are lectures helpful in 162? Is the textbook better? Can you jump straight into assignments?
for math 128a, are they slow to release hw solutions? if so how would you know where the holes in your knowledge are?
i've read that 186 was a heavy time commitment project class at the same tier of 162, has that changed?
is the workload including lectures/labs ?
For the Defi class, are there any prerequisites? I’m taking 161 and 170 next semester along with that class.
How did you feel balancing the 4 techs?
thanks for this detailed review!
how long exactly (eg how many hours total/or how many days) did proj2 in 161 take you?
if my 61c  knowledge is lacking, will 186 of 161 be harder and which would have more workload?
>:)

:)
This is good advice about the class. Also for OH I agree that it wasn't too helpful. In person OH during project week is a mess and online is only slightly better because I'm pretty sure some TAs just read off the staff solution to help you fix code which kinda leads u in the right direction. Not ideal, but still a bit helpful when you are stressing about the project.
Blockchain definitely has it's issues which weaver was pretty adamant about pointing out  during the Blockchain lectures lmao.  ut the DeFi class definitely showed me that it also has huge potential. I'm of the thought that it's probably too early for it to go mainstream given how many security issues and shady things go on in Blockchain but the ideas behind it and possibilities it offers are really interesting.
So much of the variability on workload depends on the quality of your teammates. You really can’t do the work by yourself (you can but the class would turn into a 8-unit course), you need a bare minimum of 2 competent people in the group to split up the work, and preferably all 4 pull their weight.  I had a decent group where we all had solid all-around skills, so we alternated each of the 3 projects between code and design in pairs. Also, there are differences in who your TA is, some can be assholes when divvying out participation points at the end, so choose carefully.  Participation points is a non-trivial part of the grade.
Hmm it's pretty constant, I kinda averaged in my cramming time but it felt like it was similar work per week throughout aside from project 2 which I spent probably 20-30 hrs/week on during the last two weeks of the project.
Ngl. Opened up screen usage for VSCode and it was ~40hr/week near proj due dates. Treat it like a 9-5 job. Every week you’ll have something to do whether that’s a proj or hw assignment. Generally good advice is to start really early and stay on top of your shit. There are really rough weeks where project and hw are due on the same week, along with a midterm before or after. So really manage your time well. I’d say an average of 20-30hr/week consistently is what you can make best out of it if you start early and stay on top. 

Also, if you really want to succeed, choose good partners. If they have internship experience or proficient with C, usually okay indication. Otherwise you’re just gonna have a bad experience. Teammates in my group who were initially friends are not friends anymore and we sussed out the imposters who cant code.
There was a textbook but it was more like extra material, everything for exams and course content was from lecture + discussions. I'd say for assignments(hw, proj) you can manage off only discussions but for exams you wanna go through the slides/lectures.
Hw solutions were immediately available, but the grades weren't. The hw were completion/effort based I believe but was still kinda annoying to not have any idea of what grades were entered until right before grades were released.
I wouldn't say it's close to 162 at all. It has a lot of project work since you have 6 projects and basically 2-2.5 weeks per project but each is definitely manageable within 10 hours and the easier ones took less time than that. They are also in java and are much easier to debug so it's far less painful than 162 C code and dealing with pintos codebase. Total time spent over all projects on 162 is ~100-120 hours(includes design, design review, coding, debugging) while 186 is ~50 hours
Way different. If you really want to get the most out of a design/systems class, take 162. It was much more rewarding than 186. I also agree with OP and took both concurrently this semester. Take 186 if you want an easy way out of the design req for CS upper division with some project based learning involved , although it seems like OPs review of 161 indicates that’s the better option.
Yup, although I definitely didn't watch every lecture or go to every discussion, this includes the time to learn the material per week.
The class being offered next sem is actually different from the DeFi one this past fall, but should be similar in areas. I think you could take it without any pre reqs, just basic cs knowledge and maybe some of the math stuff from cs70 will help (barely part of the class though, maybe more of a part in next sems version)
Was pretty rough especially during some of the midterm weeks where I would end up having 2 projects + 2 midterms due the same week and then more midterms next week, etc but I still had decent free time on weekends + time spent procrastinating during week. Im certain someone with better time management could have pretty free weekends aside from some busy weeks.
Any advice on which TAs to pick or avoid?
thanks, and what grade were yall aiming for? i feel like hours will vary a LOT if youre trying to get a good grade vs just pass
my 2 cents is that good partners != internships/being smart etc.

&#x200B;

everyone took 61c and knows c and knows gdb (some more than others ofc) and well we are all at berkeley so we are all capable enough at figuring out the material. but 162 introduces a weird codebase that nobody really will have prior exp working with and so what you really want to be looking for and, this is kinda hard without already working w them, is work ethic and time commitment imo. this class is going to asking for a lot of time sometimes and if a deadline is coming up, you need to make sure that your entire team is on the same page.
damn what if i am looking to just get a C- or above in the course, do you think it'll still be really bad? I'm not about to put in 40/hr week just for one class lol. Taking 162 just for the knowledge rather than the coding skills. Doing part time internship as well..
side question: how do people know whether the textbook's info is necessary to a class (any class not 162) or not? do they look at the practice tests super early? ask people who've taken the class?
what did you mean in math 128a that you wish you could've been in charge of your hw drops?
Yeah aiming for an A, although I feel like you would still want to go for at least a 90% on project points even if you weren't which still requires a mostly working solution, maybe subtract ~10 hours per project for debugging. Exam studying could cut down quite a bit of time however if not aiming for an A.
That is probably doable. I genuinely think you can’t fail a CS course unless you put zero effort, especially if it’s a curved class. If you PNP and put in some effort on exams, hw, and proj with a good group, I’d say P is guaranteed. But be low key amongst your groupmates about PNPing, cause they’ll think you’re a crutch to the group. Just note that in group projects, you’ll evaluate each other on how much work everyone contributed. If you think you can contribute to a fourth of the project or you’re willing to be a chad and contribute minimum effort and take a low group evaluation, go for it.
I honestly didn't even know we had a textbook, never looked at it. Everything is covered in lecture and the projects.
People usually ask on piazza at the beginning of class or during first lecture
Oh I wasn't too specific here but I fell sick and had to use some drops then also used another when I had a super busy week and didn't have any left for much harder hw that I wished I could've dropped lmao"

CS 161 (Nicholas Weaver):

Rating: 9/10

Workload: \~4-5 hr/week, \~15hr/week when project 2 was being implemented

Pros:

* I found the content very interesting. It opened my eyes to a lot of security vulnerabilities and even improved how I approach my own personal security (security keys anyone?).
* Weaver was very passionate about the material (especially crypto) and  was a fantastic lecturer overall. If you read this post, best of luck being the CEO, Janitor, and Chief Mad Scientist of Skerry Technologies!
* Projects 1 & 2 are some of the coolest projects I've had to do for a class here. In Project 1, I felt like I was a hacker hacking into old decommissioned Gobian Union satellites. I thought the lore added some character from the otherwise same old same old CS project requirements (although obviously not required).
* For Project 2, I loved the systems design with security component of it. I found developing Project 2 very rewarding, as I not only learned Go, but I had practice applying a ton of the cryptographic primitives learned in class.

Cons:

* While there was an attempt to perhaps make how they are assigning grades more transparent, I felt that the binned grading scheme caused a good bit of stress for me. I think the bins are currently set unreasonably high, and there is a rumor that the bins will be shifted. I personally prefer a curve where you can estimate your position than unreasonably high bins with possibility (but not necessarily guaranteed) of a downward shift.

Overall, I strongly recommend any EECS/CS major to take CS161. It is super fun and the work around Project 2 can be managed.

CS 162 (John Kubiatowicz and Anthony Joseph)

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: \~20 hr/week

Pros:

* Content is generally really interesting and very helpful in understanding systems.
* Working within an existing codebase like Pintos was initially rough, but it ended up becoming rewarding, as you end up seeing how so many of the core OS functions are implemented.
* Design documents and design reviews force you to actually think about all sorts of aspects integrating features into a large codebase. I think my systems design skills definitely improved by the end of the course.
* Both Professor Kubi and Joseph are solid lecturers! I highly recommend them.

Cons:

* I think at some point there was a Homework, Project, Design Document, and Midterm in the span of 2.5 weeks. I wished the workload was more distributed or that the deadlines were spaced out better.
* Workload around project due dates was very high (almost like a full time job), but this could have been mitigated through better time management.
* Good group is an absolute must (or enjoy having your back broken)! I was fortunate to have a great group and I survived.

Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in becoming a SWE or who has an interest in systems.

CS 189 (Jonathan Shewchuk)

Rating: 8/10

Workload: \~10-12 hrs per week

Pros:

* I've been slow to pick up ML before due to the heavy math and I wasn't able to learn effectively from online resources. This class definitely pushed me over this hump, and now I find ML very exciting.
* I think Shewchuk's iteration has the right amount of theory to the point where I can understand the intuition for the algorithms as opposed to just memorizing certain formulas.
* Majority of the homeworks were very helpful in understanding concepts. In general, homeworks included both traditional math and theory based questions but also code implementation of certain algorithms. I'm glad there was a balance so I could see how the theory related to code in practice.
* I loved Shewchuk's lectures!

Cons:

* As someone who took neither EECS126/127 and survived off of the backs of EECS16B and CS70, I found HW2 very challenging and long. While I did learn many concepts, like multivariate Gaussians, I found some of the proofs unnecessary and too much work for someone who is inexperienced at math compared to my peers.
* HW difficulty and workload is generally inconsistent. Some homeworks are somewhat short, but other homeworks like 2 and 6 become very long.
* Grading bins are not transparent, but I've heard bins are generous.

Overall, I think it does a great job of introducing ML topics at a good level of depth. It is definitely a worthwhile course to take, and if you are interested in ML, if you can survive HW2, you should be fine in a Shewchuk semester.

CS 188 (Stuart Russell and Dawn Song)

Rating: 3/10

Workload: \~5-7 hr/week

Pros:

* Projects for the most part are really easy plug and chug. Definitely takes the stress off if you have a ton of other work to do.
* A small amount of content actually helped me understand some of a new research project I'm working on this summer.

Cons:

* Content at the end of the semester was very rushed, and in my opinion it is some of the most interesting.
* I have absolutely 0 clue why we decided to spend 2 whole weeks on a logic unit where we could have added at least taken one of the lectures and put it towards RL.
* No idea why grading policy claims participation is optional 5% extra credit, when the reality is that the bins are 5% shifted up from Fall 2021. The participation is only optional if you are a genius and absolutely crush the exams. To have a shot at even making a similar level bin as Fall 2021 you have to go to discussion or participate on Piazza. I don't have an issue with participation, but please don't claim it as extra credit when it is required for mere mortals like myself.
* The way the material is presented does not develop a sort of intuition you can get like from CS189, for example. I felt a lot of it became know X, Y, Z formulas (or I guess write it down on your cheat sheets).

Overall: If you are taking/have taken CS189, I don't think it is justifiable to take CS188 as a whole separate course when you could probably learn the relevant RL portions in 2 weeks tops (IMO if you are interested in RL, CS189->CS285 would probably be better). If you find Bayes Nets/HMMs fascinating, then take this course, but do it at the peril of wasting your time. It could perhaps be a good introductory course for those who don't want the hardcore nature of CS189 but still want some AI background.

EDIT: I don't want to rail on CS188. I think the course staff was helpful for project completion, discussion, etc. I just felt like the content actually taught in the class did not meet the high bar set by the other three classes mentioned here.","Damn ur crazy
it's funny that there's a whole unit on scheduling in 162 and course staff was absolute ass when it came to scheduling assignments this sem
U took four techs🤠
Cs 188 is a dogshit class. Keep railing :)
Fwiw we covered HMMs and PGMs in 189 too. So 188 is actually completely useless lmfao
Also will be saving this post!! :)
I love seeing people who want to get by the CS degree the easy, less stressful way by taking light techs like 160, 161, 186, 194s. Then they naively choose to take CS 188 and just get absolutely railed with the impossible difficult exams.
So you think 188 is harder than those?
188 is ""easy"" up until the exams. The content is so wishy-washy and everyone gets 100-ish on the projects and HW. 188 isn't a ""hard"" class, but 188 is a ""hard class to get a good grade in because wtf did we even learn"".
I took all of the classes OP mentioned and 188 ruined my 4.0 GPA (i got a B+)

It’s also his/her/their worst rated class. So yes, 188 was harder than all if those IMO. Your effort in this class doesn’t correlate well to the exams and the concepts don’t even come up as someone who’s interviewed for many ML engineer positions.
Seems like an odd way to run a course... so was it more useful to look at past exams?"
"Claude Steele, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, steps down",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4ezxb8/claude_steele_executive_vice_chancellor_and/,2016-04-15 18:43:48,"Dear Colleagues, 

It is with sadness that I write to inform you that my friend and long-time colleague, Claude Steele, has decided to step down from his administrative position as UC Berkeley’s Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost. Claude’s many contributions will have a lasting impact on our university, including: 

* Launching a budget reform and simplification effort to base planning and decision-making on more clearly understood and predictable metrics.
* Managing the university’s effort to assess and verify its financial deficit as well as develop short and long term strategies for sustaining its excellence in the face of financial challenges. I am confident that the university is now on a path to financial strength in the years ahead.
* Designing a new, more centrally managed fund-raising organization with the aim of achieving a closer relationship between the donor and alumni communities and the needs of the university.
* Improving the campus climate through the African American Initiative and the diversification of campus leaderships from the athletic department to deanships.

We will, very shortly, have an announcement about who will fill the EVCP role on an interim basis, including assuming responsibilities for leading the strategic initiatives process, and I greatly appreciate Claude’s readiness to assist with the transition. In the meantime, he has asked me to share with you the following message:

*Two years ago, I joined UC Berkeley—an institution I have long admired—with excitement about its twin missions of excellence and access. It has been a privilege to devote my time and energy to growing and supporting the university, and in particular to building a more inclusive community. For academic freedom to be meaningful in the experience of our students, staff and faculty, our university has to be a place where everyone has a sense of belonging and of being valued.*

*For all the reasons that the Chancellor just mentioned, I have been fortunate to be part of important developments here, and indeed there are so many more things I would like to be part of in the university’s near- and long-term.*

*Alas, my wife’s ongoing health challenges remain quite significant, and this is simply not a time in our lives where I can afford to further sacrifice our time together. The choice has thus become clear: I can no longer offer UC Berkeley the time and level of commitment it needs from its EVCP, while at the same time being a part of my family in the way I want to be.*     

*While I am sad to leave the central administration and my beloved colleagues there, my consolation is that I won’t be far away. I am excited to return to my professional life as a psychologist and writer, and will join UC Berkeley’s Department of Psychology next year, a place and group of friends and colleagues that I have known and admired for many years. I am also excited about the opportunity to play a role at the School of Education.*

*I want to thank my colleagues in the central administration mightily for the support they have given me and my family, and for their continued dedication and hard work for the university and the UC system. UC-Berkeley is a special place – I am proud of my work as provost, and look forward to continuing to be part of the Berkeley family.*

*I know you will all join me in wishing Dorothy Steele, Claude’s wife, a rapid return to good health. She is and will remain in our thoughts and prayers.*

We will have an opportunity to say more about Claude’s many contributions to the university during his time as EVCP in due course; for now we thank him profoundly for his service, and wish him the very best as he returns to his professional life as a psychologist and writer, and becomes a valued full time member of our faculty. I also want to thank the Cal community for their remarkable resilience during this time of transition. I look forward to continued partnership and collaboration as we go forward with our work to secure Berkeley’s excellence and access for years to come.

Regards,

Nicholas B. Dirks
Chancellor","[Going into the faculty -> scam way for the good ole boys to keep giving each other huge salaries at our expense.](http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/article29406190.html)

Screw you Steele and Dirks. You blow off the real issues as if we are idiots and in so doing you continue to destroy UC. "
