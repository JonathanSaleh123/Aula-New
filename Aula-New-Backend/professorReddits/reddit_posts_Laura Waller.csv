Does anyone know how the professors for EE16A are for Spring 2018: Vladimir Stojanovic and Laura Waller?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/78e15h/does_anyone_know_how_the_professors_for_ee16a_are/,2017-10-23 23:43:38,,"I had Stojanovic, when I took it he taught the circuit portion of the course. Material can be dry if you're not super into it, but he explained things relatively clearly. Lectures tended to be really simple and homework/exams lots of more complicated shit came up, which was frustrating at times.
Laura Waller is an absolutely brilliant and approachable person. She is just a bit awkward at times.
I had Stojanovic for CS61C, I thought he was good in that course.  Not amazing, but solid.
They can't possibly be as bad as Sahai for teaching linear algebra, so you'll be good for that part at least.
I'll keep those things mind. Thank you very much.
I would hope so. Thanks for the input
Ahaha thanks. I suppose they are better than sahai "
