ECON classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dnpvgh/econ_classes/,2019-10-26 23:44:06,"Hi, I will declaring my Econ major after I finish Stat 20 and ECON 100B this fall semester. I just had a few questions regarding who to take for 100A/101A. My two choices are ECON 100A spring semester with David Roland or ECON 101A with Stefano Dellavigna!

I'm also planning to take ECON 140 Stephen Bianchi or ECON141 Bryan Graham but just wanted feedback or any experiences from these professors and classes.","I took 101A last semester (not with dellavigna unfortunately) and I'm in 100b this semester, and I'd definitely say that the 100 series seems a lot more practical in terms of teaching intuition, whereas in 100A I learned lots of equation but didn't really learn the theory behind it.  That being said, Dellavigna is supposed to be an awesome professor, so maybe your experience would be different"
