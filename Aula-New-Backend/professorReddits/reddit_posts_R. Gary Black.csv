Cult legend GARY WILSON performing @ Rasputin Berkeley this Saturday (xpost from /r/music),http://www.rasputinmusic.com/?p=2301,2011-07-19 00:12:30,,
"Black Oak Books, which has been in Berkeley for 33 years, is shutting its doors. Gary Cornell, the math professor who rescued the storied bookstore in 2008 said the store no longer makes financial sense. Berkeley raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour making it more difficult to run the business.",http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/01/07/berkeleys-black-oak-books-to-shut-its-doors-after-33-years/,2016-01-07 18:29:26,,"Right, minimum wage increase killed his business, not Amazon, et al.
This sucks - it's a nice store.
I'm sure you know better than the guy who actually owns the store.
On-line booksellers have been killing brick and mortar bookstores for years now, did you not know that?  If you read the article he even states there were several reasons for closure, not just the minimum wage increase.  Unfortunately OP choose to editorialize the post title.
Actually indie bookstores are making a comeback. "
The incel talk really worries me,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1da1v67/the_incel_talk_really_worries_me/,2024-06-06 21:12:22,"I read a recent post where a guy was insecure about his looks and height. I truly feel for him. It's so easy to be misled by online media at our age. What he and everyone should know is that in our own way, we are all unique and beautiful, and we should celebrate who we are.

Immediately afterwards, another poster u/[Diligent\_Divide\_4978](https://www.reddit.com/user/Diligent_Divide_4978/) made [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cxg2ty/its_not_your_fault_if_youre_a_lonely_man/) trying to ""black pill"" this insecure guy. He twisted studies to suit his narrative and responded with ""ad hominem"" when someone *rightfully* condemned his post. But worst of all, h**e tried to drag OOP down into his crocodile pit of misogynistic despair**.

That's why I'm not afraid to call him out publicly.

The interesting thing is that ""Diligent Divide"" apparently struggles with autism. While I understand that this has affected his life, he should understand that no reasonable person will agree with him.

Why would any reasonable person *want* to have hate in their heart for half of the population?

Why would any reasonable person *want* to give up?

Why would any reasonable person *want* to **make their loneliness** their ***identity?***

Why would any reasonable person *want* to ***be unhappy?***

If you're lonely, I totally sympathize. There were many times in my life when I was lonely as well.

And let me make it clear: if you have autism or a condition like ""Diligent Divide"" has, it may be harder to find people. After all, most people aren't autistic. He has his own challenges that would be much better suited for a therapist than a random college sub.

And that is the **danger** of inceldom. Insecure young guys will be led into the pit of crocodile incels by **harmful** toxic guys like ""Diligent Divide.""

No matter what you do or where you are in life, please feel the freedom to **be happy.** Don't let guys like him guide you into lonely forums in the darkest corners of the internet.

I will end by paraphrasing his bone-chilling final statement:

You *are* a free agent in life because **you are free to make your life anything you want it to be.** Let gratitude guide you.

Thank you for reading. I sincerely hope you got something out of this.","uh. go bears?
*Something something* **Artillery Range**
I was at Berkeley in the early 1980s. 5'7"", not particularly handsome, in retrospect definitely on the spectrum. Dating, romance, sex - it all caused me considerable anxiety and self-doubt. 

What I resolved to do (in addition to seeking and getting mental health care) was diligently pursue changes to my outlook and behavior that would make me more attractive to my potential partners. The idea that I couldn't change never occurred to me. That I should build my identity around being unattractive and alone would have seemed like madness. 

FWIW, I'm 63 now and have been happily married for almost thirty years.
I said this before and I'll say it again, but take care of yourself. You need be comfortable being yourself before you can be comfortable being with another person. Find your confidence and security within, not from the approval of randos. Yes, it's easier said than done, but be patient. Chances are you're young and still have some experiences to experience.

A caterpillar secludes itself inside its cocoon before becoming a butterfly. Transformation takes time, but also self-acceptance...
Whatever happened to Gary Cooper, the strong silent type?
while i don’t think young men are the most underprivileged or mistreated group of people (far from it), i think it’s really easy for large amounts of young men in today’s climate to fall victim to manipulative influencers/influences who spread toxic masculinity and misogyny. it’s so important to lean on the people around you, make friends, try talking to people, and reach out to other when you need help. loneliness happens, but therapy, talking it out, and finding things you enjoy can really make a difference. i know it’s easier said than done, but there is credence to the idea that it is much better to look elsewhere than to incel figureheads trying to spread hate. 
I got curious about that dude’s account and went thru it and read the following in one of his posts:

“ **Neurodivergence:**

""Autism literally doesn't matter bro, just be yourself bro.""

[16% of autistic men are in a relationship. 46% of autistic women are.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/)

Damn it’s over before it even began😭😭😭 next level ropefuel lmao 🫡
To note: I don’t agree with hateful views like sexism and racism.

Loneliness isn't just caused by a bad personality; it's influenced by a mix of factors like life circumstances, social environment, and even unfair judgments based on appearance (also known as lookism). For people with autism, social interactions can be challenging.

Science tells us that loneliness isn't just a feeling; it can actually affect our brains and our health. Feeling disconnected from others can worsen mental health issues and impact physical well-being. We're wired to connect with others, so feeling lonely goes against our basic human nature.

In terms of romantic relationships, loneliness can be depressing . The desire for companionship and intimacy is very common , and feeling unable to fulfill that need can create feelings of isolation and despair.

Instead of brushing off someone's loneliness, offering support, understanding, and encouragement to build meaningful connections, including romantic ones, can make a significant difference in their well-being.
After looking through that guy's profile, there is no indication that he is a Berkeley student (or even a student at all for that matter). 
Downvoting these posts to oblivion and ignoring them is probably for the better if the mods won't take them down. I don't see why this discourse should be entertained here so readily, particularly when it has nothing to do with the city/university/students directly. 

With that said, once I get settled in my career I will have no issue with this discourse, but until then I still need to bank on the fact that the Cal brand holds value. Just give me a few months, then ya'll can resume discussing the mating ritual or whatever all you want. 🙏

While I agree with your post, it's important to point out that ""self-improvement"" is cope for a decent amount of the population
I heard a great quote the other day 
Women are not vending machines that you put kindness into until sex comes out.
Why is shewchuk still here trying to blackpill students
Not saying I agree with the Diligent Divide guy, but ignoring the fact that these posts should not be had on the Berkeley sub at all and have NOTHING to do without university...

What about Diligent Divide's post is about autism? he's talking about looks and physical appearance and how they can pose a challenge for people, as well as other predetermined factors that can make it harder to succeed, but mainly physical appearance. 

Aside from the fact that the dude is autistic, do you have any actual rebuttal to what he said? Society CAN be shallow, and economic/political conditions and material circumstances DO play a huge role in determining life outcomes. 

At least accept that and engage in a productive dialogue to move towards a new solution rather than writing the guy off as autistic and saying ""You can do whatever you want!"" because it's exactly those kinds of false promises that make people upset when their expectations aren't reached. 

No one WANTS to become an incel, they don't magically wake up one day and decide to hate everyone and everything. The fact that so many people are (to the point where you have to make this post as a ""warning"") should be a sign that something is wrong with our society even if we don't want to acknowledge it. What it is, I don't know, but your post does little to address any root causes and seeks to divide further, especially along identity lines (such as mental disorders and other labels)
This is such a scumbag post. You're ""worried"" that people will point out the way our culture isolates people, especially autistic men, and basically just telling them not to worry about it. Instead of highlighting that real dynamic and maybe encouraging others to act differently because of the harm that causes, the same way we've culturally shifted how men view women over the last few decades, for example, you just want them to shut up and accept it so you can go back to comfortably ignoring them. This isn't what caring or sympathizing looks like. This is what dismissal and barely concealed disdain looks like. Of course, since what I'm saying is correct, I expect nothing but attacks and downvotes for saying this but at this point I don't care. From the bottom of my heart: fuck you.

Each of us is genetically unique. But many of us are NOT attractive. This is very clear when it comes to studies between attractive-looking people and hiring and promotion practices. Attractive people are far more likely to get hired and promoted than unattractive people. The sooner I recognized that I was NOT part of the beautiful people group, the sooner I could move on with my life. I don’t need to be attractive to be well-liked, have friends and family, or be successful. I do have to work harder, though. I played the best game, given the cards that I was dealt.
It is a tad astonishing the way people can become attached to some shared pit of despair. Self-pity is a weird thing. I read about a concept some years ago that is both intriguing and troubling, the business of 'believing in your chains.'

(puts on flame suit) I've seen it in minority groups sometimes, sort of 'of course we can't get ahead, the ***** are keeping us down.' Can lead to not even trying and alienating people who want to help.
I think its important to engage with people and treat everyone with kindness and respect. 

A lot of young men who struggle interpersonally and feel rejected by society are welcomed with open arms into these communities.   It's not excusing their behavior, but I do think that kindness is the best weapon against these incel communities.
I'm autistic. I'm not conventionally attractive either. I never have been. This did not stop me from having a lot of sex in my youth. I'm not a Berkeley student at this time, though I might apply there at some point if life takes me to California, but this came up on my feed and I gotta agree with you, OP. Cultivating joy and gratitude is a better way to live than harboring resentment. Not everyone is going to like you and that's okay. I am comfortable not being everyone's cup of tea. I have had a lot of setbacks in life but my therapist agrees I can still be loved for who I am someday. I am at peace with being single for now. Being single is better than setting for someone who doesn't meet my standards. I'm sure I'll have more opportunities to date as I continue to work on myself and my situation. I wanna say this, though: sex won't fix your life. A lot of the sex I've had did not change me for the better in any way. There's more to life than sex. I agree it's part of the human experience to try to find a person or people to share your life with but don't give up hope. Everyone experiences rejection and no one gets their way all the time. I feel like learning and studying should be top priority over dating but that's just my opinion, so feel free to take it or leave it.
Trying to drag object oriented programming down into a crocodile pit of misogynistic despair is unironically a thing I’ve seen men do in my programming career. 

That being said this post is absolutely important. Please don’t fall into this. I moderate or participate in a few discord servers for games, hobbies, etc and have seen a lot of young men come and go with varying degrees of confidence in their own ability to attract people. I’ve also seen people try to lead them into believing there’s something fundamentally broken about them. Take the advice given by OP and others here and try to focus on yourself and your passions and pursuits. I promise the rest of your life will fall into place in its own time no matter how short or ugly you are.
I believe that if we take ‘incel’ by definition, and remove the perception that incel eludes to killers, that a good 70-80% of berkeley’s student body is by definition an incel.

> in our own way, we are all unique and beautiful

that’s a fucking horrible take. what he should know is that not everyone is actually beautiful. a lot of people are ugly. Half of us are below average (by definition… or is that mean?… anyways it’s half of us).

People saying absolutely stupid shit like “we are all beautiful” just makes the world a shittier place.

Stop telling ugly people they are beautiful.
When I was at Cal, my luck with the opposite sex was pretty bad.  In hindsight, I definitely missed some opportunities, mainly because my confidence was so shot from high school.  I won’t delve into the problems of that earlier period here, but despite not having a steady girlfriend in college, they were still some of the best, most irreplaceable years of my life.  Why?  Because I found real friendship and because I was finding out who I was and finally getting comfortable with that.  Also I was growing so much intellectually and having all sorts of amazing, new experiences.

It was hard sometimes, don’t get me wrong.  However, after college things got better, and the groundwork I’d laid with myself paid off in the long run.  So, my best advice is to find yourself and embrace that.  Don’t underrate the power and freedom of not being tied down and doing what you want to do.  When a relationship does come, it’s full of compromises, and while it can be a wonderful thing with the right person, there’s plenty of time in life for it and no need to rush it or worry about it if it doesn’t happen in college at all.  Truly.  That’s how it was for me, and my life has turned out fine overall.

If more people focused on glorifying God instead of glorifying themselves none of these issues would exist. People should focus on loving the higher parts of themselves (I.e their intellect and rational soul) and ordering their desires, appetites, and rational will in accordance with God’s will. Then the true love of charity would bring the right kind of self-love. People would stretch their souls towards the ultimate good that is God and also help their neighbors stretch their souls toward God as well. This in turn would lead to a more peaceful and virtuous society.

Is dating here really so bad?

Most of the discord here is just this
For real - work on yourself to become someone other people would want to date. How do you determine that? Well, what would you like in someone you date? In good physical shape, emotionally stable and in touch, some interests / hobbies, taking good care of themselves / grooming / hygiene, all those things you can do yourself. Sure you can't really change your face but you'll be absolutely ""dateable"" if you work on those things for yourself. 
Yeah the idea that someone would identify as an “incel” rather than hit the gym and work on their education/career is baffling.
Circumstances have changed since then. In the age of rapidly evolving technology and globalism, It has become much easier for a girl to find a “better” guy than yourself. Women have nearly unlimited access to “better” options. 

I think it’s more important than ever for young men who aren’t in the top ~10% of men (in terms of looks, status, wealth) to remain focused on self-improvement as you mentioned, and to also try to not be romantically attached to someone. If it’s written, then it will come eventually.
Lmao! Sopranos!
I am not sure a trap as much as cultural thing.  ""We"" really have failed men in respect to this myth that all their feelings of loneliness will magically go away if they just find a romantic partner(s).  IMHO it won't and, indeed, when men approach life from that point they are unattractive (""desperate"" and ""clingy"").

I truly believe the right approach for young men struggling with this is to identify things you like to do (or might want to do) and find a group of likeminded people.  

The funny thing is that for all of our culture's patriararchy and misogyny, one of the more positive things is the entire idea of the group of ""girl friends"" celebrates the idea that people need a group of friends and that their happiness doesn't depend entirely on finding a partner.  I think the challenge is that men's friendships are culturally conditioned to be superficial - without a lot of vulnerability and sharing the norm.
What is it exactly about young men that makes them so easily propagandized to believe they have it so horrible when in reality it's better than everyone else, that liberal white women are completely immune from believing the same about themselves?
> The results of our study are limited because they are solely based on self-report, and one cannot be sure that all participants were diagnosed by a trained psychologist or psychiatrist. However, all ASD participants scored above the cutoff value of the German version of the AQ, ensuring that they showed pronounced ASD symptomatology. Furthermore, all participants were recruited through ASD self-help groups or ASD outpatient care centers, indicating that their contact with the medical system was due to their symptomatology. Our study results are also limited by the potential that individuals with a higher interest in sexuality-related issues, and perhaps also having more sexual problems, were more likely to volunteer to participate, thus affecting the study population. 

So the study made sure to pick autistic people who were already in contact with the medical system because they were having issues adjusting to society, rather than picking a random sample. The study recruited people in such a way that people who were having ""sexuality-related issues, and perhaps also having more sexual problems, were more likely to volunteer to participate"".

In other words this sample is so skewed that the numbers are kind of useless. The study also wasn't even meant to test for the thing you're claiming it does, it was designed to test hypersexuality. That means they were showing these numbers to give a better understanding of the actual study group, not to try and claim these states represent the entire population. There are multiple things beyond even what I quoted in the paper that acknowledge this issue.

If you're an actual Berkeley grad you should ask for a refund, because they clearly failed to teach you basic scientific literacy.

Bro is writing scripts to make bots en masse
I think the issue with inceldom OP is indirectly talking about is that it ends up becoming a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. Many people go through times in their life where they are lonely, frustrated, not taking good care of themselves physically, not meeting new people, and don't have disposable income to spend on activities with others or dates. Lots of such people eventually find a partner by working on themselves. ""Inceldom"" for lack of a better term instead blames women. That gives peolle an excuse to kind of give up, and once you develop some kind of spite towards women on top of not working on yourself towards being someone another person would want to be with, theres no way someone will want to date you. And boom, it'll feel like everything you were told by uncels was true. Meanwhile another version of you started exercising, went to therapy or worked on your own issues, picked up a new hobby, put some time into appearance and found someone who wants to be with you. 
> Aside from the fact that the dude is autistic, do you have any actual rebuttal to what he said? Society CAN be shallow, and economic/political conditions and material circumstances DO play a huge role in determining life outcomes.

Sure, there's an actual rebuttal.  Because that's not the falsehood.  I mean, it is in degree - it overlooks a bunch of people who have depth, a bunch of people who overcame their circumstances, including people at Cal - but that's not the *main* problem.  The problem, the falsehood, is the idea that these are the only relevant facts that control your life, and that dwelling on them will bring peace of mind instead of cynicism, helplessness, and despair.

If we are to look shallowly, let's acknowledge the audience, okay?  We're talking about UC Berkeley students.  In a lot of important ways, we got lotto numbers when we rolled our characters.  In other ways, we ourselves made good choices to get to Cal.  Does Divide acknowledge any of that?  Is this part of what he wants to talk about when he says ""life is truly about much more than dating""?  No, of course not.  If we remembered our advantages or our choices, we might be grateful instead of anxious, ready to act on what we have instead of being paralyzed by what we're missing.

Instead, what Divide wants to talk about is how we should take this thing we're struggling with, and apply it to *everything*.  Dating sucks?  Well, there's much more to life than dating - and it *all* sucks in the same way dating sucks, because it all depends on things outside of your control: your genes, your looks, your gender, your smarts, your homeland, etc etc etc.  And because everything sucks in uncontrollable ways, we should give up on our goals and desires, reject anyone trying to encourage (oops, ""gaslight"") us, and try to console ourselves that at least it's not our fault.

Remember, this was supposed to bring peace of mind.  So why does it read like textbook symptoms of depression?

Frankly, any idiot knows that acknowledging circumstances outside of our control is supposed to be step one towards *letting go of our anxieties over those things*, the better to focus on what we *can* control - principally, ourselves.  But this genius has fooled himself into thinking he has to stay stuck on step one, forever - and persuade others to do the same.

Which isn't to say that there isn't anything tempting about the thought.  Sure, if I believed that, it would completely absolve me of any responsibility towards myself.  It would let me feel good about ""seeing through the lie"" that I can become anything I set my mind to, not being ""gaslit"" (I believe the term Holden Caulfield used was ""phony"").  I would get to have special insight into taboo truths about genetic determinism and the undeserving nature of anyone successful.

And all I would have to do is give up on the idea of setting my mind to anything at all.  Resign myself to my failures, forever, abandoning the thought that I can make anything better by my own efforts.  ""Don't be a free agent in life.""

But the cure is worse than the disease.  What good is serenity by way of abandoning courage and wisdom?

You’re absolutely right. No one admits that anyone is ugly and by result know one admits that ugly people can be happy. We should be honest with people, but we all pretend like ugly people are beautiful which long term harms them far more. There’s legitimate hope for people who are unattractive and many are good people deserving of good lives, but no one wants to be honest with them.
Also to tie in to the whole incel theme, just try to have empathy for others and realize everyone is a person with their own struggles and their own rate of maturation in different areas.  If you’re still developing in terms of relating to others on a romantic level, don’t make that other people’s problem.  Some of us who focused more on academics can be slower to develop these types of social skills.  It’s ok.  There’s time.  And no reason to give up.

Never stop realizing that getting laid or having a partner, while something we’re strongly driven to do biologically and animalistically (that’s a word?) is no magic bullet for anything, including happiness.  In fact, it can bring whole new problems of its own.  Over idealizing sex and romance is a common pitfall for those who just don’t have experience with it.

“Discord”

There’s your problem
People are busy, you have to really make the effort to get out and meet new people. I recommend joining clubs and trying groups on Meetups. Dating apps can be difficult and misleading as to your worth. Just be confident and be yourself and get out and meet people, and get up the courage to shoot your shot when you like someone (respecting boundaries and consent, of course!), and remember that even the hottest celebrities go through rejection and breakups and so on. Best of luck! ✌️
It's related to the issue that yes there are struggles in life that can make it harder to be happy all the time, but you have to at least try to be happy to enjoy life. People who build an identity around being miserable will naturally be miserable and there's nothing anyone can do to force you to change that.

There are multiple problems with the work on yourself advice and other forms of male checklist to magically datable:

To put it simply and consistently, this and other people are basically telling most non upper class men to accept being kissless until they're like 28-30.a Expecting people to spend most of early adulthood with no romantic soccess is just going to create more jncels. 

This sounds drastic but hear me out - Most US adults are overweight. Mental illness is increasing in young people. Hobbies and self care take time and money that young adults are short on. 

It's understandable that someone who is obese, has nothing going on, broke, uninteresting will struggle... But that's a lot of young men and women. For some reason in modern society - mid people don't want to date other mid people anymore. 

The solution, especially for men has to be something else than just do better.

Bro, go outside. Get off the internet. Lol
I hate to break this to you, friend, but it was *always* easy for a girl to find ""better"" options out there. Sure, in the past they had to actually leave their homes to do so but that didn't seem to be the insurmountable obstacle many today seem to think it is. And yes, life has always been easier for those in possession of highly desirable traits. Then, as now, those who were less blessed by nature had to put in a bit of effort toward making themselves enticing partners. Long story short: nothing has really changed, nothing is ""written"", don't wallow in a fixed mindset.
Men don’t need to find the perfect someone. That’s impossible. But men’s standards are the bare minimum. Most would be happy with anyone as long as they have an orifice between their legs. Men have increased their own supply because of low standards despite making only half the population. 

Women are fine with being alone and prefer finding a quality man thus decreasing their supply. Men need to do the same. Men need to be happy with themselves first instead of finding happiness from others.
yes i agree, there needs to be focus on finding what makes you happy, not seeking external validation through a romantic partner. i also think people can take advantage of this, as well, with dubious “courses” and bad “advice”
Marginalized men don't get that much sympathy and help from society compared to marginalized women. Have you noticed how 90% of the homeless are men?
i said i don’t think young men are remotely close to the most marginalized groups. just that you have andrew tate types making it worse for men and women alike, poisoning society through weaponized misogyny 
Toxic masculinity means that men aren't expected to open up emotionally to anyone except their partner. This is a pretty bad thing for both men and women. It leads to men who are emotionally stunted and lack proper support networks, and people who are emotionally immature and don't have trusted people who can point out when they're being taken advantage of are more likely to fall for propaganda.

This isn't my trying to say that men have it worse than women, or anything remotely like that. It's just pointing out that our society is structured in a way that leads to a lot of men never really growing up or forming healthy relationships. Dealing with toxic masculinity would result in a better society for everyone.
If all participants were recruited that way then that doesn't account for the gender disparity. You just don't want to acknowledge what any person with 2 brain cells to rub together would realize is obviously true: women have an easier time dating than men and autistic men in particular have an extremely bad time because of how masculine expectations clash with typically autistic traits. You just pulled the first justification for dismissing evidence for something as obvious as the ""the sky is blue"" out of your ass and insulted the guy pointing it out. I've spent so much of my life pushing back against the idea that average people are cruel, closed-minded, or hateful but seeing so many examples of statements like yours, and seeing them supported, has made that position impossible to continue holding. And what hurts the most is it doesn't matter what I say here. You won't change your mind. The people making posts like this one or posting dismissive comments on it won't change their minds. The more I push back, the more justification in your twisted heads that is to mock, belittle, attack or ignore me. The more I'm honest about my frustration, the worse caricature you'll conjure in your head to justify your belief that I must simply be a terrible person and essentially deserve the treatment I get, even though we could literally be neighbors or classmates and you'd have no idea. I genuinely can't believe how many people go out of their way to dismiss and hate one of the most ostracized demographics. Like I said, I've spent so much of my life resisting the idea that people could be that needlessly cruel. But I've been wrong. I want to tell you to work on yourself, but you won't listen to me. At this point the most I feel I can realistically hope for is that I build up the courage to kill myself before spending an entire life slaving away in a culture that wishes I didn't exist. And that isn't because I need more therapy to gaslight me into pretending that's not the case. It's directly because of people like you.

I think you’re right, I think I let myself get lost in the sauce because I’m personally extremely insecure about a couple things outside of my control and have thus far found zero coping mechanisms that worked, maybe I felt like this post called me out a bit. Sigh, working on it.

Yea the thing is people just naturally want to feel in control of their lives. So they’re unwilling to attribute a lot of circumstances to chance.

I might get some flak for saying this but it’s literally why religions were created! Essentially mass copium perpetuated by peer pressure.

Similarly, people don’t like to acknowledge that they’re lucky in some aspects bc they feel like it detracts from the authenticity of their accomplishments.

For instance, in the context of dating, the average dating coach is probably in the 90% percentile when it comes to things like looks and height, both of which are heavily genetic.

Access to a woman’s body is not a participation trophy for existing. If they are shitty people then they need to either work on themselves or make peace with sucking so much no human wants to be with them. I don’t even mean get fit or rich, just start being a better person is enough for most men. Especially now that so many of them are tater tot antiwomen antisocial assholes, being a good person who respects women as equal humans is probably enough to get laid or find lasting love (depending on your preference).
So what's your alternative? Be miserable and without romance for ever instead of until you've been able to work on yourself to be a worthwhile partner? No one is entitled to have someone date them. Hobbies, self care and exercise of course take time but not money lol. I've been a piss poor grad student for years - I mostly run, play pickup soccer (those cost practically nothing and keep me athletic), play chess, and bake (that actually saves me money making breads) as hobbies and exercise. I also meet new people through those things. And I've been doing all those since 22, not 28 lol. The main barrier for people is that they feel trapped and feel unmotivated to start something new because it always means leaving the comfort zone. Starting to go to a gym, or running or picking up a new sport is tough as hell in the beginning, no doubt. But buying all the incel shit and doing nothing about it but blame women, come on

Or maybe you are rejecting the women who are attracted to you because your standards are unrealistic. Or maybe your personality is lacking and that’s why. Looks are not the only thing people look for in a partner.

'Conventionally attractive women are so shallow and superficial! They're always going after conventionally attractive men, and won't even give a short, unattractive man like me a chance!'

Well, why not shoot your shot with a short, unattractive woman?

Hey dude, i am at Cal too and agree with all that you said here. I’m autistic as well and male, though i am bisexual and into subcultures, which make navigating social and romantic relationships easier than for straight guys who want to make it in the “normal” social currency systems in Berkeley. You can shoot me a DM if you wanna chat. I think that UC Berkeley needs to stop their agenda of “all men are privieleged” for once and take care of its autistic/neurodivergent male population better. It would help everyone. Male privilege is real but it actually puts you at a disadvantage if you are both male and autistic.
Just want to say you're correct. It should be so obvious that it doesn't even need a study to back it up, but people are committed to pretending this isn't true. Even the person responding to and insulting you is making bullshit arguments that don't hold up. They just wanted to dismiss you and said the first thing that popped into their head after scanning the paper for ""limitations"" because they were already committed to doing so. Just want to say, for whatever it's worth, that not everyone here buys into the absurd denialism that most of this sub seems devoted to.
> I might get some flak for saying this but it’s literally why religions were created! Essentially mass copium perpetuated by peer pressure.

That's as may be, but frankly, in terms of understanding life, I would take the religious approach to this topic over Diligent Divide's any day of the week and twice on Sundays:

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
The heterosexual dating/hookup ""economy"" is completely different from the homosexual one.  This is evinced not only by the eye test and anecdotal evidence, but dating app data also confirms this.  I agree that there is more to life than sex, but I just wanted to point this out.  It's up to the individual to determine the role sex plays in their life, but many people aren't even getting there to make that decision (hence the frustration among these men).

Damn, didn’t know they named a whole term after the platform.  I assume it happened after that one guy leaked a bunch of classified US intel.
This talk about a participation trophy is weird....

A relationship isn't something you grind for or ""win"". Life isn't a RPG. Relationships are just two people who like to spend time each other or have to. It could be family, could be friends, could re romantic, etc.


If you don't believe me - look at your own parents. They're likely weren't weren't fit now or then. They likely didn't have a bunch of interesting hobbies. They likely didn't have to dedicate years of their life to be deemed worthy of companionship. 

Look around at average people - who are in relationships. Most of them are not fit, financially secure, particularly interesting or well raveled people, liberal, or antisocial, have communication skills, are particularly intellectual etc...

This whole criteria list of what a man, or whoever has to be or strive to be to get into a relationship just doesn't line up with reality. It's college kids who are predominately upper middle class and upper class projecting onto the rest of society their own value system and insecurities.

A lot of it has the same incel / redpill / tradcon logic with better window dressing. 

This is not to say that self improvement is bad, but it's ***self*** improvement not earning enough good boy/girl points to get let into the dateable person realm.
Let's be honest, there are not that many 5' tall Indian women around here and the few that are here have choices.
>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

Damn you're deep in this man. Literally yes my parents were in great shape when they met, had and still have hobbies that they care about and that *enrich their relationship*. Also someone having hobbies means they are much less likely to become codependent because they have things they care about other than the relationship. 


There's no checklist or anything, but kf course to be in a relationship you need to be a person that someone else would want to be in a relationship with,dude
My parents were perfectly fit when they met, because they were nice people who respected themselves and others. They didn't blame their problems on faceless others or play some numbers game in their head to justify being assholes. 

That's literally it, they were super different otherwise and my mom made more than my dad and was hotter, he was a fat happy guy with revolving jobs who became a sahd in the 90s when people were a lot less nice about subverting gender norms. She liked him because he treated her and others gently and with care.

That's it dude. Just be a good person. Not to get stuff, not to later throw it in someone's face that you were nice to them so they owe you something, just be fucking decent and lots of people will want to be around you.
Let me do my dailies and get back to you on that.
They don’t understand the whole point of having a relationship with all of this nomothetic abstraction talk about the “dating economy”. Don’t bother. They are too out of touch with their feelings and this is where the communication blockage starts. If they can’t let themselves feel, they will never know what their real taste in people is, which is key to not be an incel
You missed the point.

You don't have to be any of the things you described your parents to be to get into a relationship. Conservatives have relationships, abusive people get into readerships, the immature, the broke, the obese, the uninteresting, etc...

Your standards of ""decent"" is loaded beyond reality."

I am an undergraduate demanding for the recall election of ASUC Senator Gabbi Sharp. Based on a number of hateful comments she's made on social media, I write to you to express that she does not represent the values of inclusivity, community, respect, or integrity within the UC Berkeley community. This is a violation of the UC Berkeley Honor Code (created by ASUC) which we all accept when admitted, and one in which she should be held accountable for. As your constituent, I ask that you release a statement condemning her actions and call for her immediate resignation from ASUC. Her bigotry and hate has no place on the UC Berkeley campus.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
I’m a little confused how the image is related…
i have a quick question: when did she make darker skinned black people feel not black enough? Like is there concrete evidence or is this hearsay?

first of all I’m also in the community and I haven’t heard of any of that. i don’t think u should say she’s done things unless there is concrete evidence(like tweets etc). Hearsay is not enough

that has nothing to do with colorism and I’m not sure what that has to do with her tweets at all.

This is why it’s important when you are bullied or abused to go to the police station or call the police (THEY ARE HERE TO HELP YOU) so the law can effectively and legally handle the situation. Other people like school staff will try to protect themselves by not making a fuss or you are not allowed to say exactly who did this to you publicly making it hard for victims to know what to do or stop the harassment or give consequences to the abuser. I know this because it’s happened to me before a few times and the only thing that stopped it was telling my school counselor or telling the police. Telling my RA, arguing with my teacher, or (in my case) telling my family or even relatives was useless.

I really think you need to get much better legal advice regarding doxing or hating-on ANYONE.

18 U.S. Code 2261A regarding stalking is very broad, and doxing and/or threatening is generally held to be a form of stalking.  Even if you do not think you as moderators are personally liable, you at least have a duty to warn and inform users of their potential liability, repeat potential, not certain.

JMH but expensively advised O.
Great takeaway.
So technically this is not allowed either. I was a Gsi for a class two years ago and we made tshirts for our students to get after taking the class. Traditionally the shirts were a version of the seal that was parodied to have subject matter from our class rather than the official graphics. Campus admin found out and threatened to sue us if we went through with printing the shirts; they said the parody seal “degraded the Berkeley brand”. We tried to argue that it was indeed parody and therefore protected, but unfortunately as a group of GSIs we did not have the means to hire a lawyer if it came to that. So they absolutely will try to give you hell about the seal if they find out, even if it is parody.

The post calling out abuse in a BAIR lab. People made some inferences as to who the OP was referring to and ig bc none of that is public info it went against the subreddit rules.
I decided to research to see if what you were saying was real and I came across this link regarding use of basically any Berkeley logo: https://bcbp.berkeley.edu/brand-protection/request-permission

So basically, even the logo we have right now is against UC Berkeley’s trademark policy because of the use of Oski’s hat.

TBH I think r/berkeley not being able to use the seal *just now* is bullshit (this is exactly a case where a negative few ruin something good for everyone), given that multiple campus organizations and even the Chancellor herself, as lulzcakes has noted, frequent the subreddit. The school should be aware by now that this sub’s been using the seal as the logo for a number of years at least. But I do respect the moderation team of this subreddit so I’m not upset that they found a need to change it.

So if that’s the case we can’t allude to the school logo at all, so be it. I now vote for using a certain Tree logo colored green with a red and white letter behind it /s

OP said:
> I am explicitly not naming the person publicly, as I do not want anyone to harass them or the PI involved.

People in the comments (unrelated to the whole incident) tried to figure out who it was, identify the schools he's applying to, and message them about him. This is witch-hunting.
Yup that’s the office that we dealt with. They were pretty annoying. I ended up drawing an original design loosely based on the *parody* seal and they still had comments about it. To me, it’s a reminder that the university is a lot more corporate and brand-oriented than it might seem on the surface.
[deleted]
It's definitely a grey area. I'd point out that OP explicitly didn't want him named or harassed. Additionally, even if it were like Taylor Swift, organizing *random* people to contact Taylor Swift's future employers would be harassment.

If you're involved in the incident, please report it to the correct parties. Otherwise, don't involve yourself."
The Daily Cal needs to stop letting such hateful people write articles on their website. It is purely toxic rhetoric that only serves to polarize our community and students.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9izpzt/the_daily_cal_needs_to_stop_letting_such_hateful/,2018-09-25 22:30:10,"I now rarely post threads outside of /r/wallstreetbets, but I'm writing this today because of a [Sex on Tuesday article](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9iusal/former_asuc_aavp_candidate_rizza_estacio_is_the/) that really bothered me, and one I'm sure many of you have read. This article isn't the first of its kind. Many of you may also remember this classic: [Fucking White Boys](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4qorp7/fucking_white_boys_the_daily_californian/), which ended up getting national attention. 

I'm writing this today because our school deserves better than the utter nonsense and absolute trash coming out of the Daily Cal. 

-

It's a personal pet peeve of mine when people start off with disclaimers, qualifiers, or apologies. In light of what I'm about to write, I feel the need to make sure some of you out there know my background. As a brown man with a turban, I understand white privilege and how harmful it can be to minorities. I'm quite sure that I have, first-hand, experienced and seen more hate towards me and my people than well over 90% of the disenfranchised students who go here. 

I understand white privilege. I understand how difficult it is for people of color (PoC) to fit in, establish their identity, and express their wants and needs in our society. I even understand where these two girls are coming from when they write these sex-related articles because I too experience an extreme attraction to white people (white girls hmu tho). If I could choose, I would choose to be attracted to women of my own race because that would make my parents happy. If I were less emotionally stable and more hateful, perhaps I would have written an article similar to the articles I'm criticizing, but I do understand fully well where these hateful thoughts are coming from. 

I also happen to understand what it means to be a decent human being and not write hateful, provocative **trash** that only serves to alienate our allies and polarize the conversation between perfectly well-meaning individuals. 

Allies of PoC are white people and those with privilege. The vast majority of white people, at least in the Bay Area, are well-meaning individuals. It's not their fault they grew up knowing a privilege that few PoC experience, and it's not their fault they can't understand what it's like to live your life under a veil invisible to others. 

-

What I really dislike is when girls like these call out all white boys and call them 'fuccbois'. You will never see these girls writing articles about black guys calling all black guys fuccbois. Or all guys with turbans fuccbois. Perhaps they should give it a try because I know plenty of 'fuccboi' brown and black dudes. The only difference is that I don't call all brown and black dudes fuccbois. 

In order to teach others, we must welcome people's ignorance. There is no other way around it. The only way to change a person is to accept that many of us don't fully understand the plight of people unlike us.

Some of you may know how often I meet up and talk to strangers. I love talking to strangers no matter who they are or where they come from. I have met with and have had deep conversations with strangers completely different to me, all around the world, and let me tell you. I have *never*, in my life, encountered a hateful white person that I couldn't talk to, reason with, and come to an understanding with. All it takes is a little because everyone can change -- even if they change by only a little. All I do is show them a kind of compassion and love that, it seems, writers at the Daily Cal can't express. 

I once spent 1.5 days on a fishing boat with a fisherman who, without me prompting him, came up to me and told me that he hates brown people and immigrants. If I can spend 1.5 days talking to that racist fisherman and have him come to an understanding, without being toxic, then I'm pretty damn sure these two girls writing articles in the Daily Cal can come to an understanding with the 'fuccbois' who at least know what the word privilege means. 

-

By letting students like these two post such unadulterated trash, the Daily Cal is directly contributing to the polarization of our students and community. White people come up to me and tell me how hard it is for them to fit into PoC circles because of how easily they get labeled racists. White people I don't know walk around me like they're walking on eggshells because that's the type of society these Daily Cal writers are creating. When every white guy who doesn't fully comprehend white privilege is a fuccboi, how do you expect that fuccboi to reach out to you and learn what it means to truly be 'woke'? You will never be woke if you don't understand basic human decency. One thing I'm sure of is that Maggie Lam and Rizza Estacio are not decent human beings and are not in the slightest woke. Preaching hate makes you a hateful person, not woke.

If this post accomplishes anything, I hope it convinces one of these writers to look at themselves in the mirror and realize they are becoming a caricature of who they think they hate. 

And I do honestly hope *something* convinces the Daily Cal to stop posting these kinds of articles. ","On the one hand, I agree with everything you said.

On the other hand, reading the unfiltered bile that gets posted in SoT is one of my favorite weekday pastimes. So I'd be lowkey sad if they stopped.
Rizzas kind of a narcissist though, and I think she’s using social activism to express it. Ironically in the last election she called the Daily Cal racist because it didn’t endorse her and convinced her running mates to put her picture on their campaign pages. I mean even on her first article for SoT it’s immediately bragging to some person she’s cooking with in her mind about how she fucks the dudes this person wanted to. It’s all about how big of a slut she is and how she’s proud of it and how she does just to piss white chicks off. I mean I guess SoT is a column about sexual experiences, but for all the quirks past writers like Michelle had, she wasn’t like “Yes Becky he chose me because I shove glue sticks up my ass and you don’t!”.

You didn't get the memo? Racism isn't bad when it's directed at Whites! It's encouraged. Keep it up, let's accelerate. Double down. More articles. More vitriol. Let's get emboldened. That's the only way to progress.
The thing is, that Fucking White Boys article just does make any sense to me. The logic is weird and her idea or whatever she is trying to express seems so out of context. Like wtf is the relationship between the thesis and the story in the beginning? The quality of the article is just so bad.
I agree.

The heavy/over emphasis of political correctness about inequality (or anything) does not make your article more intelligent or the argument more compelling. It does make the writer seem arrogant and self righteous on their world views, and in turn it gives what right winged media describes as a special snowflake more legitimacy. 

Writings and attitude like this hurts as well as devalue legitimate arguments surrounding PoC and privilege.

Too bad articles like this are by far the most viewed/spread on the Daily Cal, encouraging more toxic news.
> In order to teach others, we must welcome people's ignorance. There is no other way around it. The only way to change a person is to accept that many of us don't fully understand the plight of people unlike us.

People don't say this enough.
I distinguished this thread because I'm a mod with mod privileges that none of you non-mod redditors will ever understand. 
Why even be 'woke', though? What's the point? When a whole group of people _clearly_ hates you for your race, gender, etc., why should you ever try to make _peace_ with them? Being a poor white person at Berkeley is a goddamn nightmare, and as much as I love the school, the curriculum, the opportunities, and the professors, I hate the student body and I don't know how any of that is going to change.
Your dick is big and your ass lovely. I salute you, sir.

Sex on Tuesday has never been good. I'm surprised you let it bother you.
ily
I'm bisexual and a very much relate to this article. The way that East Asian women are sexually objectified by white men is complicated, damaging, and has a unique and particular dynamic to those two groups. 

  
This woman isn't interested in teaching people to be ""woke"", she's just trying to have sex. That's valid. Coming from somebody who's often sexualized in really gross ways, it's not my job to turn my sexual relationships into ""teachable moment"" because of your fucked up fantasies.  It's easier to just avoid fuckbois.   

There was an article written awhile back titled “whites need not apply”. Apparently this half white women thought it was racist when her sexual partner said she had exotic eyes and the article is essentially about not wanting to date whites. Which is fine. To each their own. I don’t like dating black women, but could you imagine the outrage if I had written an article “blacks need not apply”. And to be fair, I think the outrage would be fair. But in this case, an intentionally inflammatory and divisive headline is allowed... 
I hate the Daily Cal and what it passes off as ""journalism"", but at least most of the writers and their articles have class. This one reeks of filth. No established or highly regarded publication would have allowed something like this to be published. 
Short DCAL?
Nothing wrong with it imo. They are just training for their future careers in journalism. Hate drives views.
This nothing compared to the DC 20, 15, even 10 years ago. You guys need to lighten up, you'll give Berkeley a bad name.....lol.
start writing for them then
honestly I really don't see the problem with what she wrote
While this is not a very well written piece, i don’t believe it’s “purely toxic rhetoric”. In fact with regards to the whole “white privileged” thing, I think this is simply a tactic to help achieve equality. She’s doing Malcolm X’s work when you are doing MLK’s. 

Spot on.  

&#x200B;

The most vocal social activist types seem to be in this category; they've hit upon using the vocabulary of social theory and justice to advance personal advantage and power, not because they're all that concerned with others.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the amount of care for ""the community"" is inversely proportional to how often it's invoked in conversation and writing.
You have a way with words

Man I feel old 
I love this post
I remember in the last election when Rizza & Juniperangelica went all batshit crazy about racism when they lost, I commented that they shouldn't be surprised people didn't want to vote for them when their primary policy position was increasing affirmative action that would make it harder for the younger siblings of the Asian American population comprising over 40% of the student body to attend UC Berkeley.  Obviously didn't go down well with them...she probably think discrimination against Asians is a good thing.
I doubt they give a shit unless it affects their funding. This is giving them so many clicks.

Rizza is Asian
You talking about this SoT article, or all of them?
So, we will never completely understand. But we can do our best to *approach* ""complete understanding."" Maybe our rate of convergence is so pathetically slow that we never meaningfully come close to understanding. But maybe our rate of convergence will be such that by the time we raise other young people, and by the time we're in positions of tangible power, that we will be in a position to affect significant positive change.

We won't know when we're in the first situation, or when we're in the second. But it doesn't really matter which situation we're in objectively. What matters (from a moral perspective, I think) is to do what one can, in the moment. If you don't know what ""the best you can do"" is, that's okay! Do better-than-the-status-quo, and develop an expectation for yourself that you will do more than ""average plus epsilon"" in the long term.

lol. I was expecting a vibrator review/ testimonial at the end of that article. 
I didn't say she wasn't....she has a very strange sense of social justice and righteousness that can be seen from the article she wrote that makes it difficult to take her seriously and leaves a lot of us wondering how exactly her behavior is helping to rectify the unequal privilege that exists in society.  
Zero points when I replied. Weird. I mean, yeah pointing out that Rizza is Asian doesn't definitively settle any kind of argument, but in the context of /u/1353513636 's comment it was worth noting.

So to pass time I just stood in front of the Telegraph chess tables and was looking at my phone. A guy (asian, black hair) biked across the intersection and braked his bike in front of me and sorta hovered around. I was kinda confused cuz I thought I was in his way or something. But then he asked me ""you playing chess?"" I gave a rash reply ""what? no"" cuz I wasnt intially thinking of playing then he biked away and after a sec I thought, darn it woulda been a great way to pass time. I tried to catch up to him but he was already down the block.

Anyway I thought how it would've been a fun ""how did you meet story"" if I played chess with him and became friends.

Responding to white liberals being racist,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17ceh0q/responding_to_white_liberals_being_racist/,2023-10-20 08:51:35,">white liberals aren’t the most racist. International Asian students are

An interesting comment from my other post that caught my attention.

original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17bjyuo/genuine\_concern\_why\_are\_white\_liberals\_so\_racist/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17bjyuo/genuine_concern_why_are_white_liberals_so_racist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I agree some (or many) International Asian students are racist but at least a lot of us are not preaching people not to be racist and we lowkey admit we are racist (not just to other colors but just to countries - ex. Korea don't like China as much as China don't like Japan and the hate relationship goes on and on) . One thing that just irritates me is when a white liberal lectures me on colonization/slavery - btw your ancestors were colonizers and btw my ancestors were colonized (not by your ancestors but other Asian colonizers). 

Conservative or liberal- many people are racist and often times liberals don't realize they are just as racist as conservatives. I do want to fight for social justice and sustainable development but there are too many ""liberals"" these days destroying this movement because they think their IQ is 1000 on racial capitalism

I think white ""liberals"" are just racist to smart, successful people. They love struggling, depressed Asians- and I know because I was one. They disregard the fact that the East Asian Tigers developed because we worked hard- diligently, we saved/invested, we sacrificed for the next generation without much welfare spending. Some people think it was some sort of miracle/luck but a lot of Asian cultures value education, grades, competition, accomplishment, economic success, profit, income, property, wealth, money. Yes it's toxic at times but go to Korea/Japan/China/Singapore/HK, we have better public transportation, better institutions, prohibit drugs/guns 

white liberals today are salty white conservatives want to do business with smart, successful Asians. When other minorities here (the Black community, Latin, small Asian countries, etc) get richer than white liberals, it's no longer going to be about the race theory ",">They disregard the fact that the East Asian Tigers developed because we worked hard- diligently, we saved/invested, we sacrificed for the next generation without much welfare spending.

Christ, look into the model minority myth because you fell for it hook, line and sinker. You're not being discriminated against for being too successful. I say this as an Asian person before you come for me.
it sounds like you have a lot of internalized conflict that stems from valuing yourself against the people you racially identify with, and mostly on the basis of stereotypes. the other commenter is right -- the model minority myth is making you feel worse.

how does it do that? it uses these stereotypes to instill even more division.

""You don’t build the left by figuring out which victim has been most victimized; you build it by organizing all the victims."" 

important voices for you to hear:

Cedric J. Robinson

W.E.B. Du Bois

Angela Davis

Stuart Hall

bell hooks
I assume you are Korean simply because you used the term East Asian Tigers quite often, and trust me among all the asians I know only Koreans use this term. I dare say the South Korean working ethic is alien even among East Asians. 

Make one thing clear, the four tigers didn’t get their wealth accumulated because the people could save or worked hard. The fundamental reason to the tigers’ economic boom was they seized the opportunity to attract foreign investment through labour-intensive industries. Syngman Rhee government of SK, Chiang Dynasty of Taiwan, Colonial General Government of Hong Kong and Leegapore were all worlds away from liberalism and democracy. By the time the tigers experienced their economic boom, Japan was already a world leading economic entity, while China was busy with the Cultural Revolution. 

About your opinion on race, social stratification and political alignment - I see some internally conflicting perspectives. In 1978, the Palestinian American academic, Edward E. Said, published an important book called Orientalism. It critically reviewed the limitation of the depiction of the ‘Orient’ from the ‘Occidental’ perspectives. I do believe this book could prove very valuable to your thoughts.
So: why not just be perfectly satisfied with getting the rare privilege of a low cost (not free like it used to be) but still world-class education at Berkeley, go on to get a good-paying job/career, raise a family, save for your kid's education and your retirement, and at some point say thank you to the professors, the university, and millions of CA taxpayers who made it all possible?
Ur delusional. Your beloved East Asia is way ahead of everyone else on the road to extinction.
""As a white liberal racist..."" /s 

not any of those things
As an international student originally from East Asia, I come from a mono-ethnic environment where discriminations are mostly based on interpersonal differences (e.g. income level). It shocks me when i witnessed Berkeley’s great diversity, and I believe that as strangers to this culture, we are not obliged to hide our opinions—even those that may be implicitly discriminative. 

Learn, keep our eyes and ears open. The privileges we gained from our own culture are what we should be always proud of, and those “privileges” are what defined us, allowing us to empathize with people from other races.
I felt the same sentiment as a liberal Asian woman.. OP definitely needs to reflect on their identity and detach it from what they were taught about the model minority myth
lmfao I didn't come at you bruh you're Asian I was talking about white liberals 

do you read?
It's interesting that you bring up WEB DuBois in the context of comparisons to racial stereotypes here because in contemporary social studies he's infamous for his concept of the ""talented tenth"", the idea that only the top 10% of a race is capable of elevating the whole clade. To most people, myself included, that is a pretty absurd idea and even in recognition of our inherent individual differences in intellectual capacity it should be agreed upon that not only the top 10% of each racial class should have agency in society.

He was a great researcher, he expanded studies into low-income minority neighborhoods where other social scientists didn't bother acknowledging and he was a powerful voice in the Pan-African movement but when it comes to the subject of minority education and fighting against internalized racial stereotypes he is not a voice to follow. DuBois's stance is very elitist and it draws lines in the sand based on arbitrary, incalculable differences in individual disposition.
>retirement, and at some point say thank you to the professors, the university, and millions of CA taxpayers who made it all possible?

I thank the Professors, the university and millions of American taxpayers that made my education possible. As an alien non-resident international student (I do pay a lot and my tuition probably support financially struggling American students; also just wanted to clarify that I'm not one of those rich international students because there are middle income Asian parents who send kids to the US for better future- more like an investment) , I really respect this country. In fact, I find the US incredible.

Sadly, I think a lot of people here want to tear down what made America great. Even as a foreigner/non-American, I benefit from America's democracy, freedom, diversity because you Americans made our world safer and better. It's just so so sad that so many people especially Americans are hating America - they do have valid reasons but compared to most great powers in history, America is relatively a virtuous country.

yes Of course, there are problems like inequality, environmental problems, corruption, monopoly,housing crisis,exploitation of workers,racism,sexism,etc . Berkeley is at the forefront of addressing these important issues and I have great pride in being a student here to learn about these problems and find solutions. I love Cal because I have friends with different cultures, backgrounds and ethnicities and I learn so so much from them. I sincerely do but I think we've gotten to a point where some movements/activism  are becoming radical in a way that they suppressing opinions on a very ambiguous fine line. I see people not voicing their true opinion/asking controversial questions from fear of getting angry looks. I'm sad that I have to use an anonymous identity to go on reddit and talk about these issues.

so why am I not perfectly satisfied with my rare privilege? because I didn't come here to pay 70k this year to have the same opinion as my Prof/GSI/like 90% of my brainwashed classmates

I came here to learn how to think critically - a skill that isn't always solely used to get a job and raise a kid
Good for you admitting that liberal women are the ultimate racists these days!!
As an old alumnus and long time CA taxpayer, thank you for that.  

It's true that thinking is not a big part of life for many people, and that fact is a huge problem in a democracy.  That problem was well recognized by our founders, and is part of the reason we are a republic; but the compromise they crafted was and still is very imperfect.  Look at what's happening in the House, look at what has become of our formerly small-l liberal Supreme Court.  The only good news is it seems objectively (to me and you anyway) to be somewhat better than other forms of government, warts and all.  Bottom line: it's the reason we must (no choice) fund public schools and universities.

Lastly, my wish for you is to worry a bit less, go forward with the project you've started to build ""you"": finish school and leverage the gifts you were born with and given to live a happy and full life, and along the way do good for others.  That's fair payback."
Sorry for Trolling,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mt7ryj/sorry_for_trolling/,2021-04-17 23:43:36,"Hey I would like to respond to a post that was made on this subreddit earlier, linked here:

I feel somewhat responsible for this situation, so I think I should say something. There has been a huge mishap here, and I would like to explain what happened.

I like to stalk people on linkedin because who doesn't do some social media stalking now right. Anyways, op viewed the linkedin profile of one of my friends earlier this week under the name Black Cat, which is kind of weird tbh (sorry op). Not to um criticize op's linkedin, but it has zero connections, the name Black Cat, AND said op went to Harvard for engineering. Kind of fishy! Black Cat has the same initials as my name btw. So one of my other friends jokingly said it was my fake linkedin profile that I created to stalk gold account members on linkedin, and for some reason my other friend believed her and sent a troll message to that account, and op replied back with a "";)"", which added to the confusion. I just found out an hour about this whole situation because my friend sent this post to me, and we realized what happened. I would like to say that sexual harassment over the Internet is absolutely real, but this was just a big misunderstanding, and I want to apologize to op. Also, I would like to say that this has no connection with op's earlier post about sexual harassment from a GSI. No hate at all to op; I just want to vindicate my friend.

Here's some screenshot evidence:

My hero!
i made this account bc ik the guy who was accused, and im pretty sure he is gay or at least not into women
This man is not the person who has been bothering me. I should have blacked out the full chat info and just have left the message.

To give you a little bit of background: I am a senior from UC Berkeley and so far I don't have any full time offer yet. I have taken upper divs like CS188 AI, CS189 ML, CS169 Web Dev, CS170 Algorithm and CS174 Random Algorithm and some other EE classes. My CS GPA is around 3.32 and I think I am an average student in Berkeley. I have couple of friends that also havn't have any offer yet, while others took offers that are lower than average. I applied to companies both online and career fair. For online I applied to companies on angel list and some other that I found online doing interesting work. I have not gotten any replies for companies that I applied online. I am definitely a little bit of worried as of now since I don't think we have any more career fairs left (we just had a startup fair last week got 1 reply among 20 companies). I am not sure what I am experiencing is normal, maybe I just suck at interview? which I don't know if that is the case since most of the question I got is binary tree, and linked list question, all pretty straight forward, the hardest was a self balancing tree question from Microsoft.

> Edit: I do get phone screen interviews, at least from career fairs, I get rejected mostly from onsite or third round skype. Don't want to post resume since I have personal projects on there that will reveal who I am. You can actually search the description and find my linkedin.

Does anyone have advice for /u/badinka? Like any resources s/he can take advantage of at Cal?

BTW, the title of the post is in reference to [As a hiring manager I'm baffled that there are several posts regarding not being able to find work, how can it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zv4ws/as_a_hiring_manager_im_baffled_that_there_are/) from /u/garyOakCantIgnore.

> How is it possible that some people can get no interviews, while I can't seem to find anyone to interview?
","I do interviews at Google. Most common problems I see for new grads are:

* lack of in-depth experience with at least one language. At work, you need to be able to learn languages on fly and write *quality* code in those languages. I cannot trust you to do that if in the last 4 years you haven't even mastered one (quality, not quantity is the key here). I don't care what language it is, but you need to demonstrate competence in the language you do the interview in.

* Write easily readable code. A lot of people jump right into coding a partial solution, then try to patch it up in the end with a bunch of spaghetti code. That's how you get messy code and bugs. Don't do it in real software engineering and don't do it in an interview. Take a step back, work through examples, flesh out an algorithm first.

* A lot of new grads are great at solving textbook algorithms problems (e.g. trees, graphs, search, etc). But then they start sucking when presented with an open-ended problem with no exact solution. I am not testing your communication skills and waiting for you to ask me to ""clarify"" the problem. I want to see your intuition and what's the best, most general solution that you can come up with.

A CS education does not make you a good software engineer, though it's certainly a prerequisite. The best way to get these skills is by doing internships or alternatively some other forum where you can write peer-reviewed code (e.g. OSS).
> from what I have experience so far

> there is definitely a scarcity of jobs for new grad

> I am an average student in Berkeley

> most of the question I got is binary tree

This is giving me a headache to read; they're minor mistakes, but they're in pretty much every sentence. I fear what this dude's resume/application materials must look like. I wouldn't want to work with this person.

And this is why the writing requirement is important. And perhaps why Berkeley needs higher standards for English skills. 
Are you an international student that requires sponsorship ? 

If so, that will make it 10 times harder to find a job since the company has to be ready to sponsor your work visa (which again is not guaranteed given that you compete for h1bs with the thousands of outsourced IT slaves) 

You just have to bring more to the table than everyone else competing for the position. that also includes better soft skills and the ability to communicate (which is harder if your native language is not english)
> I am not sure what I am experiencing is normal, maybe I just suck at interview?

Yes, you probably do. Interviewing well is 100% of what gets you the offer. The resume just gets you the interview and then it's up to you to seal the deal. Learning to communicate well (English) and code well are important for that process.

Edit: 

> Don't want to post resume since I have personal projects on there that will reveal who I am. You can actually search the description and find my linkedin.

Then you don't want a job that bad. If you did, you would have found a way to create a censored version to post so that you could get some criticism. Put filler text where the information is and then upload it for formatting and general advice. It won't be as good as if it was the real resume but it will still be useful. This is just an excuse to shield oneself from criticism. The whole post comes off as kind of whiny

> Ok I have to apologize for the title, but I just couldn't resist. 

Yeah, bullshit. You should be able to resist. This person is just looking for people to say everything is okay and those big bad companies are all wrong.

To understand what employers are looking for, the OP should read *Ask the Headhunter*, by Nick Corcodilos. Best book ever on job-hunting, and available for $4 used on Amazon.

Summary: Employers are looking for someone who can understand and solve their problem - their *business* problem, not just their interview question. A job is not like taking a bunch of exams, and it is not a ""reward"" for being a CS grad or whatever - which is the attitude conveyed by the post.

Also read some of Laszlo Bock's posts on interviewing. 

Good luck! 
Do you have ANY actual work experience?
Employers typically won't hire people who only have academic coursework.
If you don't do an unpaid internship or begin temping at a temp agency.
Internships?
Are you a senior or a grad? Do you seriously not understand what a huge difference this is? Most jobs want you to start in a few weeks, unless you are awesome which a senior in college obviously isn't. Only the big corps hire months ahead of time otherwise. 
This is why I recommend doing answering interview questions in Python. It's so easy to write clean code vs something like Java or C++.

Also, being well spoken is a big deal. You can have good ideas but if you can't communicate them then what good are they?

I know Google has to have some good self-taught developers.

S/he would settle for 70-88k in SF so probably somewhere in that ballpark.
I'm guessing /u/badinka doesn't have any internships since s/he didn't mention doing any.

Can CS seniors graduating in May get internships after graduation if they're not pursuing grad school?

""Grad"" should be ""grads"".
It should be ""at Berkeley""; you study ""at"" a University, not ""in"" a University. 

Idiomatic use of prepositions in English is a pain in the ass and I would totally overlook one or two of these (likely not even notice), but I'm sure you can see that this guy's post taken as a whole is pretty bad.

Oops, I misread your comment! I'll leave this here in case anyone wonders about that one as well. For the second one, it should be ""for new grads"" - the scarcity affects everyone, not just one grad. 
Of course they can, but new grads typically want a job for more than 2-3 months...
Yes, they can. A friend of mine did an internship after he graduated in EECS because he couldn't find a job either. He has one now.
and what kind of company was it? The kind that recruits continuously? 

> You condescend in the first half of your comment and make broad assumptions in the second half. Might I suggest some light reading: http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette[1] 

And what do you call that? If cscalli was standing in front of me I would've said the same thing. People treat CS jobs on this subreddit like it's grad school. There's zero shame in getting a job in June.
> I'd say that I can rule out at least 75% of candidates within the first 10 minutes of the interview and/or by the 10th line of code that they write.

Out of curiosity, assuming I passed a first-round phone screen or coding challenge, what could be reasoning for why I'm rejected after an onsite? I'm assuming my code should at least be decent if I passed the phone interview. 
Sorry I meant

Fixed, sorry!
Right, but that particular use of the indefinite article does not function to define one individual, but indexes a feature as representative of all members of a group. ""Life is hard for a single mom"" clearly entails all single moms and not one particular single mom, though it could be used in discourse with reference to one mom or a group of moms.

This is the usual function of an [indefinite article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_%28grammar%29#Indefinite_article) (""An indefinite article indicates that its noun is not a particular one (or ones) identifiable to the listener. It may be something that the speaker is mentioning for the first time, or its precise identity may be irrelevant or hypothetical, or the speaker may be making a general statement about any such thing."")

Definiteness is weird. I'm guessing the original poster and /u/grammarwhat speak languages without a definite/indefinite distinction and with minimal marking of number - Korean or Chinese?
Interesting post... Thanks!
Ehhh, in my experience, they haven't been much lower. I've personally found them similar in terms of difficulty, I think (on average, maybe just a little harder?) - maybe I do worse on them, though? 
thanks, didn't catch that one
I understand what you're saying, but as a native speaker, ""there is definitely a scarcity of jobs for a new grad"" is totally fine if your goal is to avoid sounding weird
Yes, it is - because it references *group* of people with one certain trait rather than an individual. I think you're misunderstanding; I was explaining why using an indefinite article DOES work. "

This is really odd, because by now both these threads had already fallen off the /r/berkeley page and people should have stopped voting on them. After a tipoff, I found out that both these threads were posted to /r/ShitRedditSays [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/4drji0/its_the_result_of_how_asian_culture_values/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/4driss/and_even_after_hes_proven_not_guilty_will_there/).

So be warned, if you see troll-ey posters about, be aware they might be brigading from SRS.","But wait, isn't brigading against the rules of reddit? Surely the admins will fix this /s
Hey there. I'm the one who's been posting these. And the thing is, I'm not afraid of saying that. Why? Because we're *not brigading*. None of the comment scores have gone down since I linked to them, and I don't think anyone has even come through to comment on them.

So, not brigading, just complaining. Which, as far as I can tell, is perfectly allowed.
lol I don't understand. why would SRS brigade the subreddit of one of the most liberal colleges in the nation.
I've never understood why the admins suck SRS's dick so much.  They get on every other subreddit's ass about brigading but SRS gets a free pass because the admins like it for some reason.

Makes me kinda wish voat actually caught on.
Why don't you use NP links then?
Why not reply to the comments you disagree with?  It would be much more constructive than telling a random third party.
>we're not brigading. [sic]

**Bull. Shit. SRS is absolutely upvote brigading.** After you posted that thread to SRS my comments there ""magically"" gained +20 comment karma for a thread that was completely off the /r/berkeley front page. People whined too much about the SRS downvote brigade SRS started upvoting to pretend they never downvote. This is clear vote manipulation which is against reddit rules. The official reddit policy is that [**participating in any thread linked to another subreddit is a shadowbannable offense**](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/40b0c1/please_use_np_links_when_linking_to_other/). Why is SRS exempt from this rule?

Why do you think /r/bestof switched to np links, after [blatant 3000 point vote manipulation](https://np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/243j64/upsychopathic_rhino_breaks_down_and_debunks_and/)?

>None of the comment scores have gone down since I linked to them

Nope. SRS downvoted the shit out of this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4demfa/racism_against_blacks_at_cal/d1tss9j 

> don't think anyone has even come through to comment on them [sic]

Are you fucking blind? One look at the brigaded threads and it's nearly all the comments there are from random SRS shitposters.

Look the [thread](https://reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4demfa/racism_against_blacks_at_cal/d1qa6d9) you posted to SRS. There are *Six* comments from people who do not regularly post on /r/berkeley. In fact, many of those six have **never even commented on /r/berkeley before**. In the [other thread](https://reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4df7tt/mutual_flirtation_yann_hufnagel_presented_900/d1qu14b) it's the same situation. Many of those posters have never posted on /r/berkeley before.

How in any way, is this 1) not a violation of reddit's rules and 2) does this not disrupt discussion in this subreddit.

Because even though Berkeley is supposed to be left-leaning and open-minded, the comments stemming from this sub are often not.
[All the SRS posts are submitted by the same guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/search?q=url%3A%2Fr%2Fberkeley&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all). The posts started around 5 months ago. Since theres none from the previous school year, whoever's posting them is probably an edgy freshman who's got nothing better to do.
Because they're annoying, but don't do anything if someone actually wants to brigade.
If I think it's worth it I do.
So let me get this straight. Some of the posts were upvoted and some were downvoted, and either way it's SRS's fault?
left leaning yes, open minded no
Then why is it that every other major subreddit requires them to appease the admins? Why is SRS special? I don't have any issue with the content of the sub, in fact I think you are right about NP links not accomplishing anything, I just don't get why all other subs don't get the same licenses to not use them as SRS does.
Participating in any thread linked to another subreddit is against reddit's sitewide rules. Do you have trouble understanding this? Below is an admin speaking officially on this topic. This should clarify any deficiencies in your understanding.

>From Ocrasorm [A] via /r/reddit.com sent 5 days ago Hey there. It is nothing major in the grand scheme of things but we need to take action against accounts that brigade into another subreddit. **Brigades happen when users follow a link from one subreddit (or site) in to another and votes on a comment or post. This is a form of vote manipulation as it gives an inorganic score to the content. We protect subreddits from this because they need to be free to talk about what they like, without influence from outside sources.** In this case you follow the below link from /r/china and voted on content in /r/worldnews. This type of voting is not organic. https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3zf2cq/latest_update_kidnapped_bookseller_in_hong_kong/ If we allowed this then users would just use subreddit to try and influence voting all over the site.

That gives a clear definition of what brigading is, and why it is against reddit rules. For some reason you think what SRS is doing does not qualify, can you elaborate? In my opinion, SRS is clearly flaunting theses rules intended to protect the comment quality of this site.
The admins actually aren't fans of NP links. They vary by linked subreddit, don't always work, and often cause errors. I'll see if I can find a link to them talking about it.

Edit: [they don't officially support them](http://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/396upx/costco_karma_scam_exposed_a_visual_tutorial_on/cs19jm5)
The admins have repeatedly said that SRS doesn't brigade, lol.
>The admins said that SRS doesn't brigade

This means nothing without evidence. AFAIK, the admins have never said this. Please link to comment where a reddit admin states that SRS has never brigaded; otherwise, your comment is worthless.
Well I'd imagine that the admins have access to more useful information than the average user and here you [go](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/czfg0u4). Looks like they have actually said stuff about this, SRS is just a really polarizing subject for reddit."

Stolen bike,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qa830/stolen_bike/,2012-02-28 13:16:47,"I know this is a long shot, but I figured I may as well post it.  My bike was stolen from the racks in the Unit 1 courtyard last night. It is a large frame Globe hybrid.  It's black, missing the front wheel, had a wire rack on the back with a basket on the right side, all black.  It wasn't registered, but the sticker telling me to register is still on the frame.  There's also a mount for a U-lock on the frame and it looks pretty new.  If anyone sees anything like it, please contact me here! 

Thanks r/Berkeley!","Check the swap meet at Ashby BART on Sunday and head over to Karim's Cyclery on Telegraph. He only deals in stolen goods.
I'll make sure to keep my eyes peeled. My condolences, losing a bike just really sucks.
check craigslist too
Out of curiosity of the safety of my own bike, how was it locked up?

> only deals in stolen goods. 
 
And no one tries to bust him? 
I think he is pretty dialed though.. like his bike won't see the light of day up here for a while and he'll sell it months from now when its forgotten.   Or its in a truck in the south bay already waitin for the flea market.  
Dude that runs karim's has been havin yard sales at his place on Ashby near Shattuck / Adeline on the weekends.  Peeked inside his place and it is also full of bikes. Sketchy hording thieving dude.
If you're in Unit 1, you put your front wheel from one of [these](http://www.parkabike.com/img_prod/inverted-U-bike-rack_hrm6_Park-a-Bike.jpg) but they're turned horizontally. I put my U lock through one of the tongs of the through the fork of my bike and the spokes of the wheel, kind of like[ this, although it's very badly drawn.](http://i.imgur.com/fI0Tm.png) So basically they just undid my front wheel and slid the rest of it out. Just make sure that your lock always goes through the actual frame, and don't think that U-locking your wheel and using a cable to go through the rest will deter thieves, like I did.
I checked him out today, sketchiest place I've ever been. His store was literally filled with bikes, you couldn't even walk in.  He had a bunch of really crappy old bikes outside, and it didn't look like mine was in there.  I'll definitely check out the swap meet, thanks!
They've tried, but none of the bikes he has have been registered as stolen. My guess is he looks up the serial, and if they're stolen, he sells em elsewhere.

I saw a really shady looking guy ride up with a $1000 bike, and Karim just took it. It was obvious they had these ""transactions"" often.
Successful criminals aren't that stupid. Besides, stolen bicycles are hardly a priority for the police. The resources and manhours necessary for a sting operation would likely not be worth it to BPD.
God, those suck. I tried one of those at Unit 2 for a few hours and felt super sketchy leaving even my beater bike there.

For the future though, make sure that when you're locking your bike, put your U-lock through the back wheel, part of the frame (either the seat stays or the seat tube), and then finally to the bike rack itself. Use your cable to secure only your front wheel to the U-lock, since the front wheel is cheaper to replace than the rest of the bike. (You generally do this by shoving your bike in backwards so you can lock the rear wheel to the rack, while everyone else's is usually facing forward like yours was. Don't be like them.) If you can't get the frame+wheel to lock to the rack because they don't fit in your U-lock, then lock only your rear wheel to the rack, but make sure the lock is inside the bike frame's rear triangle- they can unbolt the rear wheel but the lock will prevent them from separating the wheel and frame. 

My condolences- I hope you never experience this again!
also, check the Laney flea market near Lake Merritt.  more stolen bikes show up there than at Ashby.
There is a skinny white dude in town that does not look too disimilar to ""karim""  that I see with different bikes all the time.  Happened to be behind him on my slow commute home once... He was peering down each and every driveway.  See him hovering around the Ashby market a lot on bikes that he just looks dumb on.  Like he is in beater jeans and wrecked steal toe boots, on a slick road bike with tiny clipless pedals.  Often wonder if he is one of karim's dudes.
Yeah, I think I learned my lesson! I'll probably just bring a bike up from home next year and bring it in to my apartment.  Thanks for the advice!
I lock my bike exactly as Jiforce explains. Many people on campus lock it up front wheel first, but like Jiforce says, don't be like these people. U lock  locks back wheel, frame, and bike rack. Cable goes through front wheel and U lock."
Shewchuk and the problematic rise of incels,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bjp72e/shewchuk_and_the_problematic_rise_of_incels/,2024-03-20 14:37:35,"In light of the events that happened yesterday, I think it’s becoming increasingly important to discuss why inceldom has become mainstream in today’s age and what can be done to address it. I do not in any way condone Schewchuk's actions and I feel sorry for the women in his class. This post (https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bj2c9s/the\_problem\_with\_shewchuks\_post\_a\_womans/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3) eloquently illustrates the issues his remarks pose. His dismissal from the university would be completely justified. However, as a former, de-radicalized incel, I believe this does not constitute a long-term solution to inceldom and its root causes. 

Firstly, the way the term incel is used colloquially differs significantly from what the everyday incel looks like. Deriving from ""involuntary celibate,"" the majority of incels are not women-hating, lazy, narcissistic virgins as the media would like you to believe, but are really just your average joe. Not particularly handsome nor smart, but also not devoid of ambition and other desirable traits. More specifically, incels exist on a spectrum, with guys like the two from yesterday lying towards the more extreme end, while the rest are really just yearning for companionship in the form of romance. You might be thinking, ""but wouldn't a lot of guys I know fit into the incel label then?"" and you'd be absolutely correct. Studies show that upwards of a third of young men haven't had sex in the past year and a similar amount are unwillingly single (figures that have steadily increased over the years), and thus it is safe to say that a lot of the guys you meet nowadays are technically incels. But again, that doesn't mean they hate women, *yet*. 

Over the last decade, obscure topics that only appeared on misogynistic 4chan forums have now become mainstream (think looksmaxxing) as the public has become more and more exposed to radical ideas through social media (think Andrew Tate). Depending on which brainwashing philosophy a guy is exposed to, the process of radicalization is known as taking the red pill (i.e. women only go for rich/handsome/strong men) or taking the black pill (women *only* care about looks). You might think this is the stupidest thing ever and how could any guy believe this crap, but speaking from experience I will tell you that a lot of guys don't have any girl friends and as such are only exposed to a woman's beliefs on dating through the biased lens of social media. A lens that often consists of Andrew Tate and other guys inviting objectively stupid/shallow women on their shows and parading them as the average woman, all while silencing the normal ones that they 'mistakenly' invited. And since these are the *only* girls their own age they are exposed to, guys aren't aware of this extreme sampling bias, and will internalize the idea that the reason they can’t find love is because they are below 6ft tall, don't make $200k/yr or lack some other immutable trait that only a small minority of men possess.

And thus, the coping begins. Without anyone to properly guide them, these lonely men will further spiral down a rabbit hole of engaging more and more with these toxic communities that validate their insecurities. They will detach from reality, never to realize that most women are normal and that there are just as many awful guys as there are awful women (let them date each other). Some of the men will cope by blaming women and becoming the vocal and vile creatures shown in the media. Most others (I think) will come to blame themselves, and embark on a futile endeavor to reach the impossible standards set out by social media (gym, looksmaxxing, money, etc.). Either way, their mental health will take a plunge and only get worse with time as, again, they often lack spaces in which they can express themselves freely and have their ideas challenged by good role models.

As I write this, I want to reiterate that I'm not excusing/justifying these people's behavior, I am merely explaining why I believe it happens. If I had to place the blame on someone, I'd say everyone (society, men as a whole and even a minority of women) are accountable.

While this might not seem like a big deal now, I don't see any measures to prevent this from getting worse, and there are already hints of things going downhill other than what we saw yesterday. Men’s mental health is pretty bad right now and as such it doesn’t surprise me when my girl friends complain about never being approached or dating in general. I'd like to end this piece with some advice for different groups. Keep in mind that the goal isn’t to find a companion for every incel (this line of thinking has many issues like, for starters, that no one is entitled to a girlfriend) but rather to support them socially and emotionally in an effort to de-radicalize them.

To Incels: Get off social media NOW and become friends with women around you (you'll find it hard to hate them once you know them, I promise). Don't seek romance with them (but if it happens then great) and remember that they are people with their own wants and feelings. Realize the logical flaws in redpill ideas (I can help debunk below if needed) but don't ignore the value of self-improvement that is also preached (it helps with women but that is not the purpose). Be kind to yourself and build a good support system where you can open up about your emotions. Be patient when it comes to love, and if I had to recommend a philosophy to follow instead of redpill bullshit, read up on stoicism.

To women: Honestly it isn't fair for me to give advice when y'all are just victims. You don’t inherently have a moral obligation to help men, but doing so is very much appreciated. Firstly, be aware that there are a lot more guys than you think around you who are becoming very lonely and lacking in self-esteem (I know many guys whose bravado would fool you into believing they don't constantly worry about their image). As such, try not to dismiss their issues regardless of your own and your empathy will be reciprocated. 

To non-incel guys: Stop with toxic masculinity and perpetuating the idea that a man’s worth is inherently tied to his ability to 'pull'. It’s gross.

As long as this post is, there’s a lot I left out so I'd love to elaborate on any point/controversial take I made. I'd like to reiterate that women do not have a responsibility to support men nor to lower their standards for them. I’d also like to emphasize that while I believe most incels don’t wish badly upon women, it is important to recognize that there are many who do and to punish them accordingly. I wanted to talk about this because it seems like a silent issue that no one is addressing and instances like yesterday will recur until we take proper action. **The takeaway from this isn't that Shewchuk should be forgiven but rather what can we do to provide men with much-needed emotional support so that they don’t feel alienated and go looking for it in the wrong places.** 

Thank you.","bro ended his mewing streak to talk abt this
TLDR.  Provide tangible support: get off the computer and invite a handful of incels of both sexes out for no-host beer and pizza and establish an old fashioned group blind date / mixer.  It's a start.

>""I do not in any way condone Schewchuk's actions and I feel sorry for the women in his class...  His dismissal from the university would be completely justified.""

Firing Schewchuk would not be justified by his post on Ed. That would be a wildly disproportionate response, and flies in the face of basic job protections we all ought to support for employees.
I truly enjoyed reading your post! As we become increasingly more vocal about our feelings of low self esteem, it's important that we A. find the proper language to communicate these feelings and B. properly address the underlying issues with the appropriate treatment. A lot of what you've written seems to align with what I've been through on my own journey. I wouldn't say that I was an 'incel' but my low self esteem got so low that I believe that I became dangerously close to becoming one.
[deleted]
I think it's very dangerous how incel rhetoric and ideas is bleeding into mainstream. 

Not having sex doesn't make one an incel. We have single, virgin, bachelor, unlucky in love and so on but incels want you believe they don't exist anymore just to make it seem that all men are incels or at least started as one. At the core it's gender insecurity because incels believe women **make** men. Woman is a woman but man is someone who has a woman. To them having a woman is instant gender validation to show off to other men ""the manliness"".

Men need feminist movent women had. Truth is men were sleeping while women fraught for women's rights so now they have masculinity crisis because old school gender norms doesn't work for men anymore because women moved on and men are jealous of women's freedom to express their gender as they like while retaining their womanhood. Men are not stupid. They see toxic masculinity is toxic but until men en masse agree that ""man is a man"" all these sexist extremist ideas and movements will continue to endanger us all.
Yo, Berkeley woman in STEM here. From your writing and your responses in threads referring to the male experience with articles like ""us,"" I am assuming you identify as male, or from the ""y'all are just the victims,"" at least don't identify as female. Thus, I can't describe how glad it makes me feel to read a post like yours, so eloquently and clearly breaking these things down, and from your perspective. So – I thank you, deeply.   


In reality, we as women **do** see these dynamics (the lack of spaces for men to receive emotional support and express themselves), as we are forced to reckon with and be keenly aware of *all* systems that perpetuate our endless subjection to harmful rhetoric and harassment. **Nevertheless** **we do see that men are hurting**. How could we not? And we **do** value and empathize with that pain; that pain is human, and if we cannot acknowledge the devastating impact of what you describe in your post, then we are not exercising our own humanity. **We do want men to get emotional support** (like really really want that)**.**.. because (a) that's great in general, as we all deserve to not feel alone, and benefit from space to process and face our pain, and (b) that means a lower likelihood of us women experiencing some potentially career-altering moment of offense or upset. **We do know that it's ""not all men,""** from experience. But unfortunately, due to repeated offense, I think we become used to misogynistic perception so much that we generally *expect* it – something many of us unconsciously are required to do to protect ourselves. And yet, while this may leave us naturally in the defensive, or skeptical, **we don't hate men until we know men hate us** (where ""hate"" implies any form of sexism.) And even then, we can't really hate these men. We lament how they make us uncomfortable and sour our experience in a scientific discipline we love. We feel angry and defeated when harassment is so repeated or extreme that it makes us consider fully leaving a field we're really good at. But in the end, we (at least I) feel sad, and sorry for these men; we know that their prejudice is borne from pain, misinformation, and whatever toxic-masculine systems have brutalized them to this point. That pain is real. Our society is fucked up and no one is a winner.  

&#x200B;

But this is all why the advice to ""make friends with women around you"" is gold. Again, we don't hate men because they are men. First, we want to be seen as the people, classmates, collaborators, colleagues, and potential friends we are (*outside* of being romantic or sexual interests). Second: to me, it seems like making friends with a woman without expecting or seeking romance is a surefire way to liberate the male mind from misogyny and just... learn. Absorb. Observe. Empathize. Appreciate. Cross-reference. Grow...   


So thank you OP, for your words, for the amount of genuine time and concern that went into your post, and for all the obvious work you've done on yourself. It's impressive. And it gives us women hope. :D
I wonder how you came to the conclusion that the guys in the Ed comments were incels?  

One of them talked about how CS took away effectively all of his free time and he likely wouldn't get a gf until after graduation. That read to me like your typical ""staying on top of CS work = no life"" type of rant. There's nothing in that post that suggest the kind of women blaming you'd expect in an ""incel"".

It doesn't help that you're playing semantics here: ""they're are technically \`incel\` because incel = involuntary celibate!!"". 

Well, are you going to tell me now that people who, say, have difficulty finding a partner because of their HIV status are incels? No. They gay dating pool is small, and even smaller for HIV+ people (not everyone is comfortable with U=U yet). That HIV+ people have a harder time finding a partner is a consequence of statistics, not necessarily them being incels. Deliberately ignoring the connotation associated with \`incel\` (i.e. women blaming) just so that you can write an inflammatory post is honestly ridiculous.

Yea, some of them talked about their height for sure but, again, nothing suggest the kind of quintessential women hating associated with \`incel\`. In fact, the comment was obviously meant to be a nonsensical, not-to-be-taken-seriously rant. ""About to expire""? You seriously took the comment literally after reading that?
We have to all be very careful. Incels, “the extreme women hating ones”, can have the potential to become more and more dangerous overtime. But the tough thing is there is not much we can do about it. Those influencers that activate them will almost always find a way to leak through. The best way is to adjust the culture as a whole like what was mentioned in this post. Love cannot happen until one becomes secure and loves themselves.

Aight boys, I’m coming out the closet. Today, I announce that I am Incel.

i personally think the word ""problematic"" should make a swift exit from our general vocabulary. nothing else i feel like commenting on here
You can’t use rhetorics like “toxic masculinity” “women are all victims” and expect incels to follow your advice. You’re part of the problem. Get some education on not using sexist terms and being hypocritical
I ain’t readin all that. I’m happy for you though or sorry that happened
> I'd like to reiterate that women do not have a responsibility to support men nor to lower their standards for them. 

I have a lot of problems with your post, but I'll focus on just this one: when it comes to (straight) dating, you say that **women shouldn't ""lower their standards,""** but if a straight guy were to make a parallel statement [edit: about male standards], ""incel"" and a hundred other insults are heaped upon him.

Can you see the problem?
You know what, I think this is a great post. Very fair and insightful, and I am sure a lot of my peers could benefit from reading this. Thank you for taking your time to write this out.
i feel like this is a really mature post discussing some of the root causes that radicalize young men and create unrest. great job :) i think a lot of people could benefit by reading this and expanding their perspective
Hi OP!  


Are you familiar with Dr K in the gaming/streaming space? He's one of the few psychiatrists in the space that has a lot of insights into these issues and is one of the few of them actually talking coherently about it like you are.    


[Here is a clip from a recent podcast he did talking about the incel/redpill movement and why men gravitate towards it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCCmdUNGukY)   


[Here is a different clip of the same podcast talking about the modern day experience for many men and how suicide is on the rise for men.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn-cdabIb-0)   


[Here is a link to the full podcast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_5N_aDu3u0)  


I think several people might gain some insight here from his words if they didn't want to read your full post.
What’s the appeal of Andrew Tate?
So basically this has been a social issue around us (and got amplified by the pandemic) but Schewchuk’s Ed post just ignited the whole thing.
All you feminists complaining about incels could literally just solve the problem by fucking them
>and perpetuating the idea that a man’s worth is inherently tied to his ability to 'pull'

It absolutely does in both directions, and you can't properly characterize the problem without understanding this
Holy Yapper. You don’t got a midterm/project/assignment that deserves more attention?

This is good stuff. Very insightful 4 real
Bla bla bla . Not sure what you’re on but my girl was riding me an hour back till exhaustion. No incels in this household.
Any official announcements regarding this issue? Will he get fired? And as I know, 189 for this semester hasn’t been finished, so will they change the course staff halfway?

That was a very thoughtful and well articulated post. I agree from experience with almost all of it. But, I don’t think dismissing Shewchuck would be “completely justified”. It feels like you have to say that to convince the woke that you’re on their side because everything else you said makes perfect sense. Shewchuck said something stupid and insensitive and he was asked to apologize for it and he did. We need to get rid of this idea that if someone slips up and says something dumb, and who among us is without sin here, that their lifelong career should be destroyed forever. I believe in redemption and forgiveness. If there were a clear pattern of blatant misogyny over a period of time despite warnings to stop that would be a completely different story. But this idea that one post and you’re gone is too much. Especially one that he obviously didn’t give too much thought to. (I’m sure it wasn’t intended “for the record” or to become a meme). It’s not something all of us in the Bay Area haven’t heard a million times before, that dating is hard in Man Jose cuz of so many male tech workers. If you heard it at a party you wouldn’t give it a second thought, it’s just cuz it’s coming from a prof. That doesnt excuse it, he definitely should have been aware of his role representing Berkeley and not said it , but I don’t immediately equate that with a “completely justified” destruction of his life. 

Also how do we know he’s an incel? I thought he was older and married, I don’t think we can conclude from his comment that he’s involuntarily celibate so maybe we shouldn’t even use that term. The guy offering $10 for introductions to girls probably is but Shewchuck did not say that.
Am not readn all dat
Yall really need to stop watching porn and learn how to have a conversation with other people. Thats a good start, not everyone is able to have great conversations “winging it” - you have to practice, just like all things in life.

Also, stop acting like yall are Steph curry hitting 3’s, your success rate isn’t going to be 60% - so you are going to get shot down trying. This is part of the process of learning, you wont be successful at everything you try initially.

Forget this trash. The only way to get a gf in the bay area is by tiptoe-maxxing
I hate to be the party pooper, but as someone who actually dated an incel, had a long term relationship with him, and ended up being severely abused by him - social interaction and dating do not “cure” an incel. And pizza party is not going to change the ideology that makes them dangerous misogynists.
Better yet: join a co-op!
[deleted]
Incels of both sexes? That’s not really how dating works. Women can practically get sex any time they want from anyone they want. That’s a bit of an exaggeration of course, but in general incel genders are very unbalanced.
Hot take: incel is just another word for insecure men. The best men and women to have as co-workers are stably married working parents. Way more considerate and down to earth than the rest of the population. The majority of my company are stably married working parents and WLB is great, promo, pay, and equity are also great, no toxicity whatsoever.
“yapmaxxed” is crazy 😭
bro thought he said sumn too 😂
I’m glad you said this and that it got upvoted. People seem to have very little understanding of what tenure and the first amendment actually mean (or academic freedom for that matter).  It was certainly an inappropriate and downright bizarre thing to say, but a world where saying offensive things or being unlikable to a vocal group gets you fired is… not a world id like to live in. Everyone on planet earth is guilty of saying offensive things, or being unlikable at times, whether they’d like to admit it or not.
Valid, although it seems he got off with a quick slap on the wrist which is also ridiculous.
Basic job protections include the right to not be sexually harassed or discriminated against. They don't include the right to be misogynistic to students. 

Shewchuk should've been fired already.
That's not even close to what I'm saying. I'm saying there needs to be societal changes such that men have more spaces to express themselves, have their ideas challenged, and their emotions dealt with in a healthy way. In general, many guys feel absolutely trapped in life right now and no one validates these feelings other than radical forums. Providing men with better spaces so they don't go down the rabbit hole seems like a good solution to me, but it is not the only one.
*Truth is* ***men were sleeping while women fraught for women's rights*** *so now they have masculinity crisis because old school gender norms doesn't work for men anymore because women moved on and men are jealous of women's freedom to express their gender as they like while retaining their womanhood.* 

This is true. And it was here at Cal, too. We're all supposed to worship the Free Speech Movement and it was profoundly important...but there was a lot of ingrained sexism in it, as well. Many of the male students involved assumed their gender should be in charge and make the decisions, and women who were active participants were often typecast by the men as support staff--their role was seen as cooking food and cleaning apartments for the men who were having profound intellectual discussions with other men, typing up reports, passing out flyers on picket lines, and--frankly--providing sex for the male ""leaders"". (David Lance Goines, an undergrad at the time who became an important artist / designer and wrote a book about the FSM decades later, was candid and honest enough to admit that one of the main reasons he became active in the FSM was that he thought it would give him a better chance of having sex.)

Various women's rights movements emerged, in part, in the aftermath of the FSM as women who had participated in it and other early 60s movements (including Civil Rights, anti-nuclear, anti-war, environmental) thought about being regarded as second class activists, and determined to do something about it.

At a different age level, some of the same factors played out in the environmental movement. Three older women, including the wife of UC President Clark Kerr, became alarmed in the early 1960s that San Francisco Bay was being used as a dump and filled at such a rate that within a few decades it would almost completely disappear beneath landfill. They met with established environmental groups--all led by men--and the male leaders told them patronizingly, we're really busy with more important things. So the three women formed their own organization--and, within a few years, won major environmental victories and galvanized a whole new branch of the environmental movement.
Women benefit far more from hypergamy than men, no 10 paragraph essay is gonna change that buddy
There is a widening gap between males and females in society. In the presence of that gap, I'd imagine (and I do sorta see it) more men not bothering to pursue women for validation and instead ""focusing"" on themselves + a general disdain of women.. They could internally still want gender validation, but it's kind of complicated. I figure that the average incel attitude these days is ""They don't like us, so why bother?"" Under that attitude, it doesn't make sense to pursue people who you think don't like you. This gender gap could be a pretty bad vicious cycle, because at a certain point you are no longer trying to resist the other gender on the basis of lived experiences but rather on preconceived biases and fears.
>Men need feminist movent women had.

There actually was (and is) a parallel movement that developed in the 60’s/70’s for this exact purpose, called [Men’s Liberation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_liberation_movement#:~:text=The%20men's%20liberation%20movement%2C%20as,counterculture%2C%20women's%20and%20gay%20liberation). Although I’ve never encountered it in the wild, there is an active community here at /r/menslib . It leans solidly left politically, and explicitly supports feminism. As a whole, you could say it focuses on examining men’s issues from the perspective of how traditional male roles / expectations are harmful to men and society.
It’s bad. Got into a bit of online comment battle with a long time friend, who is always seen as open minded and kind. He had gone to see Jordan let Peterson speak, because, Bible stuff or whatever. Friend is pretty devout, but it’s in a non-problematic way. My screenname should help give clues to my take on the good word, but he and I always got along in spite of those differences. 

And, when I mentioned some of Peterson’s pretty fucking awful ideas regarding women and trans people, said friend repeatedly lobbed ad hominem arguments, only barely acknowledging that Peterson had made some “challenging” (he used quotes) statements in the past. Then dragging any sources I used, and not the actual content. Like, he went hard trying to dodge addressing the fact that Peterson thinks that the way to stop incels from driving vans into crowds of people and such is to involuntarily dole out women to them like brood mares

That was incredibly indicative of how effective this sort of sinister propaganda is. Just sneak it in there with a bunch of other vaguely academic “oh. That kinda makes sense” stuff, and suddenly they don’t taste the shit in the sandwich. 

The fucked up part is that in isolation from the whole incel “movement”, a lot of these dudes might just have managed to figure shit out like everyone else had to. 

We need an 80s teen-movie style makeover therapy rehab clinic for incels. Everything mut happen as a montage, perhaps to “don’t stop me now” by Queen.
Thank you for the response, it means a lot :)
""Incel"" is the socially acceptable way to attack men who don't conform to social stereotypes of popularity and attractiveness (ESPECIALLY neurodivergent men) and dismiss anyone you disagree with without having to consider anything they said or provide a reasoned counter-argument to their position. It's just a meaningless buzzword/insult at this point. Liberals use it the same way right-wingers call anyone they don't like a ""pedo"" or a ""groomer.""
Shewchuk is a passport bro, that is very much incel behavior. Paying people to meet friends (and double if they are a girl) and using language like ""expire"" when talking about women is incel behavior. I didn't infer that the other guys in the comments are incels so don't strawman, although I will say that a nontrivial amount of eecs kids are incels (I would know, I take classes with them). Of course HIV+ ppl aren't incels although they technically fit the definition, but you're bringing up edge cases that aren't relevant to what I'm talking about.
I think there's more we can do about it than people think and at the very least that some of their actions were def preventable.
Anything in the extreme is dangerous over time, the female ally or male feminist has a startling amount of sexual assault, the real issue is frustrated people (men) who feel entitled by action or by birth right to someone else’s attention or affection.

A part of this is also driven by unrealistic expectations from women, the swipe right culture has far too many women competing for the top 10% of men, rather than traditionally picking from the limited selection at the few bars they frequent.

This is not say women are at fault but part of a larger issue of the impersonal nature of online hook up culture and general lack of interpersonal skills of everyone involved. We have created a generation incapable of conversing beyond a 128 character tweet or whatever the hell X now calls it.

i love chico he told everyone to spread kindness on his podcast my GOAT
everyone forgets about Volcels
huh?
I see what you mean but it doesn't mean that ppl are right for calling him an incel in that case, nor do i imply that women's standards are inherently right or wrong on a per person basis. Do I sometimes hear some ppl (men and women) express standards that I find to be ridiculous, yes, but that doesn't mean I have the right to tell them what to do, nor that they have to change who they are in order to 'serve' someone else. what's important in my statement is the '**for them'** at the end.
Dr. K is awesome and I concur :) I didn't fully watch his videos on the topic but I agreed with his points and I think he might be one of the very few people out there trying to address the issue.
Dr.K is a fucking joke that aired out his patients business on tiktok 😂😂😂 nice way to discredit your little post you wrote. Also a borderline grifter and very unprofessional (other than airing business out).
The appeal of Andrew Tate to incels is that he validates their insecurities and tells them they should self-improve by becoming more literate, going to the gym, dressing better etc. (nothing wrong with this imo) But one of the many issues is that he also constantly disparages women and has awfully sexist views about them.
Nerd/autist that became very successful with money and women 

""he's just like me"" etc
yeah, but gross
I don't understand what you are saying, could you be more specific?
*He’s just complaining about the sex ratio of his area*

But he's misinformed. San Francisco has 104 men for every 100 women, which is not a horrible imbalance. San Jose has 51.01% men, 48.99% women. Those are the two cities he specifically called out as terrible places for men to meet women. There are imbalances, but they are statistically slight. 

At Berkeley, where he teaches, more than 50% of undergrad students are women, the ratio of men / women among graduate students is almost equal (a couple percentage points more men than women). The worst ratio is among his own group, ladder rank faculty, where about 1 in 3 are women.

I'm sorry that happened to you.  I've posted elsewhere that your story is more common than many think, and was downvoted en-masse (??). So I totally get what you're saying.  Incels suffer from high levels of social rejection, depression, anxiety, insecure attachment, and loneliness. They don't have friends of either sex, they don't socialize, and don't know how to.  If they do manage to get a gf, they tend to be hyper-jealous, and that in turn leads to abuse as they try to avoid rejection.  In life in general, but especially in a school setting, there are other triggers for anxiety and depression that just pile on.  

TLDR: I agree someone who has gone that deep (abuse) needs professional treatment, not an invite to a pizza party.  On the other hand I do think it important that all schools explicitly teach social skills, especially these days with everyone living in digital echo chambers.  A part of the ""lab"" for that class is holding safe in-person social events, because that practice tends to reduces the triggers that give rise to this problem.  Especially in school settings (esp hyper-competitive schools like Berkeley) where many of those triggers are part of the academic experience.
Not sure about lack of education in general, but more like we don't teach kids how to socialize and get along with others.  We throw young kids together in pre-school or daycare and assume they have instincts to reach out and play/interact with others, yet there are a significant percentage of kids who don't have that instinct: they sit there by themselves, or play with toys alone...and little if anything is done.  I think this is a huge problem for society, and instead of throwing shit at the victims, we need to help them.  One way is direct such as I suggested, but that's hardly better than throwing them back on the playground again; they really need a hell of a lot of talk therapy and behavioral training / coaching.  They need to learn the human game / dance.  JMHO.
I dunno, in my day I had more than a few lady friends tell me they were afraid to give men the ""nod/look"", because they were not sure what might happen, like maybe rejection.  The ladies who knew what they had and what they wanted never hesitated.  I'd answer those calls on the first ring.  Your comments suggest you're just not dialing...as a class.  So do you mean to make Shewchuks point?
You can be insecure without blaming women for everything.

I agree, and I hope that more people really stop to think through what they are asking for when they advocate rolling back protections to our jobs and rights to voice controversial opinions. For anyone reading this who imagines they will always be on the ""right side of history"" - please consider the possibility that someday it could be you on the wrong side of an online/in person mob, and try to imagine what sort of protections you would wish were in place if you were. It's not as unlikely a scenario as you might think.
he has a right to say what he wants, but Ed Stem was not the place lol
What should be the appropriate response? Everyone got +30 points on their exams?
the response to his post is perfectly balanced, I don't think he requires anything more. He made a careless post, he was reprimanded by the university, he apologized. End of story.
Yes, and when employees engage in and are found guilty of sexual harassment and discrimination, I agree that it is appropriate they be subjected to progressive disciplinary actions as specified in their union contracts, and in accordance with the protections offered to them by tenure.

Professor Schewchuk's post in Ed is very likely neither an example of sexual harassment or discrimination, but I am not a law student, so am open to someone with more expertise correcting me.

>at a certain point you are no longer trying to resist the other gender on the basis of lived experiences but rather on preconceived biases and fears. 

This essentially describes anyone who thinks women, in the Bay Area in 2024, are systematically oppressed and silenced by men. The immediate, overwhelming popular AND institutional backlash erupting over a single comment about dating dynamics here perfectly demonstrates how far from reality that belief is.
u/Lost-Ad-3625 & u/SunsetChaser2001  


This is very much an uninvited opinion on what is a wholly exceptional dialog between two bright and articulate young people. You do not need my input, and in no way am I attempting to correct anything you have added here. I'm grateful to have found this and digested it at 8AM on a Saturday morning. But I have to share these thoughts.  


I'm not a member of this subreddit, but because I've obviously mentioned my background, I keep seeing these discussions due to the Reddit algo.  


I am 51. I grew up in Berkeley, my parents worked at Cal. I didn't attend, I was an early tech teen dropout in the area with access to computers and a hijacked Pine email account and dialup access to everything. I didn't work in mobile tech, I was already a CEO in another field, but I did help do some cool stuff that made WWW happen earlier in my career. I was there for a bunch of firsts. I ate pizza with Steve Jobs when he was still just an asshole (and I was just a punk of a teenager) with an overpriced difficult to sell computer system and less than 1% share.  


These things you've grown up with, these derived social media platforms are not what we envisioned. They were not the pioneer's dreams. We did not want to neuter our sons and shame and compound the barriers our daughters had to face. This is what the fourth wave of entrepreneurs have made following our bubble in the dotcom. I thought by now we'd be on Mars, have defeated early mortality, higher education, cured cancer, reduced war, improved access to political representation and saved the planet from overheating.  


God we were so fucking wrong. We let the children coming up behind us find their own way to make their own millions, and we allowed the masses of users and potential market size misguide our judgment. Investment went into market size, it went into the very thing that has driven the development of social media. We  older geeks cared about the user experience and value to the end user, this has no value to people, and it turns the very precious user experience and value into a commodity to be mined and manipulated by the numbers.  


We grew up with the internet being something we did around computer science. We talked to each other with respect, warmth and connection in the early days of the internet. We valued our ACCESS TO EACH OTHER exponentially. I was friends with a novelist in China before we could fly there, because of our shared object discussions. I valued everything the internet brought to me, because it was precious. My connections were important and tangible. I would never have been rude, because we thought of the internet users as people across the table from us - still in slapping distance. I still try to behave this way today...   


I am so sorry we allowed this to happen. What is it? Users of social media no longer value connection to human beings, they value the number of connections, the number of likes, the perception of ranking higher than others. My own relationship once suffered from Hotornot or whatever it was called. We saw these problems coming and no one stopped it because the money was in the algorithms, and the money was in manipulating the market size for greater profit.   


And somehow in the first generation of interconnected development, we misplaced that wonder that drove us to create dialup BBS communities, then interlink them, then expand the access to more and more people. We traded that special feeling for speed, access, things that were cheaper than other things: we valued wrong, we valued numbers. And the result is... People are worthless now, but they have a measurable NET PRESENT VALUE to commercial interests. Their social media numbers and their ranking of the numbers are all that matter to the user. Who likes me, how many likes, how long did it take the to respond? It's all ... numbers.  


I was working in New York when Gary Shteyngart's ""Super Sad True Love Story"" came out. It's based there, and it is a dystopian view on where personal mobile devices were going in 2009. I know rich people would not have done things differently to get ultra rich. But I don't believe the geeks older than me who became our generation's venture capitalists would have wanted their initial investments to break their grandchildren, or destroy their grandchildren's social fabric.  


This Incel thing you're dealing with. I understand it in broad strokes and this thread has helped remind me that of the pressures that younger people are facing. I've been with my husband since 1995, we have a 25 year old son who has birth modifications and struggles with social media self-worth. He is not able to digest and discuss things the way you both have here, so I appreciate if you've read this far.  


In 1999 we knew the planet was overheating, we didn't do enough. In 2010 we knew the internet was going to become a soul crushing generational destroying disaster for our children if we didn't control their access, and we didn't. We knew. Your parents knew. Your teachers knew. Now you know.  


Connection to people is what matters. Not how many people, but the depth of the connection comes from mutual interest and mutual valuation of that contact. You are in control of how you react and how you behave with people. No app will affect that. Remember, you are the users. Stop being the product, stop feeding the algorithm while you still can. Real human connection and valued communication with people may seem difficult. It may seem rare. It isn't. You have to look up from your phones and extend the chance.  


You have to go to a cafe and engage in conversation. You have to ask opinions and questions of people different from you. You can find it, and you can nurture and grow your contacts. I know, because I did it right there in Berkeley, one cappuccino or earl grey tea at a time.  


For all I know those cafe's are closed. Just like the bars and clubs that we went to aren't needed. If they are, I wouldn't know. I don't live in Berkeley any more, or the Bay Area. My memories are a time machine that lacks user controls and goes where and when it wants. But this message isn't quite clear yet. Let me refocus.  


You have the ability to change the world. It begins by changing what you do personally. Then encouraging change in your community. Then encouraging change in the broader world outside that. It's 1999 again for you, the planet is overheating, you can elect a president who you want to have a beer with, or a president that wants to reduce emissions and prevent a 3 degree or greater planetary warming risk.  


I thank you for taking the time to communicate with each other and I appreciate you taking the time to read my rambling. I'm so sorry we didn't stop this from happening, as we now have no ideas on how to help you fix it.
I really doubt that random ugly people being called incels is a common occurrence. More likely, they're dismissed as 'incels' because they use misogynistic incel talking points. Why engage in arguments with them when their arguments are fueled not by reason but by hatred towards women? 

Maybe people call you an incel because you say things like ""Women's biggest problem seems to be that they just aren't satisfied with any of the dozens to hundreds of men that would readily try going out with them"". I probably don't need to explain why painting women as privileged, entitled princesses sneering at the peasants begging at their feet is misogynistic. Regardless, no one should use incel as an insult.
Also I really don't understand how this post is inflammatory, nor does it ignore the existence of women-blaming incel, so I'd recommend you to read it in full and stop strawmanning
Using ""expire"" is incel behavior? Brah. You're just diluting the meaning of \`incel\`. Not helpful. Are you familiar with, say, Bumble? Where your match would ""expire"" if you don't talk to them after a while. Honestly, using ""expire"" just immediately marks the post as a nonsensical, sarcastic rant. 

The edge cases fitting your definition exists is a testament to the fact that you're just ignoring the connotation of the word just to write a post bro. 

And don't backpedal.  You brought up incels in light of what happened on Ed but now they have nothing to do with one antoher?
wait where’s did he say “expire”
How is being a passport bro incel behaviour? Do men in 2024 not have rights to choose whoever they want to date and have preferences?
I agree. While I am not the best at solving large social problems like this, I believe others could find lots of other solutions. But it seems like a lot of the solution relies on the incels themselves to self-reflect and come to a good conclusion.

I guess something I’ve been dealing that is similar is not being able to find great job or internship. I have been trying to push myself by taking lots of difficult classes and striving to finish in the 90th percentile. And when I miss, I would be extremely upset with myself. I’ve taken a step back the past week and realized that my approach was wrong. I shouldn’t be challenging myself in hopes of a reward. I should be doing so to find fulfillment. After taking that step back and shifting my mindset, I feel much better.
The problem you describe is only applicable for people using dating apps. 

If you're not using the apps, you'd never even notice the problem.
He looks so cold but has a heart of gold!
""problematic"". it's basically the primary way to identify 1) someone from cali 2) someone twitter-brained. it's such an effective way of signaling your distaste without having to voice what that distaste is. and it's so fucking pretentious 

problematic is condescension in a can. it's the srat girl explaining to you why you're wrong about palestine. it's utter fucking nonsense. needs to go.
Dr.K is a fucking joke that aired out his patients business on tiktok 😂😂😂 nice way to discredit your little post you wrote.

Also, I feel like he’s the total opposite of a nerd; if anything, he’s a jock. In fact, that’s how he got his initial fame; from MMA
He’s literally a pimp though.
Sure, this can be explained by status and evolutionary pressures/success. The ability to respond to and manage our urges as human beings is of utmost importance.

Holding all else equal, a guy that can't 'pull' is inherently of lower worth than one who can easily can.
How about the major he teaches?
Not sure what your point is, but think that would fall under a clear pattern of blatant misogyny, which I said is a different case altogether.
i personally would apply it to trump and not to shewchuk. like spiderman says, ""everyone gets one""

Insecure has different meaning when combined with ego. Most common among young professional types, but can also happen to late career folks who are not stably married working parents.
The ""right side of history"" attitude has troubled me lately. Not because I don't believe in what's right but because I know that being on the ""right side of history"" just means being the winner. And winners aren't necessarily ""right"".
For sure, and he should be informed as such from COE. It was insane that he even fielded that question at all.
At a minimum there needs to be a public apology from Shewchuck. That would mitigate some of the fallout. But it doesn't go far enough to address the damage that's already been done, which is why I think that apology needs to happen within the context of a larger restorative justice proceeding.
His ""apology"" was terrible :/
My apologies I spoke too harshly. What I mean to say is that yes, social media is what converts men's insecurity/loneliness to radicalization, but while removing social media might mitigate the radicalization, it will not solve the underlying issue of men's insecurity/loneliness (which will thereafter manifest itself in other ways). And no, from my own personal experiences (and I'd recommend you look into what HealthyGamer has to say on the topic) there are *no* spaces (or at least a relatively minuscule number) for guys to address these feelings. Since growing up, many of us are constantly told that we are weak if we seek therapy/express our emotions and that we are worth less if we can't get girls. It is only in recent years that toxic masculinity like this has been brought to light, but there haven't been any actual measures taken to change these harmful beliefs at a societal level. It is because of this that these toxic spaces have risen to the top, there are no other competitors (and we all know what the harms of monopolies are). Speaking from personal experience, I grew up without a father, and when I was told that I had to get a girlfriend to be 'cool' (instead of being taught what actually matters), I had no other choice but to look online to find advice as to how to 'get women'. As you highlight, the algorithms on these apps often lead to echo chambers, and as such many guys are quickly inundated with this type of content. Lastly, I agree that men have created these systems and are accountable, but there are guys as young as 14 who are now on these forums and I truly fear what might happen to them.
Actually the word takes only 0.5 seconds to look up on your favorite search engine

No, this is what happens:

They said something you disagree with that only a straight man would say --> you call them an incel --> since they're an incel they must hate women --> since they hate women everything they said must be due to hating women
I'm sure that just about everyone who uses it as a dismissive insult has convinced themself they're only using it because that person deserves it. Even here you're doing the same to me. I didn't say I get called an incel. Your mind just immediately went there because you found something you disagree with in my comment history. You then didn't actually argue why I was wrong. You just tried to shame me into accepting that I must be wrong and misogynistic because you said so. You're pretty clearly just fueled by a pile of biases and assumptions and seem to be doing exactly what I'm talking about.
bro what are you even saying?? The guy specifically said that he was ""sharing his opinions,"" the post is nonsensical but it was not meant to be sarcastic nor does anyone believe it is except for you. When did I say that incels don't have to do with each other, again you clearly did not read the post. Forget the exact connotation of the word incel, I am writing about men that are suffering and becoming radicalized to their own (and others') detriment. That's it.
If you actually read the dude's comment, it's clear as day that the entire post was meant to be a sarcastic, nonsensical rant.
Yeah, that's pretty insane.  He could the most hardcore women's rights believer in the universe, but because he wants to engage with a more favorable dating market that makes him an incel?  Dumbest shit ever, why can't people just let others live their lives the way they want?
What is a passport bro?
It’s not exactly the only thing that could help, but I think the fact so many people can’t afford mental health care is a criminal contributor to the problem
Oh I don’t use the apps, just someone old enough to remember a time when you could go sit in a bar and look around and not see a single person too busy tweeting on their phones and taking selfies to be doing something worthy of sharing on the internet.

You are correct when you are not buried in the apps, you hardly notice the issue. However, for every person addicted to their phone that is one person that will never interact with you, and don’t have a frame of reference to understand each other, and on a very microcosmic level you just became 2 members of separate sides of the so called culture war.
for real, big golden retriever energy from him 🥺
again, huh? all ik is im not from cali and ive never used twitter so keep your assumptions to urself lmao
Tate is 100% LARPing as a 'jock', you're just not reading him well enough
That's not mutually exclusive with what I said

Don’t use the word pull but actually explain what it means. I doubt most here are trying to be pickup artists.
I assume you look around; do you ever make eye contact?  Try a simple smile...if you get a nice one back, then you've probably gotten her permission to begin a dialog.  If you get a blank stare or an eye roll (or worse), it's ""not interested"".  Bottom line: If she really wants your attention, she will get it, if by no other way than saying ""what do I have to do..."" as you leave class.  Then you wake up and apologize, and offer to buy her a coffee or bobba.  The game is pretty simple.  Good hunting.
With respect, ego (large or small) is how people manifest their feelings of insecurity.  It's a collection of behavioral reflexes to deal with it (stress / insecurity).  There's all sorts of insecurity in this world: financial, physical, food, shelter, political, medical, relationship, clothes, family, peers, you name it. Young people of both sexes are under a lot of stress, there's familial and societal pressure to succeed, and all that entails.  Older people have a different spectrum of stresses, financial and medical primarily.  Talk therapy, aka ""talking it out"" with the right person can be very effective to relieve stress and turn reflexive behavior into more rational (aka healthy) behavior.
winners are strong enough to make you say they're right, though.
""Justice proceeding""?

Honestly did you read the dude's statement? He made a supply/demand kind of statement. Nothing in the comment was meant to demean female students.

Why do you care? Do you want him to be paraded in front of the school in a chicken costume? Specifically what could he say that would make the online masses happy? 

Shewchuck said something vile online. But like do you want a firing squad? What’s the perfect response?
r/menslib somewhat fits the bill
I know what it means, and only dumb incels are concerned about it.
What are these non-misogynistic things that ""only a straight man would say"" that lead to being called an incel? Some examples please.
Don't try and shame women and then get offended because I supposedly 'shamed' you for pointing out that your comment was anti-woman. You want me to argue why you're wrong that women's ""only problem"" in dating is that we're ""just not satisfied"" with the hundreds of prospects we receive daily? First of all the average woman on Tinder receives 5 matches a day. Secondly, most of these are sexual prospects, not romantic ones. This can be partly explained by the fact that men make up the vast majority of Tinder users, are more enticed by physical appearance, and are willing to have sex with almost anyone. Some problems that women have in dating are we're more likely to be cheated on and domestically abused, and we're in vulnerable positions when we meet up with guys we don't know. We're also valued overwhelmingly for our appearance, so if you're an ugly woman it's tough luck. According to multiple dating surveys, a man's top priority in women is her physical appearance. Women are just as lonely as men are.
i didn't read it as sarcastic or nonsensical, but that he was just using hyperbole. and anyways it was pretty clear he was talking about matches on dating apps.  


i guess most people don't actually use dating apps, though.
Because passport bros are losers that want a bangmaid, not an equal partner. There sexpats and loses who take advantage of poor economic situations for a slave. They're never proponents right 
insightful, thanks for posting
damn, what do you *mean* my biases are wrong? /s
My point is that he doesn’t really have the “he’s just like me” appeal that stereotypical incels would gravitate towards.

-He’s 6’3” which puts him at almost 99th percentile in height.

-He’s athletic.

-His father is a chess grandmaster.

He himself admitted once that he “won the genetic lottery”.
What's the alternative? Can you provide a better evaluation of this environment and possible solutions? Because simply lying to the less successful that they're just as significant doesn't seem to be helping
It's a realistic assessment of how social dynamics work in our culture at this particular moment. Gaslighting men who end up at the bottom of that hierarchy isn't how you fix that. Admitting it and making a concerted effort to change it is and that has to start with those who have the capacity to enforce social norms. That's people at the ""top"" of the pyramid, not the ""bottom.""
Incel literally means someone that cannot “pull” any women. I’m not quite sure what we are even talking about here.
Sure, it just means to attract those of the opposite sex with variable effort

Generally the one asking is the one pulling and the one answering is being pulled
No, its the strong who make you say they are the winners
No, not ""justice proceeding."" Restorative justice. It's an approach to justice that proactively addresses the harm done to victims. This is exactly the kind of situation that merits this intervention. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice


The Berkeley co-op system, to give you one real life example, will use this in situations where a resident's actions cause another resident to feel unsafe, regardless of the intent behind those actions.
No. We want him to be fired. Which would be in keeping with California and US sexual harassment and discrimination laws. It's that simple.
That sub is mainly about reframing men's issues in terms of feminism or ignoring them if that proves impossible. The modding is extremely restrictive as well. 

r/leftwingmaleadvocates has some more aggressively MRA-type dudes on occasion and a lot of folks who clearly aren't left-wing, but it's generally where I've felt the best balance of taking men's issues seriously on their own terms without just falling into reactionary hatred can be found.
The comment from u/Ill-Turnip3727 that you were responding to.
>we're more likely to be cheated on and domestically abused 

This is not true. A CDC investigation has shown that domestic violence is initiated at roughly equal rates by men and women, with women actually initiating mutual violence MORE OFTEN than men. Differences in reporting and rates of prosecution, as well as the frequent repetition of false claims to the contrary, account for the perceived discrepancy. 


https://www.domestic-violence-law.com/blog/2016/april/women-or-men-who-usually-instigates-domestic-vio/ 

All those other claims can be addressed, from dating app data which shows women have much more exacting physical standards than men to rates of initiation showing women by and large are able to take a back seat when it comes to seeking romance, but it's clear you've got your mind made up, so I'm not going to go digging for more articles you'll surely dismiss. I'm hoping one example is enough for anyone else reading this to reconsider whether points they've heard from feminists on this issue can actually be taken for granted. 

Also when did I say women get hundreds of prospects ""daily?"" Even if I only had 5 matches per day on Tinder (which would amount to 100 people in less than 3 weeks) I'd be doing orders of magnitude better than I am now. It really shows how wildly out of touch you are that you think that somehow proves ""women are just as lonely as men are."" Unless you're willing to concede that they're much more often lonely by choice. 

And that's not even to mention your insulting characterization of men as just shallow horndogs right after you have the gall to tell me my comments are shaming and ""anti-woman."" The fact you can't seem to admit there's any arena whatsoever where women might actually have a better experience than men tells me you're an ideologue and any further engagement with you on this topic would be a waste of time.
Yea. Hyperbole is the characterization I should have used but didn't. The student's comment honestly read like a self-deprecating rant. I don't think people would have come after him had Shewchuck not commented.
Yes those things abt him are right, but he specifically panders to others on the other end of the SMV spectrum as he repeats their talking points
It’s worth pointing out that this version of “success”, seen in pseudo-evolutionary terms, is an interpretation that was basically created out of whole cloth by the capitalist class in the late 19th century, because it let them grab Darwin as a social meme for their own ends. This PR project was highly successful, given the pervasiveness of these kinds of arguments today.

*Mutual Aid* by Kropotkin has a lot to say about this. TL;DR even the idea that there are individual “winners” somehow baked into “biology” or something is pretty ridiculous. You can “win” by helping people, not just by like generating more humans. Cf. climate change.

Edit: Words
why did you repeat what I said?
Not sure it's fair to talk about ""harm done to victims"" when the whole ordeal stems from students overreacting/misinterpreting what was said. 

What about the people who are witch-hunted because what they said were misinterpreted? Isn't that enough retribution?
I beg you to get a life genuinely. If you think a misogynistic comment is outright, demonstrable sexual harassment or even discrimination you need professional help. A bad person sure but certainly not actively putting women at a disadvantage because he hates them.
It is very unlikely his comments on Ed would meet the definition of either sexual harassment or discrimination.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT? Are you fucking insane? Touch grass I beg you

I'll address your points one by one.

The source you posted is a blog post that cherry-picks the data suspiciously and doesn't even link to where the data is collected from. Some data: 

""Ninety percent of people who commit violent physical assault are men. Males perpetrate 95% of all serious domestic violence."" Source: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics. Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics Online. http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/  
""The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that 95% of reported assaults on spouses or ex-spouses are committed by men against women."" Source: Douglas, H. (1991). Assessing violent couples. Families in Society, 72 (9): 525-535.

The CDC says as much. [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/fastfact.html](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/fastfact.html) I'm curious why you linked a blog post and not the CDC study itself. 

What dating app data show that ""women have much more exacting physical standards than men""?

 ""Differences in reporting and rates of prosecution account for the perceived discrepancy."" Do you have a source for this or is this just a guess? 

Me pointing out women are as lonely as men has nothing to do with the number of matches they get on tinder. 

I'm not characterizing men as shallow. They self-reported that their number 1 criterion for a partner is physical appearance in many studies, that's a fact not a character judgment.
Why did you say what I repeated?
Disagree with your entire premise, so no.
That's exactly what it is. It's just very unlikely anything will be done about it. Mostly because of people like you, who find it impossible to listen to the experiences of anyone who isn't you, let alone empathize.
Here's the actual study. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/ 

I'm not playing any more sea-lioning games with you. If you can cherry pick source from over 30 years ago to support your perspective you can do the work yourself if you're curious and not just trying to ""prove"" you win by incessantly asking for more and more sources until I stop responding out of frustration. I'm not getting drawn into that black hole again. Have a nice night.
Most people really take a step back from the witch-hunting after reading the actual comments it seems.
Maybe you’re just online too much
Lol first of all I gave you three sources. Secondly, the source you gave is 17 years old so not exactly new. Thirdly and most amusing the source you linked says ""approximately 1.5 million women and 835 000 men are physically assaulted or raped by intimate partners in the United States annually."" So even your own source proves my point. Have a nice night.
>Overall, IPV was reported in 23.9% of relationships, with women reporting a greater proportion of violent relationships than men (28.4% vs 19.3%; P< .01). Among violent relationships, nearly half (49.7%) were characterized as reciprocally violent. Women reported a significantly greater proportion of violent relationships that were reciprocal versus nonreciprocal than did men (women = 51.5%; men = 46.9%; P< .03). **Among relationships with nonreciprocal violence, women were reported to be the perpetrator in a majority of cases (70.7%), as reported by both women (67.7%) and men (74.9%).** To look at the data another way, women reported both greater victimization and perpetration of violence than did men (victimization = 19.3% vs 16.4%, respectively; perpetration = 24.8% vs 11.4%, respectively). **In fact, women’s greater perpetration of violence was reported by both women (female perpetrators=24.8%, male perpetrators = 19.2%) and by men (female perpetrators = 16.4%, male perpetrators = 11.2%).** 

Alright, your commitment to bad-faith reading has gotten one more response out of me. Congratulations.
You realize that this is only addressing a subset of DV right? Overall, women are more likely to be physically abused by their partners than men are, as that same study says.
The source for that claim was a survey conducted about 10 years prior to the study. The data from the study contradicted that claim. 

And even if the data from this study is completely wrong somehow, the original contention was that women suffer in dating in a way men don't because men are overwhelmingly likey to initiate IPV compared to women. 

Ignoring all the results of the study I cited and clinging to an aggregated number from a much older survey –a survey which also included same-sex couples meaning woman on woman violence in relationships ought to account for at least some of the discrepancy– the ratio between victims by gender was less than 2:1. 

So between that and the study results indicating women are actually more likely to initiate IPV than men, to try and paint IPV as something almost uniquely suffered by women and therefore a good reason for women to be considerably more paranoid about dating and relationships than men seems to me like fishing for a reason to try and avoid admitting than when it comes to dating, women might actually have it better than men.

Bike Theft Next to the RSF,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2hbex9/bike_theft_next_to_the_rsf/,2014-09-24 03:01:58,"Since I lost my bike wheel and got mugged near the RSF last semester (refer to this [post]( http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1v1ie9/berkeley_is_a_dangerous_place_at_night/) from 8 months ago), I've become a lot more vigilant when I go out at night. I always carry a pocket knife and pepper spray just in case. Also, I am a lot more alert when I am around bike racks. I cannot stress enough the importance of locking your bike [properly](http://www.unh.edu/sites/www.unh.edu/files/departments/police_department/lockyourbikehowtolockdiagra.gif)

Yesterday, my girlfriend and I were on our way to the RSF and someone was attempting to steal a wheel. It was seven, fucking, PM. There were so many people near the entrance of the RSF, but no one said a word. It's infuriating **how bike thieves take advantage of people's stigma to react and steal with  confidence in broad daylight(not really daylight, but you get what I mean).** 

He had a light blue wrench and a bolt cutter. He was white, medium build, around 5'9"" and had a faint smell of whiskey. He has dark black hair, droopy eyes, fleshy nose, stubble unkempt facial hair, and around 25 -35 years old. He was also wearing a black hoodie (possibly padded), a black hat, and black shorts. 

Of course, we stepped in and questioned him about the wheel and stopped him before he could take the wheel. (unfortunately he ran off, but we got the wheel) The wheel has an axel nut. And the bike is just a cheap commuter bike. There was another bike that got stolen, because only its quick-release front wheel was locked. 

**IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE CRUISING ON A FANCY NEW RIDE OR A GARBAGE BIKE, THE THEIF WILL STEAL IT IF IT LOOKS EASY TO STEAL.**
they will unscrew your axel nut, cut your cables, dremel your bike lock.

After we completed the witness records, we found out that UCPD deals with this kind of property theft on average **15** times a day. So why does bike theft persist? 

1. These people aren't worthy to be locked up. They are just drug addicts/ hobos who steal to get some money and get chalked up. 

2. If they do get locked up, they won't stay in for long. And once they get out, they continue to do what they're best at. 

I am really not expecting the school to implement security cameras next to most of the bike racks on campus (hello? ASUC? halp plz?), so please please buy locks that are more expensive locks than your bikes and lock them securely.

**TLDR; Lock your bike properly or...or... it'll get stolen. :(**","I said this a few weeks ago already, but no amount of police is going to change this.  It is a culture thing.  You stepping in and stopping the guy probably has done more good for the safety of that rack than a hundred police interventions!  Too bad you didn't give him something to remember by kicking him in the face!
thanks for the PSA.  Shit needs to be repeated over and over again.

One thing that I recommend is removing all quick-release parts from your bike (i.e. wheels and seat).  You can replace them with axels/bolts-nuts that require tools to move.  This isn't failsafe by any means, but it def ups the level of work the theif needs to take your bike (parts). 
I remember there briefly used to be cameras in areas like Sproul plaza---they were up for only a little while before they were quietly taken down.  I heard it was because a few vocal students complained about privacy and being 'watched'; with that added headache, the school couldn't justify the cameras/cost enough to keep them up. I am really not privy to the details of that whole situation, but in any case I think you are correct that there will not be cameras used for anything besides straight building security for the foreseeable future. 

A good reminder to be careful with your bike, and to keep your eyes open for shifty activities---even in crowded areas and during the day!

Put the pocket knife away, stop being a fucking idiot. It's not going to do much of anything if you need it, and the bummer about knives is that your knife can become *his* knife really, really fast. 

All you're doing is 1) Escalating the situation (if he hasn't taken out a weapon) or 2) Fighting with a pocketknife when the other guy obviously *does* this.

Do yourself a favor and leave the knife at home. Don't try to be a tough guy.
You should've started that conversation with some pepper spray.

Seriously though, fuck bike thieves. Thank you for stepping in. I had a bike that meant a lot to me stolen years ago and one that was a piece of shit stolen last year. It's never fun.
You should buy the Nutlock.

http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/12/new-product-nutlock-may-help-deter-bike-theft-berkeley/
As someone who just had his bike stolen at 10 am this morning IN BROAD FUCKING DAYLIGHT next to Hearst Mining Hall. Yes, both wheels were completely chained.  Please. I beg of you. Question anybody that is cutting chains near bike racks. I don't care how ""nice"" or ""innocent"" they look. They will understand you are doing the right thing by simply questioning them. This stigma has to end. 
Bad news is you'll always have a lack of knowledge (use of subpar locks, improper locking methods) that allows bike and component theft to remain viable on campus. 

Good news is you can educate people as best you can regarding how to secure their bikes, but there will always be new students who don't understand how bad the bike theft problem here (and other college campuses really) is. 
I completely agree with you! Switch blades are honestly not so useful in a fight. However, I never said anything about getting in a fight with a bike thief and even if I am a fucking idiot, I would never brandish in a scenario like that. Like I said, I have pepper spray and my last resort would be using a knife. (For example, trapped in a corner and defenseless).
The winner of a knife fight is the person who bleeds out last
This is a really good invention.
oh no! I'm so sorry. I hope you reported it already! but check on craigslist/ Berkeley flea market or post pictures on free & for sale/ lost & found won't hurt either.

And yes! It doesn't hurt to confront someone if you suspect them. If it's really their bike, you can always apologize later. 
Ok, gotcha! I only take that tone because I used to do the same thing when I worked in a bar in a shittier area in Philly... until I realized that I'd still definitely get my ass kicked, knife or no.

Pardon the tone!
FYI, Cal has really wonky self-defense and homicide laws, so even carrying a knife can be considered enough premeditation to get you charged with something by a DA if you ever use it to defend yourself.
I disagree; the winner of the knife fight is whoever looked cooler, regardless of who (if anyone) dies.
Number one rule of a knife fight is don't be in a knife fight.

Number two rule of a knife fight is you're gonna get cut, just try to make it happen in a nonlethal spot like the outside of your forearms.


Bonus rule: If you win it with a casual but precise knife throw, you get double points"

It all started within the unclaimed mess left of our general location, the void began to take shape and slowly crawled towards us. [Albania was the first to fall](https://imgur.com/a/h9BXcTS), even with our aid. As the black mass approached our left border, one of our brave members risked his life to make a deal with the devil: the leader of the void agreed to leave us be, as the attack moved [upward](https://imgur.com/a/QrwNJG4) instead. We were able to preserve our place, or we thought.

---


To no one’s surprise, the void [ignored our treaty](https://imgur.com/a/l3zKID3) after a few hours and gradually began expanding downward to devour us alongside the remaining Albanian flag. Our friendly neighbor UMich was not strong enough to help us and was partially erased as well.

The CAL logo was destroyed and abandoned after a hard-fought battle. But this was not the end of us, Cal is not a place, it’s a people.

A new location was found, [a mostly unorganized area located on the right of an Anti-CCP artwork.](https://imgur.com/a/OqXUEa1) The initial takeover was slow, as the area was also claimed by an unknown streamer. However, the incredible leadership in the Berkeley-place Discord server was able to connect and ally with all the other UC campuses and formed a coalition to represent the entirety of the University of California. Now with more members, our plan was feasible.

[New design](https://imgur.com/a/MEUO5X4) 
I would also like to bring awareness that during our initial push against everything else in the area, we had to unfortunately demolish [a piece of artwork](https://imgur.com/a/AxN41Pt) made by the moth people. We have negotiated with them and agreed to help them rebuild. So please, if you see them again in r/place, lend a hand. 

As we further laid out the blue foundation to clear the area, spots of yellow also appeared. We simply assumed it was just our people planning ahead. However as time went by, a [strange streak of yellow](https://imgur.com/a/PKRAKIY) was formed that was not of our design. Initially confused, members of our team quickly realized that the place to our left, r/CLTV, meanly comprised of Taiwanese and mainland Chinese Reddit users that have strong opinions against the Chinese Communist Party, also had plans for this space — A yellow version of The [Great Wave](https://imgur.com/a/GsJHD1E) off Kanagawa.

---


Since we have already established a foothold here, the war against r/CLTV officially began. 

During the height of the battle, some of our team members, including me, infiltrated the r/place chat in the enemy subreddit. We were able to directly acquire their plans and orders, thanks to our Mandarin speakers and google translate. 

We quickly found the weakness in CLTV’s building operation: they had ineffective communication. It was disorganized and without a central command. The moderators rarely gave directions and they simply used a live chat to voice themselves, which can be easily exploited by our agents.

We quickly infiltrated their chat and told them to fill in blue pixels instead of yellow, helping our building team to lay more foundations. However, just like the many other opinions lost in the chat, our diversions weren’t heard by the majority. Soon, they realized this issue as well and were devising a better form of communication in order to defeat us. They decided to make a discord server. 

Naturally, you would think our team would seize this opportunity to infiltrate their discord server as well, right? No, we were quick enough to CREATE an entire [discord server](https://imgur.com/a/kyDT8UF) for them, and immediately posted multiple invite links in their chat. 

One by one the eager r/CLTV users joined, with numbers reaching almost 100. Our discord owner quickly promoted a few of our members as moderators and began the deep cover. Not only were we able to see what they were planning, we had a direct influence on their high command. If all things goes well, we win the fight, if things get out of control, we had the power to terminate the server immediately, disrupting their coordination.

Our agents began misleading the enemy forces by suggesting alternative locations for their new plan (a Winnie the pooh with the [face of Xi JinPing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DPUo8PX_p3PnaWx3RjpLJqHJcDd73Ed/edit#gid=1479258230) because the wave was too hard to draw, according to enemy intel). We also used psychological attacks to plant seeds of doubt within their ranks — that they could never win against us, a bunch of tireless-CS-student-machines that have no life other than staring at a computer screen 24/7 defending our pixels. We also took inspiration from the CIA to covertly orchestrate a CLTV invasion of the neighboring Armenian flag, as well as the trans rainbow flag.

Although it was evident that this operation greatly aided our overall efforts to defend our logo during the night. Our agency failed to completely redirect the enemy’s attention away. As they had strength in numbers and most of them did not join the fake discord, the invasion never fully stopped. One by one our troops went to bed, and we began to lose ground.

That’s not all, on top of the intense warfare against CLTV, we lived in constant fear as the twitch streamer Mizkif along with his chat army constantly hovered around and raided artworks in our general area.  

We fought hard. It was 1 am past midnight, Winnie’s lower body and ears were slowly taking shape. The letter A in the UC logo became amongus. We couldn't stop the inevitable. At our darkest moment, we considered allying with the furries, but were luckily stopped by our conscience. 

We were defeated, before I went to bed at 2:30 am, the place that we worked so hard on is now Xi Jinping, at least it’s still a bear?

[-1000000 social credits](https://imgur.com/a/LrcXRGs)

In the end, was this battle worth it? Yes, it helped us expand in numbers.

Did we feel bad that we fought against the freedom-fighting dissidents of an oppressive regime and secretly arranged their invasion of Armenia? No

But WAIT! Not all hope is lost! Remember our original logo that got eaten by the void? Turns out bots and people that brainlessly follow twitch streamers are not good at keeping ground. Some dedicated people from our team spent the night trying to fix our old logo and it was a [huge success.](https://imgur.com/a/1D33BLW)

Although our initial relocation was unsuccessful, the Cal spirit remains, and we are stronger than ever. We made peace with our previous enemies and seized a new location during the day 2 canvas expansion around [(1893,346)](https://imgur.com/a/dmfGyPY). Also, the original Cal logo is at (374,284), Keep it safe.

Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this.
fuck this was a stressful day i helped when i could, go bears!
can you repost the discord link? that one says invalid
an addendum to the ""the fairly peaceful Albanians"" part! at first they actually wanted to take our land over and turn it into [this flag of kosovo](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959481323397992480/959550392595800124/unknown.png?width=339&height=540). with a lot of stubborn defense, we were eventually able to get them to quit their invasion, and formed an alliance.
Someone posted this to china_place and got my attention, laughed so hard when reading the story I didn’t realize happening. Ya you are totally right, that subreddit is a bunch of mess and chaos and infiltration is hardly useful at all lol, people who are more collective would probably not end up here hahahaha. 

Glad to see you have found a place to establish your logo! It’s a really nice piece (and aesthetically so much better than the Winnie they draw, if one day you changed your mind and decided to come back for this area I’m totally supporting that!!!)
Both Armenia and Georgia are destroyed by some flag with ego issues.
Well you know why cltv won? Because we have so many CCP haters in every time zone and we never sleep lmao
Agents? Camouflages? Disguises? Gimmicks and tricks are **USELESS** in front of CLTV's absolute power.
I got banned from the Discord server :(
Nasty nasty UC Berkeley students
Glory to the Ronin！Glory to XianZhong！Glory to Xi the pooh
Funny it’s a pity I didn’t join this battle. At first r/CLTV only intended to draw a sub picture and later members found they underestimated their strength and expended another picture of Tank man. But it really surprised me that r/CTLV could draw one more, that is, a total of three! Considering members of r/CLTV were helping free HK and Taiwan’s flags at the some time, when I thought it came to end, another battle were to begin. Much surprise!

Thanks haha, the whole thing was so crazy I had to document it.
They had to temporarily disable invites due to a streamer attack, it should be back soon.
Updated, thanks for the info!
As an UC alumni, I would prefer anything else over the current two bully flags. Also, there is a alliance between china-place and Armenia flag. However, the bots were too strong. We lost Armedia.

My attempt to highlight the flaws of Affirmative Action and why it doesn't do what it's supposed to: (Not a shitpost),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h9vaz8/my_attempt_to_highlight_the_flaws_of_affirmative/,2020-06-15 20:07:54,"Hey all, though I once yearned to be one of the shitpost legends on this sub, along the likes of u/HornyAsianBro, u/blockeleyhacker, and others, I am writing this in a more solemn state of mind, and I understand I will never reach that status.

THIS IS NOT A SHITPOST

You should know that I am Asian, as my haters would know, my post history reveals that I am a dual Korean-American citizen. I'm here to point out something that isn't original, but is certainly left alone more than it should be in regards to the debate around affirmative action, or racial consideration in the college admissions process in general.

Let me just say, I do not support Affirmative Action. Mind, I support its intention and the principle behind it, but it's clear to all of us that putting quotas on ""diversity"" is innately discriminatory and thoroughly nonsensical.

The Supreme Court case UC Regents v. Bakke pretty much established race as a necessary and important consideration in the admissions process-- we know it is. Anybody who knows anything knows that race (for the anthro majors, *ethnicity)* IS in fact a very integral part of our identities, experience, and realm of opportunity. I'm not here to argue that, and in fact, I know most of us aren't against that notion either. It's the fact that we allow this sentiment to drive unfair and often controversial policies into place, that lift some and bar others. Affirmative Action was not the solution to racial disparity in America.

It's also apparent that arguments in favor of AA tend to rationalize racial quotas as a necessary form or reparation to the impoverished African American and URM communities. While noble and righteous, it conflates *poverty* with *race*, and generalizes entire ethnic/demographic populations as representative of poverty, or lacking in opportunity.

This is one of AA's major issues. While seeking to address inequality in America, it attempts to solve that issue by generalizing the URM population as poor and the white/asian population as affluent enough. If the purpose of AA is to stimulate and encourage college education and opportunities for poverty-stricken students across the nation, wouldn't it make more sense to literally consider exactly that issue during the admissions process? Nope. Instead, Common App and most Universities choose to be ""need blind,"" and *IGNORE* incomes of applicants.

THIS is an issue; if my race does not constitute my identity, it certainly does not constitute a believable standard of income/societal privilege. Statistics aside, generalizations have NO place in something as paramount as college admissions. If anything, this is a MORE of a major impediment to poorer non-URM groups than it is a help to the much-needed diversity on college campuses.

Here's something tangible to consider: a popular sentiment around here is that rather than allowing race to decide admissions, merit is the more logical aspect to consider. This is applicable to any and all anti-merit policies and arguments. AA proponents will negate this by pointing out the disadvantages URMs deal with and the importance of diversity in public and private institutions. Like always. these are indeed things worthwhile to consider, yet it seems that it's only applied when its in the university's interest.

An example? Why doesn't the need for ""diversity"" apply to the NCAA, or any professional sport for that matter? Why is it okay for the Cal football team to be dominated by black and white students, with almost zero Asian representation? Why is the college athletics realm dominated by black students in general?

The answer is simple, if albeit generalizing: black students tend to perform better, receive more attention, and have proven themselves to have consistently better statistics than other ethnic counterparts. Basically, they've earned it, and they've worked for it. Asian americans have no place on the Cal football team unless they're at the competitive level of their peers. It makes sense, doesn't it?

Oh, it sure does. *Wait*, you say...

Yes. Merit makes *sense*. There's nothing to doubt about it. There is, however, something to doubt about Affirmative Action.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: The scale between merit and social service meets its tipping point when certain groups' opportunities are taken away to be given to another. Merit has been and should be the qualifying factor in college admissions.

edit: i wanted to crosspost this to r/ApplyingToCollege, but I was banned lol. If one of you guys think this is deserving of more discussion, please feel free to repost.","I don't really think your example of the football team illustrates what you think it illustrates. The  over-representation of black athletes in football is, if anything, an example of the structural issues in American society. We're fine reserving a few slots at our universities for athletes, who make universities crazy revenue while the athletes must sign away their right to make revenue off their absurdly lucrative talents. Those same athletes often don't get the same educational opportunities because their enrollment is tied to performing at what is essentially a full time job, at least for portions of the calendar.

Look, you get into how incredibly complicated it is to assess 'merit,' and you're entirely correct. Most college applicants have had to overcome one hardship or another, whether because of their ethnicity, sexual orientation, family income, geography, etc. Hey! There's the value of intersectionality - to try our best to understand all that and put in place policies that work to address those issues.

But I think it's ultimately kinda lazy to take all of that complication, throw up your hands, and say that the solution is worse than the current reality. Your very post recognizes that there are problems, so how do YOU suggest we build a better, more equal society?
While I do agree with most of the reasoning, you seem to make an assumption in your argument. It’s not perfectly clear that AA’s goal in the case of college admissions is to ensure equality regardless of income. We shouldn’t be thinking about income when we think about AA, that’s not the point, we should solely be thinking about race and whether or not all races are being represented well in admissions.

Whether we should also take into consideration income is another matter entirely. The question should be if AA is ensuring equality among races in the admissions process. If it is, then we should ask ourselves if its benefits outweigh its consequences.

The argument for AA is simple:

* These groups of people have been discriminated against *precisely* because of their race / appearance.  It is universal; even affluent minorities are still discriminated against, and would perhaps be even more affluent (based on their merit, if we're going to bring up that bag of worms) if such discrimination did not exist.

* AA seeks to redress the issue by directly targeting the groups targeted by discrimination.  Simple.

The merit argument is flawed in that it is circular.  Discrimination reinforces itself.  Those discriminated against have fewer opportunities, more challenges, and can be reliably found to 'achieve' less due to that.  They are less meritorious *because* of discrimination.  The majority groups are more meritorious *because* they have relative advantage.

_______

If the value of AA is recognized, then the next issue is where it should be applied.

AA in employment has some significant complications.  Logistically, there are many thousands of employers, so it is very difficult to implement.  They are also private companies that are aligned to their own competitive interests, rather than public institutions.  Tokenism is also a major issue in perpetuating discrimination.

Education is a natural target.  Ideally there would be more AA in early education, no doubt.  This is likely to be the most impact, and also avoids entirely the discussion of merit unless you begin to judge toddlers this way.  If such a system were in place, these arguments would be made - and loudly - but they are nonetheless absurd.

The problem with early education is that the structural funding issues prevent this from occurring.  Early childhood programs, which are demonstrably effective and money-saving, remain a near impossibility politically.  Actual AA in early education is a pipe dream.

College is then the natural target because it is a limited number of institutions, many with a powerful progressive voice that can hear reason.  Furthermore, secondary education functions as a powerful sorting mechanism in our society.  AA interventions here have powerful effects in future employment and life outcomes.

______

Opposition to AA is a kind of NIMBYism.  Most people can understand, at least in the abstract, that systematic discrimination is a real issue, and one that will not simply solve itself.  Even if slow progress over centuries would lead to social justice, it is morally reprehensible to let this situation endure for hundreds of years because it is inconvenient to address it affirmatively.

It is inconvenient to privileged groups.  This is not a bold new perspective.  It is one that simply prioritizes the issues directly in front of them over the undeniable and horrific issues of our society.
[deleted]
have my upvote; i didn’t consider your perspective on college sports and the implications of a black-dominated field. that’s a really good point, and we sort of reached the same conclusion, that it’s awfully complicated. my post didn’t aim at finding a new solution, it really was just a hard poke at Affirmative Action, since Cal is expected to pass thay bill in an upcoming vote.
literally doing nothing is more just than AA. because we go from ""deserving people might be passed over"" to ""deserving people will be passed over""
From an idealistic point of view, I certainly agree with the aims of race-based AA.  And from a both idealistic and pragmatic point of view, I completely agree with socio-economic status (SES) indicators, which Berkeley is actually successful at using at (UCs have a significantly higher percent of Pell Grant recipients than comparable schools)

However, I disagree with race-based AA (without significant checks, which a simple repeal of prop 209 fails to put in place) because how it ultimately gets implemented in a real system:

* It does not become an even-handed reparative system.  e.g. Asians (who were historically discriminated against -- and still are) don't benefit from Harvard considering race -- in fact, they are [actively discriminated against](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/realpenalty.pdf) relative to the white majority!
* While racism is present, in practice it's not really that clear that outcomes are significantly different once you condition on the type of SES factors UCs already consider. The sole exception seems to be [black men](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html).  (I'm open to other sources here contradicting this claim -- I've found it surprisingly hard in my research to find papers that compare race differences conditioned on SES rather than independently).
* Because race is so arbitrarily defined by administrators, benefits fail to go to the groups with the most need.  As one [example](http://www.jbhe.com/news_views/52_harvard-blackstudents.html), the majority of black students at Harvard are Caribbean or African immigrants (or children of) and very few are decedents of slaves.

Generally speaking, metrics like racial diversity are very coarse representatives of who is being helped.  Making this highly simplified metric itself a factor tends to pervert incentives. (e.g. discriminate against poor Chinese immigrants in favor of rich African immigrants)
This argument is valid if one of the following is true:

1) Affirmative action reduces the admissions of white students more so than for Asian American students

or 

2) Asian Americans have white privilege/don't suffer systemic racism. Anyone who believes this is true probably grew up in the bubble of the South Bay or similar, because it's not.

In every implementation of affirmative action I've seen, both are false, so affirmative action fails at equitably addressing systemic racism. Then, it's just a tool to introduce more diversity, which while I agree can be beneficial, is harder to use as a justification for denying more meritorious students.
Affirmative action is systematic discrimination. By definition.

And easily identifiable.
i either suggest you re-read my post or i suggest myself to re-read your comment; maybe there’s an imperative here i’m not grasping, because otherwise this isn’t what i argued at all
Just a graphic that I found helpful to think about.

https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/gq2n31/inequality_v_equality_v_equity_v_justice/

When you go to college, it might be a good idea to take some general education classes relating to these topics that you are discussing (both in philosophy and maybe in social sciences). I found them to be very interesting and open my perspective more than regular English classes.
I think it's pretty naive to say that, in the current system, deserving people 'might' be getting passed over.

But hey, if you think that the current educational system is equitable (or if you think that higher education doesn't have to play a role in fixing societal issues, as if high ed is somehow distinct and separate from society) I doubt there's anything I can say to change your mind.
[deleted]
any classes to recommend? my upcoming fall is purely technical; some humanities would be welcomed
the tree does not disallow the boy from moving to the left side

and anyways, according to this graphic inequality, equality, and equity all are bad options, and switching among them is a waste of time. so why argue whether or not AA pushes for equality vs equity when we should argue whether or not AA pushes for justice
agreed, my point is that affirmative action fails to solve any of these issues you mentioned. colleges literally go “need blind” and emit income during college admissions... meanwhile affirmative action uses race to qualify whether poverty affects the applicant or not. well which is it? my post just points out AA’s fallacies, it doesn’t refute anything regarding the real issues at hand. it also doesn’t support any particular course of action, other than against AA.
Hmm I have been out of school a while, but one class that had quite an impact on me was ESPM 163AC Environment Justice. No prereqs, fulfills a ton of breath requirements.

Not exactly applicable to AA but still interesting. So that's a real course with real work load. There are also many 1-2 credit seminar/special topic classes around in different department that are super interesting. It's awesome because the work load is so light but you get to learn something  completely out of your normal classes. It was super fun for me. You should really try to take advantage of that opportunity.

Edit: I was looking around on the catalog. It seems like a lot of classes satisfying American Culture requirement give good exposure to these ethnicity/race issues. Psych 167AC and polsci 117ac,167ac look cool too. Sociology 130ac, socwel 150AC, etc
Highly recommend Wealth & Poverty by Robert Reich. Incredibly popular and thought-provoking class.
I do love Robert Reich"
Hey quick question about the city of Berkeley's RPP program.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7qmm26/hey_quick_question_about_the_city_of_berkeleys/,2018-01-15 12:34:58,"I'm moving to Berkeley from out of state and am trying to understand the RPP program out there. What I understand according to [This Map](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_Transportation/RPP_R(1).pdf) is that there are ceretain neighborhoods that require certain permits. My question is, there is a lot of white space within the black boarder that isn't tied to a certain Zone. Is there some permit required for parking in those neighborhoods? Or if I get a rental on one of those streets I can park my car there without it getting ticketed? (Aside from moving it for street sweeping and every 72 hours so it doesn't look abandoned).

Thanks for the info!","No permit required, you're correct. Can always double-check the signs (or lack thereof) on the street to be sure. That said, the permits are easy to get assuming you're on the lease and able to transfer the car's registration to the Berkeley address (they're also massively underpriced). 
Short answer is yes, there are some streets that have chosen not to participate in the RPP program.  All of these blocks are about a mile or more from campus, and you can park there for up to three days (or more, if you're feeling lucky).   The 51B bus line has ~12 minute headways, so you can park around Sacramento and University Ave and take the bus to campus (or walk).
Thanks!
Thanks!

Good point. I was actually able to change the address online for mine and they accepted a printout as good enough when I got my permit."
Here's the info Chegg ACTUALLY shares in an official investigation [WORSE then you think],https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/m1rb0g/heres_the_info_chegg_actually_shares_in_an/,2021-03-09 22:33:42,"So I've seen several posts such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/g2420b/psa_heres_the_info_chegg_will_share_in_an/) that claim that during the investigation IP addresses and such are not shared for both the poster and the viewer. However, it actually does get shared!

Here is exactly what the information they get during a Chegg investigation looks like. This is from the excel file that shares all details (the excel file is what all universities/colleges will receive when simply requesting a Chegg investigation). They don't even have to specify the information they're looking for but rather Chegg would provide them with **all** of it.

There are two tabs at the bottom:

One that shares [asker's details](https://imgur.com/a/ISbKdTz) and another that share's [viewer's details](https://imgur.com/a/OhvVKZ9) \[Please note i blacked out the email and university name but those do show up\].

On the excel file in the question column it'll include a link that'll redirect you to the media that was used as the Chegg question and the same thing for the answers column except with the answers (even if the question is deleted this information will **still** be provided).

As a side note: The excel sheet was obtained from a question that WAS deleted (you can get Chegg to delete questions by submitting a Content Removal Request) nonetheless the information from the deleted question was still shared. They will share both the question and answers months later (even if you got it deleted right away because this question was posted and deleted in October but the Chegg investigation was requested this morning then the excel file was given a few hours later. So yes, Chegg does store deleted data).

**TLDR**:

* Chegg gives all the information that's filled out on the Chegg profile (including email address)
* Chegg gives IP address of both the person who posted and all viewers
* Even if you had your question deleted (could be months ago) Chegg will still provide the school with the question and all answers that it received (so yes deleted material is stored!)","good thing none of us cheat and use chegg right?

edit: /s, in case i get sued.
These don't mean anything though because IP addresses are not conclusive evidence of anything as they can change any second.
If only this much effort was put into actually teaching the material...
wait does this also apply if you just use Chegg to remt textbooks?
You misspelled ""than"".
Can they send credit card info?
You can’t fool us NotCarolChrist

They can easily match the IP address that was used to login to the student portal with that of the Chegg viewer

Pretty sure thats what happened here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/l7w7qw/psa\_my\_friend\_uses\_chegg\_for\_help\_with\_homework/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/l7w7qw/psa_my_friend_uses_chegg_for_help_with_homework/)
Came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/m1h9ve/look_who_is_advertising_on_rprofessors/) on the professor sub discussing Chegg and one of them said: 

""Ugh. I just spent almost my whole day searching for quiz questions on chegg so I can request their removal. DAMN YOU CHEGG *shakes fist""*

They literally spend more time witch hunting then they do teaching
Indeed, if the document is uploaded on the same LAN (without proxy)
We have an obligation to our honest students to vigorously pursue cheating.  If cheating ever gets above a threshold this acts to both devalue the degree from honest students and creates incentives where rational students are supposed to cheat.

Chegg is a big problem because they don't actually make it easy for faculty: monitoring is difficult and you have to go through Student Conduct to get results.  Their entire business model is really ""cheat on demand"".
When I was still at berkeley, cheaters pissed me off. The idea that people are straight up posting exam questions on chegg and getting answers is even worse. 

I'm glad instructors are doing something about it and don't think it's honestly all that much work. Like lmao it's not like classes are significantly worse because someone on staff spends a few hours requesting a spreadsheet and looking it over. Also, I'm guessing gsis do all the grunt work."

The fact that so many books still name the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved. 

In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for free for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply publicize what the music business wants to make money with.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. And rock critics will study more of rock history and realize who invented what and who simply exploited it commercially.

Beatles' ""aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll: it replaced syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.

Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for a good reason. They could not figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). THat phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Fours'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"". Not to mention later and far greater British musicians. Not to mention the American musicians who created what the Beatles later sold to the masses.

The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial band. 
uh...did you post in the right thread? I mean OP mentioned the Beatles once as a band he liked, not worshiped them as the greatest musical icon ever.

"What are your thoughts on affirmative action being re-implemented? Here's an account from a non-underrepresented-minority who still got screwed by the system but still wouldn't fit UC's proposed racial quota when pitted against someone from a ""rarer"" race.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hbvjav/what_are_your_thoughts_on_affirmative_action/,2020-06-18 23:22:12,"I'm conflicted. While I am partial to voting ""no"" this November should it be on the ballot, I have seen for myself what life is like for those who grew up in poverty (which tend to be underrepresented minorities like blacks and Latin people) and had to settle for crap high schools. I'm not sure if placing quotas based on race would solve the problem, since there are other ""races"" such as myself who was deprived of resources. I do, however, empathize with those who grew up with a fucked-up system holding me back. My name is RichMoneyBeast, and this is my experience of going to a shit high school.

As an Asian-American who grew up middle class but went to a well-known magnet elementary school, culminated to a reputably-ghetto middle school, and graduated to a high school notorious for fraud, fights, a racial killing, and riots, I've experienced what it's like to have the drive of going to an elite university with the lack of resources achieving that goal.

Let me start. Since, my freshman year of high school, I obsessed over getting admitted to UC Berkeley's EECS and UCLA's computer science & engineering by planning for four years of maximizing all AP classes available, taking CC classes to maximize my weighted UC GPA for sophomore and junior year, and trying different activities. I saw that the average GPA for both programs hovered around the 4.3-4.4 range (this was back in 2013), so the drive to straight A's was burning. Getting the A's was the easy part (until junior year; more on that later). I worked until 4am on some homework assignments for geometry while I saw my classmates barely passing by, coming into the classroom faded and outright disrespecting teachers (e.g., one time a student in freshman geography got an apple from teacher's fruit bowl and rubbed it on the crotch area of his basketball shorts, the class in unison calling the teacher ""Little Dick,"" a student impersonating a teacher's speech impediment from a stroke in front of his face). The school felt like the ghetto side of Twitter. As the only person who put effort in these ghetto classes, I was scared for my safety. I felt like a minnow in a pool of sharks.  There would be a routine smoke bomb in the restroom, the fume of marijuana dispersing in buildings, and even gang-affiliated fights. As a matter of fact, not giving a shit about school was cool. Many of you come from competitive high schools–which include but are not limited to–Bay Area, Beach City, and prep schools. You know how many of your classmates strived to get 5's on AP Exams? At my school, I was the only one in my graduating class besides a middle-class white girl to earn a 4 on AP Bio (2014). I was not surrounded by students whose parents had the means to provide them with a plethora of Barron's AP test prep. They hardly saw the incentive to work hard, since there's hardly an environment to influence them: go to school, be on your phone in class, kick it with friends. We didn't even have proper funding for SAT prep. The only remote thing to it was an English teacher volunteering his Saturdays to read from the official College Board test-prep book. No strategies. Literally just read the questions and leave students to work on them quietly like a bad GSI. Nevertheless, I performed well my 10th grade year having a 4.4 weighted GPA and being pleased with my bio AP score. I also was volunteering at the library that summer, so I felt like I had momentum going for me.

Enter 11th grade (grade-fraud teacher). I joined the debate team with the coach of the program being my AP Lang teacher. She had an abnormal obsession with UCLA, rocking Bruin swag in the classroom (even wore a UCLA Santa hat in December) and putting down USC. With the savvy of playing politics, she was able to become buddies the admins, who allowed her to teach mostly honors and AP students (i.e., not ghetto, but cooperative and submissive). She was excited to have me on the team, because other students claimed that I was hard worker and they thought I was ""smart."" (sorry if that comes off as cocky.) As the semester passed by, I found myself unable to keep up with debate, since my A-G classes were priority for the UC GPA. The tough was going for other students as well. Like me, many of them asked to be excused from the competitions. It got to the point where she got so frustrated in class that she screamed like a pig, ripped the Post-It sheet of our brainstorming ideas, and LEFT. It was so loud her neighboring teacher on the other side of the bungalow came in to check on us. We just sat in class until the bell rang. She also wasn't the best English teacher, since she put her all-in to debate. In 9th grade, for example (yup, had her back then too), she stopped inputting points onto the online grading portal. Sketch, I thought, but I ended up with an A, so I didn't bother challenging her or thinking this would foreshadow her whimsical grading system two years later. That same year, she gave my upperclassman classmate an A in AP Lang for selling chocolates for her debate team's fundraiser. Going back to junior year, she wasn't happy with me not reaching expectations of bringing the team the gold, despite me doing all the assignments and going to all but one competition. Based on the point system on the syllabus, I should have gotten an A. At the end of the semester, we had a final in-class essay for AP Lang. It was argumentative; the prompt was to write about why competition is good. I wrote about the advancement of technology from Cold War and gave my points, evidence, and explanations like the AP Lang exam wanted. I came up to her after school to ask for my final-semester grade. She asked me, ""what do you think you deserve?"" ""An A,"" I said, thinking about all the essays I turned in on time done correctly. She read my final paper, and wholeheartedly disagreed with her liberal viewpoints. She said ""no. no. no,"" and told me that I can't get an A. She literally based my grade on one final in-class writing. I, along with many other students, know she didn't grade our papers. We had no grade reports, JupiterGrades was nonexistent, and the signed parent signatures ""for points"" laid at the same table for the rest of the school year. Four weeks later: C in debate, B in AP Lang. I felt crushed. I  My competitive GPA was ruined. I didn't even bother thinking of applying to colleges anymore. I lost the drive for school and was clinically-depressed until community college.

Enter a fucked-up system. This wasn't the only case. As the years, went on, admin was caught purposely changing grades to benefit students. One audit found that football players were constantly absent and earned straight A's. That same teacher who screwed me was approached by a disgruntled student one year later, asking her, ""Why do I have an F \[on the 5-week\]? I did all the work."" She gave some non-answer with her typical attitude. He got mad, and pushed her to the ground. My friend who was a passerby saw her screaming to another student for help, and offering to give him points LMAO. Karma was catching up I guess. The same year. I enrolled in a 3rd-year foreign language course to be competitive for UC (no honors option). Guess what? School budget was low, so I we were merged with the same class as \[foreign language\] speakers 1. Ultimately, the class was cancelled and I was moved to digital imaging. Great, so now I can't even take a 3rd year of foreign language, and the school stopped teaching the AP version of the class a long time ago. Ah, maybe there's hope with AP Calc BC! Nope. It has never been taught, since there aren't enough students to enroll in the class.

Enter the conclusion. While I am Asian-American and grew up with a roof over my head and food on the table, I certainly was not in an optimal environment that paved me a Berkeley-bound path. I exhausted my high school resources, and they fired back at me. I was surrounded by peers who championed academic neglect. I was born Asian. If admissions were going to pit me against some underrepresented minority who easily had the resources to succeed at some fancy beach-city high school who got the same C and B as me, I know they'd have implicit biased, asking ""why did this asian kid get a C? Must be lazy..."" That's not fair, UC. While I do understand that there is a need for more diversity to improve our campus environment, I personally do not think discriminating on race is the way to go. Look what the CS department has done in the last few years. It has increased the enrollment of women many-fold without the need for quotas. What UC needs to do improve its outreach programs and incentivize driven people from underrepresented groups to apply. I'll tell you right now, people from these groups at my high school thought about USC and UCLA. I've never heard a black guy dreaming of going to Berkeley. I personally think the problem is how the school brands itself. While I certainly don't want Berkeley's student body to be homogenous, I think we should approach the diversity problem from another perspective. These recently-proposed changes (abolish SAT, affirmative action) are dangerous if implemented with haste.

People of r/berkeley, what are your thoughts on affirmative action?

EDIT 1 (6/9/20 @ 1:01pm): To clarify, I'm a student here at Berkeley. I chose the community college with more resources and better transfer rates than the one closer to home. I learned my lesson from high school. I applied to only UCLA and UC Berkeley, got into both, and chose Berkeley, so GO BEARS!","I still think the UC’s do a better job of viewing applicants based on the context of their school rather than race. Instead, family income/geographic location are better indicators of students’ access to resources.
>proposed racial quota

Nobody is proposing a racial quota. That's unconstitutional.
Here’s my take: do SES based AA, not racially based AA
Since in today's world you can't touch these topics without first bringing your race, I'll start by clarifying I'm a Latino alumn.  


Racial-based AA is bullshit.  


It is, first of all, pretty overtly discriminatory, of the type that doesn't improve race relations the least bit.  


Second of all, it even misses the mark in its intended purpose: \*Class\* based affirmative action is infinitely more effective and less discriminatory than race based AA, and would do everything race based affirmative action wants to do without the political baggage that comes with it. If Latinos and Blacks are consistently more economically challenged than Asians and whites – and they are – then class based AA already helps them out more, without also shafting poor Asian and White students that also grew up in adverse conditions and also worked their asses off.  


Third of all, it's not even good for the students it purports to help: It leads to impostor syndrome and – what's worse – it leads to pretty much everyone (including the student) wondering if he managed to get into the school or medical program, or whatever, because of his qualification or his race.  


And lastly, it's not even good for a student to go into a school that he's perhaps not academically prepared for just because it's more prestigious. There's actually been plenty of evidence to suggest that, long term, a more suitable academic environment where students are challenged but not overwhelmed is much better for their job and research prospects than going to a cutthroat environment where they're overwhelmed and possibly even drop out.  


I hope this effort fails, and race based AA is not implemented. If it is… I'll just be happy to know at least I managed my admission and subsequent graduation from Cal in a time before this happened. I'm more than happy standing on my own two feet, thanks.
I also have mixed feelings.

It seems pretty clear to me that targeting racial disparities at the point of college applications is missing the mark...we need to get to a point where we have parity in early childhood educational outcomes if we want to have a real chance at economic equality between races. I also worry that affirmative action creates unique opportunities for discrimination...for example, looking at the resume of a black Harvard grad as lesser than the resume of an Asian Harvard grad, all other things being equal. And I empathize with the frustrations of Asians who have to meet a much higher bar to get into schools that use affirmative action.

On the other hand, it's pretty clear that there is a racial under-representation problem on campus, and it's not clear how else the admins could effectively address it. We've seen a huge proliferation in these vague ""diversity"" initiatives since affirmative action was outlawed, and there's very little to show for them. Affirmative action cuts through the bullshit and gets right to the point.
The sentiment behind it is swag, but since college admissions offices are supposed to take things like race, poverty, and struggle into account already, I don’t see the point of putting up quotas that hurt overrepresented minorities who worked to achieve what they have attained.

Tl;dr: the sentiment is swag, but AA itself is not yolo.
I read the whole thing. Good on you overcoming that! I went to a high school that was similar to yours, though not quite as bad. I had a super long road to college as a result, and its a big accomplishment to do well in spite of such a bad environment. I think you bring up some very valid concerns.
 [https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/labor-employment-law/employment-discrimination/Affirmative-Action.html](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/labor-employment-law/employment-discrimination/Affirmative-Action.html) 

""An employer or school takes affirmative action when it **puts in place programs, plans, and efforts designed to eliminate discrimination in the hiring or admissions process, remedy the effects of past discrimination, or prevent future discrimination**. For example, an employer could sponsor or participate in job fairs on historically black college campuses to attract a more diverse pool of job applicants. However, an employer can't consider an individual's race during the hiring process without violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

Commentators have cautioned that affirmative action and strict minority quota systems should not be confused with one another. While the U.S. Supreme Court has held that strict racial quotas are unconstitutional in university admissions, the Court has upheld affirmative action policies that use race as one factor to be considered in making an admissions decision.""

I think in most scenarios people are misrepresenting or misunderstanding AA as racial quotas when it's meant to add more nuance to an already biased application system. Now, the exact methods of AA haven't been revealed yet, but there is a clear plan to make college (UCs) more accessible to underrepresented high school students.
It's a multi-faceted issue with three aspects that are more extreme than Others: 

1. The UC is at extreme risk of going against the Supreme Court decision they lost in the '70s. 
2. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits such discrimination and the UC (and their students) may be at risk of losing federal funds. 
2. The actual amendment to the California Constitution that would allow the UCs to re-institute Affirmative Action does MUCH MORE and it is a genuine problem. 

**The Supreme Court Issue**
In UC Regents vs. Bakke, it was determined that there couldn't be a race quota system in the UC's Affirmative Action program. Race could be used as a factor, but not a basis for admission/denial. Eventually the UC evolved to us a Comprehensive Review where the student's high school performance was evaluated within the student's individual context: 

1. How good was the high school?
2. How many rigorous classes were offered vs. how many were taken?
3. What hardships did the student face (bad home life, paid job, low income, victim of crime, surviving major social tensions)?

Now, the UC hasn't released any of their plans to reintegrate race as a factor, but they've already released their intent and I think that's doomed their plans. The UC has long had a goal of achieving a racial/ethnic/gender mix of students that mirrors the California mix. In all the interviews with the president and the Regents and President of the UC regarding their support for this amendment to the California Constitution, they've mentioned that we haven't attained that goal ""fast enough"". And I guarantee you that if Affirmative Action is brought back, these statements will be used to shoot it down in court. That will be another black eye on the UC and the lawsuit with the cost of defense being borne by the students.  

If you have a goal proportion of races and you explicitly want to use race as a factor in admissions, you have a quota. The quota may not be annual, but it's still a mandate to achieve a proportion of particular races by some measure of time. By saying, ""It hasn't been fast enough,"" those in charge are admitting that they have a deadline in mind. 

**Federal Funding**

The Title VI issue is pretty darn big as well. (https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/hq43e4.html)

> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects people from discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title VI states that:

> No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

> Programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from the United States Department of Education (ED) are covered by Title VI. 

**Allowing the State to Legally Discriminate**

The other, even greater problem is the constitutional amendment itself. Here's the link to the bill: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACA5 

There's a massive preamble with the legislative effect being:
> hereby proposes to the people of the State of California, that the Constitution of the State be amended as follows: That Section 31 of Article I thereof is repealed.

What is Section 31 or Article 1? 

> The State shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. 

Let's just have a count of people that want the State to LEGALLY do what is currently forbidden by Section 31.
I actually read the whole thing and it doesn't seem like most people in the comment section did. Either way though I went to a similar high school, only in the Bay Area and maybe not as bad but not the ""Berkeley-Bound"" school like you mentioned. Even though Affirmative Action would benefit me I also think about the white and Asian kids at my school who have to deal with the same bs as you mentioned. Your story really related to me and honestly tells the story on why income impacts your chances at college. It also tells why I personally think being middle class at a school like you mentioned is way worse than being low income at a top magnet or public school. Coming from a High School like that do you going going Test Blind is a step in the right direction? I know a lot of people on this sub oppose it, but it makes sense when they went to a top school so they are naturally going to have Higher test scores despite having the same or a lower GPA than the kid from a school like you mentioned.
I think affirmative action actually hurts those it purports to help. Because underrepresented minorities receive a boost to their application, it means that they are, on average, less academically qualified than White or Asian students. 

Because classes are graded on a curve, the upshot is that they end up with lower GPAs on average than their counterparts. 

Table 2.3 in this document https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013150.pdf shows this GPA disparity pretty clearly. 

Also anecdotally, AA leads to a lot of imposter syndrome. It makes it very easy to believe that you only got in because of your race and hence do not really belong here, when that is not necessarily true.
It seems like a good idea on paper, but I don't trust college admissions to do a thorough job accounting for all factors. I would imagine that a wealthy underrepresented minority would be viewed as favorable to a less well-off non-underrepresented demographic for the reason that they could potentially donate more money in the future.
Honestly, I think we should strive for a ""colorblind"" ideal. Race, as stated on an application, is too broad of a category. I think we should consider case by case if we want to give people preferential treatment based on hardships in life, not apply a band-aid solution like AA. That being said, we live in a democracy, and it should probably be up to the voters to decide.
Id like to think admissions is smart enough to tell the difference between who is privileged or not and really use AA to focus on those underrepresented minorities and give them a better opportunity but will anyone really know if they get in through AA or not? I think any program that tries to accomplish that is worthwhile obviously it really isn’t fair if kids have the same experiences but race is the factor but there is no black representation in most industries and higher power positions. Until we can fix the gap AA serves to provide opportunities. If you want more BIPOC in management and as professors and in government it starts at the educational level. Yes the non-underrepresented minorities take a hit but there are white asian and Indian CEOs out there. US society does not value black lives and even if it takes away from other deserving students the change has to start somewhere. I don’t think AA is perfect and outreach and community support is better but that’s a much harder problem to solve. Using race as an admissions determinant serves as a quicker fix to at least try to equalize the proportions
ima keep it real with you cheif, ain't nobody reading all that shit lmfao.  

anyways, to answer your question, race based AA is dumb for a number of reasons and doesn't even address the root cause of why URMs are disadvantaged when it comes to college admissions in the first place (being poor/not having the money to resources).  

The clear correct solution is to implement AA with heavy emphasis on economic status and not race. this would never happen though because government officials feel the need to serve black + latinos (even if the solution only looks good on the surface and doesn't cause real change), and since asians aren't really vocal in the political scene no one really cares if we get fucked over. 


There's an argument to be made that 4 year retention/graduation rates could drop since in theory less academically gifted students would be able to gain admission to a rigorous school like Berkeley.. Not to mention that racial AA only hurts the diversity of majors that need objective performance to gain admission to (i.e CS/Stats/Econ/Math etc.) since we're now using race in the criteria instead of sticking to pure academic achievement.
Schools are Bringin back institutionalized racism ? 😳
This post definitely needs more attention. I personally think that if UCs are going to be instating racial quotas and admitting students with a new emphasis on race and gender rather than merit, the integrity of the entire UC system will go down. 

This may be a controversial point, but if people are admitted not for the content of their character - their hard work and achievements - but rather for the color of their skin, how is it fair that AA would be taking opportunities from those who would have originally been admitted under the current merit-based system to give to others? 

I do understand that it’s important to address the individuals who may not have grown up under the best circumstances or given the best resources, but it would be more effective to address the problem at its root such as with funding for help, resources, and better K-12 education in needed areas as opposed to cutting people off at the admissions level.
You know you can transfer, right? It isn’t the end of the world.
Coming from a school similar to the OP's mentioned one, only not in LA I honestly think that a low income person going to a top magnet or public school is a greater advantage than the middle class kid like the one OP mentioned.
TIL wealthy minorities aren't discriminated against.
>There's actually been plenty of evidence to suggest that, long term, a more suitable academic environment where students are challenged but not overwhelmed is much better for their job and research prospects 

Hey! Sorry for the late comment haha but could you please give me a source if possible? I'm against AA being implemented and I'm scouring the internet for some good data I can pull up. This argument seems especially good to me, and if you would be able to give me a source, it'd be very helpful! Thanks!
>It seems pretty clear to me that targeting racial disparities at the point of college applications is missing the mark 

I feel the same way. It really seems as though the UC wants to help more than it actually can. You know the saying, ""When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail""? Well, the UC can control who it admits and SOME aspect of financial aid. They can't control....

1. Applicants' household income
2. Applicants' educational opportunities through 12th grade
3. Applicants' parents' education

Still, they're going to try to correct those problems by re-implementing state-sponsored racial discrimination. Because this isn't just about college admissions. This is the part of the state constitution they support repealing: 

> The State shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.

Destroying that in an attempt to improve the educational outcomes of certain people is like using one's proverbial hammer to repair cracks in windows.
Race based quotas are actually unconstitutional. However, what are allowed in other states (and not CA) is the use of race as a “plus-factor” in a wholistic admissions process.
Thank you! Glad to be a Bear now. I learned my lesson and went to the community college with resources rather than the one closer to home.
The problem is that the UC administrators have, even in just their latest interviews, constructed their plans as a quota effectively shooting themselves in the foot. 

**End Goal -- A Specific Proportion of Racial Population**
The UC has stated in many, many documents, websites, talks, etc. that the goal is to have the ethnic/racial/sex/gender make-up of the UC system mirror that of the population of the State of California (or at the very least reflect the make-up of the most recent graduating high school class). 

**A Deadline**
Pull up any of the interviews with the UC Regents or Napolitano and you'll find them saying that we have the above goal and that we've made big progress, but it hasn't been fast enough. That implies that they have a deadline. 

Thus: End goal of racial proportions with a deadline. That's a quota. And if they explicitly use race as a factor to meet that quota, they'll be in contravention of *Bakke*.
Well fuck me then if we start using the same discrimination whites used against people of color to attempt to ""right"" (very obvious) wrongs while some people in your own admission ""take a hit."" 

I don't think stopgap solutions ever achieve lasting justice (hence the term stopgap) and while I will admit community support is harder to achieve, why isn't there a referendum on it? If the voters of California are willing to allow affirmative action to hastily achieve racial representation in the UC system but would not willing to  support reform to what happens in education before college admissions, then that shows they don't substantially care about the educational outcomes of people of color at all.
I did. I'm here. I got into UCLA and Berkeley as a transfer. But as an inexperienced high school student, my mental health was still crushed. I–and many people at that age–didn't have the proper coping mechanism to see that it wasn't the end of the world. I was still depressed to work hard and still get unmeasured grades I didn't deserve.
The purpose of affirmative action isn't to eliminate all discrimination everywhere. The purpose of affirmative action is to adjust for disparities in opportunities, which are primarily a function of economic class.
I don’t think anyone would say that. But, I’d say that a black child of millionaires who goes to a private school will usually have a much more similar experience and access to resources as a white child of millionaires who goes to private school than they do with a poor black kid from a ghetto. 

The argument would be that the chief means of discrimination for minorities is lack of access to resources, and socio-economic status is a better proxy for that.
No one said that. Wealthy minorities largely have access to the same opportunities and resources as wealthy white people. Look at any POC student at a rich prep school.
Hey man, no problem.

What you're looking for is something called ""Mismatch Theory"", and is one of the biggest existing criticisms currently present against affirmative action. There's *a lot* of papers out there discussing the theory, some backing them up, others criticizing its findings (as is par for the course), but there's also a lot of really mediocre ""opinion"" articles out there from both sides trying to dismiss or support the theory one way or the other. I would suggest you mainly stick to the academic side of the theory, otherwise you'll be bogged down by endless useless articles from the culture wars.

>If the voters of California are willing to allow affirmative action to hastily achieve racial representation in the UC system but would not willing to support reform to what happens in education before college admissions, then that shows they don't substantially care about the educational outcomes of people of color at all.

I think they care enough for the ""goal"" to be met so they can say it has been done, but not enough to actually do the work/pay the money to improve the quality of education so that underrepresented groups naturally matriculate to 4-year universities in representative proportions.

However, I also think that California voters will not support ACA 5. The effort stinks of racial preference and would require that we compromise our well-ingrained expectation of race-blindness by the government. (That's not to say the government should be blind to **hardships**, but that the government should not have racial bias or preference.)
There is no instant fix so you have to start somewhere. Ofcourse AA is not the perfect solution but denying it and waiting for a better option is harmful. There’s so many issues that if you keep putting it off nothing will happen. Community support is hard to fix black representation in schools and business is not as hard so using race to help more get in schools is an easy step. California voters don’t really care about black lives. The US as a whole doesn’t and won’t change instantly so increasing representation will have lasting down stream effects that can spur on the true change that needs to happen. AA gives people a chance even if it’s not the best. Opportunity is better than nothing.
Don't worry about your grades too much lol. GPA is such a poor measure of ability imo. It can vary too much between schools and circumstances. A standardized metric like the SAT, while flawed, is a more objective way of comparing applicants, since you are expected (in theory) to score roughly the same if you were to retake the exam.
Yeah but poor minorities have even more difficult conditions than poor whites. SES based AA also doesn't account for the massive privilege that is ancestral education.
Thank you so much! I've been invited to speak at a few lowkey places , and have been searching for academic arguments against race-based AA. This really helps my case! Idk if what I'll do have any sort of impact, but I guess we'll find out in November!
Yup, that's exactly what I was thinking, just a rubber stamp and a pat on their own back to say ""yay we did it.""
I propose this: the essays are very well suited for an applicant to discuss the hardships they have faced and how those have shaped them as a person. This even allows for individual nuance rather than assuming things based on race alone. Admission reps should reach out to underprivileged school districts to help those students convey this more effectively.
I've actually been a part of that effort. It's called ""higher education outreach"" and most (all?) UC campuses have entire departments that do this type of work. https://cep.berkeley.edu/

I think better funding of *this* type of effort is way more ethical and effective in the long run than giving certain applicants bonus points based on their race.

Additionally, I've been an essay reviewer multiple times, going through hundreds of essays over he winter break."

    (A Poem for the 99%)
    when Hope comes back
    he will be more than a campaign slogan
    and a face on a poster faded red, white, and blue
    he will not come from a presidential palace
    bought and paid for like a Citibank stock option villa
    he will put not forget to put on his walking shoes
    and join the picket lines in New York
    the bread lines in Baltimore
    to shake the calloused hands
    of everyone walking by

    when Hope comes back
    he might be named Barack
    but he won’t be named Obama

    when Hope comes back
    he will be a Black Panther baby
    who speaks Spanglish
    and cooks Korean tacos
    and does 180 sun salutations
    to the soundtrack of Zion I
    - yes, Hope is hella Bay

    when Hope comes back
    he will be a UFW farmworker
    who loves his fields and his flag
    more than he hates his foreman
    he will be a runaway foster child
    who forgives his parents
    he will be an Iraq war veteran
    who returns to protest in Oakland again
    without tear gas canisters to his head

    when Hope comes back
    he will come back from the future
    in a DeLorean like Michael J. Fox
    and show us all the things we’d won
    like people swimming across the Rio Grande
    for fun rather than survival
    and the only student debt being to our livers
    rather than to our banks
    and then Michael J would take us
    for a ride back to the past
    and show us this is not our first occupation
    Flint, sit-down strikers in ’36
    Alcatraz, American Indian Movement in ’69
    Sproul Plaza, Free Speech Movement in ’64
    and every semester since then that was worth a damn
    and reminded Berkeley what it means
    to be called Berkeley

    when Hope comes back
    he will be one of my students
    East Asia meets East Oakland
    brilliantly cross-continental
    even though he hates the ocean
    speaks with the wisdom of Buddha and Mac Dre
    really, he is my teacher
    and I think he knows it
    and we’re both ok with that

    when Hope comes back
    he will actually be a she
    because hey, that’s who actually gets shit done
    she will be a librarian by day, a DJ by night,
    an Occupy activist in between
    she will be thick hair and thick hips
    and if you try to touch either one
    you’ll get a thick hand to the face
    when Hope comes back
    she’ll show us to burn down the banks in our
    hearts and love without lust or profit or restraining orders

    when Hope comes back
    she will be an OPD cop,
    then NYPD, then UCPD,
    refusing to follow orders
    putting down their riot gear
    and picking up a picket sign
    cuz when the cops join the 99% they actually belong to
    that’s when the banks will have nowhere to hide

    when Hope comes back
    she will be a midwife
    in tune with the moon and the womb
    an ancient healer who knows every herb in the redwoods
    ready to help us birth a new world
    one without bombs or borders or Michelle Bachman
    a planet of peoples free to honor the earth
    and each other like the God
    in whose image we’re still trying to evolve into

    when Hope comes back
    she will be here
    right here, right now
    on the streets and plazas and parks
    of New York and DC
    Milwaukee and Austin
    Portland and Nashville
    London and Manila and Cairo
    San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, CA
    with the people and the hashtags
    setting up her tent in the morning
    paintings banners in the afternoon
    attending ridicously long meetings in the evening
    shutting down the port of Oakland
    and reminding us all that yes,
    Hope still lives here in America
    she has always lived here with us

    and now she is back before our eyes
    marching head high, fist higher
    and whispering to the millions amongst her,
    Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Thank you.

ASUC Senator Gabbi Sharp is a racist,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pswbsz/asuc_senator_gabbi_sharp_is_a_racist/,2021-09-21 17:51:33,"I want to [respond to the assertion](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/psphby/would_you_support_the_recall_of_asuc_senator/hdr822i/) that racist comments she made before taking office should not be included in the discourse surrounding the recall effort, and that it's our fault for not finding out sooner.

This makes no sense to me. The comments were made this year, at most a few months before her taking office. So, why should we keep the discourse limited to comments she made after taking office? Racism is racism. All of the comments are evidence of her poor character and fitness. And they should all be considered for purposes of initiating a recall. Unless she magically changed her racist beliefs and was forgiven by everyone within the span of a short few months, there's no reason to exclude the comments made before she was in office in our discourse.

In my opinion, operating fairly and putting on a professional image is necessary but not sufficient to serving on ASUC; you also have to not be a racist piece of shit in your personal life. And so what if voters could have read her comments before voting? Perhaps they could have, or perhaps they were too busy, unaware, or disengaged at the time for whatever reason. Perhaps it was difficult to access the tweets, or maybe nobody suspected she was racist and thus bothered to look. Just because we missed the tweets the first time around, doesn't mean we shouldn't take them into consideration and discuss them upon their discovery, later. Especially since it was pretty fucking easy to have missed those tweets.

I believe that even if she made 100 racist tweets the day before she took office, and then became squeaky clean the day after - no longer tweeting anything racist, that would still warrant a recall. Poor character and racism in her personal life is enough to give her the boot, especially if she's dumb enough to do it publicly and so brazenly.","SHE NEEDS TO GET BOOTED ASAP!! A sickening racist statements of hers against Asian, Latinos, whites and any other group of people coming from a fellow golden bear and most specially a freaking student senator raises damning questions about wtf are we doing wrong on this campus letting this occur. If this news gets out, I'm positive donors will start asking way tougher questions as to how their donations allow for hatred and racism of this kind to flourish on our campus! She needs to face repercussions.
While I’m out of the loop and need to take some time to educate myself on this specific issue, I do want to comment on past statements being used against public figures.  

In general, I think past statements are absolutely fair game, but I also think we need to have a “statute limitations” on how far back statements can be used against you, which should scale with age.  For example: Statements made as a minor should only be able to be used against you for 4 years since made, 8 years for statements made until 26, 12 years for statements made any later (very arbitrary numbers, just explaining what I meant).  I believe people and culture changes and we haven’t figured out how to deal with that in the digital age.

With that being said, a number of these statements were made in 2021, I have no shield for that, people do not change overnight and you absolutely should use those statements against someone who just took public office.
I'm very surprised that it's been a quiet subject within the DailyCal or any other platform of Cal info, and I can see why people won't report on this because of the freedom of speech argument. 

This may not be related, but the ASUC is such a problematic presence in the Cal student experience. From the few people who mentioned their time with ASUC, it's been an unpleasant experience. In some parts, it's due to the extreme views many ASUC senators hold (like Gabbi for example), or [differing ideologies](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/09/08/asuc-executive-vice-president-aditya-varma-resigns/), and the other is the lack of power an actual senator holds. Either way, I feel like the ASUC are not going to give the proper dedication and justice to this issue of recall. 

But as many have mentioned previously, taking the proper measures of creating a petition would be best to proceed.

Why do you need to use a burner to say this?
I wonder how this would go face to face, instead of on the internet. People tend to act differently when they're typing, just like her and you I'm sure. Are you guys that threatened by someone who lets you feel a slightest hint of the racism that might be a rude taste but no actual understanding of the racism in the the ratio of homeless people to rich people versus powerful CEOs versus janitors or 3,000 dead from 9-11 but 900,000 killed by American bombs in 20 years of American supremacy or freedom to you and me. In how teachers treat some answers with a frown but a slightly more confident but similar answer given by someone who looks more like the teacher's kids a smile? She doesn't match your image of a competent polite civil servant, but tearing her down from this anonymous perch claiming to defend us from racism because she made in the past some harmless comments that offended you makes me think you're more upset she doesn't treat you with the praise you feel entitled to for simply being not racist and wanting to help by stripping an outspoken poc who isn't perfect of something she surely worked hard for and probably didn't even expect to attain. She does need to grow as a person and clearly improve her public diplomacy, but these pitchforks and anonymous internet chat handles to hide behind like a mask do not make for a righteous crusade. Maybe politics though and maybe more anger than is deserved towards someone who doesn't seem to hate you or want to hurt you. To me, it looks like she's expressing how it's felt on her end as an experiencer of that polite and subtle racism we have been conditioned to accept, that you find impolite to be made to taste. I would probably try to say this differently in person too though.
Y’all really don’t like it when POC don’t want to be in your perfect civil yes master molds huh?
Lie again
I wonder how many people actually vote in ASUC elections; I know in my time as a student I did not vote in a single one.  Nobody ever articulated to me what ASUC did for me enough for me to actually care about it, nor do I recall any candidate running a gotv campaign (or any campaign that went beyond chalking).  If there's nobody bothering to drive turnout (and no good information on candidates), then it's no shock that candidates with fringe opinions can get elected.
Well if the daily cal isn’t reporting on this because of “freedom of speech,” that’s absurd. I don’t see how that argument is relevant in this matter. Nobody is saying she can’t say what she wants; she’s totally allowed to spew racist drivel. But freedom of speech doesn’t shield her from criticism, repudiation or even a recall. 

The daily cal should be reporting it for many reasons. 1) it’s newsworthy 2) it involves a public campus representative and 3) it’s information that voters and constituents ought to know. 

It’s more likely that the daily cal is staying quiet because their editors agree with Gabbi’s worldview: that racism is okay as long as it’s directed at certain groups. They probably also don’t want to seem like they are going against someone of color.
>I can see why people won't report on this because of the freedom of speech argument

This is a misunderstanding of freedom of speech. It means that the government cannot limit your speech (except in narrow instances where it leads to physical danger). People responding to her speech with Reddit posts, DailyCal articles, or street protests is *itself* free speech. If one group of speech critiques another group of speech, that is free speech. Your words have consequences, and in a country of free speech, other citizens, groups, or newspapers can come after your free speech with their own free speech. It is a marketplace of ideas and if we collectively think some ideas are poisonous to society, we can collectively disavow and punish it via boycotts, recalls, etc, as long as we are not the government. That is an important way to deal with racism and prejudice (along with policy reforms where systemic racism comes into play). And I don't just mean in this instance. An entire town did it to Richard Spencer where his home base used to be.
Yikes. I get that she’s trying to remove her private account, but using this reason on removing posts on the Reddit is problematic ☠️☠️
It depends on if you are using the dictionary definition or not. If someone says something racist that doesn’t mean they said something powerful and prejudicial. Most people separate the two by systemic racism and racism. Typically used Racism being your version of race based prejudice and bigotry. 

At the end of the day we are dancing around semantics. There’s no denying she said some hateful racially motivated stuff. Whether you call that racism is besides the point. If it makes it easier whenever you see the word racism directed towards white people just read it as race based prejudice and you’re good.
When plenty (majority) of people use the term racism to apply to prejudiced actions towards someone on the color of their skin, you can’t just introduce a new definition (wrt oppression dynamics) and tell everyone they are not using the word correctly. 

Is there an important distinction to be made between racism from those in positions of power vs those in oppressed classes? *Absolutely*. I think racism from whites is MUCH more problematic than racism from blacks. But we can’t just change the meaning of the word in order to distinguish these different kinds of racism. We certainly can discuss it by talking about “systemic racism” etc to distinguish racism in the context of oppression dynamics vs individual racism. 

I understand the intent is to raise awareness of that distinction which is a good thing, but attempting to change a definition forcefully and tell people they are using the wrong definition is a subversive technique that only angers people more instead of convincing them of that important distinction. Language is fundamentally emergent and descriptive, not normative. 

It’s this strange “well obviously you haven’t taken a class on racial justice” argument when people try to accuse blacks people of racism. It’s this weird “well I was taught the REAL definition of racism” whereas you were taught the definition in a dictionary. You’re just arguing over how different people define a word, when the definition is just a result of how people *use* a word. If people are using the word racism to for both systemic racism as well as interpersonal racism, then the meaning of the word encompasses both usages. So we should stop trying to use semantics to force the conversation and just have the conversation, which will be more fruitful.
I had a similar take, also downvoted into oblivious, thanks for speaking up.
Y’all don’t wanna read, you just hate on anyone who doesn’t agree with you 

🤡🤡
You’re the one muddying the waters. There already exists a term to describe what you’re talking about, systemic racism. No one is accusing her of perpetuating systematic racism. But she very clearly is racist towards mixed race and Latino people, in addition to making racist comments about white people. Despite lacking the social power to enforce systemic racism against those people, she can still be racist towards them on an individual level
even if we grant you this, she's still a racist. have you seen the shit she's said about mixed race people and light skinned latinos? it's still racism.
Most people don’t subscribe to that fringe definition of racism. I certainly don’t.
shut up, asshole
Not a burner, my username was made in jest. I mostly lurk, but I’ve been posting for years.
I mean, he's an uninvolved, terminally online non-student orchestrating an online campaign to oust a young progressive black LGBTQ woman elected representative over tweets that contain no slurs, no credible threats, no doxing or calls for online harassment. He's not exactly on solid ground lol.

She's since locked her Twitter, because (unlike Gabbi), this guy has directed online action (which, for black lgbtq women inevitably includes harassment) against a specific, in real life person.
FACTSS!!!!
First, use paragraphs. Second, it has nothing to do with racism or feeling threatened and everyone knows it. This is about weaponizing the language of cancel culture to attack a political opponent for making stupid jokes.
lol shes being an asshole and people are calling her out for it
TWO COMBATANTS SPAR
what the hell is an ASUC
Yep, I think that's a main issue regarding student government on campus which is that a good part of the student pop don't know how the ASUC function and how it impact us.
I have no idea when elections even take place, or how to vote in them.
The DailyCal reports on ASUC elections turnout. Last Spring, elections had 8,769 students vote, which is about 20% of the student population (but \~28% of the undergrad population). That being said, the number of votes for each senator, typically are less than 200. You only need \~150 votes to get a senate seat, because voting turnout drops off at the senator level (even ASUC exec board - people are mostly voting on referendums and student fees).

Spring 2021 Senate Election results: [https://www.dailycal.org/2021/04/10/independent-candidates-sweep-majority-in-asuc-senate-for-2nd-year-in-a-row/](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/04/10/independent-candidates-sweep-majority-in-asuc-senate-for-2nd-year-in-a-row/)
couldn't agree more. they tell us racism, bigotry, hatred has no place on this campus (and they're right) - then they should do something about this!
agreed - the daily cal has always had biases and sometimes they’re more obvious than others
Great point! I do agree to an extent that there is functionally no difference between systematic racism and racism.  My main point was that I wanted to point out the connotations carried between these wordings and why it would matter ( especially in an academic setting where interpretation could hold a lot of weight in society). But you voiced it better than I had! Additionally, maybe introduce in relations of social context into this topic

&#x200B;

Edit: I thought more about your comment, perhaps there holds an even stronger meaning behind it. Although, I  argue it might allow some racist actions by white people to appear as a smaller issue since it would equate to that of POC, so it would be more difficult to tackle racial issues
u/storme17 you could use some wisdom from this comment.

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pswbsz/asuc_senator_gabbi_sharp_is_a_racist/hdvyqzi/
No worries! I felt that it was almost necessary to speak up since I do believe many students who are active in this sub are passionate about anti-racism. Especially seeing the active engagement at trying to counter racism on campus, I thought it was suitable to bring up some useful ideas as well

Edit: Y'all chill. I am not defending Gabbi's actions, but rather trying to get some ideas in.
Or just don’t write a book
race-based bigotry ≠ racism

The experience of a White person being called a nasty name because of their skin color is not the same as a Black person. Pretending they are the same thing just means you're not seeing the broader context.

That is all.
we’re at one of the most liberal schools, ofc ppl are gonna use the twitter leftist more liberal definition
It's not at all fringe.

There's a difference between personal bigotry, and an entire society organized against a specific race.

I'm a 50+ white man, and it's unpleasant when someone is an asshole towards me because of my appearance, but I don't fear for my life or career because of it. And it's not all-pervasive, it's not something that follows me through life, and colors every interaction. I can walk away.

It's just not the same, and we shouldn't pretend it is.

Bigotry is the term you're looking for. Calling it racism invites comparisons, and I guarantee that your experience is nothing like hers, regardless of how obnoxious she is.
Wow, that's mature. Got your knickers is a twist?
The account you use exclusively for posting on this sub isn’t a burner. Sure thing bud.
She is absolutely fucking not progressive - to be progressive she'd have to not be a racist.
> I mean, he's an uninvolved, terminally online non-student

Wrong. I'm a student and therefore a constituent of Ms. Gabbi Sharp. She represents students and votes on proposals that affect all students. So, I'm involved as a voting constituent who is free to speak on my representatives and their conduct. 

> Orchestrating an online campaign to oust a young

It is within the rights of the student body to initiate a recall if they feel their representatives are poor in character, conduct, and unfit for office.

> young progressive black LGBTQ woman elected representative

Way to skip over the unapologetically racist, bigoted and hateful part of her personality.

> tweets that contain no slurs, no credible threats, no doxing or calls for online harassment.

Tweets that are hateful, prejudiced, racist, insulting, hurtful and reprehensive.

> She's since locked her Twitter, because (unlike Gabbi)

She's free to lock her twitter but it doesn't matter at this point. Her racism has been exposed.
 
> directed online action (which, for black lgbtq women inevitably includes harassment) against a specific, in real life person.

The only ""action"" I've encouraged is for a recall to be initiated. That's perfectly valid and not harassment. You are incredibly dumb if you think that constitutes harassment. Calling a public figure on campus out for poor behavior is not harassment. Because someone is LGBTQ Black Woman doesn't shield them from consequences of their actions. Restating her sexual orientation and skin color isn't a panacea for shitty behavior.
By this logic, Trump isn’t racist, he’s just a progressive white male representative, defending his people. Perhaps now it’s ok to make racist comments?
It's an excellent point, thank you for calling it to my attention.
Damn dawg it took like 5 mins to read. Just move on if you're too lazy.
Dismantle racism in a few sentences ☠️☠️

I get it tho, it is a bit too long. I’ll try shortening it up. Comment if you’re down
no disagreement with any of that, but again, she did not \*only\* target white people. she also went after other POC and mixed race people, and you'd be dishonest to leave that out of your assessment of this situation.
Yeah, well I’m going to keep calling it racism buddy. That’s what it is. Keep your fringe definition. And I’ll do me over here.
Knickers? You’re sounding like quite the bigot
A burner is a new account that you use once for a single purpose and then dispose of. Whether it’s a burner doesn’t change the veracity of what I said or refute my points. That’s not an argument. Try coming up with something of substance instead of making a dull observation. 

Let’s hypothetically grant you that point though; it’s a burner. So what? And? Does that refute anything I’ve said? Nope.

The entire concept of burners on Reddit is pretty dumb though, considering that the entire website is anonymous. All screennames are pretty much anonymous. All users are anonymous unless they go out of their way to ID themselves, so posting it on this account or another wouldn’t make a difference. We’re all using “burner” accounts given that nobody knows who we are.
I mean, would you not consider something like the Black Panther movement progressive?
>free to initiate a recall

I mean, sure. Generally you don't start anonymous threads on an Unofficial reddit though lol.

>racist bigoted parts of her personality

I mean, I'm white and I struggle to see the issue with these tweets.

She tells white people to check privilege several times; white privilege is a pretty well understood concept at this point. Same with colorism and same with the tensions between otherwise intersecting white and POC feminism/LGBTQ advocacy.

She definitely isn't milquetoast, i definitely understand it can be off-putting when you aren't used to it. Lots of people feel similarly about, say, AOC or Rashida Jones.

You're getting a lot of positive reinforcement from this (extremely unrepresentative) community though, I imagine you'll try to follow through. Good luck, I'm sure it'll be a good learning experience if nothing else. 

Maybe you'll end up involved as an RA, EDI intern, retention intern, on the people's park committee, a Queer alliance community coordinator, a transfer coordinator, a BSU finance and leadership development intern, and planned parenthood coordinator. Just like, you know, Gabbi.
>by this logic

Im sorry, I'm not following you. Progressive means moving away from the historical and present status quo; in this case I think that is white/male political, social, cultural, and economic dominance. Do you think you example applies?
How are people this stupid omgggg dude did u think for like one second before posting? Just one second of critical thinking, it’s not that hard I believe in u bestie.
>oppression against black people, meanwhile, a black person could say slang against a white person. There is not as much weight behind it. Of course, this is just exchanging insults, there is no reason to 

I think you might have copied your second paragraph twice, and that could definitely shorten things! (Although maybe I missed how they're difference). 

&#x200B;

I appreciate your comment and folks saying it's not worth reading if its long is concerning, because it makes me ask if  they have spent time reading about racism (especially in the USA) or even think that's a worthy pursuit. I don't know if I have an opinion on this senator, I have no stake in the ASUC, but I also don't like how this looks that a lot of folks on reddit want to prosecute a black queer person. But I haven't really looked at all the tweets.
She's clearly a bigot, and I think, and asshole.

But her experience of bigotry, and the experience of Black people generally, is nothing like ours - that's the part that needs to kept in mind.

Using the same word to describe what she's doing, and what you experience because of it, to what Black people experience is just not accurate.

Race-based bigotry that White people experience is a different thing from what Black people experience - you can see that, I hope?
Edumacate yourself then.

No, we aren’t all using burner accounts. Most use the same account over a wide variety of subs so you actually know who you’re talking to. In the case of someone orchestrating a campaign to attack a politician the person behind the campaign is absolutely relevant. 

To be perfectly frank I suspect that if I could see your real post history there’d be far worse than what’s in these tweets. Over and over again we find out that attacks like these were carried out by people who are in no way offended or threatened but are merely upset that *they* aren’t allowed to say the rascist things they’d like to in public.
So moving the age of consent to 10 would be progressive? Because it’s away from the status quo? Or perhaps slavery but only for white people? I mean that would be ‘moving away from the historical and present status quo’ right? So on what grounds would it *not* be progressive?
Why would it matter if the experience is different if we’re simply describing the action.
Alright bud. Well you take care now.
how you graduate eecs with this logic damn
So this is real real old; are you looking through my history or something?

But I'll answer anyway: what you just mentioned (age of consent etc) is actually a historical status quo, especially for women and girls but also for men and boys. It continues to be an issue in particularly conservative (literal meaning of the word) communities. The age of consent is a phenomena of modern age: the age of consent in Delaware was 7 years old (?!?!?!?) until 1895 for instance, 30 years after the Civil war, 100 years after the French revolution. This change was largely driven by early feminists like Josephine Butler.

We have since *progressed*. What you're talking about is actually REGRESSIVE. Good try though?

Same goes for slavery of white people: white slaves were called serfs and their status and treatment led to several revolutions (including the Russian revolution and the rise of communism to the world stage).
The logic that the vast majority of end users are too brave dumb or lazy to juggle multiple logins? That comes from working in industry.

I heard on KCBS today that Berkeley police were arresting people who were wearing facemasks today around campus. 

What happens when people wear Burkas/Niqabs next? This is done in Europe by ""far-right"" groups to mock ""far-left"" groups. 

can you be arrested for that? or will the far-left institute their own ""muslim test"" to see if you are allowed to wear, do, go as you please?

I was surprised that AntiFa didn't show up. I watched some livestreams and saw lots of police and right wing groups ready for a fight, lots of helmets, shields gloves ect. They had planned to come, saw lots of AntiFa social media planing to disrupt/attack but AntiFa was a no show. Maybe they thought it wasn't such a good idea with so many ready to counter? 
The Guy Fieri memes?
Reports were UCPD were arresting those who failed to provide UC affiliation ID on UC grounds and wore a mask (logical AND).
there is no way BPD arrests a hijabi under any sort of masking law.  that would just be a lawsuit waiting to happen, and not a troll one like BCR's.
BAMN did show up though. And one alt-righter was arrested for carrying a concealed dagger and another was arrested for inciting violence. The police also confiscated tons of weapons and made people remove face masks, so maybe Antifa did show up. I think the only explanation is that the police did a great job keeping the peace.

So, if the Church of the Flying Spaghetti monster were to proclaim that masks should be worn when engaged in nefarious acts, would that be a lawsuit waiting to happen?

Why does a superstitious belief in something false give rise to rights that trump secular rights?  

Edit: I hope my question makes sense.  Writing very quickly.  I see I should have structured it better.  Sorry but in a rush. Real question but I have to scoot.

Wow Guy Fieri is going way too far these days. 
You can arrest a hijabi for performing a crime.  Wearing a hijab while performing a crime is not *itself* a crime, because hijabis are allowed to wear hijabs.

Nowhere in this process are ""secular rights"" being trumped by ""superstitious belief"", but don't let that get in the way of your atheistic euphoria.

"Daily Cal: Are multicultural clubs ""voluntary"" racial segregation? (x-post from r/politics)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/liic2/daily_cal_are_multicultural_clubs_voluntary/,2011-10-20 01:08:09,"http://www.dailycal.org/2011/10/17/a-new-face-for-segregation/

I originally posted this in r/politics, but I was wondering what you guys thought about this article. Casey Given wrote a column in the Daily Cal about multicultural clubs and how they were causing the students to voluntarily segregate under labels instead of seeking to integrate into the general population.

>If Dr. King were to walk onto UC Berkeley now, would he be satisfied with the social state of our campus? Passing by the plethora of multicultural clubs that pervade Sproul Plaza, would he be happy to see that the segregation he so ardently fought against is now taking place voluntarily? Would he be pleased that instead of truly integrating ourselves as a student body, we have chosen to be categorized and divided along the lines of race, religion and sexuality?

>Our campus is obsessed with labels. A walk down Sproul shows an abundance of cultural clubs that seek to celebrate — or rather, segregate — particular identity groups.


* 
Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ligya/are_multicultural_clubs_voluntary_racial/","People aren't segregating because there are clubs, there are clubs because people naturally segregate themselves, either by culture, by primary language, by ethnicity, etc. You don't change the fact that people are voluntarily segregating by taking away the product of a deeper problem. All that does is isolate people who don't feel like they belong in, or aren't accepted into, the dominant (read: upper middle class white) classification of student who attends Cal. It's hard to become close friends with your dorm mates when you speak in an accent that makes it difficult for them to understand you. It's hard to feel like you belong in a group when you function as a token minority within that group. The simple fact is that people interact with you differently based on your ethnicity, or your dominant language, or what country you're from, and taking away the one resource (not only racial) minorities have for overcoming alienation amidst a sea of people who don't relate to them, and who they don't relate to, is not a solution to this problem.
As someone who appreciates cultural diversity and would like to get a chance to interact with more people who are come from backgrounds different from my own, I find ethnic and racial clubs to be a disappointing but understandable phenomenon.  It's certainly easier to interact with people who share your culture.  But as intelligent and responsible individuals, I feel that we should be trying to fight the tendency to simply do what is easy when instead we could be striving to do what is best.
I feel occurrences such as these clubs are a reflection of a trend toward what I call positive racial segregation. 

It's still racial segregation, but it's for a ""good"" purpose (as opposed to the Jim Crow South), such as celebrating and increasing community-wide awareness of a minority culture that would otherwise be absorbed in the melting pot-American consciousness, or in the case of affirmative action, supposedly giving underrepresented minority groups a leg-up to make up for historical injustices. Positive racial segregation. 

My opinion on this sort of racial segregation is rather conflicted. On one hand, I do believe that it's beneficial for these multicultural awareness clubs to be around, as variety is the spice of life where the alternative is a race-blind community in which everyone is simply ""American"" or any other large umbrella label. However, a downside of having these clubs is that many minorities who grew up around their own group will tend to stick to their comfort zone and associate exclusively or almost-exclusively with people of their race or ethnicity, and these clubs are an easy way for people to fall into that trap of comfortable familiarity. 

On the other hand, I personally believe that programs such as affirmative action tend to screw over individuals in the short term for the purposes of smoothing out imbalances in racial justice for the collective community over the long term. The example I used when we discussed affirmative action in the bake sale thread was if an African-American student and an Asian student were up for consideration for admission to Cal and hypothetically were exactly identical in every way (impossible in actuality I know), would the African-American student be offered the acceptance over the Asian student simply by merit of African-Americans being ""historically underrepresented"" in higher education? 

One might argue that sacrifices like this are necessary if centuries of racial injustice are to be broken down and for balance to be achieved. But what about that Asian student who got screwed out of a spot because he wasn't ""lucky"" (I use this term a bit ironically) enough to be born as a historically underrepresented minority group even though as an Asian student he had to go through everything minority students go through anyways? (Note: I myself am the child of Chinese immigrant parents who came here in their early 20s and busted their asses to get the family to where we are today, so it may be relevant to take into account my admittedly heavy bias)

To return to the question, I feel that positive racial segregation that is only for the purposes of cultural and educational enrichment is perfectly acceptable, as seen in the form of multicultural clubs etc.

However, I feel that institutional positive racial segregation is where things get dicey, as it is a world of limited resources and so in order for one group to be artificially benefitted, another group must artificially lose out. 

/rant
Ask yourself this, what would happen if a white guy like myself were to start a cultural club celebrating our culture? If one group gets angry at another celebrating their culture, there is still more work to be done.
Do people really view the dominant classification here as upper middle class white? I'm honestly curious, because that isn't how I see it but maybe I'm naive.
It actually used to be against the student code to have ethnically or religiously oriented groups.  Racism and discrimination are still those things even when applied for ""good"" purposes.  I find it extremely disheartening that when I walk down Sproul on any given day the clubs that I might even remotely consider myself qualified to associate with are the Ski and Snowboard club, Calpirg, Cal Dems / BCR, and a comedy group or two.  And I think people are doing themselves a disservice (not to mention completely defeating the purpose of havig a diverse campus) when they segregate themselves by culture or religion so thoroughly that they might insulate themselves from others.
Yes, people would be uncomfortable with a ""white"" club. But not with a Russian, Serbian, or Bulgarian cultural club, all of which we already have, and all of which contain primarily white students for obvious reasons. There really isn't a ""white"" culture to learn about and perpetuate, so why would we want to have a club for the purpose?
What would you be celebrating, slavery and imperialism? White culture, just like 'black culture' and 'Chicano culture', only exists in relation to another racial group. The cultural narrative that defines a 'black culture' is, unfortunately, the discrimination it has faced at the hands of institutions controlled by white people. The narrative defining a white culture would appear to be the converse of this, because a 'race' culture can only exist in relation to other races, and whites have in recent history been (alas) the race that oppresses the other races.

Black culture, or Chicano culture, or any kind of 'minority movement', isn't just about celebrating the accomplishments of individuals who happen to be members of minority X. It's about celebrating their accomplishments in the wake of racial discrimination. George Washington Carver isn't as famous as he is because he invented peanut butter. He's famous because he was an ex - slave who achieved something great in spite of being born into the oppressed 'black' caste. The narrative of white oppressor who controls institutions versus black oppressee who is a victim of those institutions still holds.

Contrast this with the story of a famous white revolutionary, Thomas Jefferson. The institution that Jefferson was resisting didn't involve race, it involved the British Empire. Jefferson's narrative of resistance has nothing to do with being white. He doesn't function as a symbol for a white culture in this respect because there is nothing putting his struggle in relation to another race. In fact, the only narratives placing his 'white' racial group in relation to minority racial groups tend to be discriminatory on the side of whites (slavery, etc.), and therefore unflattering.

Edit: Celebrating white culture is perceived as racist because when you celebrate white culture you're celebrating institutions that have been dominated by white people, not individual white people. Similarly, celebrating 'black culture' celebrates black society in relation to those institutions. White institutions have in recent history been the ones oppressing minorities.
So what would a white cultural club do?
Wow, no, it turns out my assumptions were faulty. I checked out the statistics, and apparently, 66% of the people who go here are on financial aid, and 40% are asian (as opposed to 30% white). Very interesting...

I think that the point I'm making still stands though. You can still feel alienated from a group of people who are your same 'color', especially considering that contemporary East Asian cultures tend to be a lot more xenophobic than contemporary Western European cultures (which might help explain the proliferation of East Asian clubs). I also still think it's true that race plays a factor in determining how people treat one another. Whites not being a majority doesn't defeat the argument that race clubs are a product of self - segregation, not a cause of self - segregation, and getting rid of a consequence for why people self - segregate is not an effective means of dealing with that problem.
This is so completely false. I must disagree. There are many white Americans that have lived in America for generations that have, more or less, lost any connection they had to Europe and any European cultures or customs their ancestors may have practiced. In America today there is definitely a white culture. Some people call it ""American"" culture, because white Americans are in the majority in this country, but if you look at the habits, social customs, food, dress, etc. of a typical ""white"" family and a typical Mexican-American family, for instance, they will vastly differ. So whether or not you accept this fact, there is a white culture in America.
Because everyone else has a club, and I don't. Knowing that people feel so much animosity towards ""white"" is a bit of a bummer. 
You just made a list of all the work that has to be done and proved my point.

thanks.
No idea, drink mountain dew and play xbox? Maybe do the chicken dance?

I am not proposing a white people club, I am proposing that the existance of one would create unrest.
Agreed. And you're right, that didn't change your argument much, I was just surprised and curious about that assumption.
I actually believe that economic status plays much less of a role than skin color itself.  The reason is that most of what drives college social dynamics is sexual interactions.  The driving factors for social status on campus revolve around perceived 'attractiveness', which for various reasons (another whole discussion) favors whites (I doubt anyone will disagree).
The control communities for this argument are professional and academic organizations, where status is driven by perceived 'success'.  Here, if you observe, race plays almost no role in status.
I recognize that your comment doesn't officially take a side in whether the white oppressor trope is true or not, but you have to recognize that by pitting yourself as a victim ('white person such as myself'), characterizing white culture as something other groups are pitted against (one group gets angry at another group for celebrating 'our culture'), and by posting it on a website where the 'whites as oppressed group' argument is actually taken seriously, its very easy to pigeonhole you as someone who thinks that there is nothing racist about a 'white rights' group.
It might, it might not.  I think its contingent on the specifics of the club itself, since a club that labels itself as ""X-ethnicity club"" is generally vague and non-descriptive.  For example, the Asian American Association is more just a bunch of college Asian kids throwing social events--the ""Asian"" aspect seems secondary.  On the other hand, the South-east Asian Student Coalition is specifically geared toward aiding disenfranchised south-east asian minority groups in California toward higher education.  Two vague-sounding clubs, two very different goals.  

I would imagine a white club akin to AAA would be met with confusion and ridicule, rather than unrest--people would see that niche as already being filled by the fraternities and sororities.  On the other hand, a ""white club"" to aid disenfranchised whites would be a commendable club, and in good spirit with the leftist bent of Berkeley.   
Everybody assumes that. Totally boggles the minds of the upper middle class whites attending this university. Especially when we're somehow assumed to be dominant oppressors or something.
The example is that if anyone one group tries to have a cultural club and it is seen as offensive, there is still more work to be done to overcome racial issues.

I never meant to say I was a victim, and I have not perpetuated atrocity and I question my own motivations. I also live with ""white guilt"" but the fact of the matter is that when any one group cannot have a cultural celebration without the question being posed ""is this racist"" society has further to go.
Why do current white people have to be held constantly to the sins of our past? It's not my fault there was slavery. It's also not my fault that there was imperialism. Why must I be viewed in the light of an oppressor, even though I never have and never will oppress anyone? Sort of unfair isn't it? We don't hold current Germans responsible for the Holocaust yet we seem to subconsciously (or consciously) hold white people to slavery and imperialism. Not cool.
I totally agree.
>Why do current white people have to be held constantly to the sins of our past?

You're not. The point I'm making has nothing to do with any individual white people, or even the attitudes of the contemporary 'white people community'. It has to do with what history a white pride group would be celebrating. For example, Albert Einstein was white. But I wouldn't instantly define his success as an 'accomplishment for the white race', I would define it as a victory for science, or for America if we're talking about his contributions to the nuclear bomb. If I look at Thomas Jefferson, I don't admire him as a white man, I admire him as a Founding Father, and view him as an American first and foremost. His accomplishments were American accomplishments, not white accomplishments.

Contrast these examples with WEB Dubois. Yes, it is certainly true that Dubois was a great American. But part of what's admirable about him is that he was a successful *black* American. The fact that he was able to overcome so many obstacles placed in front of him by an oppressive system that was controlled by a group of people who discriminated against him is what makes his *blackness* relevant to his importance as a historical figure. The only reason we're celebrating his blackness in the first place is that his black culture is defined in opposition to an oppressive and yes definitely white-controlled set of institutions.

My point has absolutely *nothing* to do with whether or not we should hold white people accountable for anything pertaining to race. What I'm dealing with is the idea that by celebrating 'white pride', you are celebrating a culture that is defined historically by its oppression of minorities. The only reason we celebrate 'black pride' is that we recognize hardships this demographic had to pass through in opposition to white groups; the accomplishments of famous black people are in part black accomplishments, because there was something for black people to accomplish, to improve the standing of their 'group' in the social hierarchy. The same does not hold true in the case of 'white pride'."
