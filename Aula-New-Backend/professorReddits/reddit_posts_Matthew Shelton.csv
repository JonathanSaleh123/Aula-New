I saw this, did you see this before? I'm a bit concerned and not sure if I should drop it in favor of fulfilling an AC requirement.
My bad, just checked and I have Zachary Johnson , not Matthew Shelton
Hey, I was thinking of taking celtic r1b with Zachary Johnson next semester, how is the class?
How was the class?
Did you end up taking it?
