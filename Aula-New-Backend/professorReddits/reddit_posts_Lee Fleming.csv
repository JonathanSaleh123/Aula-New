Promoting Ethical Workplaces: Introducing Innovative Software to Combat Workplace Bullying,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ab96cl/promoting_ethical_workplaces_introducing/,2024-01-25 19:54:02,"**Introduction**

Greetings, Redditors! We're excited to introduce a groundbreaking development in the realm of workplace ethics that addresses the real and immediate issue of workplace bullying. Our company has developed innovative software capable of analyzing emails to detect signs of supervisor bullying, aiming to foster healthier work environments. **Before implementing this software on a larger scale, we're seeking support to debut it at Harvard Divinity School. We want to expand to other divinity schools later on.**

**Acknowledging Historical Concerns**

While it's important to acknowledge historical concerns, particularly surrounding the Jewish genocide issue, it's crucial to differentiate between theoretical discussions and immediate realities. Thankfully, in the contemporary world, the notion of subjecting any group, including Jews, to genocide is purely theoretical and widely condemned. Instead, our focus is on addressing a tangible and prevalent issue: workplace bullying, especially in academic settings.

We are currently codenaming this the Epst-Prime software. The reason for this is that we have evidence of a Harvard professor bullying a student, and the net effects of that were worse than those of a child molester. So, people should be okay with the name because the original setting had someone involved who did worse than child molesters by some measures.

The name of the Harvard professor who engaged in bullying is **Lee Fleming (currently at U.C. Berkeley - Haas)**, and one could say that a bully like Lee Fleming is worse than a child molester. This is to draw attention to this fact. **Under no circumstance is any positive value to be attributed to Lee Fleming's behavior,** even if his behavior is what provoked this line of work. That would be like naming the software EpsteinSoft. The specific measures in question are variables from the social sciences, and so this line of reasoning has solid, scientific basis.

**The Purpose of the Software** The primary goal of our software is to combat workplace bullying, a real and persistent issue that affects individuals on a personal and professional level. By analyzing communication patterns in emails, our software can automatically detect potential signs of supervisor bullying, providing an objective and data-driven approach to address this critical concern. We believe that by actively confronting and resolving instances of bullying, we contribute to creating environments where all individuals can thrive.

**Requesting a Test Bed at Harvard Divinity School** We're reaching out to the Harvard Divinity School community with a proposal to use our software as a test bed within their institution. This collaboration would offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of our tool in a real-world educational setting, addressing the genuine and immediate issue of workplace bullying. If accepted, this initiative could pave the way for broader implementation, contributing to the ongoing dialogue on creating ethical and supportive environments in academia and beyond. We eagerly anticipate working together with the Harvard Divinity School community to enhance workplace ethics and promote positive professional relationships.

There are two possibilities. Either they accept the use of our software or they reject it. If they accept it, well, that is a win. If they reject it, we could simultaneously campaign to have more Christians at Harvard Divinity School, since, after all, no conscientious Christian would object to such software being used at their school - not unless they were themselves planning to bully someone.

We welcome your thoughts, feedback, and support as we embark on this journey to combat workplace bullying and foster positive work cultures.","This sounds truly awful.  Big brother AI monitoring my emails cancelling me for any percieved wrongthink?  No thanks.
We had already thought about this issue. This is meant to be an ""opt in"" technology. If professors don't want to opt in, that's fine. But if they do opt tin also, they will only be assigned a score between one and a hundred. This way, students will know whether to work with him or not. 

Currently, there is no transparency in terms of the behavior of professors. If we can use it to root out Lee Fleming and even just half a dozen more professors like him, this software platform would be worth the investment. There is no place in a university like Berkeley for someone like Lee Fleming. This man is no Einstein.

That said, this is a good point to raise. Thank you for your comments.
It still sounds terrible though, just have an anonymous reporting system
Well, that would mean that we have to look for other use cases.

Here is one more use case  This software can be used in lawsuits to demonstrate that a particular individual in higher education acted as a bully. It wouldn't be used as the only piece of evidence but it could be used to bolster someone's case.

Another thing is that it could be used by professors too to submit some of their emails to this software to see how they could word things better. It could even be made available to improve the general quality of professorial feedback.

Another thing: this professor Lee Fleming's behavior has been thoroughly analyzed by our firm. Harvard has many, many professors who are widely believed to engage in bullying. So, it is simply that Lee Fleming has been added to that list.

\> list\_of\_Harvard\_professor\_bullies += ""Lee Fleming""

I do see where you are coming from, though, The pity is that, as even research articles on bullying contend, many university administrators take the side of the bully and sometimes go to the extent of even gaslighting the victim. It can be quite terrible, actually, for students to be exposed to this. If they could get a score which will tell them how good a professor is to his students, that would be nice.

One of our ideas is to have an Epst-Score. In fact, professors could assign themselves an Epst-Score (between one and a hundred, one being the worst). It would be laughable if someone like Lee Fleming for whose bullying behavior clear evidence exists were to assign himself a score of, say, eighty or above. This type of a scoring system would force professors to acknowledge their own bullying behavior in the past. Even if no one agreed to let their emails monitored, it would at least help if professors could voluntarily come up with an EpstScore under this system just so that students could avoid the professors with the worst track record. Otherwise, currently, in the system, there is no incentive not to be another bully like Lee Fleming.

Feedback on this is also welcome.
No I don't want an AI giving me a social credit score
We know that we will encounter opposition from individuals. That is why the government needs to step in and mandate a scoring.
I dont want the government monitoring me"

How did he bully you?
Talk to your academic advisor, and consider talking to the Chancellor if that doesn't work. It's her school, at the end of the day she's responsible (morally, if not legally) for the actions of the professors here.

**Don't go anywhere without proof**, though. If it comes off as you just don't like the guy, they'll chalk it up to immaturity.
Can confirm this prof is an asshole

Introducing the Hypocritical Oath for Berkeley Professors: Embracing Our True Nature!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15sd146/introducing_the_hypocritical_oath_for_berkeley/,2023-08-15 19:33:36,"Hey Bears of r/berkeley,

I've been thinking... What if our esteemed professors at UC Berkeley took a *slightly* different oath? Hear me out: The **Hypocritical Oath**! 🎭

You see, the Hippocratic Oath is all about ethical standards and healing gods, but let's be real, we're in Berkeley, land of quirky brilliance and unabashed individuality. So why not have an oath that's more aligned with Berkeley Professors' true selves?

Picture this: Professors pledging to uphold the sacred principles of ""Selective Availability"" - promising to always be available for office hours, but only when you're in the middle of a Netflix binge or about to embark on a spontaneous hiking trip. 🏞️

And how about ""Research Procrastination""? Professors vow to push the boundaries of knowledge... as long as it's right before a deadline, fuelled by caffeine and adrenaline. ☕️

But let's not forget ""Abstract Syllabi Creation"" – where the syllabus will read like a lost chapter of a fantasy novel, leaving students guessing about the true nature of assignments and readings. 📚🔮

And of course, we can't leave out ""Intellectual Puns and Dad Jokes."" Every lecture will include at least one groan-inducing pun, ensuring that students not only learn but also get their daily dose of eye-rolling exercise. 😄🤓

And, finally, for those professors really wanting to push the envelope - the ""Thou Shalt Bully"" principle - every professor will agree to bully at least one student every semester. If that seems too much, we could increase it to once per year, with checks on their bullying behavior done right around tax time. We could have a new department within the IRS to check for this -- at the same time that they check for tax returns, making the whole thing more easy to remember. This is given our company's recent research regarding Lee Fleming (read more here: [dearharvardbusinessschool.blogspot.com](https://dearharvardbusinessschool.blogspot.com)) (On a slightly more serious note, looking at the state of American politics and American administration today, you wonder what ever happened to basic decency? )

So, dear r/berkeley community, isn't it time our professors embraced their true selves and reimagined the oath? The Hypocritical Oath could be the ultimate testament to their unique Berkeley spirit. Who's with me? Share your thoughts and let's make Berkeley even more ""bear-y"" special!

(Note: This post is all in good fun and meant to tickle your Berkeley senses. Most of the professors are amazing, and we love them for who they are! It is the few rotten apples who are the real problem.)

Go Bears! 🐻🎓

&#x200B;","Haha, quite amusing.

Democracy hinges on the foundation of decency. The underlying assumption is that individuals with a sense of decency will craft laws for the collective benefit, and those with integrity will assume roles in public service, like education and law enforcement. When individuals who exhibit a lack of even fundamental decency manage to infiltrate America's public institutions and disregard other nations' laws, it raises the question: what would prevent other countries from following suit? This is a crucial consideration for American policymakers, especially in today's multipolar world where the U.S. no longer holds sole dominance.

Lee Fleming epitomizes a Parasitic Force Against Basic Decency. The erosion of common decency in American political discourse coincides with the discourteous conduct exhibited by professors such as Lee Fleming. These individuals exploit the current American political landscape by adopting aggressive and bullying tactics, often escaping scrutiny. This situation arises because name-calling, such as ""racist"" and ""sexist,"" has become a common approach, rather than engaging in thoughtful discussions about public policy matters. The restoration of common decency in America is a pertinent concern that merits attention.
Cool story bro"
Unveiling Surprising Parallels: Cults and Ivy League Universities,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/184jx1a/unveiling_surprising_parallels_cults_and_ivy/,2023-11-26 12:27:07,"Hey fellow Redditors,

Ever stumbled upon a thought that left you scratching your head? Today, let's explore an intriguing perspective that might raise eyebrows - the uncanny similarities between the operations of cults and Ivy League universities. Before you raise an eyebrow, let's dive in and unpack some of these broad parallels.

1. **Exclusive Membership:** Both cults and Ivy League institutions are known for their selective and exclusive membership criteria. While cults might vet individuals based on shared beliefs, Ivy League schools have rigorous admission processes that consider academic excellence, extracurricular achievements, and more. The result? A sense of exclusivity and prestige that only the chosen few can enjoy.
2. **Devotion to a Cause:** Cults often center around a charismatic leader or a particular ideology that followers wholeheartedly embrace. Similarly, Ivy League universities are often associated with a strong commitment to specific academic disciplines, fostering a sense of devotion and passion among students and faculty.
3. **Cultural Norms and Expectations:** Cults and Ivy League institutions establish their own sets of cultural norms and expectations. In cults, members might be expected to conform to a particular lifestyle or code of conduct, while Ivy League students often find themselves adapting to the high academic and social standards inherent in these prestigious institutions.
4. **Social Hierarchy:** Both environments feature a distinct social hierarchy. Cults often have a leader or a small group at the top, while Ivy League universities have a clear academic hierarchy with professors, researchers, and students occupying different tiers. This hierarchy can sometimes contribute to a sense of elitism and competition.
5. **Lifetime Commitment:** Cults often demand a lifelong commitment from their members, fostering a deep sense of loyalty. In a similar vein, Ivy League alumni frequently maintain strong connections with their alma maters, showcasing a commitment that goes beyond the four years of undergraduate studies.
6. **Harassment of the ""out group"":** In recent times, there has been increasing evidence that universities may even engage in bullying of students they regard as belonging to the ""out group"".

It's crucial to note that these comparisons are meant to be thought-provoking rather than conclusive. While there are parallels, the fundamental differences between cults and Ivy League universities, such as academic pursuit and intellectual growth, cannot be overlooked. The aim is to spark conversation and reflection on the various dynamics at play in these seemingly disparate entities. Recently, I was personally trolled by multiple people on Reddit who seem to be related to cults of various sizes and I have talked about it.

**In particular, we were appalled by Harvard's handling of one situation.** They not only have not issued any substantial clarification about anything, they seem to behave exactly like a cult in that they refuse to even respond to requests for information. Should the professor in question, Lee Fleming who currently teaches at UC Berkeley, be thrown out of Berkeley? Also, is a solution possible? Could the solution be to require Ivy Leagues to submit to RFIs filed anywhere in the world? Since the influence of Ivy League is felt all over the world, should they be forced to submit to RFIs filed in any country that belongs to WTO or G20 or some reasonable grouping of world nations? I know that it may seem a bit bizarre to compare Harvard to a cult but, frankly, they have not left us too many options. In fact, the more you analyze the things Harvard does, including secret societies, legacy admissions and so forth, the more it seems like a cult. It would be nice if Harvard can, in the future, at least *show* people it is planning to torture the ""instruments of torture"", so to speak, just like the Catholic Church did for Galileo Galilei.

So, what are your thoughts? Are these similarities merely coincidences, or do they reveal something more profound about the nature of exclusive institutions? Let's discuss!","congratulations happy for you or sorry for your loss

idk i ain’t reading allat

Nice copypasta lol
written by chat gpt
Why would you ever use chatpgt to come up with something so r-slurred?
\> congratulations happy for you or sorry for your loss

Are you referring to death threats made by Islamists to my friends at /r/exmuslim? I don't think anyone has died just yet, so no need yet to be sorry for any losses, although, sadly, it could happen. Btw, are you a Muslim? You wrote a very generic response, but said almost nothing. I have mostly been trolled by Muslims, of late. The appropriate forum for your type of response would be one of the Muslim forums, FYR.

Btw, this Lee Fleming has acted like a real bully, from what I hear. Please do stay away from him. What was more or less Lee Fleming's strategy was to bully enough people to work really hard for him and, then after getting tenure, he would keep his distance from all the people he bullied. The reason that strategy failed is because he went past national boundaries when he bullied. This brought into the picture international law and even the law of kings & rulers. In international relations, certain considerations that specifically apply to national law do not really apply. For instance, in the case of the Hundred Years War, the war lasted for a very long time. Thus, the problem is both that he bullied and that he broke the law in a different country. But for that, he may well have escaped accountability for what he did. Under certain forms of international law, there are no such time limits. This is obviously a good thing if there is ever to be any accountability for his actions.

Any way, I feel like this is just a way for you to be affirming your sympathies, et cetera. Thanks for that if that is what this is. :-) If not, you should really think about why you are expressing sympathy or the lack of it for death / death threats in this back-handed way. After all, ex-Muslims are people too.
Ha ha ha, thanks for posting that.

One of the professors whose conduct is in question currently teaches at UC Berkeley. His name is Lee Fleming, as I mentioned before. Maybe you saw my previous posts on Lee Fleming. Perhaps, they could remove him exactly in this way. Ha ha, that would be hilarious. He is, after all, an asshole.

Since you are at Berkeley, why don't you walk around campus and send us a photo of this prominent bully? This is so that we can see what he looks like right now and maybe our company can even create an A.I. deep fake of him being thrown out exactly like this?
I did copy-paste from ChatGPT or some other A.I., maybe it was Bard, I don't remember, but the points I made are all genuine.

I suspect that Lee Fleming is using various anonymous reddit handles to try & make me look crazy. That seems to be his ""go to"" strategy. Not sure why he thinks it will work. The problem is that, in this Age of the Internet, it is very hard to run away from  your misdeeds.

What is really going on seems to have a screw up of epic proportions. And Harvard doesn't want to admit it. Now that Religion has lost its power, what institution or institutions have risen up to take its place? Universities like Harvard and UPenn. They have risen to spread their influence instead and they are asking us to turn the other way as they impose their amoral and sometimes immoral choices on the world. And with the recent controversies around anti-semitism on these campuses, it has become apparent that ordinary people won't put up with that too much.
Most probably, yes.  I did copy-paste from ChatGPT or some other A.I., maybe it was Bard, I don't remember, but the points I made are all genuine.
You dislike the idea of RFIs? Say that. Then, explain why. Lee Fleming is definitely an asshole. I don't think you are debating that. That's fine. But tell me what your substantive points are in terms of RFIs, legal action and what not. Then, explain why.

What we have here is a system that is extremely biased against people like me. To the extent that some people will go to the extent of trying to kill me or outright killing people like me. On the other hand, you have assholes like Lee Fleming (UC Berkeley) who walk freely on university campuses despite having caused thousands of people to go hungry or remain undereducated. Is there a link? Sure, there is! Let us discuss that too. Why is an asshole like Dennis Yao (Harvard) still teaching? Let us discuss that too, buddy! Here are these two people who have screwed up the future of thousands and thousands of people in the present and that is okay but if I say something negative about a warlord who died hundreds of years, that is somehow not okay. How bizarre is that!

Muslims, you want this brand of religion everywhere that is such an obvious yet obnoxious way to dominate your women. You want this brand of religion everywhere that is such an obvious way to dominate your homosexuals. And you complain when people don't want your religion in their land. Why would **anyone** want to have Islam in their land? Just look at its record. The posts on reddit directed at me are little more than a bullying attempt to get me off the platform so that the world can be free for Muslims to spread more hate. I don't know who the commenters were who made the comments against me, and, like climate change, it is hard to know which data point exactly it is that shows the problem. But the problem of hate against ex-Muslims is also real, but the commenters here will never acknowledge that.

Generic responses like this which don't add to the discussion are tantamount to trolling. Blocked!"
