Math 113 with Ryba,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kq1fqf/math_113_with_ryba/,2021-01-03 20:43:30,"Did anyone take Math 113 with Christopher Ryba in the fall?  If so, how is he as a professor?  BerkeleyTime hasn't yet updated with Fall 2020 distributions.","I thought it was great, personally. His lectures are pretty clear and he clearly cares about students - at OH, he would go to great lengths to explain things in detail and also offer context, etc. The psets were awesome - very engaging and often going a bit beyond lecture, instead of just repeating things that were covered in lecture already. Exams were very fair. We also had to write a short paper, but that seemed to be pretty low-stakes (don't know exactly, we never got grades for that, it was just rolled into the final grade). 

I believe this was his first time teaching too, so the next time will likely be even better, in particular because he's extremely open to feedback (you can literally go tell him at OH/write it on your pset). 

Tldr; highly recommend
What was the workload like w/ Ryba?
Thanks so much!  That's super exciting, I got randomly placed into his class after Harrison's class was canceled, so I'm glad he's a good professor.  Do you have a copy of the syllabus/the name of the book?"
