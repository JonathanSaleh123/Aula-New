No, mankind cannot have nice things.

Why can’t the world have nice things? 😵‍💫
Mann whoever did this can suck their mums I swear. Loved hearing ppl play on this piano after a hard finals ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
shame
Least vandalized Berkeley public property
It's wild how there are always a few people out there who just want to destroy stuff for no reason. They make having a truly free society impossible.
Damn, that's frustrating
I'm over fucking People's Park. Somebody needs to get those people the help they deserve as human beings because right now students fear for their lives going back and forth to class. I grew up around Berkeley and People's Park is just not what it once was. It is full of violent people with mental health problems who need help!!! I hate that people are still clinging onto this old idea of a hippie park where peaceful protests would happen/people would gather. That shit doesn't happen anymore! Now people just get assaulted! Wake up fr get these people into treatment centers and build housing there. I'm SO over it.
Man. I liked hearing that when walking through Sproul.

Whoever did this is a genuine asshole.
Sad :(

Dang this is what Fox News always complain about us for
Pave People’s Park
☹️☹️☹️
Canadians leaving their mark!
That hand has an extra finger.
AH YES FINALLY A PIANO I CAN PLAY
chaos.
From counterculture to crackhead.
Sorry but this took some time to vandalise, what was security/UCPD doing? You also got to think that there was CCTV covering this and it is not as if UCPD had to go far....
Have that same cup
This has happened basically every year for the last 5 years. It always sucks. Freecycle and Trashnothing may have some pianos available if someone can transport one.  


Side note: Why are y'all making this a People's Park issue?
Kudos to those of you who actually think someone from peoples Park did this.
This is reality lol
Let’s be real here.  I love playing that piano at night or between classes, and last time I went to play it it looked good to go but was functionally useless, probably due to people playing it like a damn drum set.  A piano out in the public will lose a key here or there but it was already basically useless with whole octaves no longer functioning by finals week, while looking like maybe one or two keys would probably not work.  That it looks like this now is just a visualization of its already existing subsurface uselessness.  It’s ultimately good that this broken piano is visibly useless so the people who graciously take it upon themselves to install pianos on Sproul are more likely to know that it needs replacing.
So sad!! That piano has been there and enjoyed by all for several years. 😢😔
This is sad
At UCSB, by Sands Beach, someone put a piano. I played it several times, was so lovely. Within two weeks it’s keyboard looked like this. 

I figured it wouldn’t last long, being in the weather and all. But somebody just decided to destroy it.
what brand is it anyone?
A couple of the local meth heads got bored.
I hope so! 😢
Well, you can, just not there..
They’re likely mentally unwell. They need social services.
Same kids who ripped up erasers for no reason in class
they hate to hear it
Build us another basketball court and community garden open 24/7 to the public in the same neighborhood then. 🤷🏽‍♂️
We literally had a whole series of concerts these last year but pop off sis you know best. You know folks from the neighborhood use the park tho right?
Build housing on it
Pave peoples park!!
what does that have to do with the piano
so brave 👏
It’ll be back. We’re on like the 5th piano now. He gets destroyed every final season, TBH.
just not in the most educated and socially conscious city in the world
Which Reagan and the GOP took away over 40 years ago and no one has ever restored.
Y’all are like vegans. That’s all we hear from the vocal anti-park minority.
Ur delusional 😂
For what? Shooting up?
does it really need to be said? most of us are capable of putting 2 and 2 together lol.
Peoples Park activists brought the second piano to campus 🤷🏽‍♂️
Great example of the Paradox of Tolerance in action. We are so tolerant and socially conscious that we welcome people who are hopelessly antisocial and intolerant...and now we’re paying the price.
And humble too
You forgot to say that they revere the arts as well but that’s cool. I guess in a sense this lowly piano is art too and says something as well when your statement is taken into context.
How does lived experience make me delusional. Don’t you think the ones sucking UC’s Oski, brown nosing the blue and gold and not having actual experience are the delusional ones 😮‍💨
Dude your dorm mates probably snort adderall and your frats are assaulting people nonstop. Students are just as fucked up if not worse cause you know better and can do better but you just complain on Reddit. Like… get off the high horse already.
the piano has old paint on it mentioning peoples park so the implication is that it’s peoples parks fault that the piano is missing some keys?
I like that. In my own personal experience I’ve found that absolute tolerance has led to enabling and disastrous choices for some friends of mine who dropped me because I would draw a line for what I believed was their own personal well-being. I’m not sure where that line is in society and honestly I’m glad Berkeley exists as it does to show us whatever it is we want to take away from it. To me, no place is perfect of course, but some do certainly have issues that aren’t as prevalent in other areas. It’s always a give and take though and one has to find the place they enjoy in my book.
Thanks for the ad hominem. I'm actually a woman and don't live in the dorms. If students are just as bad as the people in People's Park, maybe you should try your luck staying there? If it's just as safe as a dorm? Let me know how it goes!
lol there's no point in arguing with someone so blatantly blind to the truth. I think we all know that there's a pretty high chance that whoever vandalized the piano was a mentally-ill and/or drug addicted individual that places like peoples park attract from all over.
What is your major so I can judge you.
What is your major so I can judge you.
Compassion is nice but too much turns into enablement
I’m literally always there. And the fact you think “shooting up” is anything except pain relief is shameful. Please if you don’t like it you shouldn’t be at Berkeley. You are suppose to have a good education to get in. That means BASIC understanding of social issues including drug addiction. Students like you are bad and lack empathy. Still makes you a frat bro cause you’re no different.
Usually it’s people who are angry about finals. Not everyone at People’s Park are ill. Folks from People’s Park always play on that piano hence the graffiti 🙄
how do we know that a mentally ill person who lives in peoples park vandalized the piano? what is this based off of? vibes? how do you know random hooligans didn’t do it?
You are totally delusional if you think the perpetrator was a UC Berkeley student"

Hey OP fuck you and fuck peoples park. Power to UC berkeley to pave that disgusting homeless encampment. Build that student housing for members of our society that are actually positively benefiting it in some way.
people's park ☕️
I think it’s funny how people think of the homeless in Berkeley as though they are Native Americans, and People’s Park is like “their land.” Even UCB feels morally obligated to build affordable housing units in place of People’s Park as some kind of weird parasocial reconciliation with the homeless who once lived there. I say, “fuck that,” just pave the fuckin park, make a bunch of regular-priced housing cuz they own the damn land and can do whatever the fuck they want with it. Then, do something that actually matters to bring down rent costs for all UCB students such that all housing becomes affordable, not just the small
subsection built over People’s Park.
They cleaned out all the homeless?
[deleted]
Maybe they will get to use tear gas now
A huge failure to all the students here.
That looks like Webcor's valuable construction equipment, just checked and the vagrants are still there.
Power to an extremist criminal tiny minority that cares more about being an “activist” than actually solving the homeless and housing crisis in Berkeley.
[deleted]
What was wrong with the telehandlers that they could not be driven?
Human beings are not trash.
Amazing
The park is a great green space with historical value but often times its not a park I would consider utilizing for anything that a park is generally used for. Its obvious the unhoused need a place to stay but the park is not the answer. I thought the construction was going to include low income apartments for individuals. Now they will go back to sleeping in their tents? What about the crime and other activity that is often associated with that park? I know at times its a great place to find drugs, that's not something I believe in protecting. The custodians at the UC cant even service the restrooms at the park due to safety concerns. If the park remains an open green area where typical park activates occur then I support it, but if it returns into another encampment for individuals who have often refused legitimate housing and/or services for addiction or mental health issues then I cant support that place. Guarantee we will get an advisory text stating some sort of crime was committed in or around that park shortly after it reopens and individuals occupy it again. I am not against them, I just know the trends.
SQUATTERS RIGHTS ARE STILL A THING.... THAT STILL APPLIES TO PEOPLES PARK. FUCK UC BERKELEY AND FUCK ALL YOU HATEFUL AND DISGUSTING STUDENTS ... YOU WERE QUICK TO HAND OUT TENTS... FREE METH PIPES AND NEEDLES WHICH U BOUGHT WITH CAL STUDENT AID...U HANDED OUT SHITTY VEGAN MEALS ...AND WATCHED THE HOMELESS SLOWLY DIE...U DESTROYED THE PARK AND KILLED WILDLIFE ON TOP OF TAKING PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES. FUCK YOU UC BERKELEY.... U ARE THE ULTIMATE ANTI CHRISTS. .. I HOPE U ENJOY LAUGHING AND SPITTING AT THE HOMELESS... HEARTLESS AND GODLESS DESPICABLE HUMAN BEINGS. FUCK YOU PEOPLE. YOU WERE NOT RAISED RIGHT.
How do you feel now lol
Cry never gonna happen haha
Not happening
I support human rights
You don’t even go here anymore go cry
You don’t even go here go cry
Not gonna happen us protestors here to fight back
That’s too early I would walk around midnight unharmed yall just a bunch of sussies
Thanks for supporting
Never gonna happen
I love it
Price will never be affordable
Nope they thriving there
Don’t keep your hopes up
Not happening lol
Students can go cry
The people will never leave
There’s nothing the city of Berkeley wants to do
Nah yall mad 🤣
They were completely destroyed by protestors
They are not
Yup so happy ucb removed their disgusting trash off the beautiful land
These people need to find a stable life first
You’re delusional bud, pave it on god
No you don’t. You care about being an “activist” instead of creating desperately needed housing.
Probably spent more time in Berkeley than you have in your whole life though lmao
And let me guess “us protestors” are the ones who also carry pepper sprays while walking by the park at 2am in the morning. Keep in mind UC Berkeley is a university, NOT a homeless encampment shelter service whatsoever. The “homeless encampment in disguised of a park” is owned by the UC and their job is to prioritize safety for the students by shutting that crime-infested place down.
nice so ur down to walk us all home, however i dont think the person who got assaulted via toilet seat last semester needs ur assistance first😍
Because you keep blocking any developments. Way to be a tool of the Berkeley oldsters that are actually deeply conservative
By thriving you mean trespassing private property (the park is owned by the UC regents SO NO IT IS NOT PUBLIC, so is the entire Berkeley campus fyi), infesting it with crime and needles, harassing students and making it a heaven for drug dealers?
you mean like permanent housing for 100 homeless people?

[https://peoplesparkhousing.berkeley.edu/supportive-housing](https://peoplesparkhousing.berkeley.edu/supportive-housing)

your protests have had a measurably negative impact on the lives of so many people and no positive impact except for your own sense of self.
By protestors you mean rioters and criminals. I hope you people get arrested and expelled from school.
[deleted]
Nobody except people who smoke crack would ever call this crime-infested homeless encampment beautiful lol
So your think it’s more stable for the homeless to live in tents rather than supportive housing?
Y’all delusional thinking it will be paved 🤣
Everyone needs activism
Nope uc doesnt care about the students, another year with the park’🎉
Not walking anyone home 🤣y’all old enough to walk home by yourself scaredy cats
There’s other places they can build on silly
Nope they are the residents of the park and deserve to be on that land
can someone explain this to me? i recently stumbled on this story, knowing nothing of california or UC Berkeley but i've been reading obsessively because i feel completely at a loss to understand whats going on here. The housing crisis in the California colleges was pretty shocking to me (everything I learned about california was shocking to me actually, really always thought people were exaggerating but man the state is a disaster!), and while I understand the initial concern about not wanting to proceed with development without securing a plan for what it'll mean for the people living there, once berkeley offered supportive housing, I really cannot possibly understand what the opposition is here. 

I understand that most of the people involved in the protests are students, but I used to work in social services in a city much bigger than berkeley, and not a day went by that I didn't meet with someone dreaming of a program just like this. There are so few programs that offer this kind of stability and support, that I'm curious if people don't really understand the gravity of what 100 spaces can really do. It's truly nothing to scoff at or dismiss and I understand it's not enough, but something like this will be changing lives for decades to come. Many of the programs like this we relied on were from the 70s and typically had 15-40 spaces at most, housing resources for the homeless, no matter how small, and particularly something like this which is regarded as a gold standard by many, always has an impact. and with 100 available spaces in a city as small as berkeley, I have to say as far as PR strategy concessions go, this offers long term impact in a way that impressed me. I get the sense that the housing situation in california is far more difficult and on tenderhooks than it is where I was (I can't seem to gauge if there are any real adults involved in the homeless outreach of this student movement, or any organized professional assistance or advocacy) but i guess I just feel like if the goal is to advocate for the homeless population, mission accomplished. this matters. 

if thats not the goal though, and its all about preserving the historical legacy of the park then thats fine I'll just never understand it i guess
Never gonna happen go cry
We dismantled all fences and destroyed equipment we are powerful
Drugs aren’t bad
not when it's anti-democratic. you're a vocal minority suppressing the will of the general public with the effect of harming a lot of people.
Weak argument
the university doesn't care about me and i dont care about the university. i also dont care about the mentally insane rapists who live in the park either. I dont care about the residence of berkeley.  I dont care about the protestors also. all i care about is myself and i want more student housing so i dont have to pay nearly as much in rent. how do you fix a housing problem? build more houses. FUCK THE PARK
ya bc statistically all the violent crimes in berkeley happened to children right, as if adults aren’t the one’s getting assaulted?
that's what they say about every proposed development.

that's literally what NIMBY means.
Nope honey. It is a privately owned land so no they are neither ReSiDeNtS of the park nor deserve to be on that land whatsoever. The correct word that you’re looking for is unlawful SQUATTERS.
A lot of people don't understand it. Students who protested it; they don't really care about the city of Berkeley. After graduating, they'll leave the place. And I've heard countless complaints from the UCB Alumni claiming that the city being unsafe and such. I just don't understand it either.
Oh but it will. Eventually you will lose.
Yeah crackhead
Nope just facts
The rapists are your frat bros and houses can be built in other areas
Y’all can go cry all you want the park is staying ✊
Nope they will stay there forever
Hey how about this. If you are okay with homeless people occupying privately owned land, why don’t you let them use your house and your parents’ house for housing first? Central heating at your parents’ place must be nice for them i think!
lol you really are a prime example of nimbyism. if you look into housing and renting anywhere in the bay area, you'll realize that sentiment of ""just build somewhere else"" doesn't work.

""just building somewhere else"" does ""work"" in places like texas but that comes at the cost of ruinously car dependent cities not to mention the environmental impact of endlessly developing previously undeveloped places.  

want to help homeless people and help people who are making minimum wage at the same time? build more homes so the cost of living wont be nearly as high. affordable housing is a matter of fixing the supply problem which people like you perpetuate.

arguably, your ""self virtue"" hurts poor people more than it helps. seriously, im not trying to be mean or anything, i seriously cant understand why  someone would not support the development of the park. why do you not support developing the parK?
Denying the eventual reality will not make it go away, but why would I be suprised that your are delusional.
The park will stay for another year, go worry about something else
And continue to be an eyesore and safety hazard yes unfortunately
Nothing y’all homeless haters can do about it
Why the fuck would you want support  the continuation of a dump/safety hazard to the community like that anyway? Do you think its good for the community to have homeless filthy drug addicted criminals living in our parks on our sidewalks etc you're literally brainless if you think this is a positive thing."

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
Looking into MS/Post Bacc IN CS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/brv3pt/looking_into_mspost_bacc_in_cs/,2019-05-22 15:19:30,"&#x200B;

Hi All,

So I recently graduated in August 2018 from UC Berkeley

My Major was in Cognitive Science with a 2.912 GPA.

Coding Classes I took

CS10 - The Beauty and Joy of Computing - SNAP/ 10% Python - Learned Recursion, If Else, Functionality of programming

CS61A - The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (C+) - Python

CS61B - Data Structures (D+) - Java

Cog Sci 131 - Computational Models of Cognition (B)- Learned PCA Algorithm/K-Means - in Python

At a California Community College

COMSC 2 Assembly Language for x86 Processors (B+)

MOOCS

CS50 Harvard on EDX - Learned C - Introduction to Computer Science,

Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng - in MATLAB

Work Experience:

6 MONTHS in Non-Coding Database Monitoring Job

&#x200B;

I wanted ask which way is the best route for me to get a Software Engineering Job? I am focusing on getting an Post Bacc/MS in Computer Science so I also wanted to find out which programs I should apply to? I could not do CS at Berkeley but not giving up on it. Would Bachelors or Masters be better for me?","In your situation I would probably try for a masters instead, but really you should be able to get a SWE job without either.
You don’t need more education; you need to grind prep materials for interviews and coding screens."
Anthro 3AC Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2bz4o3/anthro_3ac_questions/,2014-07-28 13:02:43,"After deciding that Anthro 3AC did vaguely interest me, i visited ninja courses, only to find that the ratings for this class didn't seem very high. For those of you that have taken this class with Hirschkind, C K as your instructor, how was your experience in this class and would you recommend it or not?","I really liked this class with Hirschkind. I thought he explained things fairly clearly, even if sometimes it felt like he kept repeating himself. I guess he just wanted to be sure everyone got it which isn't bad in a professor. I have noticed that people who aren't primarily interested in Anthropology can have mixed feelings about the class. Some people think its interesting while others complain that its too much reading or its boring and pointless. The reading wasn't actually bad at all and came from a lot of different sources and there were many topics discussed which kept things moving. I would recommend :)
I took anthro 3ac my freshman year with Hayden, and it was the most fun class I've ever taken. It made me want to become an anthro major. As an upperclassman, I took Anthropology of Religion with Hirschkind.  I would recommend Anthro 3AC. It is not hard, and if you get a good GSI you will do well. It is one of those classes in which  your GSI can make or break your experience. 
As for Hirschkind, he's very nice and I recommend going to his office hours, he does repeat himself but that helps understand concepts that are not clear. His religion class had an open notes midterm, two papers that were graded pass/nopass, and a final. The class itself wasn't hard but the TA's that graded our work sucked. The amount of reading he assigned was fair and he went over it in class. 
While i'm sure the readings were interesting for you, did you feel that there was a lot/too much reading at some points? How were assignments/tests for you? Any tips/advice before I take this class?
There isn't really anything you can do in advance to prepare. The readings only felt like too much if I had a lot of other work for my other classes. There was like 2 readings a week, some long some fairly short. Even if you don't finish the readings he covers them very well in class. Lecture is just him discussing the concepts in the readings. I remember the tests being pretty fair if you understood the concepts and remembered examples from the readings. I think they took attendance at section though. There was this ethnographic project you have to do where you go somewhere for like maybe 8 hours total and write an ethnographic paper (like 8 pages I think). They give you a lot of time on it and you turn things in in steps throughout the semester."
My car got towed on a game day and I got double my money back,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qrdwox/my_car_got_towed_on_a_game_day_and_i_got_double/,2021-11-10 21:30:00,"If your car got towed on a game day, you might be able to get double your $220 tow fee back like I did.

I was stupid to park on a game day tow zone a couple weeks ago. In my defense, I had parked 150 feet from the sign. I'm appealing the ticket from the city for that reason. My car got towed by this company called Avenue-Berkeley tow, and I picked it up from a UC Berkeley lot on Bancroft but was required to pay a tow company $220 to release my car.

The tow company actually so sloppily filled out my itemized receipt that they didn't put down my address, location of the tow, and vehicle identification, or anything besides my name, DL number, or me paying the $220. Something wasn't right, they didn't even have business cards when I asked for one.

I looked up the California Vehicle code, and  California Vehicle Code Section 22651.07(g) states that,  


>(g) “Itemized invoice,” as used in this section, means a written document that contains the following information.  Any document that substantially complies with this subdivision shall be deemed an “itemized invoice” for purposes of this section:  
>  
>(1) The name, address, telephone number, and carrier identification number as required by subdivision (a) of Section 34507.5 of the person that is charging for towing and storage.  
(2) If ascertainable, the registered owner or operator's name, address, and telephone number.  
(3) The date service was initiated.  
(4) The location of the vehicle at the time service was initiated, including either the address or nearest intersecting roadways.  
(5) A vehicle description that includes, if ascertainable, the vehicle year, make, model, odometer reading, license plate number, or if a license plate number is unavailable, the vehicle identification number (VIN).  
(6) The service dispatch time, the service arrival time of the tow truck, and the service completion time.  
(7) A clear, itemized, and detailed explanation of any additional services that caused the total towing-related service time to exceed one hour between service dispatch time and service completion time.  
(8) The hourly rate or per item rate used to calculate the total towing and recovery-related fees.  These fees shall be listed as separate line items.  
(9) If subject to storage fees, the daily storage rate and the total number of days stored.  The storage fees shall be listed as a separate line item.  Storage rates shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (c) of Section 22524.5 ([https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html))

 

California Vehicle Code § 22651.07(k) states: ""A person \[business entity under  who violates this section is civilly liable to a registered or legal owner of the vehicle, or a registered owner's insurer, for up to two times the amount charged.  Liability in any action brought under this section shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500) per vehicle."" [https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/vehicle-code/veh-sect-22651-07.html)

I emailed the tow company and requested double the amount back, cited these laws, and promised to take them to small claims court if they didn't comply. They will be sending me back a check for $440.

If you've been towed on game day, CHECK YOUR RECEIPT. If it's as sloppily filled out as mine, you're entitled to compensation.","Always good to figure this stuff out to recover your money when they didnt do things correctly. But also, strict gameday parking rules have been around for a long time. To you or anyone else reading, make sure you read up on that before parking, might not be able to get out of the next one. They dont fool around on gamedays.
fuck yeah dude. fuck towing companies.

I looked up this company's contract with the city, the city is literally paying them $45,000 to run their business model that basically extorts car owners, and disproportionately hits lower income people. It's infuriating."

Open team in Dynasty Baseball League,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35vah9/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league/,2015-05-13 13:25:13,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. This isn't an all Berkeley league, but I figured this would be a great opportunity to meet other baseball fans at Cal.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward. 

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete). 

The team roster is below. The minors system is pretty barren and the roster has too many bench offensive pieces, but there's a great deal of elite talent here. A smart owner could turn this team into a contender in short order, either through rebuilding or with a shorter term strategy. Reply or PM me if you're interested!

Context: Robert La Follette was a progressive Republican from Wisconsin who helped to revolutionize the state's structure, and made it a blueprint for other states to come in creating a government that responded to the needs of the people.  During the early 20th century, La Follette pushed for the initiative and referendum systems, the recall vote, called for strong unions, and helped develop public policy based upon research and the findings at the University of Wisconsin, embracing the benefits that learning and higher education could bring to the state.  He was eventually elected to be a US Senator.  He dared to break from President Taft during the 1912 presidential election but refused to support Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Party at that time.  He was an outspoken critic of Woodrow Wilson and his choice to join World War I while senator.  He would eventually become the presidential candidate for the Progressive Party in 1924, where left wing supporters and socialists voted for him against Calvin Coolidge.

____

To put this another way: the EE~~(CS)~~ department students at Cal were so Anti-War they actually sent a telegram at the outbreak of World War I and instead of writing to their own Senator, they wrote to the most outspoken opponent of the status quo.  They did this while the sitting president of the University, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, was a personal friend of the Kaiser [\(nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize!\)](https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show.php&id=8363) and held pro-German sentiments from his time learning and teaching in Leipzig, Heidelberg, Jena, and Berlin.

This feels like spam.
It's not too late to add the course as the first class was just a syllabus review.

All information from the first class is posted on bCourses.

Feel free to DM me for more information.
I think people should make up their minds on their own--don't you?

Open Team In Dynasty Baseball League (Again),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3cvs25/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league_again/,2015-07-10 21:41:28,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. I've posted previously about a different team that was open, and a recent Berkeley grad wound up taking it. I'd love to meet more Berkeley students (maybe who are still attending, though I'm not picky) who are into baseball.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward.

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete).

Here's the team. It's in definite need a rebuild, but there are several awesome core pieces (Cole, Wacha, Trout, Abreu) to build around or trade away for a haul depending on your strategy:

Thanks for your kind words.  It’s real, but I feel very lucky to “teach” it, even though I learn more from attending the class than I contribute personally as the instructor."

Anyone that has taken this class lmk if u have any comments abt it!! this would be my only fun class so im desperate to get in :c","Hi! I was fortunate enough to get a spot in this class taught by Prof Lucy (Kyungmi Yoo) last semester! As I can recall, attendance for everyone (both enrolled and waitlisted) on the first day of the course is really important because that determines who will stay in the class. If enrolled students do not come, they will not be able to continue with the course and another student will take their position (in the order of the waitlist). The class size will overall is pretty small and it’s in high demand, so there is a chance that little to no spots will be given up. Being #18 on the waitlist is risky, and I think I only remember seeing a couple of waitlisted students getting into the course. If you really want to take this class, you should consider contacting the prof and asking about how you might go about this matter. Good luck, and I hope things will go in your favor!

Sorry just as a follow up, Prof Lucy originally stated for everyone to attend the first class, but when I checked an announcement near the beginning of the course, she said: “Waitlist students, please don't show up for the first class. But please check your status the day before classes start to see if you have moved into enrolled status.  If that is the case, show up for the first class.” 

She also said “If I think I can add a few students, I will contact you based on your position on the waitlist.”

Hope this helps. Good luck!
Thank you so much!!! This was super helpful :)"
