Fed up with the strike? Support the strike? Email leadership,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yxe6x3/fed_up_with_the_strike_support_the_strike_email/,2022-11-16 18:40:37,"As the university’s customers, the most powerful action you can take is directly telling them you’re unsatisfied. Right now the university thinks that they can wait out the strike and instruction will continue as usual. We’ve even heard department chairs say ""everything is running fine without the striking GSIs and postdocs."" Students need to tell them that the way things are right now isn’t normal and can’t go on. Please email your department chairs and deans telling them that your education is being disrupted. Ask them to pressure the university to bargain fairly now and end the strike. Tell your friends to do the same.

**A list of people to email**:

* The [chair of your academic department](https://apo.berkeley.edu/quick-links/chairs-deans) (you can look up their email on their website if it isn’t linked)
* Jennifer Johnson-Hanks, Executive Dean, College of Letters & Science: [ug\_dean@berkeley.edu](mailto:ug_dean@berkeley.edu)
* Sunny Lee, Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean of Students, [deanofstudents@berkeley.edu](mailto:deanofstudents@berkeley.edu)","I wouldn’t email profs or department chairs — they have severely limited power in this process and might not pass on your concerns or feelings or emails to whoever really makes decisions. Go straight to the administration. Deans and assistant deans and chancellors … excellent.
I’ll email them after winter break if they don’t have my grades by then. But for now, I’m taking a long break and watch the saga unfold from my couch.
noooo. keep the strike going until finals so we can get p/np.

/s but also not /s
This isn't going to do anything our emails will bounce
One person walking around at Sather gate shouting picket chants also doesn’t do anything. 100? 200? More? Sends a message. We also want to shut this campus down, and that includes their inboxes
Yk what, you're right"
