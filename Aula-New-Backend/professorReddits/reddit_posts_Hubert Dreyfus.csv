"Hubert Lederer Dreyfus' Twitter account: ""Reports of my demise are not exaggerated."" Dreyfus, 87, taught at Cal for nearly 50 years. He was a preeminent scholar of 20th-century European philosophy, early skeptic of artificial intelligence, iTunes podcast star and Cal professor emeritus of philosophy",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/24/hubert-dreyfus/,2017-04-25 00:09:13,,"I have very fond memories of classes with Dreyfus in the mid '80s. He always had a tootsie pop or other hard candy that he would suck on while he lectured. He told the story that he used to lecture with an ice cream cone until one day he gestured with too much force and the ice cream fell off the cone.

I was in graduate school in the '90s with Sam Todes, who worked with Dreyfus on some of his early work on Heidegger and Phenomenology. I don't know the story, but believe they had some sort of falling out. Work that they did on Kierkegaard ultimately had a hugely positive impact on my life. I am very happy that I was able to tell Sam about the impact he had on my life before he died, and wish I had had the same opportunity for Dreyfus.

Great mind and a fascinating lecturer. Thank you, Dr. Dreyfus.


I've never heard of Mr. Dreyfus before, but that tweet: http://imgur.com/gallery/uc03HNk
