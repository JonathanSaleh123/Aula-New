please rate my schedule! incoming freshman pre haas.,https://i.redd.it/16eocc4zbleb1.png,2023-07-27 16:18:35,,"Prehaas as in admitted for haas or trying to transfer in? I’m not sure what the policy is now, but  I heard they changed somethings restricting transferring. 

Either way, I recommend either Econ 1 or UGBA10, just to get a feel of the major and hit some of the prereq’s. If you took AP Econ in hs, Econ 1 should be very doable. UGBA10 may require more time in my experience, but still a very freshman-friendly class.
you should take another prereq class
slavic 45 fucks and barskova is great, excellent choice

Personally I didn’t take Econ 2, but I have friends who did really well in hs Econ but still struggled a lot in Econ 2… I’d recommend waiting for next semester to do Econ 1. Can you try to get in UGBA10? Or if not see if you can do data8 or stat20 for the stats requirement.

Also, I believe haas opened their program to a 4-year experience, so L&S students may no longer be able to transfer in the future. Whether your class was the cutoff or the class after you, I’m not clear, so for the sake of not providing misinfo I’d recommend looking into it more, or waiting for someone who is more familiar with the topic to answer"
