"Milo Yiannopoulos publicly posted photos and identifying information of ASUC Senator Juniperangelica Cordova-Goff and doctoral student Adam Jadhav. Cordova-Goff: ""My existence, as a brown, transgender woman, was ridiculed by thousands who commented with queer and transgender slurs…and death threats""",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/21/uc-berkeley-students-harassed-after-milo-yiannopoulos-publicly-identifies-them/,2017-09-21 22:32:40,,">UCPD is investigating whether the incidents constitute hate crimes, the email said.

What a fucking laugh it would be if Milo showed up for ""free speech week"" and promptly got arrested for hate crimes.  I'd pay to see that, it'd be the funniest thing I see all year.
This isn't doxxing. 

It's odd though that the ASUC is passing a resolution over this but said nothing when BCR was legitimately doxxed. I can't stand BCR but the hypocrisy is deafening. 
This is fucking unacceptable.

When is Christ going to rescind his invite? He doxxed a student, leading to death threats. This isn't a matter of free speech, but of intentional, malignant negligence. Like, if they are attacked by someone emboldened by Milo, criminal negligence.

And we're paying for this shit. Fuck you Carol Christ, and fuck your lack of care for the students of Berkeley.
He posted a screenshot of her *public* Facebook post. Try again.

People are free to ridicule Juniperangelica Cordova-Goff as much as they like. Death threats should be dealt with by the appropriate legal measures. 
Crypto-fascists are cowards and weaklings who literally have to outsource their terrorism to other cowardly weaklings.
Doesn't she have a hugely popular and active Twitter feed? And wasn't this posted publicly on a student page? Anyone who thinks this is doxxing fundamentally misunderstands what the word means, god damn. 
What I've learned from this post is that no one knows the legal definition of ""incitement to violence""
How dare he post publicly available information....
I will defend anyone with the last name of Goff.
Milo is an evil piece of garbage without a redeeming quality, but UC Berkerly students literally pay for a war criminal to live out a free and happy life, despite his involvement in torturing innocent people to death.

By default I am opposed to Milo and the wannabe brownshirts that follow him, but I can never consider myself allied with people who support actual fascist war criminals like [John Yoo](http://www.firejohnyoo.net/).

Is it any wonder UC Berkerly keeps attracting fascists when you have no problems supporting - and learning from - a fascist war criminal?
on facebook, milo claims it isn't cancelled. 

>Contrary to press reports, Free Speech Week is not cancelled. We will announce our full plans for the week at a >press conference tomorrow, which will also be livestreamed on Facebook and YouTube, at 13.30pm Pacific Time.""
I love how libs are getting triggered by Milo!! Can’t wait til he comes with his navy seals.... You alt lefters are criticizing a Jewish gay immigrant!!!! 
He made a post on Instagram with an image of a public Facebook post and criticized the post for calling chalk messages ""violent"". I don't see how they could prosecute him for a hate crime. Or even a regular crime.
And then tuition goes up again in order to pay legal fees and the lawsuit that he would win. 
Yeah I'm trying to imagine how they would even word the resolution to include this. One of the people being harassed is quoted in the article saying:

> “Obviously there’s been a lot of conversation around (Free Speech Week) in the Senate and on our Facebook pages. We’ve been very critical of the events that are going to take place,” Hussein said. “We use our Facebook profiles to promote any and all work that we do … and as a result, we are being targeted.”

Information that you willingly promote isn't personal information. I'm sure the authors of some of the Daily Cal articles that have been posted here have received nasty emails in response. That doesn't mean Samses is doxxing the authors by posting them.

Reposting a publicly visible social media post =/= doxxing.
Well said. 
He posted it knowing she would be harassed. That's different than her posting it on facebook publicly.
Just because it's legal doesn't make it okay. Those pictures led to death threats. 
> Try again.

What do you mean ""try again?"" Do you think this is not newsworthy? Or do you think his behavior is morally acceptable? 
Incitement
uh
How old are you?
I don't either, but can you imagine?  I'd die laughing tbh
It is incitement, though
[deleted]
Unless he directed people to send her threats, I don't know what you're indicting him for. People can share stuff you post to public social media profiles with other people. This is why Facebook has privacy settings.
I'm happy to see you recognized your error and deleted your comments insinuating Milo has doxxed someone in the past. 
[deleted]
Go ahead and defend the claim that reposting and mocking a public Facebook post qualifies as a legal offense. 
I mean, it's incitement to the extent that any criticism of a person by a public figure is likely to result in harassment of that person, particularly when it occurs on social media. This is why my Facebook account is set to private. The internet is really bad about suddenly ganging up on people who receive exposure on a widely-circulated post.
How is it victim blaming to point out that this literally is not doxxing? Doxxing requires uncovering personal information that is not already available to the general public. Reposting a public social media post is absolutely not doxxing.
if the outcome has happened multiple times and he is fully aware of it and the intent is there he wouldnt need to direct people to do it to be found guilty. it wouldnt be hard to convince a jury actually with his history.
[deleted]
That's not at all true, most information uncovered by doxxing is public, that's how people get the information. I've been doxxed before, they got my address, my phone number, information from the courts IE *all public information*. Just because something isn't highly visible doesn't mean it's not public.
So he just shouldn't comment negatively on any specific person on social media? That's really the only outcome that would satisfy this broad a definition of intent.
How about you first assign some responsibility for the actual physical violence that has been committed by Antifa? Especially since the false claim that Milo doxxed a trans student was used to justify Feb. 1 violence.
That individual's name and image had already been made public by her appearance on a television news broadcast. I do think Milo's singling her out there was morally reprehensible, but he didn't dox her, so kindly try again. 
If they got information that was already available to the public, you weren't doxxed.

Edit: This isn't quite accurate, see my longer response below.
im not saying what he should or shouldnt. im just saying thats how the case would play out. they'll just dig up all his history and controversies and make an assessment whether there is intent or not. its not that hard to establish tbh. if you define yourself as a provocateur its like telling the world look im a stick of dynamite. would it surprise anyone if you caused damage? do you really need to look hard to establish intent? come on now
ive said in multiple post time after time about Antifa being a huge problem. and i never used the term ""doxx"" and i dont agree with that term being used in this scenario. but it is clear as day considered harassment. 
How about you first assign some responsibility for the actual physical violence that has been committed by the alt right?

(i'm just here to keep you in check)

Negative. [Second paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)
You previously said ""it wouldnt be hard to convince a jury actually with his history.""

What crime did you convict Milo of in your mind? 

 

I am 100% for accurately accounting for all violence being committed by all groups.  
I've always thought of doxxing as connecting someone's quasi-anonymous identity (online or perhaps being a face in a crowd) to identifying personal information like facebook, phone number, job, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case here. There was a public FB post under the author's real name, that was screenshotted and re-shared. Likewise with the other student, they voluntarily appeared in a public newscast with their name. No other ""private"" information was revealed.

Going up on a stage and making fun of a person's FB page and telling your fans (either explicitly or by insinuation) to send them harassing messages is disgusting, but not illegal. Neither is doxxing. However, I think both may be valid grounds to not invite someone to campus. 

The ""punishment"" of not being invited is far lower than being thrown in jail, so it should respectively have a lower bar. For example, plagiarizing is also not illegal but the university has consequences for doing it. I would never support throwing someone in jail or physically harming them for mocking, doxxing, or plagiarizing though. 

It would be chilling on democracy if publicly criticizing people who want to remain private was prohibited by the state. Any rapist, online stalker, corrupt politician, or neonazi would be protected from public criticism or social consequences for their actions. Both the left and the right use this tool to call out problematic people and inform others of their behaviour. 
No, ""almost everyone"" have not appeared on a television news broadcast showcasing their name, face, and gender identity. Milo, in presenting this information in the context of his mockery, was therefore not publishing private information.  He was taking publicly available information on a person and using it ridicule them. This bears absolutely no resemblance to any case in which someone publishes or otherwise reveals the private information of some individual that had previously not been disclosed to the public. 
You're right, ""available to the public"" probably wasn't the right term for me to use. ""Not private information"" would have been more accurate.

Information that's technically available to the public can still be considered private personal information if the person in question hasn't willingly broadcast that information. I'd say your address that can be found in court records qualifies as private information for that reason.

When you broadcast your political opinions on a public forum, you willingly make them available for public consumption.
convince jury of intent.
Aw, you can't do it, can you?
what's the crime?

U have me confused with something I'm not. 
incitement
a person willing to live by their own standards?  yea, i figured that one out on my own.
I would think if one was going to start throwing ""incitement"" charges around the people encouraging Antifa's actual violent crimes would get priority.
What standard r u imagining I am not living up to?
in an idealistic world i wouldnt disagree with you. 
Look up.  I've got faith you can figure this out.
I'm way ahead of you chump. The task I suggested above I was first doing twenty years ago and you still haven't figured out it's implications.
oh man, you must be so mature and finely aged!  20 years?!?!

What issues of social justice were you researching 20 years ago?

are you gatekeeping now?  I thought we were virtual signaling by denouncing groups that are fallaciously being associated with each other.

youareverysmart
I'm genuinely unclear on what you mean by ""gatekeeping"" in this context.


So much for researching issues of social justice.
I not ""gatekeeping"" in the traditional SJW sense  unless you've just extended the definition to include any criticism from an informed individual. 



You're just bringing up your vast 'studying' of SJW to show how smart you are?  It had nothing to do with trying to discredit my words?  weird.  Maybe brush up on that course material.  Anyway, hon, i'm heading out for the night.  Bye.
You are totally confused. My research was focused on things consistently not being covered in the SJW classes. Mainly the details of what is going on with violence in the USA. SJW's will consistently preach as if they know but all they have is cherry picked stats and ancedotes. So I looked for the whole cherry tree. 
Your research?  Please, do share the results.  Were you published?  Under whom did you study for these last 20 years?

I'm not confused in the least, I assure you.


Quid pro quo

And u r very confused. I'm not going to lecture you on Linux, Gimp or The Bruins. What made you think you were an expert on violent wannabe guerillas that have been running amuck in the UC system since before you were born, much less moved here?






Did that silence of the lambs bs sound reasonable to you in the moment?

But no, let’s talk hockey or Linux.  Your turn.

Go.

(But really, where’s that research?  You’re on a largely academic sub, go for it.  You want academic debate, do it)

Gatekeepin like fuck

Fite me on Linux, pleeeeeeease.
U r assuming I'm frauding. I'm not, but u are. What do I get if  I prove myself 2 u? If u truly think I'm faking what's the risk to offer something?
