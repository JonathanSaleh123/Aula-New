PHILOS 3 or PHILOS 12A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jjdi7u/philos_3_or_philos_12a/,2020-10-27 17:20:53,"Have you guys taken any of these classes? Which one do you recommend? (Prof John Campbell for philos 3 and prof Paolo Mancosu for philos 12A)
Thank you!!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jjdi7u)","Philos 12A is propositional logic which could be useful if you're studying computer science or discrete math. That being said, you don't learn any actually philosophy or write any papers. It's just solving propositional logic questions which is pretty easy if you've ever programmed before. When I took it with Seth Yalcin, his philosophy was not having any exams or finals because he didn't believe in students cramming. Instead, he just had a weekly quiz and homework assignment. Also, it's noted as top 10 easiest classes at Cal. So take it if you just wanna fulfill reqs and don't wanna do any philosophy papers.
Philos 3... usually it’s just 3 papers
I see! But I saw on ratemyprof that the prof for 12A has super hard final... and ok midterms and stuff. But everyone described the final as “EPIC” so I’m kinda scared lmao
So do u think philos 3 is easier?
IDK as I never took 12A. 3 definitely wasn’t difficult
kk thanks!"

Both classes are proof-based! I would take 12A in a future semester and replace it with another upper div category instead. I'm taking cogsci 144 for my linguistics req this spring and i heard it's easier than ling 100 so there's also that!!
I can’t speak much to 55 or Philos 12A as I took other classes for those reqs but I have heard 12A has good fundamental logic that is helpful if you want some background for 55 or CS courses. I would guess 55 is likely to be the hardest out of all of these.

Psych C61 work load depends on how much reading you are willing to do since that is most of the work. Get ready to memorize a lot of information. I found Ling 100 to be a pretty manageable class and I’ve found that linguistics grad students and course staff are incredibly helpful.

This seems doable, especially with how much time you have between classes T/Th. Just take advantage of all the resources they offer.
Are you doing ok? alive still?"
