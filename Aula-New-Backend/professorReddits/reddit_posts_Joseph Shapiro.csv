Envecon C181 International Trade or Envecon C132 International Environmental Economics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tynlzs/envecon_c181_international_trade_or_envecon_c132/,2022-04-07 14:41:47,"Which is easier and requires less work. The professor for C132 is joseph shapiro, no one has been announced for international trade. Also these envecon courses are equivalent to their econ counterparts so if you’ve taken those please also share ur opinion!","Took C181 last semester (Fall 2021)… it wasn’t great. 

In my opinion, the course material was extremely interesting, however it was taught in a manner that made it extremely difficult to absorb.

That being said, it is very easy to pass the class due to massive curves on tests and the overall grade. I believe the section average was a B-. I personal averaged about a 55% on all 3 tests (after the curve) and still somehow got a C+ in the course. Therefore, many other students struggled like I did.

If you are looking for a course to raise your GPA, steer clear, but if your just looking for something you can pass go ahead and take it."
