"Cal's Judith Butler to David Peritz: ""I've recently become aware of your scurrilous behavior—squatting in the home of my colleague, Elizabeth Abel.

Don't be a bad person. Don't worry about pissing off people who are trash, but don't do it just to piss them off."
"Cal's Wendy Brown to Elizabeth Abel's tenant David Peritz, an academic from Sarah Lawrence: ""It's past time for you to leave. And in case you are wondering whether there are any future possibilities of teaching at Berkeley, the answer is an emphatic no. The game is up.""",https://newrepublic.com/minutes/139555/dont-mess-judith-butler,2016-12-30 22:04:13,,"Ayyyyy that's my Queer Lit professor! Abel is such a sweet person, I could see this happening. God bless Judith Butler. 
David Peritz must be a Drumpf supporter. Just like people in red states take more welfare than other states, Peritz is a parasite.

Wendy Brown is so progressive and strong! Parasites like Peritz are not welcome teaching at Berkeley because they will pollute our students' minds.
You read like satire, except I agree with the basic principles of what you say and your post history seems earnest
This is so progressive!
Reverse Poe's Law? When your post is so earnest it reads like satire?"
