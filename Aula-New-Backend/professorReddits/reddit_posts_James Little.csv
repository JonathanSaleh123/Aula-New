My (a freshman's) highly-subjective ranking of the few UCB libraries I've visited,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16vh8zw/my_a_freshmans_highlysubjective_ranking_of_the/,2023-09-29 10:08:35,"Note: This ranking is highly subjective, and they reflect my first impressions. I have not explored a lot of these libraries in much depth, so much of my opinions might be misinformed.

Note: I use ""desks"" and ""tables"" interchangeably.  I'm sorry.

Honorable Mention: Free book collection on floor 2 of the Social Sciences building: No desks/chairs, but it's a nice open space. Open when most other spots are closed, which is nice.

15. Physics/Astro Library: Big tables, and hours aren't that bad, but it doesn't have any books. It feels sad. :(

14. French Library (""Library of French Thought""): Pretty terrible hours (10-1 Mo/We, 12-4 Tu/Th), has a decent amount of books and a nontrivial amount of books that are in English (they are about France). Good big tables, though it's a really small library so not that many of them. There's some stacks that only people who are taking French 4 or higher can browse, but I don't hold that against them in this case because those would be the only folks who'd want to see those books since they're probably in difficult-to-understand French. It's in Dwinelle on floor D, so that's a big plus, though as study spaces in Dwinelle go I prefer the Common Grounds formerly-a-cafe because of actually dependable hours and capacity (the French library has very few tables).

13. Doe Library (minus the parts which have separate hours): Hours are good; closed Saturdays and opens late on Sundays though. (though this is a thing with most libraries). Pretty bad book density, so not that interesting to lurk, wide hallways and the aesthetic exacerbate this, makes it feel ""empty"" or ""soulless"" in a way. A lot of the hallways feel like the backrooms and the layout's confusing and nontrivial. There are bathrooms but they aren't that nice and they're nontrivial to find (no big blue signs saying ""restroom"" and very few maps on walls (this also makes it difficult to find other things). Even though there's signs pointing to stuff, they're few and far between, so you could easily make a wrong turn before the next sign. It took me at *least* a half-hour to find the Bancroft library for my first time. And being lost isn't that fun because there aren't just random books around you everywhere. Whoever said Dwinelle was a ""freshman maze"" hasn't been to Doe Library.  Heyns's not a bad place to study. North would be cool but they don't let us go inside to preserve its ""historic character"" (and so we can only look through the doorway). I guess we all have different priorities Note that this categorization is kinda unfair to Doe because this entry is basically ""Doe minus all the good parts"" and the good parts all come separately.

13. Moffitt: One of the best hours around (Open on Saturdays!!!), first and fifth floors are pretty nice study spaces but get packed. Lots of natural light on 4th and 5th floor. 1st floor has nice aesthetic too, (the wood-y walls are pretty!) Floors 4-5 crowded in general, lots more couches than desks and most of the stuff are in reservable rooms so imo not that easy to find study space on those floors. Why are there couches if there's no books to read on the couches? Oh, what James Moffitt would think after the book collection named after him (see 3rd floor plaque) has dwindled down to two dictionaries and a 15-or-so-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica. (I do not count the books in moffitt circ because those books have a home somewhere else, and you can't browse them from Moffitt.)

12. Bancroft: Bancroft's weird. It has a lot of cool materials but there's a big process in order to get to use them. It isn't as bad as it looks. You look at an item on the library catalogue, you sign up for the portal, and then you request it. What I hold against Bancroft is that the language it uses feels ""gatekeepy."" Users of the library should be ""researchers."" If you're making an account for the item-request portal, it asks for your purpose of research, and there is no option that says ""personal interest"" or anything of the like. Note: I asked the staff about this and they didn't seem to care if I'm an actual researcher; I think they said to lie and pick ""research paper"" for the ""purpose of research"" thing. Looks like nobody actually checks that a research paper comes out. Hope they could change that though. There's a lot of really cool historic stuff that you can request though. You can't borrow them though (they're usually rare stuff, so that's prob for good reason), and you can bring very few stuff in (which is annoying, especially if your backpack doesn't fit in the lockers and/or if you just want to browse stuff in the reading room (a collection of reference books that you don't have to request). They have immaculate bathrooms though.

11. Institute of Government Studies Library: Hours aren't that bad, reading room has quite a lot of tables, they're the small round desks though, so not as good if you have a lot of stuff to lay on the desk. Reading room has some periodicals and cool books, probably really cool to reference. Most of their stacks are closed though, they're only open when circ staff are working, which is only in the afternoons.

10. Hass Library: I haven't explored this one much, especially not the actual materials, so its ranking is kinda nebulous. It's a quite pretty space, which is nice. Hours are really good (open Sunday mornings!!), lots of tables to study. In the Hass school of business so kinda out of the way.

9. Ethnic Studies Library: Hours aren't that bad, Right next to Institute of Government Studies library but it has open stacks which you could just browse so it goes on top. Doesn't have that many trash cans though.

8. College of Environmental Design library: Pretty big library; lots of tables but they're usually all packed. Hours are decent, there's some pretty cool folios and double folios, stacks are browsable and pretty awesome as well. Library's quite pretty, it feels like there's lots of light, not sure why. Hours aren't bad, opening at 9 a.m. is nice.

7. Newspapers and Microforms room: It's a really big room, idk what's up with that, but it's kinda cool. There's rows upon rows of documents and laws and newspapers and stuff all preserved onto microfilm and you could just take them out and view them on a reader. I'm not much of a history person. If I were, this would be higher. Horrible hours though: Weekdays 1-4 p.m. 

6. Evans library: Lots of natural lighting, good hours, in Evans Hall (I spend a lot of time there; I can't really understand what's in the shelves (with a few exceptions) because they're really advanced math stuff. It's really nice being there at the carrells by the window when the sun sets and the light starts turning orange. Currently holds the physics/astro collection.

5. Morrisson Library: Pretty unique because it's a ""no laptop space,"" which I like a lot because I could actually get some reading done for once. I treat it as an electronics-free space, which makes it even better. Lots of cool fiction there, I haven't browsed it much so I'm not sure how browsable it is. Furniture's comfortable. Good for reading. Aesthetic's nice too. Hours aren't bad (opening at 10 is nice) but not that good either (closing at 4 isn't that good)

4. East Asian Library: In my opinion the prettiest library on campus. I don't understand any East Asian languages, so I'm not sure how much I'd use it, but it's a really nice space, lots of light and stuff. Lots of greenery to its north as well!

3. VLSB library: Relatively big library, spacious, lots of shelves, lots of accessible and interesting texts, quite a few tables (usually there's a spot open), a couple couches, lots of light, nice reference material near the front -- useful for a lot of things, and some of them are just interesting, like the one about cool maps. Good hours too, closes at NINE!

2. Main (Gardner) Stacks: Glorious collection of inconcievably-many books. It has the most specific stuff, there's books that are the censuses of a particular year, or the results of a particular conference, or an overview of a really niche combination of subjects, or something else entirely, and then there's the triple and double folios. Just so many awesome books everywhere. It's so fun to just lurk around and see what sort of books are around the corner! Downside: The fiction section isn't shelved in the most browser-friendly manner. It's organized in the library of congress system so it's by author's name more than genre or anything. If you want to visit on a saturday or a morning and you're not a UCB student, it's kinda annoying because you'd need to fill up the form a long time beforehand. Hours are VERY good; if they weren't good I'd be concerned. It feels like it has the soul of a hundred libraries, though a lot of the libraries which feel soulless (and bookless) have had their souls sucked into here and idk whether that's a good thing or not.

1. Earth Science and Map Library. This place is really nice to poke around in, there's drawers full of maps; all sorts, from topos to aerial photos, to road maps, to geologic maps, to bus system maps, and a lot more stuff I haven't seen yet. There's also microfilms of the Sanborn maps, which are these really detailed ""fire insurance maps"" which give you really detailed snapshots of how a city was like in the 20th century. (really detailed building maps with building purposes) The organization might be a little intimidating, but the staff are really friendly and will help you out! I just really like maps! Hours aren't that good though, 11-5 isn't ideal, and I feel like it isn't the best of a study space (in my opinion), but that's probably just because its materials are so cool!! 

&#x200B;

Haven't visited: Music Library, BAMPFA, BerkeleyLaw Library, Chemistry Library, S/SE Asian library, Institute Transportation Studies library, LBNL library, Haviland Hall library, Kresge (closed), Philo library (temporarily closed), Anthro library (temporarily closed), Rhetoric/Film library (grad students only), Comparative Literature library, Italian/Scandinavian library, History Grad library (prolly grad students only, considering the name), Art History Library (i *think* grad students only? not sure), prob some other stuff I'm forgetting, prob some other stuff I don't know about yet","Wait, they don't let you go into the North Reading Room in Doe anymore? That was a prime study spot when I was a student
Hell yeah go EPS! 🌎
Former grad student here; graduated some time ago. This post made me feel nostalgic. However, back in my day, students had access to more spaces. Some libraries have been cannibalized for office space since I graduated. 

My favorite spot in Doe was a massive, high-ceiling reading room with lots of natural light and crazy acoustics (first floor, next to Morrison so easy to find too). Some used to call it the chamber since it could pack hundreds of students. I still see it on some Berkeley-related emails, but someone told me the space is closed to students now. Can someone confirm? Here is the picture, by the way, [https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/visit/doe](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/visit/doe)
the best place to study is actually the OCF
Bro what are you on? Doe north reading room is the most popular study spot besides moffitt. that sign is just for tour groups. And it literally is just shaped like a U,the only floors you'll really need to be on are 1 and 2. just don't bring food or drinks cause of the old books and shit you're surrounded by (and nobody wants to hear nasty ass chewing)
First: thanks! Very glad to see a student (particularly a freshperson) exploring the campus so thoroughly. Lots of insightful comments. Keep exploring, and sharing your thoughts.

Second: same question as Sean0323, wait, what! the North Reading Room at Doe is closed (???) You can only look in?

Third: some responses to some of your commentary:

\- The *Library of French Thought* was a gift to the University in World War I. The French government put together comprehensive book collections documenting the intellectual history of France and sent them abroad, in part because there was legitimate fear that Germany would overrun France and submerge / obliterate French culture. But now, well over a century after that fraught moment, it's still a good artifact of a big part of western intellectual history.

\- *Newspaper / Microfilm* room is so large (and tall) because it occupies the shell where the Main Stacks once stood. In that volume there were hundreds of thousands of books on several levels of really tight / narrow book stacks with glass block floors, that were entered from the Heyns Room. Little metal staircases everywhere, and study desks that grad students could reserve tucked in amongst the books. When the current Main Stacks were built, all the books were moved to it, and the old stacks demolished, leaving Doe with a big, hollow, core. 

Going back even further on the Main Stack history--before Doe was built, college and university libraries (and most big public libraries) had separate rooms / buildings for separate collections. Berkeley did have the Bacon Library, which was one space, but it was also thematically divided up. So people naturally thought, oh, English literature, that should have a room of its own next to the English Department offices. The design of Doe pioneered a new concept--put ALL (or almost all) of the books in one unified collection / storage area, with one staff. The alternative would have been a library building the same size, but filled with separate, self-contained, rooms each with its own specialized collection. Doe was the forerunner of huge central university libraries like this all over the United States. So your impression of the *""soul of a hundred libraries sucked in here...""* is more true than you might have imagined. (Also, many faculty, alumni, and private collectors over the past 150 years have given their private book collections to the University, and many of those books have ended up in the Main Stacks. So when you're browsing, take a look at the book plates / inscriptions on the title pages or inside front covers. You'll find ghostly pieces of literary history there.)

\- *Morrison Library:* specifically built and operated as a recreational / relaxation library for students. Not intended for studying, but as more of a restful space for students, and designed to be like the library of a big, private, home. Hence the design, comfortable chairs, couches, lamps, artwork. You should check out the monthly lunchtime poetry readings there, as well. 

\- Bancroft Library: was indeed specifically created for research purposes. And so many of the materials are so fragile--quite a lot of them are unique--that the library doesn't want people handling them directly unless there's a very specific purpose, like it's someone's handwritten journal and the researcher is writing a book on that person.  The Bancroft has some interesting sub collections--like the University Archives, which is the official repository of campus and Office of the President records. Take a look at their website sometime, for all the special collections they house--going back to Egyptian papyrus scrolls, and ancient European maps / books. Also, a lot of the things held in the Bancroft collections are stored at the Northern Regional Library (see below) so the process of calling things up and bringing them to campus does need advance notice.

*- Confusion getting around Doe / Bancroft.* Doe was built first, starting in the 1910s. It had a pretty coherent design and layout--basically a huge, hollow, square. It was built in stages, though. Bancroft built next, in the 1940s or 50s, and was attached to Doe, but operated as a separate building. The only entrance to the Bancroft Library was from the Campanile side--you couldn't go from Bancroft to Doe without going up and down obscure staircases (worse than today, I'm told). When the Bancroft was completely gutted and renovated several years ago, it was intentionally connected to Doe by that cross-corridor with the display cases in it. But the Bancroft Library access still feels obscure--you walk through that corridor, and you sort of have to know in advance that the student sitting at that desk on the south side is the face of the gateway to the Reading Room upstairs. 

I do agree it would be nice if you could go in and browse through the collections in the outer area (yearbooks, campus directories, etc) without the whole sign-in / bag-check process, though.  

Should add to your list to explore: **northern regional library** at the Richmond Field Station. You take a shuttle bus out there. A lot of campus collections have their overflow stored there. Every several years the University builds another extension to that building. It also, I think, serves the Davis and Santa Cruz campuses as well (thus, ""regional"" in the title). **Berkeley Public Library** (an impressive Central Library in Downtown Berkeley at Kittredge and Shattuck, and four branches elsewhere in the city). Anyone can get a library card there, you don't have to be a Berkeley resident. **Graduate Theological Union Library** on Ridge Road, a block north of the campus. The GTU is a consortium of most of the religious schools in Berkeley. They originally had their separate libraries, but in the 70s they agreed to build one unified library, and put all their research / reference collections there. Interesting building, and remarkable collections. Not sure about current UC student access, though, but check out their website.
There are specific libraries you can’t get in as a freshman (like the law library), that said, best of luck
Update for everyone: the north reading room is very much open to students
The Philosophy Library is great.
Ranking Doe so low is a travesty 😔😔
Kresge was the goated library, I'm sad I won't get to visit it for another couple of years
i will not tolerate this moffitt slander smh
yeah classics art history is sadly grad only, I went in there this morning and they treated me like some undergrad plebeian who couldn’t comprehend classics ( I just wanted a place to study)
also how do you get to the maps library I legit can’t find it
Definitely check out the music library. It’s a very nice vibe inside. And I used the chemistry library a lot — felt productive in there.
I need to go to more libraries 🫣
There's a sign at every doorway to it that says something along the lines of ""Visitors, please just watch from the doorway"" or something like that. Always see a couple folks studying in there though so I'm guessing it's not really enforced

The one in the picture is the north reading room. Above Morrison. From reading the other comments it is still open to students for studying, but visitors looking around the Library are apparently asked not to go in and bother the users.
>the library doesn't want people handling them directly unless there's a very specific purpose

hmm that's interesting. The staff over there seemed like they wanted people to look at materials there if they so interested them, or at least that's what they seemed like to me. (because tbf they could've shut me down at any point, but they didn't and seemed to encourage it). They did bring out a lot of materials to make sure the book stays intact though.

&#x200B;

>the book plates / inscriptions on the title pages or inside front covers

What do you mean by this?

&#x200B;

>Newspaper / Microfilm room is so large (and tall) because it occupies the shell where the Main Stacks once stood. In that volume there were hundreds of thousands of books on several levels of really tight / narrow book stacks with glass block floors, that were entered from the Heyns Room

Whoa, that's really cool! I didn't realize so many books would fit into such a (comparatively) small space! 

&#x200B;

>You should check out the monthly lunchtime poetry readings there, as well.

I didn't realize this was a thing! I'll check it out if it aligns with my timing! Why has Morrisson become a no-laptop-space? Is there a story behind that?

&#x200B;

>northern regional library at the Richmond Field Station. You take a shuttle bus out there. A lot of campus collections have their overflow stored there. Every several years the University builds another extension to that building. It also, I think, serves the Davis and Santa Cruz campuses as well (thus, ""regional"" in the title). 

The Bear Transit's RFS line's been discontinued, so now it's a transfer to the 71 and then a 0.9 minute walk. I still should make the trek out AT LEAST a few times; it seems like a really cool place and its holdings seem VAST. Is it like Bancroft where you need to make a reservation in advance to look at any of their materials? 

&#x200B;

>Berkeley Public Library (an impressive Central Library in Downtown Berkeley at Kittredge and Shattuck, and four branches elsewhere in the city). 

I need to pay a visit! Public libraries are really awesome! I went to the main Oakland library a month or so ago and there was a big history section and they had these huge books of maps (I think they were ""Sanborn maps"" or something) which had super-detailed renditions of Oakland in the time when the maps were created, which was something I found really cool.

&#x200B;

Additional question: Are any of the other Dwinelle libraries besides the French one open to undergrads/have hours when we could visit?
>like the law library

Wait really? I thought that was an open library :(
Glad to hear it!
I'll be sure to take a look when it opens!
This is probably the case. I ranked it minus the sub-rooms which have actual hours, so that was a bit unfair against it, since the sub-rooms are the parts that have the most ""soul"" out of them. 

I still feel like Doe feels ""empty."" A lot of the hallways feel wide and like a museum except without any exhibits, which feels weird. And the other non-wide hallways (like the one outside the newspaper-microform room). I feel like stair positioning might be what makes navigating the place feel unintuitive. I'll be sure to take a look at North though, see if that changes my mind.

So you could see how a lot of this comes from my subjective opinions.

You should make your own ranking!! I'd love to see your opinions on these places!
And I will not tolerate Moffitt having couches but no books to read them on; very few desks that'd be a study space that aren't in reservable rooms (except floor 1, floor 1's good study space; lots of desks)

On a more serious note, I feel like the main reason I don't like moffitt is because I've not yet needed what it's good at (group-study, and whatever the main parts of 4 and 5 are for (I honestly don't know, maybe on-ground study space, studying that doesn't involve writing stuff? idk, there's prob something or else not that many folks would use moffitt)). Another thing I like about moffitt is that they loan laptop chargers, which is something I needed once.

You should make your own ranking, O red-shouldered hawk! I'd love to see what priorities you have!
It’s weird when you have a class in there and they treat you like you are some fuckwit rando who’s not allowed to be there. Like can I pls just get to my section? 🥲
It's in the ground floor of  McCone Hall.  If you enter by the sabertooth tiger statue, just go straight ahead, past the elevator and you're there.  
If you enter on the upper entry level (floor 1), take the elevator or stairs down to the ground floor.
You should!
That sign is for tourists to not go in and disturb students studying as the library is open to the public. You can definitely go in and study there, you’re not a visitor.
Quick answers. 

**Morrison Library** was specifically built and operated so it wouldn't be a ""study library"".  People are supposed to go in there and read recreationally, or relax, or just enjoy themselves, not spread out class materials and study. I assume the ban on laptops is probably the latest iteration of that policy. 

I actually haven't been to the Richmond regional library for a while, so I don't know what their reading policies are. Check their website, though, it should say. Probably they do appreciate an inquiry in advance so they can get things ready.

**Bookplates.** So, since the 1700s at least--especially back when when printed books were rare / expensive--many people would personalize them with a bookplate. Which is basically a paper card with the name of the owner, and often something like a drawing or a motto or favorite saying. Many became very elaborate. These would be glued inside the front cover of the book, so it could always be identified as belonging to that person's collection. A personalized bookplate would have the owner's name printed as part of the design. But you could also buy generic bookplates with an empty box or space to write in your name.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex\_Libris\_(bookplate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Libris_(bookplate))

When people died, or gave their libraries away, the bookplates would typically remain in the books since they were glued in place. A lot of personal libraries were given to UC by alumni, rich donors, or faculty so scattered throughout the library collections you'll find books with bookplates. So I was just suggesting that if you're looking at an older book in the Stacks, or elsewhere, also look at the inside front cover and see if it has a bookplate that would give a clue as to where it came from.  The UC Library itself also once used to use bookplates with the UC seal: See: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Book\_plate,\_University\_of\_California,\_MDCCCLXVIII\_%281868%29,\_FIAT\_LUX,\_Ex\_Libris,\_BHL23731638\_%28cropped%29.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Book_plate,_University_of_California,_MDCCCLXVIII_%281868%29,_FIAT_LUX,_Ex_Libris,_BHL23731638_%28cropped%29.jpg)

Bookplates often include the Latin phrase, ""Ex Libris"", meaning *""from the library of...""* or *""a book belonging to...""*

Having bookplates also helped if you loaned someone a book and they ""forgot"" to return it. The bookplate would be evidence that it was your book when you visited their home and found it. :-) 

On the Bancroft yes, definitely the staff want people to use the materials. But since so many of the items are fragile or one of a kind, they do have a lot of rules for use on some things (cotton gloves, etc.). I didn't mean to say they didn't want people to research there, they do, but they are hyper focused on everything being preserved.

I don't know about other Dwinelle libraries, unfortunately.
Yeah I did what you’re doing rn during freshman year, and although I will not spoil anything, it’s good to know before hand prior to walking from one end of the camps to another.
found it, thanks friend
>you’re not a visitor

What am I, if not a visitor everywhere I go?
>That sign is for tourists to not go in and disturb students studying as the library is open to the public. 

This is weird. I visited the North Reading room recently and it had a decently-big part of the Doe Reference collection, which contains the USA statute (or something like that, some many-volume books of laws) and a lot of US censuses, which are government information. UCB's library system is a Federal Depository library, which I'm assuming means that the texts *must* be available to the general public in some capacity (this assumption is based on the thing on their website that says ""Note: While unaccompanied minors are not allowed in the MAIN Stacks, arrangements will be made for persons under age 18 to access the U.S. documents collection."" so I feel like they take it seriously).

What is going on with this apparent conflict?
How do you like it?
Yay, glad to help!
You are part of the campus community, my friend, be it Student, Faculty or Staff member, rather than a visitor.  Use the Doe North Reading Room at will!
That sign is just a politely worded request to not disturb the students studying. I don’t think it’s enforced at all and if you are going into to actually browse the collection, I don’t think anyone would have a problem. I imagine it’s because the room is very echoey with the high ceilings and if there were crowds of tourists coming in and taking photos, it’d be unusable as an actual library.

That being said, the general public can also just get a library card for a small fee and have access to all of UC Berkeley’s collection (including libraries like Main Stacks that are normally closed to the public) and even check out books.
wonderful. a bit small and not the greatest study spot but I love the books
Are you doing the same quest of trying to visit as many libraries as possible?
absolutely
Glad there's another one! Do you know anything about whether any of the other Dwinelle libraries are accessible or whether they're department/grad only?

or do they just have atrocious hours?
The dwinelle libraries have always been a mystery to me, I always just assumed they were faculty offices. Is there like an actual library in dwinelle? I looked once but couldn’t find anything
late response but the french library has open hours

and someone let me into the slavic library and showed me around once because I was staring into the window at the map (they use a card catalogue!)"
