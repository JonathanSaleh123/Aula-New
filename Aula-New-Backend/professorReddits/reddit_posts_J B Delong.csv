"How hard is Math 113, Stat 153, and Econ 101A in one semester?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15gk8p/how_hard_is_math_113_stat_153_and_econ_101a_in/,2012-12-25 23:54:21,"This is my first post, so sorry if this is a bad post. I might have to take all three of those classes along with a Decal (maybe?) next semester. I think I'll do well in 113 and 153, but I've only taken Econ 1 (Spring 2012) and I did ok in it. I got a B, but I feel like I didn't really learn much because I had a bad professor (Delong), so I'm kind of scared of 101A. 
I had a tough schedule last semester (Math 104, Math 128A, Stat 135) and I did really well in all of those classes. Unfortunately, those classes took up a lot of my time last semester and I was constantly stressed from all the work I had to do. I don't want an intense schedule next semester. Has anyone had this schedule? Does anyone recommend this schedule?

Thanks!","[deleted]
For Math 113. How good are you on algebra? How do you feel about Math 54? Do you still remember ""change of basis matrix"" although it is not on the test? (113 and 104 is kind of different.)
I would say that it will depend on the 101A teacher. DellaVigna and Card are the best and you want them. My friend is a Math/Econ/Stats guy and did very well in 101A (Card) while handling some heavy duty Math stuff. 

I, on the other hand, am not as mathematically gifted or proficient but I did really well in 101A (DellVigna). Both of us loved our profs and classes. 
David Card's notes (when I copy from Google, it spits out this shit-long link): http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CEoQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Femlab.berkeley.edu%2Fusers%2Fcle%2Fe101a_f11%2F101a-notes.pdf&ei=L87bUMjqLYbwiwLc54GYCA&usg=AFQjCNEVxAx4IfAnDDNHvRbk402yddEtyw&bvm=bv.1355534169,d.cGE
Yup, applied math major. I'll take a look at the lecture notes this winter break and decide whether to drop it or not. I took a quick glance at them, and it doesn't seem too bad since there's way more math involved in 101A than in Econ 1. I'm just hoping I don't get another bad experience like I did when I took Econ 1.

Did you need to know economic concepts beforehand (like from Econ 1) to do well in Econ 101A? 

Thanks for answering my question, by the way. 
Do you think it would be reasonable to take Econ 100A/101A without any of the Econ prerequisites? I have very basic knowledge of microeconomics from high school.
I'm not sure, I've never taken any pure algebra courses. I've taken linear algebra (54 and 110), and I did fairly well in them (B+ in both of them). Does that count?

I vaguely remember the change of basis matrix because we didn't go too in depth with matrices in 110 (we used Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right- he doesn't even introduce determinants until the last chapter) and I barely remember 54. I think I can relearn the material easily, though, because linear algebra makes more sense to me now that I've taken 110. 
Oh, my bad. I somehow think you are going to take 110. I graded 113 in a summer for a professor and the material looks not too bad, after all it is an introductory course. (BTW, Who's teaching that?) However I have to say it is kind of a different mind-set. *You won't get used to it until... until you get used to it...* and after that you don't see why people cannot understand that.

Why not grab the textbook and read some early chapters, and see what do you think? (e.g. see if you like the notion of cyclic groups)

The mathematical maturity you gained from 54 and 110 certainly helps, but the material is of a different flavor, kind of like the things in Math 55. 
Yea, I'd definitely recommend trying to look through the material a bit beforehand if you're worried about course load with your other classes.  Despite the problem sets seeming rather short, when I took 113 I found I was spending more time studying it than I was spending in my CS lab courses.  It was just extremely difficult conceptually for me to grasp the material.  On a slightly related note, it was after taking 113 that I actually decided to drop a double major/possible minor in Math and concentrate solely on my main major.  It was a very... humbling... class for me."

Shakespeare Classes for English Major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bvbdvt/shakespeare_classes_for_english_major/,2019-05-31 11:51:27,"Can someone help me find the differences between the Shakespeare classes for the English major requirement? The course descriptions are the same for English 17, and 117(A, B, J, S) so could someone please help me make an informed decision on which to take?","hi! english major here. so for whatever reason the ONLY shakespeare class that will count for the major is 117S (I'm assuming the S is for shakespeare...?) but despite that professors who specialize in his plays will offer basically shakespeare ""electives"" and those are denoted by the other letters, like A, B, F, and T, for example. 117S is basically a survey course of ALL of his works, which is why it's the only one that counts; 17 covers the same material BUT it's a lower div and therefore will not count. i hope this helps! i took 117S in Spring 18 with jeffrey knapp, who i would definitely recommend. he's a super nice old dude who sounds like kermit the frog
That helps a lot thank you so much!
Oh, uh oh, no this is a misunderstanding: Any of the 17/117's except 117T count toward the requirement. On the ""[requirements](https://english.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/the_major)"" page for the website, you'll see 117A, 117B, 117J and 117S listed as counting towards the major.

When in doubt, check the website, or the adviser for English.
no problem! imo it's unnecessarily confusing to have all the shakespeare classes under the same number, but if it turns out you really enjoy the way shakespeare is taught at cal you'll always know where to find them!"
summer classes input from a stressed bear pls help i am sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mtruis/summer_classes_input_from_a_stressed_bear_pls/,2021-04-18 20:10:51,"soo im so lost w my class situation! I'm a current freshman thinking ab majoring in PH + MCB. I have acc no idea what to take this fall :( i took tons of cc classes so im done with all of my breadth requirements also. the biggest doozy, i am taking chem1a rn and eating ass. a lot of it is me not preparing well for mts and just cramming lectures/ content vs acc studying/prepping. and i don't know  (but i do know?) why this keeps happening, trust me i hate myself for it. anyways, this sem is probs the worst I've ever done academically and my self-esteem and mental health rn sucks. i did well first semester and this semester... its def not gonna be that great lmao. i am also premed which is stressful bc ppl ik b freakinnn about a B lmao. 

i was thinking about taking chem3a/3al this summer since i feel behind in the o-chem series already as i took chem1a in the spring and not fall. but now, idk whether i should just take chem3a/3al in fall (w robak). OR do just chem3a this summer and push lab to fall to not overwhelm myself over summer? i don't wanna wreck my gpa or my learning in such an important course. 

i cant even decide my fall classes bc it kinda depends on what i do over the summer. should i take some chill class to boost my gpa a little over summer, and also get the chance to self-study o-chem before i go into it? or should i j go for chem3a? i would get like 4+ weeks until that session starts to self prep.

i would really appreciate any help im sorry if this was all over the place, im so lost and my advising app is like right before fall enrollment lmao so i would love ur input <3","I haven’t taken 3a over the summer but hearing from people who did, it’s very intense. Mostly because organic chemistry is something you learn with practice, not just memorization. However taking it over the summer may be better for you if you’re not taking any other classes at the same time like you are this semester. Another thing is that it’s pretty hard to self-study for classes so unless you have all of Robaks notes to study over the summer, I doubt that it’ll be much help to try and prepare over the summer. Last thing, just because you’re not doing well in 1a doesn’t mean that 3a won’t go well for you. Maybe inorganic chemistry just isn’t your thing right now. In general I would say ask yourself if there’s any other classes you could take this summer that would be useful to you and your goals if you want to go a more relaxed route or be ready to really focus on 3a in the summer because you’ll need to take it one day.
""I'm a current freshman...i took tons of cc classes so im done with all of my breadth requirements""...what a legend
If Chem 3A is with Pete (marsden) I’d take over summer. He’s fantastic but don’t stress too much about being behind in 3 series. You can still take the bio 1A/1B and physics 8a/8b without needed the 3 series. The only thing is you need both bio 1A and Chem 3b to declare whenever you want to start taking upper divs
Hi! I am in the same situation, would it be better to take physics 8A during the summer than chem 3A, and then do physics after sophomore year (during that summer)?
hi there! i am totally unsure of who is teaching chem3a this summer. do you know if there is a way i can check this? tysm!!! also, would u recc taking chem3al simulatenously? :)
I believe if he is teaching 3B in the fall then he usually is teaching 3A in the summer. Also for labs it is up to you, they are needed to declare but it helps to take relatively close to when you took the class
Labs are not*** needed to declare"

> Dear members of the campus community,

> I would like to share with you some changes to the webcast service:

> *As of Fall 2015 semester, to reduce service costs and enable us to maintain a lecture capture service focused on students:*

> * *We will no longer make our lecture videos available to the public.*

> * *We will make lecture videos available to enrolled students via CalCentral and bCourses.*

> * *Existing lectures through Spring 2015 will remain available at public distribution channels.*

> As many of you may know, ETS provides **Webcast Classroom Capture**, a common-good lecture capture service, in over 50 of our general assignment classrooms. Currently course recordings are made available to students and to the public via YouTube, iTunesU and [webcast.berkeley.edu](http://webcast.berkeley.edu/).  To provide these videos to the public, they are monitored, edited and steps are taken to ensure the content conforms with privacy and intellectual property law and UC policy. This process is costly, as it requires significant staff time and effort.

> As we considered the current state of the budget and after much consultation, we have chosen to reduce spending and reallocate resources in ways that least impact our primary mission to support the teaching, learning, and research activities on the campus. By transitioning to a student only approach to lecture capture, we will continue to provide a valuable service to our students in support of their learning and garner significant cost savings.

> Additional details regarding these changes will be communicated to participating instructors and students prior to the Fall Semester.

> I'd sure like to see a some numbers about what these services cost. So somebody is paid to watch every video?

> Solution number 1: ask for student volunteers to video and upload the lectures. This is not complicated, kids are doing it every day now.

> Solution number 2: simply let the faculty members make the call, those that want to provide access can and those that don't want to can decline. As for the latter boy does it ever speak volumes about a tenured elite that are so damn worried about rationing out access to their alleged wisdom. Beware, sites like KhanAcademy are just the beginning and anybody who doesn't get it pretty pretty quick is going to be seen as irrelevant sooner than they might imagine. There are community colleges blowing the roof off ""value added"" by way of using technology and meanwhile the very concept seems to be lost upon a lot of people who really should know better. I would say the fastest way to figure out who even conceives of ""value added"" in education is whether or not they are embracing technology like this.
The university has got to save money somehow, people, with the state's recent **heavy** UC-divestment campaign. If youTube posts can't get cut from the budget, what can? I used to catch up on my lectures all the time by using the YouTube page, and rarely did I see videos (that had been there for years) with more than 1,000 views. I would bet that a very high percentage of those views were Berkeley students, like me. If the administration is telling the truth about it saving $$, then this seems like a great place to do it.

That said, I'd guess they're just trying to consolidate/differentiate MOOCs resources.
I don't know. How many people even actually watched the lectures that were posted on youtube anyways?
I'm okay with this. Aren't they leaving the old lectures up? The material of most classes doesn't change *that* much over the years, what's wrong with restricting newer lectures to Berkeley students and leaving older years' to the public?
Good. The public could pay for their own education.
The time needed to process the videos isn't the issue, it's the cost of hiring someone to go through every video and make it copyright compliant. That probably requires like 2 pass throughs through the video, time to double check each source, and time to make the required edits. An hour long lecture would take about 4 hours to edit, write meta data, and upload. That's extra 4 hours of staff time compared to now probably like 20 minutes to tag it and upload. A person is who is qualified to edit video and knows enough about copyright probably earns a decent wage.
I wonder how many lectures actually contain copyrighted material.  It might make more sense to just put up lectures and deal with editing if a DCMA notice comes along.

Man, this is really too bad.
Every year the state (on behalf of the public) decides that it will contribute less than it did last year to the UC.  At the same time, students are asked to contribute more in the form of rising tuition.  When support units are asked to make cuts, they look at the value every one of their dollars provides back to the University, they logically conclude that the money they pay the person to sanitize videos for YouTube is a person they can cut without affecting the students.  The loss of service is suffered by the public who are the ones that decided to invest less in the University.  It makes perfect sense to me.
Mark Talmont's got some good points.

Public universities are paid for with tax dollars, which come from the public. The public already pay for their own education. Not sure what you're talking about.
huh. i was wondering. useful info; thanks!

Most videos won't need any editing because there's no copyrighted material.

Aren't most lectures just professors discussing the material on their own slides?

Why would they need to do two passes through the video? All you'd need is for the person recording the lecture to flag the places where there's copyrighted material (which shouldn't happen all that often). It's easy to flag those places because that happens only when the professor deviates from his/her slides and shows a video clip from YouTube or something.
> It might make more sense to just put up lectures and deal with editing if a DCMA [sic] notice comes along.

It's a bit more complicated than that. Since the UC Berkeley webcasts are produced and uploaded by UC Berkeley-affiliated staff, the webcast site doesn't qualify as a DMCA safe harbor. This means if the university knowingly hosts copyrighted content, when they receive a takedown notice, they can be sued for copyright infringement, **even** after they remove it.

Most people are unaware of this DMCA subtlety since nearly all services we use work very hard to fall under a DMCA safe harbor. If a user uploads copyrighted content to a service, it falls under safe harbor. If the owner uploads copyrighted content to a service, then it doesn't fall under safe harbor.

I've got a really great source for this but unfortunately Google is hiding it from me.
Word. Prof. Muller is a great personality. The ""public who 'pays' for this university"" argument aside-- because I could type for pages about the state's disinvestment in UC-- I think these videos actually do good things for our public cachet and probably pay for themselves in the long run (obviously, I don't mean directly).

(Still, I don't think *that* many people watch most of them. Just the big names and the intro and/or interesting lectures.)
Interesting! Good to know there are a lot of curious minds out there.
I support any change that saves the school money to allocate more for the students/don't cut current programs or benefits than wasting money on useless things like Youtube webcasts for the public.

OK, don't cry then when they raise your tuition. 
> As of Fall 2015 semester, to reduce service costs and enable us to maintain a lecture capture service focused on students:

>We will no longer make our lecture videos available to the public.
We will make lecture videos available to enrolled students via CalCentral and bCourses.
Existing lectures through Spring 2015 will remain available at public distribution channels.

>As many of you may know, ETS provides Webcast Classroom Capture, a common-good lecture capture service, in over 50 of our general assignment classrooms. Currently course recordings are made available to students and to the public via YouTube, iTunesU and webcast.berkeley.edu.  To provide these videos to the public, they are monitored, edited and steps are taken to ensure the content conforms with privacy and intellectual property law and UC policy. This process is costly, as it requires significant staff time and effort.
> 
> As we considered the current state of the budget and after much consultation, we have chosen to reduce spending and reallocate resources in ways that least impact our primary mission to support the teaching, learning, and research activities on the campus. By transitioning to a student only approach to lecture capture, we will continue to provide a valuable service to our students in support of their learning and garner significant cost savings.

 It seems like they will not be editing the videos anymore and just throwing them on the student accessible intranets.
First pass through is to flag/make edits, second pass through is to check if everything is fine. Professors often use outside sources, videos, slides, and sometimes even have weird copyrights on their own materials. The latter is supposed to be a especially big part of this problem as the professors are very picky about what rights to their material they want to give up to the university.
Thanks for the info.  Do you happen to know where fair use fits into this?

As a student joining Berkeley in the fall, I would want the YouTube webcasts to be available to the public.

Prospective students like me use these webcasts to see how Berkeley classes are like.

From [http://www.berkeley.edu/news/budget/primer/sources.shtml](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/budget/primer/sources.shtml):

> State general funds

> Funds provided by the State of California are called ""state general funds"" and include both a $450 million basic operating support allocation that covers about 25 percent of our activities and several allocations from the state to support specific research projects. **These two types of funds combined make up about $500 million per year, or about 28 percent of our total operating budget.**

California taxpayers, who pay for 28% of Cal's budget, should have access to these videos. With a change like this, Berkeley is becoming less and less of a public university.
Because posting a video on YouTube costs so much money....

And btw, students are paying money for a degree. Having videos available on YouTube isn't going to make someone who was considering college decide *not* go to college. 
Yes. California taxpayers in 2008 gave UC Berkeley half a billion dollars.

From [http://www.berkeley.edu/news/budget/primer/sources.shtml](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/budget/primer/sources.shtml):

UC raises tuition when the state cuts the UC Budget. Tuition raises fill in the gaps caused by budget cuts. So the amount of public money stays the same. Still not sure what you're talking about.

Please put more thought into your comments.

OK I'm trying to piece it together

It looks like ETS charges $16k/semester,  or about $350/hr of video.      That sounds awfully high.   The work could be done by students for much less. 

A lot of the money is probably eaten by salaries of full time staff.   Hubbard was making $110k in 2013.   Steve Garner was at $108k.   Their boss is making $153k.   Those are just the managers,  they don't actually do any video work.

The ""copyright"" issues are probably two-fold.   One is professors showing copyrighted materials,  videos etc.   The other is the professors claiming their OWN slides and lectures are copyrighted. 

ETS isn't telling us how much they'll actually save by not putting the videos on youtube.    Just that they'll save ""some"".    There's no real constituency pushing for the videos on youtube, so I guess its easy to cut.   But in theory they'd be educating a lot more people for a lot less money by putting lectures online.

Fair use is a defense that can be raised when you get sued for copyright infringement.  It's not a set of permissions; instead, the law specifies what factors a court must consider when deciding if a particular use falls under that category.  There are certain established precedents for fair use, but it is a very narrow exemption, not the broad category some people think it is.  Also, I would be very skeptical that the kind of stuff that would be fair use when presented in a classroom would always qualify as fair use if recorded on video and posted online.

A perfect example of this would be a teacher showing some kind of (say) recorded chemistry demonstration video in class.  The license for such videos generally allows them to be shown in a live classroom to students enrolled in the class.  However, it would absolutely not permit such a video to be posted on Youtube.  This would likely also not qualify as fair use, since such use would obviously destroy much of the commercial value of such a recording.  

Try 14%, max... the 6 years of state divestment between 2008 and 2014 have made a big difference. The balance has gotta come from somewhere; I for one think discontinuing the broadcast of courses is a fine place to save some money. For goodness' sake, look at the actual viewership #s on those videos. They're very low!

http://cfo.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/2013-14%20UC%20Berkeley%20Budget%20Plan%20-%20Final%20(9-5-13).pdf

Edit: though I think the actual savings is probably pretty minimal, and read this email as complete BS.
The cost comes from screening and editing the material, not hosting.
The 28% was in 2008, welcome to 2013-2014 budget (2015-2016 hasn't been released yet):
http://cfo.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/2013-14%20UC%20Berkeley%20Budget%20Plan%20-%20Final%20%289-5-13%29.pdf
(takes a while to load).

The university is way more private than public these days, so enough with the social crap. 
Taxpayer/state support is 14% or $320 million and going down every year since the state is broke.

I'm talking about numbers you haven't ever bothered to examine, read, or analysis. All you know is ""tuition raise is bad"". They raise tuition to waive the tuition for people with low income(s)/re-entry students and other need-based students. They could say screw you all and everybody pay full price (resident tuition fee). More than half of the school get some sort of financial aid and about 1/3 get a tuition waiver because other people pay for the difference. They could decrease the tuition right now by 50%, but then everybody would pay flat rate/take loans. Fair game? yes and no, depends who you ask.
The university has unions.  They have contracts, which set certain requirements for who can and cannot do certain work, and how little they can be paid.  You can't just start replacing union positions with unpaid volunteers, even if you could find enough such volunteers (which is unlikely)
Again, I don't think that students have the knowledge to do the copyright stuff. Video editing, yah, but they're paying for someone who is at least slightly versed in video copyright law.
Yeah but they're still making the videos available on bcourses, so the editing is still being done. The difference is they're not posting them on YouTube as well. 
How in the world is this getting down voted?
Federal government support and grants are also public money. Add those in and it's over half.
28% is a lot. $500 million.

What do you think the tuition would be if the State of California offered 0% instead of 28%?

The managers are not in a union.    Not sure where all the rest of the money goes.

In any case they haven't said how much this will save....


What makes you think telling if something is possibly copyrighted is a difficult job?  
People have hard time to hear the truth when it's against their interest. I'm also against raising taxes for CA resident so assholes in the university could waste money:
http://freebeacon.com/issues/uc-berkeley-misused-1-8-million-in-taxpayer-funding/
Federal government grants are given for specific research projects (and overhead associated with them), not for putting webcasts up on Youtube.  These funds are restricted and the government is very strict about how they are spent.  The funds that pay for discretionary stuff like webcasts are much more limited.
It would be the same. It would just lower in-state acceptance rate and limit (or give equal opportunity for all students across the nation/globe) the free-rides many people get. Taxpayers are paying for their kids to have the opportunity to attend the best colleges in the country in a reasonable price - they do not owe or have any rights on the content, research, accomplishment or anything at that sort that the university is producing and publishing. 
The managers might not be in a union (although I don't know why you are so sure -- UPTE covers some managers, too), but the staff doing the video editing most certainly are.

Don't know how much it will save, but editing video is not particularly cheap.  Among other things, someone must watch the whole thing, and employees cost the university a lot more than just their salary.
http://www.ucop.edu/uc-mission/index.html

> The University's fundamental missions are teaching, research and public service.

""Public service"" should include services that benefit the California public such as public webcasts.

Read between the lines 

if it were saving significant money they'd be bragging about it.  
That's your opinion what ""public service"" means - others, like me, would not include published lectures that costs a lot of money to edit and upload to YouTube (because they can't publish copyrighted materials and actually need people to watch all the lectures and get sometimes legal advices if they can or cannot publish specific pieces from the lecture). As from 2013-2014 budget, Cal doesn't want to be even part of the state system anymore since the State suckcs. 

&nbsp;

""The financial model for the campus has changed drastically, and the campus must plan for a financial future that does not rely on significant funding from the state. It is clear that philanthropy must play a growing role in sustaining the campus’s legacy of access and excellence. University Relations is continuing its strategic focus on increasing private philanthropy to complete the $3 billion Campaign for Berkeley in collaboration with units across the campus, and integrating new messaging and branding across all platforms in Public Affairs and to campus partners.""

&nbsp;

and
""In the past, the state was a primary source of funds for seismic upgrades. But those days are almost certainly over. While external funds can sometimes be used for projects that reduce seismic risk as part of a larger concept with donor appeal, such as the Stadium or the Art Museum, there is no evident donor interest in seismic risk as an objective in itself. For most academic buildings, continued improvement in life safety requires more creative financial strategies, including the strategic use of campus funds.""

&nbsp;

and
""The State of California has historically provided funds to help the campus meet these needs, but with those funds continuing to decline, Berkeley may have to chart its own course going forward. Under the campus’s newly-established capital-budget framework, these proposed projects will be evaluated for funding from two central sources: the Capital Renewal program, which focuses on upgrades to core buildings and campus infrastructure systems, and the Capital Bank, which focuses primarily on investments in existing space driven by program needs.""

&nbsp;


tl;dr --> Cal doesn't give a shit about the State's funding anymore and can manage its own business. However, it is still obligated to give a low cost education for CA residents.
I don't think it's a question of saving money, but probably more of a question of allocating resources.  For example, ETS may be able to provide other, more valuable services with the same budget.

In terms of how much money it will save:

> Each year we capture and publish nearly 4,500 lecture videos and each video requires an average of 15 minutes of staff time to prepare for public distribution.

So that's about a full-time staff member they can reallocate to other duties, saving ~$150k/yr (if we assume 2x salary as the true cost of an employee).

That's about 2/3rd of an FTE and the closest person to a video editor working at ETS s making less than 50k.    So it could ""save"" 66k.  Out of a budget in the billions.
That's not 2/3rds of an FTE, that's an FTE even assuming unrealistically high productivity.  People don't spend 8 hours a day sitting at their desk and working.  Between lunch, breaks, reading email, doing other tasks (like meetings), and not always having work to do, the average employee would be lucky to get 5-6 hours of actual work done in an average workday.  Not to mention, most of those videos are recorded within 7-8 months out of the year, so you have to have twice as many people to cover the peak (and they have to be assigned to other things when classes aren't in session).

I don't know where you are getting your information about how many staff they have (do you work there?).  I know for a fact that there are a fairly large number of staff doing video recording, since there is usually an employee or two assigned to each video classroom.  They may not all be in ETS, and I don't know what their title would be (probably something like ""specialist III"").  Also, don't confuse salary with what an employee costs.

Also, if you think $100k is nothing, feel free to donate that amount to the university each year and earmark it for webcasts.  If you don't have $100k hanging around, you could always put together a fundraiser.  That would probably at least get you a meeting with someone up there who can tell you how much it really costs.

The info is all online.    Salaries, titles,  what degrees people have,  experience level,  who reports to who. 

15 mins per lecture is what they said it takes to prepare for youtube.    1200 hrs at $25/HR is $30k.   Triple it for overhead and benefits and time reading email,    $90k.   Maybe not a perfect number but very suspect that no one is saying how much this will save. 


Why do you keep saying $90k is somehow insignificant?  Even if that's all it costs, it's a significant amount of money that can do many other, potentially more useful things.  Just because it's a small part of the total budget doesn't mean it can be neglected.  All of the university's spending consists of ""little"" expenses like this.  Again, feel free to organize a fundraiser.

It's likely less than 90k.  it's not insignificant, just like the millions spent on ETS managemers

Providing educational material to California is a pretty good use.   Even the students benefit from edited video, have you watched an unedited video before?

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
ECON major 1st year cource choices,https://i.redd.it/co3hnhiw4l3d1.jpeg,2024-05-30 08:50:04,"HELLLOO, please help me choose my cources for the first year to declare an economics major. ","The first question is - what are you bringing over from HS in terms of college credit? Any Calc? Any English?
I do A levels so i believe I am not bringing in any credits
I do Maths and Econ my bad
Will you be required to take any classes in the calc series? Math 1A/B? If not, definitely avoid them. Same with econ 1/2 if you can help it. If you've passed out of both of those I believe all you'll need to take is intro stat and one upper division econ course between Macro and Micro. I'd sign up for intro stat your first semester, and one of the upper division classes (100A/B) second semester, dependent on who is teaching. I took stat 20 my first semester, and with a HS stat background it was fine.
So when you say Math, do you mean you’re going to get college credits for the equivalent of 1 year of Calc?  ie Calc 1 and Calc 2?  You probably want to check first, you might not want to repeat stuff you’ve already gotten college credit for already. (A lot of students do repeat stuff though). 

So your Math and Econ prereqs might already be done. For Stats, usually people default to taking STAT 20, but I recommend taking Data C88S as your requirement. But in order to take that class you also need to take Data 8, either as a prerequisite or as a co-requisite.  IMO learning Python via Data 8 is somewhat more in vogue than learning R via STAT 20.

The intermediate Econ classes, you’re not eligible to take until later on.
Also, a ton of Econ students these days tend to minor or double major in Data Science, of which Data 8 is a requirement. Something to think about.
is it possible to double major in ds if accepted into l&s?
It is possible, but no one really knows the outcomes and odds of switching to/double majoring in CS/DS/Stats until next year. You apply, go thru a comprehensive review and wait and see."
"""Comprehensive"" Guide to Econ Upper Divs",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mgwgnc/comprehensive_guide_to_econ_upper_divs/,2021-03-30 19:48:35,"Hey all,

I'm a current third year at UC Berkeley majoring in Economics/Data Science. I've seen a couple of posts on this subreddit about specific classes and which ones to take as well as their difficulty. I find that a lot of posts are centered around lower division pre-requisites, but useful information on the upper-division courses is hard to find. While I can't offer my personal input on all the courses here at Cal, I found an old discussion on Piazza that I thought was worth sharing with a larger community. **Warning: There is a lot of text so just ctrl+F if you're looking for a specific course.** All credit goes to their respective owners, specifically Prof. Olney and her Spring 2021 course staff. Everything below is written up by Prof. Olney with my personal comments in italics:

>Econ 110: Game Theory. How models of strategic behavior are used in both econ and poli sci. Bob Powell, the prof, is in PoliSci. He and I were classmates in Econ PhD. So he's trained as an economist and asks PoliSci questions. He started with research on nuclear deterrence. Excellent content for lots of social science questions.  
>  
>Econ 115: 20th C World Econ History. I'm an economic historian so of course, I think you should take econ history courses! Econ history is not only about learning history and understanding history through the lens of economics, it's also about challenging the assumptions of our econ models. And historians tend to be the only ones who step back and think about structural & institutional change and its impact. *Heard this class is great but is a lot of reading. I would take this class if you don't mind the reading and want a more comprehensive understanding of how the field of Econ has developed over time.*  
>  
>Econ 119: Psych and Econ. This is the intro to behavioral economics. Berkeley is one of the foremost departments in this field. *This course seems really interesting just from a topic perspective. Psychology has been missing from Econ for a while now (since Keynes wrote his General Theory of Employment), and Behavioral Economics is probably one of the fastest developing subsets of economics at the moment.*  
>  
>Econ 131: So relevant right now! What are the incentives & disincentives to public policy programs?  
>  
>Econ 134: Take this class. Metrics is a (new) and real prereq, so be sure you've completed metrics before taking it. *I took this in Fall 2020 with Nakamura. She's a great lecturer and economist in her own right. The metrics requirement is important but I wouldn't say completely necessary. If you can learn how to read/interpret regression tables, you should be able to get through the vast majority of the class but this may change for later iterations.*  
>  
>Econ 136 & 139: Finance. Not my thing, but if it's yours, these are the finance classes. *Currently in 136 with Professor Hawkins. He is a very knowledgeable teacher with vast experience in the field. His class, at least online, is a bit hard to follow and pretty confusing. Still, if you want to do anything in finance you should probably take at least 136 to get an understanding of the field.*  
>  
>Econ 140/141: take one. Earlier is better than later as a lot of Econ classes have added or are in the process of adding metrics to their pre-reqs. *A lot of Econ courses are adding metrics of a pre-req to combat people taking it as late as possible. I would highly advise taking it as early as possible, despite its fairly notorious reputation. I took the Econ140 with Bianchi, and the class was hard but certainly not impossible, (I would compare it to some of the harder lower division statistics/math courses). The learning curve is fairly steep as you'll be forced to use Stata on top of the course material. Regardless, Econ140/141 are the most important economics class you'll take as an undergraduate so figure out a semester that has a chill workload, buckle in, and grind through it.*  
>  
>Econ 142: great class! I sat through it one term because I wanted to learn the material. How to use metrics to analyze public policy.  
>  
>Econ 162: Chinese economy. I don't know much beyond the title, and that the prof is definitely an expert in the field  
>  
>Econ 171: Intro to economic development. Our department has an awesome team of development economists, and (once we're past all the covid-19 effects) J-Pal hires a lot of people with BAs to work in the field. [https://www.povertyactionlab.org/](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/)  
>  
>Econ 174: Metrics is definitely a prereq. How do we evaluate the effectiveness of development policies? My description doesn't do it justice. If I was 20 years old, this would be high on my list (along with 134 of course). *Taking this course with Prof. Finan in Spring 2021. I love the professor even though he's a bit technologically challenged, but he's a great guy and super nice. The material is incredibly interesting and the professor does a great job explaining things. There are a lot of regression tables and the problem sets and midterms double down on being able to analyze, interpret, and develop regressions, but it's a great class overall.*  
>  
>Econ 181, 182, 184: the international classes. 181 = 100A+international (comparative advantage, trade, tariffs, etc, so exchanges of goods and services). 182 = 100B+international (exchange rates, balance of payments, financial flows, so exchanges of financial assets). 184 is new so I don't have any information. *I took 182 with Prof. Gourinchas in Fall 2020. Put simply, it was a mess. The GSI's were unresponsive for the majority of the semester and trying to get an answer from either the Professor or course staff was always a game of chicken. The problem sets were pretty hard and they were assigned weekly. Most annoying of all, we didn't have a single grade in bCourses through dead week. The content itself was interesting, especially for those interested in international macro, but my terrible experience with the class from a logistical perspective makes me hesitant to recommend it to other people.*  
>  
>191: if you want to do a thesis, if you want to go to a PhD program, if you want to write an empirical research paper, this is the class. It doesn't list metrics as a prereq but treat it as if it did. You come out of this class with a 20 page top-notch empirical research paper that you conceptualized, researched, and wrote. You will end up talking about the paper in every one of your job interviews. Every year, students say to me, ""my research paper got me my job!"" Yep, indeed.  
>  
>195A: If you want to write an honors thesis, but don't want to write a full research paper in the fall and another one in the spring, then 195A is the route to take.

Feel free to discuss, add comments, or just talk about your experience in any of these courses. This list is by no means extensive, hence the quotations around ""comprehensive"". I hope this post helps some up-and-coming econ majors and other upperclassmen looking for what to take in next Fall when most of these classes (fingers crossed) should be back in-person.","I took Econ 162 Fall '20. It's almost a history class. Interesting, and you don't need to know anything about economics at all to do well (at least with Roland). Econ 131 is typically taught by some of the best economists at Berkeley (Saez, Zucman). It's mathy, but you learn a lot about optimal taxation and how to analyze fiscal policy which is fun if you like to understand  current events and policies that are being proposed.

Professor Olney wrote this in Spring '20, so it doesn't include classes that weren't offered in Fall '20, and the professors teaching next year won't necessarily be the same. For instance, I'm currently taking Econ 121 (Industrial Org Economics), and it's possibly my favorite class I've taken. It's all about imperfect competition and market power, and Prof. Edlin is a lot of fun. Highly recommend. I think it's also important to note that the Econ major can be done a lot of ways. From what I can tell, OP is a lot more math-inclined than I am. I prefer the classes that rely more on stories and theory than proofs. Some people like macro or micro better. If you aren't a math person, don't be scared of the Econ major. It's a huge program and there are a *ton* of paths you can take

Thank you for posting this! What class would you recommend for someone who's not an Econ major but interested in learning more about this topic?
Currently in Econ 139 with Bianchi, and it's really interesting. I took 136 with Hawkins last semester and loved it, so I thought 139 would be the next step bcs I am very interested in finance (and my career goals are in a similar field). The class is great, and I really like Bianchi!!!
Thank you, I'm a freshman looking at this and want to take the least math intensive route possible. Which courses do you think that would be?

Also, how are the curves in the department? 

I'm very interested in the topics, but not at the expense of my GPA if the other bears are faster at problem solving. Trying to find a department where I can get at least a 3.3 with my skill level.

I’m in 136 rn, and confusing as lectures are, the discussions and problem sets help the content make sense to me. Overall really great class.

One class I didn’t like was 181. Prof Fally is a great prof and all, but the content is just too theoretical and would never work in a practical scenario. Good for getting the intuition behind why trade happens, but not for going in-depth.
Note: 141 is significantly more proof-based than 140. I highly recommend that you take some stats upper-divs before taking that class.

Also, 140 now uses Juypter, while 141 uses R.
This is really late to ask and it seems like you havent taken 171, but can you explain what you think the difference between econ 171 and 174? I am scheduled to take 171 this summer but 174 sounds like it goes more in-depth so I might want to take that instead.
thinking bout taking chinese economy in the summer, are the exams essay based? im guessing there's no research paper as well?
I fucked up and posted it instead of saving it as a draft. It's now updated with all the information.
It's ""comprehensive"" for a reason
If you are more interested in application and concepts rather than math and graphs, several Public Policy classes, especially 101, give good overviews and don’t assume prior knowledge, unlike most Econ upper divs which are interesting but often require more prior knowledge of formulas etc. Otherwise, Econ 1 or 2 as mentioned above
Probably Econ 1 or 2, but if you are specifically looking for an upper div, it depends on what you are interested in. Finance? Demography? Health Econ?
I'm a rising junior whose double majoring in Econ/CS! Take my advice with a grain of salt, seeing as how I haven't actually taken that many Econ upper divs (Econ100A, Econ101B, Econ141, and Econ136) and all were taken during the COVID semesters so the grading curves were definitely skewed, but I would say that so far, for most classes if you put in the work that's definitely manageable.

[berkeleytime.com](https://berkeleytime.com) is a great preliminary resource if you want a sense of the curves with specific teachers/semesters, but most classes have an average of \~B/B+ I would say. Also, the ""mathier"" Econ classes (101 series + 141) typically have more generous curves as well.

If you want to avoid math, then I would recommend going with 100A, 100B, and 140 for the mandatory upper division courses. From there, you could take Econ110 (game theory), Econ 119 (Psych + Econ), Econ 138 ((Behavioral Econ). Essentially, the more history-oriented classes would probably be more up your alley and less so the more empirically-driven (read: econometrics-heavy) development-based classes.

Hope this helps!
If you are Haas, you can take either series. Econ majors have to take Econ 100/101 A/B.
Don't know anything about 171 but I took 174 last semester and absolutely loved it. It does use a lot of regression analysis frameworks but if 140 made sense to you then you should have no problems. Highly recommend taking it with Prof. Finan if you can.
thanks for the response, I'll try to look into it more bc it sounds interesting."
