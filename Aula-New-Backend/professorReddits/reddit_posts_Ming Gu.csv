Math128A w/ Ming Gu or Math104 w/ Jikang Wang,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/162c485/math128a_w_ming_gu_or_math104_w_jikang_wang/,2023-08-26 17:52:01,"I've only taken Math53 and Math54, which of these two classes would be better suited / easier for me to take this semester?","My friends in math think that Math128A is cringe (especially with Gu).   
One of my peers who took Math104 said she suffered and barely passed because she hadn't taken the Math55 prereq.  
I would say both classes are feasible if you have enough time to study and go to office hours, but it would require a lot of extra time if you don't have Math 55. 128A is probably a little easier if you have coding experience, but they also require a group project if you take it during fall or spring. My math friends think the best order is Math 55 ‚Üí 110 ‚Üí 104 ‚Üí 185 ‚Üí 128a, but I've only taken 128a so I can't accurately say anything about the others.

I took Math W128A with Persson over summer, and I came in with Math53, 54, and E7, which were the suggested pre-reqs. However, my math 54 knowledge was shaky because I took it with Wehrheim over covid, and they covered eigenvalues in april when it should have been covered much earlier. I could have gotten an A- if I went to office hours, but I was too busy with other classes/research and ended up with a B.
Okay got it, thanks for the advice!"
Do NOT take a class with Ming Gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/m574qh/do_not_take_a_class_with_ming_gu/,2021-03-14 16:23:09,"Ive always seen people complaining about Math 54 with Ming Gu, saying he was not organized and overall just a terribly run class. 

I brushed it off, thinking an upper div would be better (usually upper div profs have their shit together, right???!?). Nope, Math 128A might just be the worst class I‚Äôve ever taken. There‚Äôs absolutely never any clarifications regarding any course logistics, the homework load is insane for NO reason and it‚Äôs ALL computation. It‚Äôs just mindless computation for hours and hours and I‚Äôd rather watch paint dry. We have a midterm coming up and no one has any idea what is going on. What‚Äôs worse is that there‚Äôs absolutely no communication from course staff, even after countless REASONABLE complaints on Piazza. 

it‚Äôs a shit show, the lectures are completely useless and his logic is incredibly hard to follow. On the other hand, if you love plug-and-chug computation and navigating an entire class by yourself, feel free to take it!","[deleted]
I took math 54 with him and second this definitely
Oh my god I took differential equations with this guy and he was such a bad lecturer. Good to know nothings changed :D
>I think 128a is plug-and-chug due to the nature of the subject. It's literally about the methods that computers use to plug-and-chug for good approximations of the exact answer. I prefer real analysis, but this aint real analysis :(

Except it's not you plugging and chugging, it should be about understanding. Not practicing using Matlab as a calculator. That's simple. I remember this class, it was a pain. 

By the way, he never graded our projects when I took it. Ever. And they were turned in half way into the semester.
If the ""plug and chug"" thing were true, then other Math 128A teachers like Persson have similar work... but he doesn't. Yes Numerical Analysis is about numerical methods, but the point is to understand how the methods work not slog away at tons of computation problems that are mostly about whether you can add or multiply. 

Another thing is they literally haven't graded even Quiz 2 yet.
Wait does it cover things we did on Thursday? I was under the impression it only covered up through the HW due tomorrow which doesn't cover 4.6.

Edit: based on the most recent announcement it seems it doesn't cover 4.6"
Ming Gu vs. David Nadler for Math 54?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g7c1so/ming_gu_vs_david_nadler_for_math_54/,2020-04-24 10:00:55,"I'm taking Math 54 this summer, and seats are open for 2 sessions (with Ming gu and Nadler). Who is the better option? The (amazing) ratings on ratemyprof for Nadler are from 2015; are they still true now? There are mixed reviews for Gu - I've heard that he's a terrible lecturer, and doesn't care about students; but I've also read that his exams are relatively easy. Which prof should I go with?

Edit:  I'm taking it in the summer, so LMAO Just realized that I'm gonna be taught by grad students. Nvm guys ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","I had Nadler for 54 in Fall 2017 and loved him! He was very clear, patient, organized, and precise. A very chill dude. I wouldn‚Äôt say his exams were easy, but not impossible, so they were fair. 

He also did his lectures writing on an iPad so no blazing through slides which I don‚Äôt like in math.
I had Ming Gu for 54‚Äîhis lectures are pretty bad, he has a fairly strong accent, and he writes the easiest exams I‚Äôve taken at Berkeley. Just know that in order to understand the material, you‚Äôll mostly have to learn it on your own or through section. He spends way too much time on the easy, mechanical stuff, and too little on the harder conceptual part of 54.
Ming Gu had pretty boring, difficult to follow lectures when I took him. But his exams are very easy. Like comically easy. I think the average for MT1 was 95%. And he seems like a really nice and very smart guy so I‚Äôm sure his OHs are worth attending (I was a dumb freshman and never went RIP).
Took Gu for 54, alongside the adjunct and got an A. But that‚Äôs mainly because of the adjunct. I wouldn‚Äôt take Gu again for any class to be honest.
Ming Gu is awesome dawg...just don't be an idiot
Yeah, Gu used PowerPoint slides all the time.
So Gu is a bad teacher but has easy tests? Is the tradeoff of bad lectures for easy exams worth it? I'm deciding between Gu and Nadler for the fall
Hello, I am taking his class rn and his teaching really makes me anxious lol

Would you recommend any online resource or useful youtube videos so that we can better prepare for his exam?

Thank you!
Sorry, but what's an adjunct?
Honestly, probably not if you‚Äôre in CS/math/stats/physics. Linear algebra comes up a LOT, and it‚Äôs very useful to have a deeper understanding of it, which you almost certainly will if you take it with someone else. You will probably get a better grade with Gu than you would with Nadler, but IMO you should go with Nadler. Gu‚Äôs lectures spend all the time on the least important stuff, and then skip over all the actually challenging conceptual meaning and understanding.
[Here‚Äôs a link to the SLC explaining it](https://slc.berkeley.edu/programs/mathematics-and-statistics/adjunct-courses)
Do you guys remember if Gu's practice exams are similar to his real ones?
Thanks!"
math 128a with Ming Gu?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j6l1i2/math_128a_with_ming_gu/,2020-10-06 22:10:02,has anyone taken math 128a with Ming Gu? how was his class in terms of workload and exam difficulty? I've only heard negative things about his teaching but if his workload/exams are easier I'm willing to take the risk and learn another way. thank you in advance!,I took math 54 with Ming Gu. Not recommended. The tradeoff for easy exams is steep. Lectures make little sense.
ming gu adjunct class for math 54,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ik2ls4/ming_gu_adjunct_class_for_math_54/,2020-08-31 10:39:21,Can explain what an adjunct class is and how i can enroll? I'm already having a hard time following Prof Gu's lectures.,"The adjunct class basically goes over the material again, but more focused and the instructor is (generally) a better lecturer. 

Branden teaches the 54 adjunct and is awesome. Taking the adjunct and doing all the work seriously basically guarantees you some type of A, at least that has been my experience with classes I did the adjunct for.

David Nadler or Ming Gu for Math 54 Fall 2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hn2f0z/david_nadler_or_ming_gu_for_math_54_fall_2020/,2020-07-07 13:28:50,"Hey guys,

With most math courses being moved to remote for Fall 2020, including Math 54, I was wondering who would be the better choice to take. I've heard Nadler is a better lecturer, even though his tests are harder, but if it's going to be online then I imagine a lot of it will be self-learning. With that in mind, would it be a better idea to take Gu instead? I've heard his exams and curves are easier, but he that is is a poor lecturer. Let me know what you guys think","Ming Gu not even a question
I see, thank you
I agree
Do you guys remember if Gu's practice exams are similar to his real ones
yeah theyre just as easy and straightforward as his practice exams"

Ming Gu is an awful lecturer and you will probably need to learn the material from the textbook if you take him. He does curve pretty generously though, or at least he did in Math 128A when I took him.
Really? I had him and thought he was delightful. The only thing I can think of that might be a turn off is he has a Chinese accent, but if you're an EECS major and can't understand Chinese/Indian/Eastern European accents, then RIP."
"Math 54, which prof?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/htlmb2/math_54_which_prof/,2020-07-18 11:37:20,"Ok incoming freshman here, pre-haas, maybe

We have two profs: Ming Gu or David Nadler

I've heard reviews that Nadler teachers the material better, however I'm worried about the curve since prob 90% of the people taking his course are EECS or CS making the curve not so generous. On the other hand, Ming Gu has exams that are apparently comparatively easier.

Thoughts?","‚Äúhowever I'm worried about the curve since prob 90% of the people taking his course are EECS or CS making the curve not so generous.‚Äù

Majority of EECS/CS students take the EECS16 series instead so I doubt there‚Äôll be many of them in 54

Edit: Also being EECS/intended CS doesn‚Äôt automatically make one a math wizard
I highly recommend Professor Nadler, he's widely considered to be one of the best Math 54 professors.
nadler
If your priority is an easy A, Ming Gu 100%. Not sure about Nadler's curve.
I had Ming Gu and he teaches by the book. You'll be doing a lot of self-learning and will 100% need to read the textbook. From what I heard from friends who took Nadler the same semester, his lectures/teaching style was easier to follow but his tests were definitely harder. It depends on your learning style!"
Which Math 54 professor should I pick?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hc6imt/which_math_54_professor_should_i_pick/,2020-06-19 11:57:11,"Incoming freshman, with the choice of taking Ming Gu or David Nadler. I've heard that Gu is not the best lecturer but has easy tests, whereas Nadler is a better lecturer but harder tests. Who do you guys recommend taking this fall?","You're already in 54, which means you've got some skillz. 

Go with the interesting guy and the harder tests. Make yourself smarter. 

The harder you work, the smarter you will become. 

That's the college secret, whether at UCB or Podunk CC.
I took 54 with Gu last spring and while the exams were easy (our first midterm had an average of 92), if you‚Äôre at all interested in linear algebra I would recommend taking it with someone else. He teaches in a very dry manner, showing you ‚Äúthis is how we do this‚Äù without much explanation or any of the value you normally get from Berkeley professors. 

Also this may have been a one time thing, but he was also very disorganized. Grades were submitted 2 weeks late with no communication (piazza was vaguely concerned that he had died and no one knew) and then they were incorrect for some students when they did get submitted. 

So, long story short, I really cannot recommend you take 54 with Gu.
You basically summed it up in your question. It's up to your preference. If you're still not sure maybe look at their different syllabi on tbp. I'm taking it with nadler because the schedule worked better for me.
I had Gu and my experience was as you described. His lectures were honestly really terrible haha, learned entirely from friends, Youtube, and the textbook. The textbook is great though so you'll learn a lot just by reading it and doing the problem sets he assigns. I didn't have any trouble with linear algebra in CS 189 so I guess that means Gu teaches you what you need to know, despite the easy tests
+1, your success in upper division courses will thank you for understanding linear algebra well
Do you remember if Gu's practice exams are similar to his real ones?
[deleted]
The practice exams he gave us were very similar. If I remember correctly (from two years ago),both the practice and real exams were 5 questions, first one was generic computation, last one was a slightly complicated proof, things like that are the same. However I wouldn‚Äôt say that the topics on the exam were exactly the same as the topics on the practice - it‚Äôs more the format that‚Äôs the same.
Nah, just come for logistics on Day 1 and dip for the rest of the semester lol. 3Brown1Blue (or was is 3Blue1Brown?) is an excellent YouTube series on linear algebra. Highly recommend, and most GSI's recommended it too.
Alright, thanks for the information. It's gonna be 7 questions for us because we have 90-100 minutes for exams now. I'm just hoping difficulty wise it's similar, and lmao the proofs kinda give me a headache. The rest are fine though. Good to know"
Best Math 54 Professor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4kj67g/best_math_54_professor/,2016-05-22 09:10:11,"This fall 3 professors are teaching Math 54 -- Ming Gu, Nikhil Srivastava, and Lin Lin. Gu has terrible ratings on ratemyprofessor so I think I'll try to avoid him, but Srivastava and Lin have hardly any ratings if any at all. Who would you take?","If neither of them have good ratings, why not attend both of their lectures for the first week or so and decide which has the better teaching style for you?
I recommend taking the class with the understanding that you will learn only from the textbook. With that in mind, choose the professor with the kindest tests.
I'm taking it with Srivastava personally but I got stuck with an 8 AM discussion RIP :(
Don't know about these other professors but can confirm Gu sucks. Lectures would be more clear if he just did them in Chinese.
Doesn't matter. Try to take the supplemental class if they offer it. If Bon-Soon is still around, you will likely get an A in that class if you put in the effort. He's the best math teacher I've had at Berkeley, not sure if he's still around though..
I've heard many good things about Srivastava's teaching. Also I've met him and he's a really nice guy as well as insightful and good at explaining things.
Lin is a little hard to understand. Srivastava taught Math 55 this past semester and I heard good things about him.
Anyone have any experience with Vojta (H54)?
Sahai, EE 16A
Didn't know you could do this but I'll probably try it out.
So basically I should go into it assuming that I will learn almost everything from the textbook... because the professors are all bad?
What do you think of Srivastava? (if you're currently in his class)
Homework instructions unclear. Accidentally learned Chinese.
Can you explain the supplemental class more?
I had Vojta for H113 last semester. He is a bit dry and mostly follows the book, and he may seem unapproachable or boring. But he is very clear, has excellent and organized boardwork, and gives fair tests. He promptly posts all the homework material and exam information online. Also, his curve was nicer than I expected.

Maybe you can go to the first few classes and see if you like his teaching style.
Not because professors are bad, but learning math from a lecture is like trying to learn to swim from youtube videos. 
I mean that's not the worst takeaway
I believe they labeled it as Math 98 - Adjunct (like most other supplemental classes). There is typically very limited space in the class, I think we had about 20-25 for a full size Math 54 class.

Bon-Soon is a legend. The guy absolutely lives math, yes lives. He has an uncanny ability to make the material fun and understandable despite his corny jokes. We had practice midterms and tests to go along with our class. By the midway point of the semester, I had stopped going to actual lecture and just went to 98 with Bon-Soon.

Just checked and he has since moved on.. to UCLA of all places. Either way, look to take the adjunct class if possible. Easier to learn in a smaller environment than the massive Dwinelle classes."

Also for adjunct classes do you have to go to every lecture, or can you go whenever you want?

Thanks, and go bears!","Typically you can only take an adjunct course if it is offered alongside your professor's course, so yes, if you are not in Nadler's class you generally would not be able to take the adjunct.

i'm in 54 with him rn and you can go to tbp to see his previous exams. They're very similar to the practice exam but a few test upto 4.2-4.3, while this one will only cover upto 4.1
I see, that's good to know. Hope that continues for this year. I appreciate the information
Yeah but the practice exam is longer and a bit tougher than his prior exams, I'm just hoping there's no last second surprises or anything.
is it though? I thought it was easier
