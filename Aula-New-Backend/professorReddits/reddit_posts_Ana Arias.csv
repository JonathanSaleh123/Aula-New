How are Mimi Lustig and Ana Arias for EE16A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/o0th16/how_are_mimi_lustig_and_ana_arias_for_ee16a/,2021-06-15 18:22:39,,"Miki is really passionate and cares for students. His lecture style was a bit hand wavy in 16B. He talked a lot about cool applications of the material but not really the nuances that we would be tested on. He would go through a basic example then real world stuff essentially. Overall he’s been one of my favorite professors
Miki Lustig*
I had Prof. Arias for EE 134 (the photovoltaics class) this past semester –– I thought she was okay. She clearly loved the topic and was knowledgeable about the contemporary research, though the class structure was clunky at times. The most noticeable shortcoming was the disparity between lecture and homeworks/exams, as well as discrepancies between her own expectations and what we could realistically accomplish as students in the class.

Since this Fall will be her first time teaching 16A, I'm interested to see how she'll teach such a large class, since she usually teaches smaller EE upper-divs (EE 134 and 143 mainly).
Miki is one of the most beloved EECS professors at Berkeley
ive heard great things about miki
Does he at least give u hw on what you’ll be tested on? Or is there just a bunch of guesswork on what’s on the test
the homework for 16a is usually the same and very straightforward for 16a, dwai, it's a chill class as long as u remember algebra and systems of equations (half the class is doing gaussian elimination, and the 2nd half is doing voltage divider circuits and opamp golden rules in 16a)
I mean the hw is difficult and test like but again it was 16b and the tests were very odd as it was virtual and fully multiple choice which was not the norm"
Best Way to study for EECS16A M1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/syh3zz/best_way_to_study_for_eecs16a_m1/,2022-02-21 23:02:03,"Hi, the EECS16A Midterm 1 is in a week and I am wondering if anyone from past years can offer some advice on how do well on the exams. The instructors this semester are Michael Lustig and Ana Arias. I haven't read the notes thoroughly, but I understand the content for the most part. Should I do as many practice exams as possible or focus more on the content or both? Thank you!","Practice exams are almost always the best thing to do. Then restudy the material that you didn’t know as well
seconding this, i did not do nearly enough practice exams for 16a and it came back to bite me LOL
how do you think the mts compared to the hw?"
Spring 2022 Schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q5koes/spring_2022_schedule/,2021-10-10 17:51:09,"So I'm taking CS 61B (w Hilfinger) and an R5B Class next semester and I'm trying to decide which other class/classes to take 

I'm still not entirely sure what major I'm gonna declare but I'm thinking either MCB + Data Science double major or CS major + BioE minor

For my third class, I'm trying to decide between

* Chem 3A + 3AL (no idea who's taking it yet)
* EECS 16A (Ana Claudia Arias, Miki Lustig) 

and then maybe Data 8 as my fourth class (I'm  thinking of doing Data 100 later) or I might just do 61B + R5B + Class 3 + a decal

Also idk what to Phase 1 and Phase 2, any suggestions? ty",61B should be your Phase 2
