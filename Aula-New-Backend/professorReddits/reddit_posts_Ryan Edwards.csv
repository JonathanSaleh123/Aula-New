Should I Delay Declaring Econ for Ryan Edwards.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ctja5r/should_i_delay_declaring_econ_for_ryan_edwards/,2024-05-16 11:02:05,"hi y'all so i'm planning to double-major in polsci and econ! it seems like the general consensus is that everyone enjoyed econ 140 (a prereq for declaring econ) with ryan edwards...his class is closed now for fall 2024 but i was wondering if i should wait until fall 2025 to take econ 140 with him (for reference i just finished my freshman year), since i'll declare polisci in the fall and will just be focusing on clearing upperdivs for it thru spring 2025. should i wait or should i just rip it with the other profs (i'm trying to protect my gpa for law school)","It really depends; there's no guarantee that Edwards will be teaching 140 in Fall 2025. I'd recommend avoiding taking 140 with Bianchi. Since you're only a rising sophomore, I think you can afford to wait and see.
You should hold off econ 140 as long as you can (ideally take it senior fall so you can take it with prof Edwards) if your goal is law school.

I recommend taking econ 100A as your first upper div core class because (at least from my experience) it opens you up to taking the majority of econ upper div electives
I personally would not delay your education for the chance to have a certain professor. On a related note, I had Bianchi for Econ 139 and thought he was fine. You should not live your life being scared of a class/prof.
I cannot understand why anyone would wait for him. He’s a nice guy, but you won’t learn very rigorous econometrics. Anyways, All profs for 140 are easy nowadays from my understanding except for bianchi."
Has anyone taken Ryan Edwards' Econ 140 in the regular semester?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12e47q6/has_anyone_taken_ryan_edwards_econ_140_in_the/,2023-04-06 17:56:44,"How about the workload and difficulty of this course? (Compared to Jim Combell's Econ 100A, ECON 119,  ECON 121, or other easy econ upper courses ).","Extremely low and easy workload, 4 problem sets that take no more than 1-2 hours each, a mini project that has very clear rubrics, a midterm and a final.

Data 100 + Data 140 Bad idea?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1awojir/data_100_data_140_bad_idea/,2024-02-21 13:52:41,"Im a econ/ds double major, and for next semester I want to take data 100 with data 140. I don't know if it will be too hard, but I'm also in a time crunch since I will be a senior next semester and I don't want to stay an extra semester. On top of these two, I hope to take 2 easy Econ electives with Ryan Edwards. Rn im doing 61b and I'm finding it to be pretty hard. Is this workload too much? ","Data 100 workload is comparable to CS 61B but slightly lower.
Data 140 is undoubtedly one of the hardest classes so if you find 61B conceptually hard then 140 is much harder imo
Data 100 was light work so I think you can do it
i’m doing it rn! early days but it’s all right
On the exact same boat but am also considering something like Econ 101A + econ elective instead of two easy econ elective. I'm taking 61B, C88S and 54 and have taken 61A and C8.
In general, it's doable, but it's a lot of work.

Data 100 is a medium level difficulty class but i think its super chill if you stay with the material-- none of the projects or assignments are super hard and there is a good gsi team. However, Data 140 is hard-- it's a common experience that people who take this class end up spending most of the semester dedicated to the hw/going to OH (which is crowded). Its a very intense class in the sense that it requires a lot of your time. But i still really enjoyed the course even though it was v hard.

Overall it's up to what you think you can handle / have you had experience in a demanding class.
do you think it'd be a better idea to take Data 100 with a slightly easier probability course then? Like maybe Indeng 172?
It’s really depends on what you want to do with your degree. Data 140 prep you better for future stat classes like STAT 135, IEOR 165, Data 102 or AI / ML related. I think Data 140 lectures and homework are well organized and better structured in term of resources. In the other hand, IEOR 172 will give you more room to adjust comparing to other counterparts but idk how well organize the class will be."

Oh yea I did lol
how was it? currently enrolled and wondering about exams, the essay, and coding on R. Any tips or advice would help! thank you
The syllabus we used might be different from now because I took the class during the covid. But the exam was like a quiz and every exam/quiz/ps could be found on online or quizlet just with a different number. Essay should be easy— econ class essays dont expect too much.

Someone you may have run into at a bar or who generally seems to support student engagement and entertainment. This is for an interview hopefully so please let me know if anyone comes to mind.,"Professor Darren Zook!!!
Filippenko in the astronomy department (seriously an intellectual and comedic powerhouse) and Landreth in the English department (he’s so funny and his interpretations of literature are so beautiful and entertaining to hear)
Professor Lowhorn
[deleted]
I really loved Professor Beatty (he was my professor for MCB 50 and 55). He was really energetic and sassy. I also loved Professor Gibbs (she taught the second third of Bio 1A - she does it in the spring). She was teaching challenging material, but she was practically jumping around Pimentel Hall at 8 am.
For me it’s Professor Lowman he’s just so sassy in class and laughs at the chat’s chaos lmao
unpopular opinion but Shobhana Stoyanov in stats was hilarious lol, she also cared way more about her students than most professors I had during my time at Cal.
James Campbell!! Literally ran into him at a bar during dead week!!
Pete Marsden for sure
\[Disclaimer: 20 years ago, but I think he might still be around\]

Prof. Wenk in Geology.

Back in my day he organized week-long field trips out to the desert. The trip was a whole upper div course. Hiking and sightseeing all day. Every night camping with steaks and things on the campfire.

I can't recall if there was beer, but it was 20 years ago so probably.

Best class I ever took. Awesome dude.

I think we all got an A too.
Josh Hug. He has a really cool taste in music (Aphex Twin, Melt Banana).
Prof. Adhikari fs 8)
djordje popovic!!!!
Daniel Neumark 

He’s like…cranky AF and salty to the core.  He has the sense of humor you might expect from the captain of a crab fishing ship during a snow storm in the Arctic circle.  He’s constantly on the edge of being really pissed off but he’s just polite enough to make wry jokes at nobody’s expense.  

Also Udi Isacoff is a real treat if you’re ever taking any neuro courses.
John Arnold for gen chem!
Professor Hilfinger 🌚
Lynn Huntsinger. Rangeland Ecology professor. She came to UC Forestry camp and at the end of her guest lecture week took out all the of-age students to the local dive bar. She is seriously a hoot.
Norman Sheu
Dan Garcia for sure
[deleted]
I love Bill White’s classes in Anthro but I’m not sure if he is teaching next semester
Norman Sheu, his lectures are great and he is a very fun person once you get to know him.
darren zook!
professor lawerence cohen, he teaches medical anthropology
Charles briggs anthro
prof firestone & prof ball!
Davina Chan she’s the best prof I’ve ever had in my life she really changed my outlook on life, besides all the academic stuff she taught me how to live life outside of school, she taught me things that I apply in my life daily. Will forever have such respect and appreciation for her.
Jim Campbell, Jean Ahn, Peter Bartou
Alex Craghead
Dan Garcia so far
61C with Garcia
my goat anant sahai
Shawn Chi

Professor Landreth in the English dept. That guy's a hoot!
Jerome Baggett, Sociology dept
Paul Fine

jrs, man of duality
Jean Ahn
Ryan Edwards
might be a niche class but Professor Ben Hammed for COMLIT 100A
Either Dr. Mardsen, Dr. Lowhorn, or Professor Ball
Prof. John Kaiser, Sociology is awesome! Definitely seems like he knows how to have fun and how to chill
I'm a such a stan for Zook!!!
was gonna say this but i knew someone would have already commented lmao
He’s the best!
I'm with you there! He's so energetic and goofy!
Fr
lowhorn makes physics tolerable <3
Big ups to the 61c legend
yes yes yes
Also, I can't forget Dr. Shusterman from Chem 1A! She was absolutely legendary!
Loved Beatty omg
Agree ^^
I was going to say him as well. I’d love to get a beer with him. He was always fun in lecture, and seemed to really care about his students. I’m sure he would be amazing to hang out with outside of the school setting. Also, Jeremy Sanchez who is in the Stats department. He always seemed down to earth and like he’d be cool to hang out with. I hated Stat 20, but loved him as a teacher!
is that the philosophy one?
I second this. I had 2 classes with him and he was so fun!
duuuude he’s so chill
The goat himself
Spot on description! I like Neumark a lot- some of us can appreciate the curmudgeonly among us for their honesty and refusal to put on airs, if nothing else.
This has to be a joke
I love how he teaches he’s such an amazing prof
I took his folklore class to fulfill a req and it was one of my favorite classes I took at Cal!
which Lyapunov function u used to show convergence?

Classes / professors that you enjoyed just sitting and listening to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17b3ntp/classes_professors_that_you_enjoyed_just_sitting/,2023-10-18 15:44:51,"For example, a few:

**Drugs and the Brain - David Presti**

**GEOG10AC (Worldings: Regions, Peoples and States) - Jon Kosek**

These were classes where most lectures I could just sit and enjoy the fascinating lecture delivered by a great and engaging speaker. Anyone have any other recommendations?","Davina Chan - Neuropsychology of Happiness  
She is an amazing professor and you can tell she loves teaching. Her slides are very detailed so there isn't any need to take notes, you can just sit in class and enjoy. That class transformed my life for real because of who the professor was, and it is the best class I've taken at Cal. I may not have believed in the power of mindfulness and meditation if it wasn't for the knowledge this class empowered me with.

&#x200B;

John Campbell - Philosophy of Mind.

I kind of think of his lectures like listening to a very interesting podcast and each week is a different episode of the general topic of philosophy of mind. He is Scottish so the way he speaks is very engaging, funny, and extremely knowledgable. You don't even need to take notes for the class, slides have minimal information because he mostly just wants to invite the class to have a discussion during lecture. It does help to do the readings of the week during the week as you go.  
The class explores free will and determinism through the compatibilist and incompatibilist views (Benjamin Libet), what we can say about moral responsibility and free will through first-order and second-order desires (Harry Frankfurt), the way we imagine transformative experiences (Laurie Paul), Locke's claim that what makes a person the same person over time is the psychological continuity of memory and consciousness, Descartes on the soul, functionalism, qualia, etc. He really brings you up to speed on the state-of-the-art literature on where the mind body problem is.
Anything by Laleh Behbehanian
John Campbell for PHILOS 3A he’s such an awesome guy you just can’t help but love him
Any class with Zook! I was a poli sci major with 0 interest in international relations, but I took every class I could with Zook and loved all of them!
Asad Ahmed - melc 180 or melc 146. Theres no hw, just two essays and the midterm and final. Great courses if you are interested in studying religion. His voice is calming as well.
Ryan Edwards
global 173 - darren zook
also i loved charles Marshall’s section of bio 1b but it is very content heavy
UGAB 192-T, Edible Education with Professor Will Rosenzweig. Great class!
Paulin Math 54
SOCIOL113AC with Professor Hurtubise. A really well spoken and inspirational man! After every lecture, the majority of the class applauded him (at least when I took it this summer). Highly recommend!

Right now I'm enrolled in the class because I think it will be a double whammy with the upper div technical req and my social behavioral req for l&s. I'm now thinking my schedule will be very high workload if I have to catch up with any econ (for reference, I'm also taking cs182, cs161, and DataC104 next sem). Is this death? Should I just take a lower div econ class instead? If it adds to anything I'm familiar with Lin Alg, Calc, and Stats from the upper division classes I've taken so far. Any help is appreciated!","Don’t take 100B with your current schedule
This is absolutely death. Econ 100B is notoriously one of the most difficult Econ classes (Econ 140/141 is the worst). That topped with CS and Data science classes is a kiss of death.
I’m an intended Econ major who has taken a bunch of Econ lower divis classes, and I just finished 100B. The class kicked my ass. It was the most difficult Econ class I’ve taken so far. (I’ve also have taken stats and up to calculus 3). It was a bunch of formulas that had to be memorized and applied to various economic situations. Plus the derivations. Those made me want to cry when I first encountered them. I learned a lot and ended the semester strong, but it seriously made me question my major at first. If you love math and application of formulas, maybe it won’t be as bad, but I would recommend taking at least one lower divis Econ course first.
I did 101b with no prior Econ experience and it was chill
Why would you choose to take an upper division class (and one that is a core requirement for several majors at that) without any prior background? If it's just for breadth and an upper div tech req't, choose something else, especially something that won't have everyone enrolled competing for a high grade to get in to a competitive major....
duly noted. Is there a light econ class I can take, or should I just keep it at the 3 classes I currently have? I want to take an econ class, but yeah admittingly the schedule does look pretty hard.
Econ 140 was pretty chill this semester with Ryan Edwards
if i've only taken ap econ in high school (5's), would you say that taking 100b is doable?

PLS HELP","Anything with Ryan Edwards
Copy-pasted from my course recommendation doc compiled from Past Reddit posts. They may not be easy courses, but it is worth checking out:

**Econ 110: Game Theory (very popular!)**  
 • “logic-based” in between math and social science  
 • How models of strategic behavior are used in both econ and poli sci.  


**Econ 119: Psych and Econ (Social science based)**  
 • Intro to behavioral economics.  
 • Berkeley is one of the foremost departments in this field.  
 • Psychology has been missing from Econ for a while now (since Keynes wrote his General Theory of Employment)  
 • Behavioral Economics is probably one of the fastest developing subsets of economics at the moment.  


**Econ 121: Industrial Org Economics**  
 • All about imperfect competition and market power  
 • Prof. Edlin is a lot of fun, highly recommend  


**Econ 133: Global Inequalities (Social science)**  


**Econ 134**  
 • Be sure you've completed econometrics before taking it.  
 • Prof. Nakamura: she's a great lecturer and economist in her own right.  
 • If you can learn how to read/interpret regression tables, you should get through the vast majority of the class, but this may change for later iterations.  


**Econ 136 (very popular!) (Finance and business, math)**  


**Economics 138: Financial and Behavioral Economics (blend of psych, econ, and 136)**  


**Econ 140: Econometrics (basically STAT 88 with an Economics twist)**  
 • Earlier is better than later as many Econ classes have added or are in the process of adding metrics to their prerequisites.  
 • Many Econ courses are adding metrics of a pre-req to combat people taking it as late as possible.  
 • Prof. Bianchi: the class was hard but certainly not impossible (I would compare it to some of the harder lower division statistics/math courses)  
 • The learning curve is fairly steep as you'll be forced to use Stata on top of the course material  
 • Econ 140 is the most important economics class you'll take as an undergraduate, so figure out a semester that has a chill workload, buckle in, and grind through it.  


**ECON 171**
Econ 157 was pretty easy
I have shared some useful information over the chats that can help you with any problems you face with ECON classes !
Hey! How would u rate econ 171 on difficulty (1-10)?
Hey, I’m taking that class with Edwards right now — do you have any tips on what to study for his exams or how difficult they are, both for his essay and the main portion of the exam? We have some long form problem sets but I can’t gauge whether his exams are also formatted in that way and if they have a lot of math.

Maybe you are just more econometrically inclined, I felt that Econ 140 was the easiest Econ technical I’ve taken, just really like the subject matter.
Who's teaching it this sem? I took it with Prof Bianchi and actually really enjoyed it( was scared initially cuz ppl were saying how bad this class is). Overall very doable even without prior stats knowledge:)

Has anyone taken Econ C175 with Joshua Goldstein?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kxlc11/has_anyone_taken_econ_c175_with_joshua_goldstein/,2021-01-14 18:52:14,Seems like an interesting class (economic demography) but his RMP ratings are shitty and I don't need to deal with an awful professor when my other econ elective choices have better professors. Shame as the topic seems interesting :/,"For future students:

I'm taking it with Goldstein right now. He is a good lecturer, very easy to listen to, incorporates the audience, etc. I've asked him questions after class and he is a pretty nice guy. Not sure why he has bad ratings, I very much enjoy this class.
I took it with Ryan Edwards and really liked the course mainly for its material. I feel like it wouldn't be super professor-dependent, but I'm not sure.
Also wondering this. The Berkeleytime distribution isn't stellar as well, but I really want to take the course because it seems interesting!
How was the workload/exams?
Workload was totally fine, there was a weekly lab which I gave myself ~3 hours before the deadline to do, and still got a B+ on most of them lol. If you just start a little earlier and ask gsis stuff, then it’s very doable to get an A.

Exams aren’t too bad. I only went to lecture, didn’t study very much, and got a B+ on most of them.

If you’re unhappy with a B+, consider the fact that you can PNP the class. That’s what I did. I’d much rather take a cool class and PNP it than take a stupid boring class for a grade."
