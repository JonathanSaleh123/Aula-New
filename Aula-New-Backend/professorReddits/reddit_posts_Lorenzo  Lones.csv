Class Schedule Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17hdr7j/class_schedule_advice/,2023-10-26 19:48:58,"Is this a doable course-load: Physics 8A with Golightly, Bio 1A with Jennifer Doudna, Karine Gibbs, and Lorenzo Lones, Bio1AL with Lorenzo Lones, and Math 1B with Paulin? Also would appreciate any advice for the courses. ","Yeah probably doable, but each class will take time. It will be better if you've taken AP Calc, AP Bio, or AP Physics in highschool, but still doable if not. If these are your classes, don't add any more. Paulin is great for math1b. I can't speak for the others. You'll need to be on top of it because at the least, math 1b and physics will probably have assignments due on friday nights that are not easy!
Yes but be prepared for lots of mental breakdowns lol. Bio 1a and Physics 8a doesn’t have a lot of homework but you do have to do a lot of studying outside of lecture in order to understand the material. Math 1b is doable if you keep up with lectures. Goodluck!
I would be cautious, as someone who took that schedule. I recommend taking Bio 1A with Chem 3B for a lot of reasons, so depending where you are i would maybe take just physics math idk
I've already taken Chem 3B. How was your experience with this schedule and do you have any advice about how to manage it?"
How many courses do you recommend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14wf174/how_many_courses_do_you_recommend/,2023-07-10 20:06:55,"Hello, I am an incoming freshmen and am currently taking two courses during the summer session.

This is my planned fall semester courses! Since I am an international student, I have to take min 13 credits. Should I take more courses? Is this okay?

Thank you

hey! this is a tough schedule as it is, so I wouldn’t suggest piling on anymore. Beware - Bio 1A and Chem 3A together is quite hard, but if you have a very strong chemistry foundation you can do well!
You’re gonna be RUNNING from pimental to li ka shing

man me personally I can't do it haha"
Bio 1A sections locked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17hjbbi/bio_1a_sections_locked/,2023-10-27 02:01:45,"Why are all but one of the sections locked?

Need to include biology 1AL in the selection. That’s what is stated in the Class Notes section for biology 1A in classes.Berkeley.edu

And phase 1 is for students with 3 terms completed."
