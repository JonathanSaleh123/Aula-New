Rant: this school is too expensive to be this trash,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1atnexd/rant_this_school_is_too_expensive_to_be_this_trash/,2024-02-17 22:18:49,"There‚Äôs never any places to sit, study, eat anything without the constant horde of students. I can‚Äôt even get an appointment with a counselor because they‚Äôre literally ALWAYS booked. The WiFi hasn‚Äôt worked consistently in weeks. The bathrooms are constantly disgusting, there‚Äôs literally not enough of them to accommodate the amount of students here. Same for the libraries, dining halls, fucking classes. The GYM!?! And on top of that students have to constantly worry about their safety and learn about things like shootings from social media because we don‚Äôt get warned until hours later? The elevator in my building hasn‚Äôt worked since Jan 15?? I‚Äôm losing my goddamn mind. I can‚Äôt even do the bare minimum and study because THERES NO FUCKING WIFI!! I already pay 40k a year to come here and now I have to buy a shitty $6 latte every day just so I can use their shitty free WiFi even tho I already paid the school to have those amenities?? wtf is going on. Who can I write to, who can we sue, how do we solve this problem?? There‚Äôs already so many issues that are directly linked the school not being able to accommodate the number of students here and now they‚Äôre about to enroll MORE??? This is unreal. What do we do guys, real talk.","go bears
This campus was built for a few thousand students.  It has not been built for the 40K+ students,faculty, staff, and guests at any time.

I genuinely feel this to my core. I pay an obscene rent in an old building where the singular coin-operated washing machine doesn‚Äôt even properly clean clothes. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on anymore
Absolutely. The university is over enrolling and it's turning the entire school and the area to a shit show.
For comparison:

Stanford campus is literally 8X bigger than Berkeley with the number of students admitted capped at less than half (20k) what is here today (46k). We were and still are being packed tight like Sardines (relatively speaking).

In my day ('75 and 30k), we had lower division courses in 300-500 seat lecture halls, which were filled to overflow, not sure if the lecture halls are much bigger today (please advise).  I think it's about the same, no?

There was no WiFi, but there were IBM punch cards and long lines in the basement of Evans to get them punched and into the one campus mainframe, and 30 minutes to get an output. That was pretty rough for a few classes that assigned computer homework.  Today with everything online, you need working WiFi, can't imagine why that is an issue other than fuddle.  From a strict engineering POV, there's zero issue.

In upper division, class sizes dropped to 20 give or take depending on major.  I just Googled and that figure has not budged (please advise).

Coffee and a bagel was about $3 as I recall, mostly for the bagel, which was a sticker shock but it was Peets and fresh baked.  That was an upgrade from instant and a slice of Wonderbread toast at home.

One huge difference is/was tuition.  Immediately post-Reagan it increased over three years from $150/qtr when I started to almost $250 (as I recall).  But it was possible to get a part time job on campus and pay both tuition and buy a couple books.  I was a BART commuter so can't comment on housing costs.
Sadly I hear this complaint from many students at large flagship public universities. I hear similar complaints of too many students and too few resources from friends who went to UCLA and UNC Chapel Hill. 

UCB has so many brilliant students but they should really limit enrollment if they cannot accommodate all their undergrads and grad students. 

If there are no resources you may wonder if the prestige of going to a upper tier UC is even worth it.

In general, Cal just has a very hard time expanding its facility under the current political atmosphere. This is more or less a widespread phenomenon throughout the entire nation‚Äôs blue states, bar a few places like New Jersey. 

I would even go as far as to say that this is a widespread problem that hurts the entire Anglosphere‚Äôs left-leaning areas

When Cal tried to bulldoze people‚Äôs park, you can see on Instagram Live that there were people from Australia (who probably never even set foot in Berkeley at all) says they were in solidarity with the park and yada yada, when students who actually live in the city suffer from lots of QoL issues and decaying infrastructure. The hypocrisy makes my brain hurt so much it is spinning
School needs money since state funding has been dropping since Reagan was governor. So it enrolls more students then it can and raises tuition. But now it has too many students so it needs to build new stuff (like the new transfer housing, called Anchor House, they are building). But in order to get more money the school needs more students and now we‚Äôre back at the beginning. It‚Äôs a never-ending loop of pain and suffering.
UCLA is the same. Overcrowded and that was 30 years ago.
i suggest you get some rest
with moffitt closing for renovation, ig its only down from here too
So sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Hang in there.
I went to Berkeley 2006-2010 and it was already like this. Granted, tuition was lower. But it‚Äôs unfortunately an expected issue with going to a public school that doesn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt build out facilities and keeps enrolling more students.
Wow! Is this just a Berkeley problem or is this typical of large public universities? It adds an additional element to the ongoing debate about whether an private school should even be a consideration for people in states with well-respected public universities. Most people tend to discuss the academic offerings, student outcomes, academic reputation, etc. After reading this post, it seems that people should consider the quality of the everyday experience and the impact of state politics as well.

Wi-Fi here is about as reliable as a fortune cookie predicting your future.
Living in Cali is a blessing and a curse because we‚Äôre one of like four states with halfway-decent public schools but our population is so high that that slimy mf that we call a Governor decides to somehow throttle both quality and acceptance rate to meet demand
Our dorm didn‚Äôt have hot water for the entire day.
Your options for recourse are limited, but you could transfer potentially. This post and others like it will help dissuade high school grads from choosing Berkeley and eventually it will self correct (hopefully). 

You should also realize that what you're actually paying for is being able to write ""UC Berkeley"" on your resume. That's essentially all the value you actually get, and it will definitely be of high value when your job hunt starts.
Classes also too big‚Ä¶. You have not mentioned that.
One thing to remember: the power of Berkeley on your resume. As a former ucsc grad that did post grad classes at Berkeley, the way people would act and want to call me a ‚ÄúBerkeley graduate‚Äù in the workforce was wild. Literally from only listing chem e classes I took on my resumeüòÖ

What you are experiencing sucks. But you‚Äôll have the highest return on your career compared to most other UC grads. Hope it gets better ‚ô•Ô∏è
It‚Äôll get worse
Idiots really enjoy downvoting the fact.
I think there are lots of solutions/things we could be doing. Here are a couple:

1. (for CoL) Accelerate the ongoing housing projects to meet demand. I think people's park housing will be one important step, but we will need a lot of housing to really see cost go down.
2. (for enrollment) A new UC campus in northern California. I do not know where it could go, and many student like Berkeley for its closeness to SF, but this is a pretty good idea imo. 
3. (for resources) Advocate for more state funding? I don't think the amount the state funds UC is a whole lot. Federal funding is also crucial, but that is an even bigger beast to tackle. Also, maybe accrue funding to do the important seismic retrofitting work in Berkeley
4. (for QoL) Advocate in general for better housing policies in dense urban areas in California. Public transportation too. Cherry on top dismantle Prop 13
5. (for space) make the campus bigger idk. I don't think this is totally impossible but I know you would be asking for a fight with the CEQA homeowner people
6. (best solution) annex Stanford

In any case, it's really a matter of money + evidence-driven solutions
But what about how nightmarish the RSF situation it? We need like 4 RSF level facilities for this pop
I'm a prospective transfer student. This is why I only applied to CSUs and Privates. Sorry, but large publics, especially, are catered for research and graduate studies. The undergraduate experience is WAY better elsewhere.
How is the quality of education?  All things being equal, would you still choose UC Berkeley for undergrad? Or perhaps another school?
when I was a student they banned me from the WiFi for torrenting and I had to use mobile data for an entire year lol
But at least we can afford 25 diversity officers!
This is Cal sadly. It's not going to improve quickly. The school is overcrowded due to a lack/mismanagement of investment. Try the Berkeley Central Public Library. The wifi should be better and free just pay attention because the public library can be sketchy.
Tuition strike soon üëÄ?
A lot of the CSU's campus is better than Berkeley ngl. SJSU's one and only library is better than all of our libraries, and their student union feels like the size of Dwinelle. It'd be nice if a little of the money can be used in student accommodations.
I‚Äôm sure there are many less unfortunate ones who would love to have our first-world problems.
lol well...shoulda been an EECS or CS student.  you get 24hr keycard access and there's plenty of places to lounge/work/study/hangout.  at least that's how it was when i went there. 

edit: keycard access you have to pay per semester, but it is worth it :)
4 critiques I'll point out on your post: 1) tuition isn't $40k/yr for most students, it's $15k/yr, which is in line with most public universities. So, for most students, they don't feel like they're paying a premium to be here since it's the same as any other UC or most other public universities. 2) You don't need to buy $6 lattes; go make a $0.50 coffee at home and then go use the wi-fi at the coffee shop (finish your coffee before entering, though). They're not paid enough to give a shit. Paying $6 for coffee is absolutely insane, I don't know how millennials and my fellow Gen Zers can possibly justify spending $6 on a coffee. 3) When you point out how crowded a place is that you're literally at, you're part of the people making it crowded. It's not like they're some separate entity making it crowded, and you're the one who has to suffer. You're as much of the crowding problem as any other student. You're not special. 4) Did you not do extensive research into what UC Berkeley is like before applying and deciding to go here? Why is any of this a surprise? I understand if some of the nuances are surprising, but most of your gripes with the school could have been pretty much realized through some background research.
I agree. Wish I wasn‚Äôt so dumb as a highschooler so I could get accepted into an Ivy League üò≠
the radical left west coast is a modern dystopia
The neurotic politics here makes it hard to make things function properly, which shouldn‚Äôt be a moonshot in any sense
If these young milleniums stopped splurging on their daily $6 lattes they could afford the yearly tuition. Back in my day we used to have to work to earn our degree, these days they just print it for you.

we literally pay the same amount as every other UC? what‚Äôs the problem

Welcome to college
That's what you get for coming as a nonresident to a public school
And people still wonder why I chose ucla over Berkeley‚Ä¶ 
In all seriousness though it is unacceptable that the administration is treating you this way. Tbh a lot of lower level workers really don‚Äôt know much so I would advise demanding speaking to someone higher up (say for ur dorm building and wifi). Although tbh idk how much the wifi can be fixed as ucla has wifi issues too but it may be just because the buildings on both campus are old and make it harder to connect/spotty
You are paying 40k a year or your parents?
Complaining, complaining
It wouldn‚Äôt be college without a lot of complaining. Always has been. Always will be. This is the way.
You wanted to take your snobby liberal ass to Berkeley tho!
Also, Cal kids in my humble opinion, most often say to each other, at least on Reddit, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre good enough to get into Cal, such that _____ fill in the blank‚Äô as if such a generic quantitative measure means something special.
A few more!  As students you share your public spaces  with an unpredictable crowd of people, some of which desperately need mental health assistance and may be unstable.  I also heard that the all-women‚Äôs dorm has mold
Yeah I chose Berkeley over cmu and sometimes I do question my decision, esp because I‚Äôm an international and therefore pay roughly the same amount of money as I would for a private schoolüíÄüíÄüíÄ
No for real, the student union is tiny as fuck and always packed and usually packed, there‚Äôs literally no where to sit at on campus that isn‚Äôt a library, compared to like other campuses like UCLA, there‚Äôs a million seats everywhere on campus
Hi ‚Äî PhD student here. I really feel horrible for the undergrads bc you guys have it tough. I wish the school decreased enrollment so they can focus on the students, actually cared about hiring good lecturers and focusing on improving pedagogy, and not having shit dsp counselors. I‚Äôm thankful I ended up going to a small school over Berkeley back in 2017, I would not have survived a day here as an undergrad. Your GSIs also most likely genuinely care about you, talk to them about this and what they think is a good idea moving forward.
Q
there's always Stanford or CSU Long Beach.
skill issue
we have the same issues over here on the east coast (NJ) at rutgers. big school, same price, same problems you guys have. it‚Äôs completely unfair to us students.
Where is all the CA lottery money going ?
I chose not to attend Berkeley for my masters when they tried to say I couldn't work while pursuing the masters degree. Berkeley is a joke. But, professor Johan McKesson was a cool neighbor.
You're paying for the name, not the hospitality
Its a school not a luxury retreat üòë
Would it be worth going to Berkeley if you are part of the MET program?
Imagine how it is for international students paying 80K üòÄ
Tuck your sack
This is the reason I did not go to Berkeley as an OOS student. Did not want to pay 70k per year. Chose to attend my state school
Administration is incompetent and overpaid, siphoning insane shares of school funds for exorbitant salaries. 

Increasing seats in the school benefit the social wellbeing of California and furthers the core mission of the UC system. However, expanding seats without expanding infrastructure was a huge mistake. The revenue generated by those last 10,000 students added was entirely eaten by administration.

Gob ears
Well said
rudy Gobert
Probably should be using some of that tuition money to improve the facilities, but that would take away from administrative salaries.
Then why does it have so many today? Caltech manages to be small.
I am all for increasing seats at UC Berkeley, its what made tons of my friends choose this place over Stanford. But... when we increase seats we need to increase the infastructure too.
UC Berkeley added 10,000 to the student population in a decade, without the required infrastructure to support it. I'm called a NIMBY if I point out that the quality of life suffers. 3, 2, 1...
IIRC was a NIMBY who got it ruled in court that the school had to cut it's enrollment in half due to the school's effects on the city and lack of housing for students. Newsom overturned the decision.
Yeeeeeeeeppppppp
Idk if all students were against it but, as someone who was, it was a pretty crazy idea, and it was primarily supported by NIMBYs who were against housing developments. Moreover, the tuition revenue that the uni would have lost from that probably would have been put onto students (or other resources cut), which is to say that it would only have made the problem worse. 

If anything, we should be looking to the state + fed government to do a better job funding higher education.
Before Berkeley I was in the Navy for 4 years and ended up renting a 2 story house in Hawaii with a garage and a small yard. My WW2 1 bed 1 bath apartment in Berkeley is $75 more per month than my house was.
UCSD same way. Maybe all the good UCs??
It was terrible when I went there. This isn't new. Students (or their parents) need to make better choices. The information is freely available.
Thanks for sharing your perspective. It‚Äôs very insightful :)

I do think that on average that figure might not have changed too much? Could be wrong. And here my anecdote:

Every single upper div major related course I took (‚Äò22) were quite strongly impacted since they were engineering adjacent majors (i.e. CS/Math/Stats) which routinely had >200 seats minimum from my memory. The smallest classes I took were out of my major and lower divs such as entry linguistics (~140 students?) which was interesting.
man i was born a year after you graduated!
Some upper division Stem classes today have 1300 students. Several hundred students is the norm but some math classes are still around 40 or so
I can‚Äôt even imagine how bad the basement of Evans is given the ground floor.
Interesting. I‚Äôm not in Cali but this really makes me think twice. Chapel Hill is my state‚Äôs flagship. So far both of my kids chose private schools over Chapel Hill but I‚Äôve got one more kid that will need to decide.
I imagine they're talking about the entirety of the bathroom that inevitably gets disgusting from general use by way too many people, not the contents of the toilet specifically
Maybe one day we can take care of that Prop 13
   I've been sitting on this comment since you posted it. I have a lot to say to it. But first let me get clear. 
What you're suggesting when you say hypocrisy, is that you believe progressives are inherently Yimby, so the actions of protesting people's park being turned into housing, is antithetical to progressive values?
Exactly correct unfortunately
Big Name and Big Brand Universities have big donor money coming in every year (there is even a large department whose responsibility is to get Money). Look it up. We get more than you can imagine every year!

Also anchor house - once they start moving students in - the building will be profitable. Student Housing is a revenue stream considering how expensive a single bed is (those triples in Unit 1 are bringing in like $60k per year for one room!!!)
School is most definitely not lacking financially. A lot of people don't know this but lemme tell you a lil sumn from a bay native: UC Berkeley owns 1/3 of Berkeley. All the businesses that are considered in campus? Yeah they're paying rent to the actual school. All the Subway sandwich shops, all the thrift stores, all the book stores, all the cafe's, everything except the actual housing, but anything CONSIDERED student hosting still does. It's not a money issue, it's a government issue. Take it up with the higher ups, as in school board for universities of California and State governments.
Although UC Irvine and UC San Diego are far from ideal, compared to what OP says, they are paradise! Lol. I guess one has pay bit more for more prestige
to be honest this person is right, i‚Äôm currently studying abroad at a way less prestigious public school that has a large student population and it‚Äôs a lot nicer here. we deserve better
It was like this in the mid 90s. I transferred to sf state due to class size.
[deleted]
The high cost of living (esp. housing) creates extra problems for Cal and some other UC schools - that most universities don't have.
i‚Äôm late and go to georgia tech, but i feel like the infrastructure is generally alright aside from on campus housing. if you seek out alternate places to hang out / study then you‚Äôll find good spots that aren‚Äôt crowded
HORDE
Maybe you focus on rankings too much? Awesome facilities and campuses at public schools in a lot of states.
It can be for longer . In my day hot water was off for 2 weeks
Last year my whole building didn‚Äôt have hot water for over a week.
That‚Äôs rough and hopefully that doesn‚Äôt happen too often. Is it a consistent pattern? Sometimes things like this are one off instances and I hope that‚Äôs the case
My dorm didn't have hot water for four days last month.
School like Cal, huge classes top public‚Ä¶. If you are a first gen college nobody just got in because of good grade, you are literally a sperm lost in colon since this society requires recommendation and so called net work for everything good.
You‚Äôre referring to resource misallocation rather than diversity being the core problem, correct?
You can also try PairVPN with your phone's 5G connection as temporary wifi.
I mean it‚Äôs on the table, but would lower tuition change the issues being described here about facilities not being able to handle the large number of students?
CSU had nice solid universities, it is a shame they get looked over by so many.
Their gym is so nice too! I considered going to SJSU over Berkeley, but in the end, the snob in me won (and lost too, haha).
I envy my friends who go to SJSU
I do work-study on campus, and my keycard works when other students' cards don't. It's fantastic having entire offices to myself.
1) your right. Tuition isn‚Äôt 40K, it‚Äôs actually more like 43K with housing before financial aid/scholarships
2) I have been asked to leave coffee shops for using WiFi and not buying items. While Strada might not care, most indoor cafes you have to ask for the WiFi password from the workers, and they‚Äôve literally told me ‚Äúoh, the WiFi is for customers only‚Äù. 
3) i don‚Äôt really see your point in this here? If I go to a library/study hall/cafe and there‚Äôs no places to work, I move onto another workspace, the same thing happens, I don‚Äôt see how the responsibility of this falls onto me the individual when it‚Äôs not a huge mystery the cal is not designed to accommodate the amount of students it enrolls? Most of the conversation about this is in relation to housing but there are other places it‚Äôs visible too. 
4) when I was touring/researching/etc, no it was not mentioned that was going to have to spend an hour walking around campus just to find a place to study. Ass hat.
You really know how to logic-away feelings of misery
or any top private school ü•≤
This has to be a joke? Sounds like copy pasta.
Womp womp
Bro forgot the /s :(
Ah yes, the traitorous critic fallacy (ergo decedo).

Why are you opposed to making things better?
UCLA's facilities are leagues better, with a pretty much identical number of students. the smallest of their multiple gyms alone makes our single gym look like a fucking dungeon
40k is not nonresident tuition
Im CA resident
Goobers
Gobe ars
The money coming in is insane! I'm not just talking tuition - Millions comes in from donors every year.
You can look up administrative salaries online.

Berkeley salaries are unbelievably low (relative to industry, relative to the cost of living) for most staff. Salaries for tenured EECS faculty might seem high, but they're a tiny fraction of the total.  (And ""faculty"" are not ""staff."")
fwiw, the tuition money goes toward replacing the money that the state used to give before defunding the university over the last 30 years or so
If you look at compensation, it's most faculty salaries that are really high
Caltech is private
Berkeley doesn't get to decide how many students it takes in.
Just increase remote coursework. Problem solved
Yeah, not building enough to meet demand is the root of most of the Bay's problems. As YIMBYs have been pointing out for decades. The answer isn't ""don't let more people in"", it's ""build more"".
Shhhh, you're making the ""we just need to keep developing, bro!"" narrative a little more complicated and that's a no-no
Not quite, the state legislature passed a new law that effectively overturned the decision.


https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/09/08/peoples-park-supreme-court-case-opposition-ab-1307-student-housing
And isn't there also a major pro housing development coalition in San Diego? Albeit there are geographical differences between Berkeley and SD, barriers like the border and the ocean are real boundaries sd cannot ignore. Water resources, (maybe not so much the last two years) but usually water is a big issue down there. 
,
Sorry for my late reply, the new version of Reddit is ""different"", and I missed your post.  Anyway, your convergence/overlap explanation makes sense from a crowding perspective, but I think it's likely to result in a) over supply and b) rather rapid obsolescence thanks to generative AI. The recent layoffs are a strong hint of the future trend.  See my post below for what I think is a more robust play.
My kids are in their early 30's.  I am going to outlive my father and mother by at least a decade, maybe more.  Medicine and health care (and workers benefits) have greatly advanced in two and a half generations. No world wars. We ""boomers"" are leaving some good behind, like you, your parents and their (and our) 401k's...not just global warming and plastic filled oceans (sorry about those mistakes).
[deleted]
IMO, 1300 in one upper division class is THE definition of a paper mill.  Lemme guess, CS data analysis?  My first thought is the weeder rate has dropped to essentially zero as a result of the massively increased tuition rates. People expect tuition buys a diploma, not just an education, and UC is delivering.  My second thought is the recent wave of tech (STEM/CS) layoffs is not just supply/demand in a stormy world market, it's also a shift to generative AI (which is largely a hardware wave like fiber optics was around '98).  The next wave after AI on Silicon will be quantum computing on ???.  That's what I would target in STEM.  Good luck, and go bears!
Wait there are lecture halls that hold more than a thousand people?
Evans was new in my day; the basement computer room was open 24x7 because one ""loop"" (punch, submit, wait for output) took a minimum of 30 minutes, unless you had a high priority account number on your job control card (first card in the stack).  It could take five or more loops to get the program working...so two to three hours per assignment...unless you were really good.  Students were there at all hours.  The way around the system was to have a high priority account number, which you got by coding (or just schlepping cards) for a professor.  High priority jobs executed immediately, and you could walk over to the printer and your job was done.  Luckily I had such a job...otherwise I would have slept in the basement of Birge more than I did.  BART stopped running at 9PM in those days.
And not a lot of that money is discretionary. Fundraising for capital projects isn't a huge draw-- the much-touted Gateway building isn't fully funded at this point. I'm pretty sure Athletics (and the stadium isn't paid for), Haas, and COE are the top fundraising depts on campus.  You can easily look up where their funds go with some digging.
If you look at the information on Anchor House, all revenue from the building goes directly back to scholarships and the building was completely privately funded at no cost from the University, City, or State. It was built with a gift from a private non-profit, the largest in the Universities history I think. 

""Proceeds from Anchor House‚Äôs net operating revenue will fund annual scholarships for Pell Grant-eligible students, selected on the basis of academic and personal achievement."" - According to the UC Berkeley page about Anchor House.
Do you know where to find how the university funds are (mis)allocated? Like charts or otherwise? If not that‚Äôs fine, just couldn‚Äôt find the source myself after a minute and got a bit lazy ngl
How many of those businesses are actually on campus, there's Yali's, the expensive places in the union, and that's basically it, there are no Subways, thrift stores, bookstores (besides the student store), etc. on actual campus property.
UC Berkeley owns a lot more than just the campus campus. Most of telegraph is also considered UC Berkeley. I know this because when I was homeless I stayed at people's park whenever there was trouble at lake Merritt. Talking to the police often let me know that campus police are used for that entire sector, and more. I'm a very curious person. I ask a lot of questions.
I loved UC Irvine and UCSB. My favorite of all UCs. Santa Cruz is nice as well.
UCSD also has a nice advantage with it's proxmity to SD.   def would have considered that :)
I agree. They overenroll and the physical plant can't take it.   


Although, to tell you the truth, I can't understand why the students don't blockrush Oakland and gentrify it.
There‚Äôs kids getting their houses bombed and living in cardboard boxes the entitlement of this post is astounding. You‚Äôre going to a state school with cheap tuition chill tf out¬†
Abroad as in international? I sorta expect foreign tuition to be better just because the whole decreased federal funding is an issue for US higher education.
Did you encounter any of these kinds of issues at USC? I‚Äôm assuming public vs. private is the main difference, but maybe it‚Äôs a California thing. I don‚Äôt know much about west coast schools so just curious.
Too bad employers focus on it too.
Omg that‚Äôs inhumane. Berkeley gets cold and having to shower in freezing water is bullshit. I had to stifle screams just to take a shower lol. Two fucking weeks tho???
I think it‚Äôs been off before but only for a day at a time this semester. It was happening on top of the WiFi not working while roommate and I were trying to study so we had to laugh because wtf else could go wrong that day
What?‚Ä¶
Yes.
i live now in sacramento...during covid i would take my little baby daughter on campus just to walk.  sac state is definitely beautiful ! and with so many folks moving here, there's more to expansion in the works.  hehe berkeley is #1 but i definitely would look into a CSU if that option is near me.
right!  in addition to my course logins, i also had my EECS login, which allowed me to term in to ~any~ available workstation.  sigh...when i went, we were just getting Windows NT workstations...they had pentium pro processors.  lmao goddamn i'm old haha :) but yeah...memories of soda hall...cory hall.. ahhhhhh
Out of state and Intl kids be paying >76k ü•≤
Housing should never be considered a part of tuition LOL

Also, try a new library, I bet there are at least 10 other libraries that you never heard of / have never set foot in, that would have plenty of study space available for you
1) I lived with my parents while attending Berkeley cuz I chose it since it was only a 35 minute drive from my house. I realize most people don't live close by but assumed most people could just go somewhere near their house to save a few tens of thousands of dollars every semester, but I understand that's a big assumption
2) Why don't you just study at your house/apt/dorm? Do you not have any wifi at home? I've literally never studied at a library cuz I have a home to study in
3) The entire time I was at Berkeley it never seemed overly crowded to me compared to how most popular public universities look nowadays. Obviously a random ass school or a private school will be much more sparse but that's to be expected. I think you have a negative mindset regarding Berkeley + confirmation bias
4) I didn't mean just touring, I mean look at statistics regarding student population numbers and reviews of the school's facilities and all that

Also did some math and $43k is a ridiculous of amount to be spending even after housing. If tuition is $15k and SHIB is like a couple thousand, and a year of school is 9 months, that means you're spending like $3000/mo. How is that even possible? Do you buy $6 coffee everyday, Doordash every meal, and drink every weekend? Even then, that's pretty crazy.
Yes, I believe I'm a very logical person. In economics, I'm similar to what's known as homo economicus, as opposed to normal people, homo sapiens.
Clearly a meme
Who is going to pay for it
It also isn't in-state tuition
https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/how-aid-works/student-budgets-cost-of-attendance/

in state tuition living with relatives is **16,522**.  what's your breakdown with everything else?  everything you say that is challenging is real and definitely a problem.  but to say that tuition is 40k is disingenious, esp if you are in state.
&#x200B;

boogers
Gooners
people always say you can look things up instead of just sharing a damn link.
to be fair, we need to pay the top professors in the world a salary to reflect that
They're certainly not paying the custodians or cafeteria workers much
Where can one find the faculty salaries listed?
And I'd add that those faculty who are garnering the ""high"" salaries are getting them because we are competing with T1 private schools for the best researchers. In that respect, their salaries aren't actually that high considering their options (not to mention the base cost of living).
does it not decide how many it accepts?
Actually though that would be an amazing idea. There are tons of self motivated students at this school that would love to learn online with the Berkeley quality education. If people think integrity and cheating will be a problem hold exams in person then.
That solves a ton of problems. Especially safety. Most anything else can be mitigated, albeit inconvenient. Scythe/gun wielding lunatics, not so much.
All for this!

hehe i appreciate you.  as it is with bay area demographics (i'm now in sacramento) i had my children late.  will be 47 in june.  but hopefully i teach my [3 little ones](https://i.imgur.com/UhmbYnP.png) to reach for the stars and do good in this world.  roll on ! :)

edit: my parents are old..my dad is 87, mum is 83.....but they are still alive!  https://i.imgur.com/kGfD439.png we took this pic a few weeks ago for the lunar new year :D   same house in oakland where i stayed at when going to Cal.  in indebted to my parents for raising me to be the man i am today.  my diploma (along with my sister's diploma) hang in that little home.  us Cal alums are fiercely proud of where we came from :)
haha i cannot believe the 90's/2000's....are like a qtr century away!!!!! bahhhhhh lol oh wells.  well, we're all bears!  roll on! :)
Lost the plot a bit there
Oof! Sounds like a drag.
Hahaaaa!!! You can go to the ca business records website and look into Berkeleys funds. It'll take a while, but it's definitely worth a deep dive. Very fascinating subject.
They also own a number of off campus buildings, as far as I know they collect rent on all tenants in these buildings. 

https://capitalstrategies.berkeley.edu/real-estate/campus-property-portfolio
They'd get shot
I feel for the students left with lousy housing options in Berkeley, but as a local I would hope Oakland doesn‚Äôt get more gentrified.
This is a dumb comment
obviously we have a lot to be grateful for and there are people in worse conditions. at the same time we can ask for reasonable conditions for ourselves. plus it costs $127,128 to go here for 8 semesters with in state tuition (which is still a lot of money)
No, I went to a UC for undergrad and USC for grad school and the student support was amazing. The resources are on another level. 

People can hate on USC all they want but the counseling , class registration, career center and alumni network are  all incredible. 

There is a big difference between public and private universities.

Some may say UCB has smarter students, but when it comes down to taking care of their own alumni and networking opportunities USC is arguably better than 99 % of colleges in the USA
I go to a California liberal arts college and have experienced none of this, but that comes with billions in endowment and few students. Out of state private college was substantially cheaper than my state school.

1. Yes, 1 is indeed a very bold assumption. Not everyone has a world class university 30 minutes from their home. If you believe a world class education and opportunity should be reserved by two factors: proximity or wealth, then sure, continue holding this point.

2. Just because studying at home worked for you, doesn‚Äôt mean it works for everyone. Clearly libraries are useful enough that there is demand (too much in fact). If OP was indeed able to satisfy all studying needs at home they wouldn‚Äôt bring it up, no?

3. Fair, in some aspects it may be over crowded. I felt in a majority of situations outside of big CS courses, it wasn‚Äôt the case. But in large CS classes, it did feel very crowded and impersonal.

Lastly on the topic of cost, a majority of middle class people don‚Äôt have this kind of money laying around to just whip out for 4 years. Did you not take out loans to pay for college Sbomb?
Wow maybe it‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve graduated so I‚Äôll try to keep that in mind. A lot has changed especially since the pandemic. For the 22-23 academic year the avg cost for undergraduate tuition was 40k, and it goes up every year. Doesn‚Äôt take more than a quick google (or logging into my own cal central) to find that info. No, im not ‚Äúdoordashing every meal‚Äù or even getting $6 lattes every day. This may come as a shock, but im literally just trying to make a point that if my tuition already pays for WiFi, it would be really nice if that WiFi would work. 
I live in an apartment w 5 other roommates. Studying here is not always an option furthermore we use the school WiFi which as I mentioned before, is always down. Meaning even if I wanted to study at my apartment, I couldn‚Äôt. 
Like you just said, when YOU were here you didn‚Äôt notice any overcrowding. But the students here NOW all notice this issue, as well as the Berkeley residents who are well aware of the literal housing crisis that is all too real for us here being exploited by shitty landlords. But it sounds like you didn‚Äôt have to deal with that since you had the luxury of living with mommy and daddy during your time here. Like you said, it‚Äôs not realistic to assume everyone has that luxury. You have no idea where people come from and what the schools/programs are like in their area compared to Cal. You don‚Äôt know what schools/programs people were accepted into and which they weren‚Äôt. 
Going back to the whole point of this post to begin with, it‚Äôs a rant. Letting off steam about something that‚Äôs quite frustrating to be frank. This is an ongoing issue that I hear a lot of my peers complain about, but ofc leave it to Berkeley students to turn everything into a competition. 
And to your comment about stats, student life etc, when I applied/got accepted here, it was the first semester that campus was returning to normal post pandemic. The conversations about ‚Äústudent life‚Äù looked a lot different. If you can imagine. Don‚Äôt know how old you are or when you graduated, but a lot of the alum in this sub seem to pretty out of touch with what campus is like for students who are actually going here NOW.
Your comments are tone deaf, misinformed and just plain dumb.¬†
you're getting downvoted for spittin' common sense.  i lived at home with parents too and in my first year, i just used AC transit --that year was the first year we got the unlimited ride sticker on our cards.  

i studied at my friends dorm....at home....in my car.  while it may seem crowded, most of the time our climate is pretty mild.  lots of places outdoors to study.  if you can find a spot to sit, you can study.  we did not have wifi then (i'm class of 1999)......but i am sure that is essential in today's age.
Pardon since I forgot you EECS majors need people to be real specific since your can‚Äôt use your imagination. Tuition (15k) + housing/cost of living, books, insurance, housing, fees etc, (28-30k) = to about 40K. It DOES actually say that on the link you posted. Not everyone has the luxury of living either family up here.
Just replace ‚Äútuition‚Äù with ‚Äútotal cost of living / expenses‚Äù and continue on. It‚Äôs just a definition difference.
GOOFY GOOBER
We should be paying professors a lot, and get rid of lots of the ass-deans.

Nope. University of California determines how much each of the campuses takes. Berkeley and its administration doesn't have a say.

Great looking family!  I've always said: getting through Cal is tough and a lot of work, but if you can make it, you'll be able to handle whatever life hands you and come out fine.  You are proof of that.
I‚Äôm still old to all these kiddos on campus. Luckily I‚Äôm
almost done. ü§ò
I am sharing my long term perspective.  I think the points are perfectly clear, but also understand it's scary for anyone caught up in it to even think that the demand for their hard earned skills has been greatly diminished by automation and the sheer number of their fellow graduates.  I simply suggested a way to avoid those issues at least through most of your career: go where the demand will be, not where it is now.  Take the trail with less traffic on it (at this point of the technology wave: and every technology is a wave that peaks and falls...).
definitely do this.  plenty of things to engage on campus while still living at home.  i hung out with my bros in the dorms.  later in the coops or apartments.  i joined daily cal to shoot photos.  some of my dudes formed a squad to play rec basketball at the RSF.  if you lean to some kind of religion...there's plenty of stuff on campus for that.  even if you're not catholic, come sit at the 10pm sunday mass at Cal Newman.  it's really welcoming and won't talk down to you ever no matter what position you are in life.  i miss Cal quite a bit and would love to be there again.  good luck !
i think OP is fucking complaining too much.  i don't know where OP is from, but it was their choice to come to berkeley.  berkeley is world class, but it's still a public university.  if you want to study....you will find a way.  because after university, work does not give a fucking shit how you get to work.  not to say that we don't value our mental health--we absolutely should.  but university is a time of adversity and growth.  some will make it, some won't.  i nearly didn't-- i was on AP 3x...by the grace of god/buddha/allah/jehovah i finished with a final GPA of 2.23.  thank goodness i was an EECS major which let me skate by with a 2.0+ GPA.  

it was tough as fuck to go then...and seems like it's tough as fuck now too.  but at some point, one has to just realize they got in and need to  make it work.
> Not everyone has a world class university 30 minutes from their home.

pretty much anyone from california does in fact have a world class uni 30 minutes from them. Study in your own state if you dont like it
Graduation 2 months ago
> Pardon since I forgot you EECS majors need people to be real specific since your can‚Äôt use your imagination. 

lol and this is why i can't with you brody.  what's with the personal attack there?  you feel a typa way about EECS / science majors ?    tuition is the cost of going to school there.  everything else is your living expenses.    i don't know where in california you are from, but if you chose to live away from home to attend this university, those are the costs you have to deal with.  unless you're living out in some podunk area, there are institutions that may have been better for you from a financial standpoint.  

while it is within your right to go to whatever school you want--the reality is that you're not just going to go to a university w/o incurring everything else related to going to school.  you're right i'm fortunate i was close by.  i actually applied only to two schools: cal and csu hayward (now csu east bay).  i was fortunate to be a spring admit to cal.  

look i feel sorry you feel this kinda way, but it's not surprising how things are the last few years with cost of living so fucking crazy in the bay area.  hell i grew up in oakland, attended cal...got an honest to goodness EECS degree, work in tech...and i still had to move to be able to afford a home to raise my family.  ain't nobody gonna feel sorry for me--it just what it is.

i hope you feel better and find your time at Cal to be better than it is now.
then sure.  but that's not tuition.
I remember Ass Dean. I thought he died at the Juggalo festival in ‚Äò04. Too much Faygo.
Oh cool, my advisor makes $1000 per day.
wow very interesting, I didn't know that
i 100% believe that getting thru cal has a great deal of my success later in life.  it was definitely tough.  but i find great satisfaction knowing that i was able to get thru it.  roll on !  :)
haha right on !  

up until pandemic...i still got to be around berkeley.  first office was above yogurt park.  then we moved to where berkeley social club is.  i was very lucky i could still roam the campus when many of my peers have long gone.  these days i'm in sacramento..so berkeley isn't very far off.  but now it really seems like a lifetime since i've last stepped on campus.  

enjoy your time on campus and good luck !
I hear you and get where you‚Äôre coming from, but at the same time there is a reason why OP‚Äôs post is so popular and is the front of this subreddit and heavily upvoted. It‚Äôs because their sentiments are echo‚Äôd / supported by their fellow classmates in some fashion. I don‚Äôt think OP is saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible to make it work‚Äù, but rather there is something inefficient in this process and that has gotten to them.

Just because when you‚Äôre off in the real world and, ‚Äúyou can make it work‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt improve where we are. And a prerequisite of trying to improve something is having to critique it.

I might be solo in this camp, but I ascribe to the idea that maybe a part of ‚Äúmaking it work‚Äù, may just in fact be trying to make it better.
First off I‚Äôm a Cali native born and raised haha.

And Yeah that‚Äôs a weird take, I can give you plenty of examples of places that take an hour to reach a world class uni‚Ä¶

once a bear, always a bear! roll on :D
Yes and for the sake of any productive conversation it is more important to focus on what a person is trying to say and not exactly what word was said‚Ä¶
and i totally get it.  i just find the tone of OP in his comment replies to be a bit trash and a bit petulant.  university time isn't going to be a big ol kumbaya where everyone has fun.  i was EECS and spent every summer doing summer courses to catch up.  and then taking general electives to round out my degree--even us engineering/cs students had to write term papers.   

being in college is a time of discovery and realization that when you land in the real world, it is going to be very challenging.  i don't know what OP's major is.....but every major has their challenge.  some are not as involved as others.  some are more impacted than others.  i do feel empathy for OP because i didn't come from a wealthy background--i was fortunate enough to have cal grant/pell grant and fed loans to cover my tuition.  i couldn't imagine affording a today's education.  

but at some point there are things one has to compromise on in order to make it.    and if one cannot make it here...then it's no big deal.  there are other learning institutions ...or heck even a different take on what to do in life.
OMG NOT AN HOUR OH NO! A vast majority of Californians live in San Fran, LA or San Diego. All close to some of the best unis in the country. God forbid people in orange county have to drive a little longer. Point is most people could commute they just don't feel like it. Nobody cares about the 10 people living in fresno or bakersfield
Not every californian needs to or deserves to attend a UC. More than half of CC students dont even finish CC. Math works just fine
so that's the thing right.  if we compare with someone going to a private school like stanford....it's even more expensive factoring in the living situation and the actual tuition.  cal is a relative bargain in terms of being at a top tier university.  

i get that OP is frustrated..but cal is far from trash and definitely not expensive compared to other universities.
[deleted]
There is, nothing I said contradicts that. If you do decide to pursue such a career that requires study at such a university, and you qualify to be there, and you are a californian, odds are you are within commuting range of said UC."

Norwegian Exchange Student looking to meet Americans,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7b2ch1/norwegian_exchange_student_looking_to_meet/,2017-11-05 18:47:30,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôll be an exchange student at UC Berkeley - Dept. of Sociology from Jan-May. I understand there‚Äôs a lot of Norwegians that study here, and I‚Äôm looking to avoid a phenomena known locally as ‚ÄúThe Norwegian Bubble‚Äù - that is, Norwegians tendency to group up and avoid people from other cultures when they‚Äôre abroad.

Absolutely nothing wrong with meeting new Norwegian people, but I want to experience some American culture and people during my exchange semester here. Lived in Norway for the entirety of my 24 year old life, love it here, but kinda feel like experiencing something different.

Question time: 

How, if at all, does American culture dictate that I go about making new acquaintances/friends?

Any particular activities you recommend to get in touch with Americans as an exchange student?

Do locals tend to take an interest in exchange students, or are we considered tourists, like DUI convicts in state pen?

Thanks,

Go Bears..?
","1. I think a standard is to go to bars and stuff. The grad student association also holds events, and you're likely to meet new people in your classes and at department events as well. Intramural sports and campus clubs too? The latter usually weighs toward undergraduates though if you might have reservations about that.

2. The most American thing you could do is probably going to a ~~football~~ basketball game (since the college football season's already ended by next semester), but everyone has different ideas about what ""American"" is. There's plenty of stuff to do that's not directly related to school, especially if you go out a bit to Oakland and San Francisco, so there's plenty to explore.

3. I've only met a couple of exchange students, but I haven't thought of them any differently compared to full-time international students. There are tons of people from all over the world around here, so I think most people wouldn't bat an eye.
I would recommend joining a club or two. When I studied abroad in Scandinavia last spring, I noticed that extracurricular activities for uni students were all through clubs and groups that weren't affiliated with the school. So take advantage of the hundreds of student groups Cal has to offer! :)

Also if you haven't already gotten housing figure out, I would apply for a spot in one of the co-ops! You'd instantly be surrounded by dozens, if not hundreds, of American students.
Join a group with interests similar to yours. Americans will chat you up in no time. As a non-srudent Norwegian I've noticed that Norwegians do indeed tend to hang out in groups. Which is too bad, as Americans can be so much fun to get to know. 
My friends and I have been watching Skam and would like to chat with a real life Norwegian about it. I live in North Berkeley and graduated Cal in 2016. DM me!
For bars around campus:


Kip‚Äôs - Where a lot of people end up on a Friday/Saturday night, only because Kip‚Äôs is the only bar other than Pappy‚Äôs with a dance floor and DJ. Isn‚Äôt that great in general, but can be fun if you‚Äôre sufficiently drunk and there will always be Cal students there (along with a mix of weird townies).


Triple Rock - GO ON THURSDAYS.  Thursday at Triple Rock is easily the best student bar scene in Berkeley. It‚Äôs 100% Cal students every Thursday.


Tap House - They have pool tables and other games. Only drinks are beer and wine.  Haven‚Äôt been this semester yet so I‚Äôm not sure what the crowd is on a usual Friday/Saturday.


Cornerstone - Pretty new, but you‚Äôll find a good amount of students who go here Friday/Saturday.  Lots of beer on tap and there‚Äôs a small concert venue attached.


Free House - Pretty small, good place to go with friends if you want to chill and have some beer and food. Not really for meeting people.


Pappy‚Äôs - Cheap drinks for a reason. Wouldn‚Äôt stay here longer than it takes to finish your $2 beer and $1 jell-o shot.


Starry Plough - People go here after Triple Rock on Thursdays.  They have live music.



I've been in soc classes with some of the packs of Norwegian kids. their issue was just not approaching any of the rest of us, just tap someone on the shoulder after class and ask if they'd like to get together to work on a study guide or something. 
Honestly, I'd just go around campus to various clubs or sporting events and meet people. Most of the time when you go to those things, there are a good amount of people who are trying to meet as well. Good luck!
I would recommend - 

- Joining a club on campus - Something that is based around social activities.

- You could consider checking out the fraternities as well. They are a good way to meet ""Real Americans"". 

- Making friends in class.
[deleted]
JOIN A CO-OP! You will meet Americans and have a very social experience. I'm an exchange student myself and highly recommend them. If you don't get in, join the waitlist and hope for the best.
I'm down to hang out bro. I'm from the Bay and I drive so I'm down to show you around! I live meeting people who are originally from other countries.

Are youa beautiful womens? If so I will be gladly show you the ways
Thanks, really appreciate your insights!

Bars/pubs are definitely on the agenda, anywhere in particular to recommend?

We had someone from the exchange office at UC Berkeley come visit, explicitly told us to stay away from Oakland, which in her view was: ‚ÄúA troubled area.‚Äù Must admit I was sceptical, any truths to this claim?

Will 100% check out a couple basketball games, fits with my perception of American culture if nothing else.


Thanks for your reply, hope you enjoyed your time over here, and that we were hospitable and welcoming to you as a foreigner! Co-ops is a great idea, haven¬¥t figured out housing yet, how do I go about getting in touch with co-ops, is there a platform people at campus tend to use for example? 
It¬¥s a definite phenomenon, and I agree it¬¥s not a good thing. Norwegians are sometimes described as close-minded and stuck up by other people from other cultures, but a lot of us seem unwilling to make an effort to change that perception. One of the reasons I want to spend as much time as possible with people from other cultures, and especially Americans.
Haha
List of important Norwegian exports:

Great guide, thanks!

I see you¬¥ve encountered classic Norwegian behaviour. Norwegians tend to be incredibly shy, but friendly once you get to know us. I¬¥ll make sure to actively approach people, even though it might seem overwhelming or scary. Really want to make the most of this relatively short experience.
Thank you! 
Thanks for replying! 
Is it possible to join a frat on exchange for only 5 months? How do you join, is there a process or do you just sign up? 
Not sure which courses I‚Äôll attend  until I arrive in the US. Currently still in Norway mate!
Thanks, any word on what type of nationalities apart from Americans I can expect to encounter if I apply for a co-op?
Cool, thanks for reaching out! I¬¥ve been a redditor about a year, but mostly lurking, is there any way you could PM me your facebook, and we can make the connect?
Thanks for your optimistic and thoughtful response, and for sharing your assumptions regarding my political stance!
Oakland is such a large area, it's unfair to call the entire city trouble. Check out First Friday Oakland in December. I'm sure you'll have a good time there. 
At the risk of repeating what's already been said, the negative perception of Oakland is misinformed and held only by those who remain unfamiliar with the area.

At the very least, if you're looking to shop, eat, drink, hike, or dance outside of Berkeley, you could do worse than Oakland. And the city itself is so much more culturally diverse than Berkeley, which can be insular to a fault.
Personally I don't go to bars very often. There are a few on southside that're the gotos for undergrads, Triple Rock and Cornerstone in downtown are more popular with an older crowd, and there are more like the Albatross if you go further from campus.

Oakland's gentrified a lot in the last few years, and there are some areas that are very nice/hip/bougie/etc like Temescal and the area by Lake Merritt, so it depends on the neighborhood.
Haha I loved my time abroad! But not gonna lie, it was a bit difficult to meet/befriend the locals so I too experienced the bubble and basically hung around with fellow exchange students. Nonetheless I had an amazing time and would go back in a heartbeat. :)

I'm pretty sure you just have to make an account on their [website](https://www.bsc.coop/index.php) and apply through there (bear in mind there's a $25 sign-up fee just for applying). If you're part of the Education Abroad Program (EAP), that gives you some priority for getting in the co-ops. You should apply ASAP if the deadline isn't already closed because the waitlist is super long. [This](https://www.bsc.coop/index.php/housing/apply-for-housing-main/apply-for-housing) is a good page to read up on. Good luck!
Hi I saw this and I currently live in and work for the co-ops! You can absolutely call the number on their website but also if you have more questions feel free to message me, would love to chat about them!
Coming from someone in a frat here, it‚Äôs really not worth trying to join one for only one semester. 
It depends who is living there that semester and which co-op you are accepted to. There are quite a few people from England in my co-op. Please PM me if you want more advice/ info about co-ops. I did a shit ton of research before moving in haha, and I definitely don't recommend moving in without knowing what they are all about.
Will be there from Jan-May, so I¬¥m afraid I won¬¥t make First Friday Oakland, but I¬¥ll chech out the area anyway! Thanks for the reply!
Thanks for sharing, I¬¥m getting the impression there¬¥s more to Oakland than I thought. Still curious, any specific places in Oakland one should avoid?
Nice, glad to hear my impression of Oakland isn¬¥t a reflection of reality, but rather a result of one woman¬¥s perception. Will keep an open mind!
Glad to hear! Thanks, I¬¥ll look into this ASAP!
Thanks, sent you a PM!
Thanks for chiming in, curious though, why do you feel it¬¥s not worth the effort?
First Friday is the first Friday of every month. Even if the street closure doesn't happen because of weather, the galleries still do their thing and the bars are packed. 
That's a tricky question for me to answer, if I'm being honest, if only because my trips into Oakland are typically very targeted, and the places one ought to avoid aren't typically places one would accidentally end up in to begin with.

However, I will say that I don't typically visit West Oakland, nor do I visit the areas around the Coliseum, which I suppose would be East Oakland. Of course, there's not an awful lot to do around there in either area, so I don't end up there. The Oakland-Berkeley border can also be sketchy at night, but again, there's no real reason you should be walking around that area at night.

Outside of those areas, you've got access to places like Rockridge for food and shopping, Temescal for food and hipster haircuts, Piedmont for more food and shopping, Grand Avenue for even more food and shopping, Lake Merritt for its lake, Uptown and Downtown for dancing, music, concerts, bars, and clubs and more food, Jack London Square for even more food, Chinatown for even more food and the Oakland Museum of California, and the hills are home to some fantastic parks.
Honestly, you really don't need to stress this. The parts of Oakland that are legit dangerous don't have anything to appeal to a visitor.

You're looking at places like Deep East, Ghost Town, and the Lower Bottoms. Granted, places like Fruitvale can still be a tad rough by some standards, but you aren't going to get shot or anything. 

Anyone who writes off Oakland as a whole doesn't know what they're talking about or gets scared shitless whenever they see a ""scary"" minority. 
Don't trust the opinions of those who don't live there, and that includes students at Berkeley who often have very biased opinions of the area. 
Yup! Welcome to PM me as well. We have several exchange students in the co-op I'm in, which honestly brings so much more vibrancy and diversity to the house! Def helps with stifling my own Berkeley bubble haha
The way frats work is you ‚Äúrush‚Äù the first week or so of the semester, which means going to different frats‚Äô events and meeting guys. If they like you, at the end of the week they‚Äôll offer you a ‚Äúbid‚Äù ‚Äî an invitation to join. However, once you accept your bid, you‚Äôre not a member until you complete the ‚Äúpledge process‚Äù, where for basically the whole semester you get hazed in various ways. So, really all I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs not fun getting hazed all semester. It‚Äôs also a HUGE time commitment. Joining a frat is more of a long term thing. 
Cool, will check it out!
Haha fantastic, sounds like I need more than five months, just to start scraping the surface of the culinary experiences the city has to offer! Thanks for the insights, appreciate it!
Really?! West and East Oakland are the heart and soul of Oakland. If you're too scared to scare to go that's your loss. 
Thankfully, minorities don¬¥t scare me, heck I suppose I¬¥ll be a minority myself over there. Thanks for chiming in!
Good tip, like I said in one of the other comments, I¬¥ll keep an open mind!
I second this, a lot of students at Berkeley are kinda scared of cities, or don't know how to determine whether an area is dangerous or not and write off all of Oakland having been there hardly ever.
Thanks, definitely agree with you in that it doesn't¬¥t seem to be worth it for the time period I¬¥m there for. 
No problem! There's so much to do here, but I always get the sense that most students here are pretty content sticking to the areas immediately around campus. They can be fun, definitely, but there's [so much more to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7b1kh3/cool_stuff_to_see_and_do_at_or_around_the/dpf1d48/?context=0).

Another user mentioned [First Fridays](http://oaklandfirstfridays.org/) which, as the name suggests, happens on the First Friday of each month, so you've got a few times to make it out to one while you're here.
Would you wander the streets there alone at night?
I never said that I was too scared to go; I just don't have anything to do there, so I'm not as familiar with them. I'm in Fruitvale every so often for the Mexican food, though.
Good to know, as you probably figured, I started this thread because I want to expose myself to new cultures, so I sure as hell don¬¥t want to write an entire city off for no particular reason apart from other people¬¥s opinion. Love the quote btw, is it taken from Nas, or are you on some Greek mythology shit?
Thanks for claring that up, I¬¥ll check it out!
It's from Nas but I think it's widely relevant

That really sucks to have 2 classes that is often combo‚Äôed to have the same time.  Anyhow, conflicts are allowed and lectures for both are recorded so there‚Äôs no issues there. 189 does not offer alternate exams.  161 will, immediately after the main Final, so you‚Äôre gonna have 2 consecutive back to back finals.  You need to check if there will be midterm conflicts.  Shewchuk‚Äôs schedule should be easy to figure out more or less, just use previous semesters‚Äô syllabus to figure out midterm dates. 

Word of advice - don‚Äôt use Schedule Planner, especially as a CS major, since the 999 discussion dummy often gives you weird options and you often wind up wading thru a bunch of bad options.  Easier to just lay things out using Excel IMO."

I had a ton of packages sent to me over break when I was living in Unit 2! They just keep it for you. When you return, you have all your packages waiting for you. You just need to pick it up like you would normally
I work at one of the other units mail offices but the policy should be the same.
Since the offices are closed all mail is held off until we reopen on the 9th. All mail that should have been delivered should have been held by the carrier (unless you've got some sketchy small scale one) until then, at which point we sort and treat it as if it were merely a weekend break. This may take a while due to sheer volume and not all of the student workers being back from break yet, but you should be receiving a package slip relatively soon.
Thanks everyone! I feel much better knowing that my packages won't be floating around within the chaotic postal system.
I believe they return them to the sender. You might wanna contact the sender.
Unit 1 is different because it also services Channing Bowditch and the Jackson Graduate House, both which have housing during the vacation. It's possible Unit 2 could have the same schedule though.
No they will not... As PTook said, the carrier will hold them until your unit's mailroom is staffed after the break. That exact date depends on the unit - they don't all reopen on the same day."

The East Bay punk explosion: How a scene rose from the ashes to create a music mecca [story link in comments],https://i.redd.it/kelgonap8yby.jpg,2017-01-25 16:16:11,,"In the mid-1990s, the East Bay was the center of the punk rock universe. In the new episode of the East Bay Yesterday podcast, Lookout Records co-founder Larry Livermore shares his thoughts on the surprising origins of the scene that produced the biggest-selling punk band of all time and countless other influential (and occasionally notorious) groups. He also reflects on how letting his little Berkeley-based record label grow beyond his bedroom into a multi-million dollar company sowed the seeds of its downfall.

I'm a huge Jawbreaker fan, too! I didn't talk about them in this episode, since they're not considered an East Bay band, but the book ""Gimme Something Better"" gets into their history. Regarding Jesse Michaels, I heard that he doesn't sing anymore because of problems with his voice : ("

It's a tough deal to sell...Trading living in a nice place with a real bed, to quarantine in crimmen-ridden homeless-filled Berkeley? No thanks, I'd rather to drive to the gym, and get in with a fingerprint rather than go in the bus and then juggle through useless badges for a very serious student-employee in the RSF. Beside the quality education, I don't find anything lucrative about Berkeley or the Bay Area. To add an all of that, it's very expensive.
 I don't think that's the goal... The goal is mainly that too many students will literally not be able to attend classes (already sick or international flights have been limited). On that latter cause, a lot of people said how flights were cancelled and the next ones they could get only were at the end of January.

From what I understand, this current virus is so contagious that unless you have a good filter or n95 mask you can spread it extremely easily. The risk that an international student/any student on a plane poses spreading the virus not just to other students but other people (in the airport, airplane, public transportation) is very high. Given that at this current moment people are very discouraged from international travel (flights are being cancelled because it's bad everywhere), if the uni told international students to come here now, they would need to have them wear very good ppe and be very disciplined‚Äîthat's the socially conscious choice. Lots of people are out sick and, while their sickness may only last 3-5 days, it's enough disruption such that I think they would benefit from less students flying in all on the same day.
Believe me, I would rather be at home. I‚Äôm also an international. It‚Äôs just that all internationals are saying they will arrive later on January. In my case, faculty of my department is amazing, this is the only thing I like about the program."

Yes, it does get colder - both on average plus the additional ""cold snaps"" that will have mid to low 30's at night.

This is somewhat normal October weather - Summer/Fall didn't have the usual heat waves though.
Yeah you‚Äôre going to need warmer clothes. Lows will drop into the high 30‚Äôs in Jan-Feb. Berkeley doesn‚Äôt hit the freezing point nor will we get frost, but you will need pants, sweaters, and jackets.
What you want is layers and zippers.  Outer layer being rain proof with a hoodie or a folding umbrella in the bp.
Grab a Columbia or a North Face Jacket, and it should help in the long run.
Welcome to the bay
All you need is a medium jacket like a north face or patagonia.
It'll dip into the mid 30's occasionally - little couple day cold spells - but those don't happen every year.

Dang! thanks for the info!
thanks! i've been waiting for a grade and it hasn't come out yet :( Final exam grade hasn't been posted either! For context the semester ended on the 15th.
We‚Äôve made a lot of CoVID-related exceptions and it takes a while to make sure we account for them properly!
Totally! It was news to me too haha"
Craft Club for Teens starting Jan 12th,https://i.redd.it/f8pwr9dvkcbc1.jpeg,2024-01-11 01:59:29,,
Alumni emails,https://i.redd.it/lvpixcjhjggc1.jpeg,2024-02-03 15:47:44,Does this mean I‚Äôm able to keep my alumni email? Did something change because before we weren‚Äôt able to do anything about it but I saw an email a few weeks ago that said to contact this address in order to keep it.,"Are you a recent grad? I thought they change the policy such that graduates after fall 2023 can't keep their Berkeley email addresses.
The badgering worked! I've been bugging the Alumni House for months about this, and I lobbied hard to compromise to let the email addresses stay.
I graduated fall 23‚Ä¶ am i just fucked
Alumni who graduated a few years back - what link are you all using to get into your .edu email?
What email did you send the question to?
Yes! I graduated spring 23. I thought so too
Thank you! It means a lot to be able to keep my email and use it for job searches haha
i‚Äôm a fall ‚Äò23 grad who emailed the cal alumni network and they confirmed that i get to keep my berkeley email. you could email them to check the status of your account, too. they can be reached at atcal@alumni.berkeley.edu

I sign into Google, and it sends me to the CalNet login page.
atcal@alumni.berkeley.edu
I think that explains why. You can still keep your account.
Yes
Well the thing is I was supposed to claim my email by a certain date but I never did so they were going to delete my account. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on
I thought all alumni were losing their accounts
That's interesting."
"[Reddit Meetup!] Final Details: Sunday Jan 21st, 1pm-3pm, at Indian Flavors Express on Bancroft Way. See you all there! Bring an umbrella.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7qkkvr/reddit_meetup_final_details_sunday_jan_21st/,2018-01-15 08:02:56,"[Location of Indian Flavors Express](http://www.indianflavorexpress.com/location.aspx)

I will be wearing a pink beanie so you can spot me. I hope there aren‚Äôt too many people wearing pink beanies that day.

The meetup is no longer going to be at Pappy‚Äôs because it‚Äôs football weekend and the entire place will be packed. The last two meetups have been at Indian Flavors Express \(IFE\). There is open seating, great food for everyone \(great vegetarian and vegan food as well\), and some drinks. I‚Äòm Punjabi, so I can tell you that IFE makes great Punjabi food.

See you all next week!","I‚Äôm all set to show up briefly, not talk to anyone, and leave awkwardly. Just like I do at every department event.

Just a meetup between people who share a common interest. We don‚Äôt usually talk much about reddit as much as we do about school and city stuff. You definitely don‚Äôt need to be a reddit fanatic to go and have fun.
