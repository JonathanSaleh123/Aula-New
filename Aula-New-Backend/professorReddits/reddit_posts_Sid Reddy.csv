"Warning: Square One Management is owned by the nephew of Raj the human trafficker, Everest Properties is planning on changing its name",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/muhglt/warning_square_one_management_is_owned_by_the/,2021-04-19 20:15:53,"We've been actively avoiding renting from anywhere affiliated with Everest and Raj Properties. For newer renters out there, Raj is a convicted human trafficker who trafficked young children and women. He made several subsidiary companies (like Everest, soon to be a new name) that continuously changes its name to avoid detection by weary students who don't want to support a scumbag. After finding Square One and not seeing anything related to Raj or Everest, we thought we were good to go. We even asked Square One asking if they were related to Everest, and they said no. 

After spreading the good news that we finally found a great apartment, and our monthly rent wouldn't help a trafficker, one of my friends found something. Square One is owned by Anchor Valley Partners, an investment group that's owned by Raj's nephew. There's no escape... finding housing is extremely hard, and we were so happy to find a good place that wasn't affiliated with Raj Properties but ultimately signed the lease and discovered the bad news. Just leaving this post to help future tenants who are thinking about renting in the future. It sucks that we have to choose between supporting them, or paying an obscene amount of rent. ","Fuck Raj.
University Walk Apartments is also a newly rebranded name some of their subsidiaries are using.

We should really start a thread that keeps track of all their shifting front companies.

Stay away from premium properties too. Life sucking leases and will strip your rights away!
The big issue trying to avoid him is 1 in 3 properties are affiliated with him. My property is run by Everest but they only do the background checks and financing for my landlord. I've paid Everest a total of $40 for processing some of my paperwork- that's $40 too much for that dickbag to have of my money but it's only $40. 

Do what you can to avoid it but it might be impossible.
Donâ€™t know if you guys know this but Mike Meighan also manages some of the apartments that are part of Square One Management. Mike is the Bio1A coordinator. Iâ€™m surprised to see he is affiliated with them.
Unfortunately they own a huge portion if not the majority of the apartments and housing near UC Berkeley. The only alternatives are private dorms, which have their own problems, other likewise shady companies like Premium Properties, and if you're lucky actually decent housing. It's a sellers market, and that means anything they can put off in terms of repairs or QoL they will.
 thank you for the update.
maybe carol could send out a warning email about this plz ðŸ¥´ for the new bears
How does this guy still have properties?  Wasn't he convicted?
Warning, seems like one of the new property companies they've switched to is called Vindium Real Estate.
It's said that in every thread regarding murdering, human trafficking Berkeley slumlords, you can go into the bathroom with the lights out and whisper ""/u/tplgigo"" three times, and a withered, old man will appear on the thread to excuse Lakireddy Balireddy's crimes.

The power of Oski compels you! Show yourself, foul demon!

\[EDIT\] So disappointing, grampy. You didn't have the balls to do your usual grandstanding and only chose to downvote meekly and slink off with your tail between your legs. Gutless.
I totally understand why some don't want to live in any of these properties, but I also understand why some people don't care.  The full story is a bit more nuanced than I assumed when I was first told about Raj.  

It's been a while since I read up on this, do your own research.  There are a couple things that stick out to me as deserving some consideration though.  I'm not saying these exonerate anyone, just saying I ponder them whenever this comes up:

* The guy has a complicated past that includes both intense acts of evil and really important philanthropy that shaped Berkeley for the better.  He's a major reason Berkeley has such a thriving Indian community today.  
* He has already served time for his crimes, which supposedly means he's been rehabilitated.  I'm a big fan of block-the-box, not sure how to reconcile that with continued boycotts.  
* It's not clear how much the entire company and his family members deserve to be painted with the same brush as Raj himself.
>y signed the lease and discovered the bad news. Just leaving this post to help future tenants who are thinking about renting in the future. It sucks that we have to choose between

buddy Raj is his Son father Lakireddy Balireddy is the one who committed the crimes. Reddy was born in 1937 in the village of Velvadam, in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India and at age 17 was married for the first time to a 14-year-old girl. Married three times, Reddy has three sons, Raj, Vijay and Prasad Lakireddy. Raj died in a motorcycle crash while attending Chennai Medical college in 1985.
Mention it in Yelp reviews
From my internet trawling looking for housing, it definitely feels like a third of Berkeley's housing stock is in some shape or form, affiliated with the Reddy real estate and human trafficking tycoons. My best advice if you really want to avoid renting from them is to go to Everest's website and take note of the same apartments that are inevitably cross-posted elsewhere (namely Craigslist), usually without the Everest/Raj name explicitly listed, and stay vigilant.

Non-comprehensive list of apartments associated with the Reddys:

* Everest Properties
* Raj Properties
* URSA Apartments
* Domingo Properties
* University Walk Apartments
* Berkeley Park Apartments
* A.S.K. Rentals 
* Square One Management (some listings are on the CalRentals website, which is unfortunate as that is affiliated with the university).
* Craiglist postings by Prasad & Vijay (sons of Lakireddy Bali Reddy)
very possibly everest shills. i've seen them post on this subreddit before denying what happened
You usually hear about it by word of mouth. Here's a wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakireddy_Bali_Reddy 

and this article from 2019: https://businessreview.berkeley.edu/living-in-berkeley-you-might-be-paying-rent-to-a-former-sex-trafficking-ring/

what's wrong with premium properties?
Their leases make you sign your life away
Not surprised, man is an asshole. Said he wouldnt mind if half the population just died because we are over populated.( before covid) I was like ""what makes you think you deserve to be in the half that lives?"", and he kinda was just pretentious and said he was just smarter than most thats why.
Not a bio major, but I saw some absolutely terrible reviews about him from several years ago when he was actually teaching
No way.. I thought Mike was the weirdest, if sometimes fun, instructor I've ever had. How do you know this?
There are still a few of us private landlords around who haven't succumbed to the siren call of buyout.  Also those companies don't tend to deal with single family homes.

That's the trick if you want to try and avoid the evil companies -- look for single family or small buildings with just a few units.
Good doesn't cancel out evil. In fact, philanthropy is one of the main ways bad people act to mask or create a facade around their true nature. People feel beholden to whatever they received from these people and seek to defend their actions saying ""they've also done good"". Yeah sure they also did good, but it doesn't make their crimes any less heinous. 

The family is doing fine. They still own a vast amount of property. They are still trying to grift students out of security deposits and refusing to proper maintenance checks on apartments (I lived in a property owned by them a few years back). The majority of students don't even know what they have done even though in the case of their victims they  destroyed their lives and in the case of the victims of the public trial some people have lost their lives....

I say having colleges students bash them online is a small price compared to that. Are they anywhere close to losing their iron grip on Berkeley's housing market? They should've had their entire business investigated thoroughly and their assets seized IMO. It's unclear how much of their current business was built on the blood of trafficked slaves. How much of their ""philanthropy"" was. The family is benefitting still to this day from all of it.

They are sex traffickers and greedy landowners. They deserve pain.
Yup, the REAL solution to corrupt sleazebags with lots of money avoiding consequences and dominating communities is to decommodify essential resources like housing, but I think we're still a little ways off from that...

For now, due diligence on everyone's part and spreading as much awareness as possible to facilitate that seem to be the best things we can do. Thanks for the list!

They are just pieces of shit that will try to finesse every dime out of you and not help u in any way when u need it.
50 page leases are not normal...they are unwilling to work with clients and have very broad clauses in their leases that strip away all your rights. These clauses are unethical at best, illegal at worst. They harass you constantly with emails and phone calls when you show any interest in their properties or haven't signed any of their brutal paperwork. Good businesses develop relationships with their clients, they have no interest in doing that.

It is no wonder that AP management just fired them!
How do I know he manages apartments thatâ€™s part of Square One Management? Iâ€™ve interacted with the company and Iâ€™ve been contacted by him while I was looking for housing.
All very good points which I wholly agree with.  

You mention ongoing effects, and it's also important to consider ongoing benefits (hear me out).  My main interaction with Raj properties is through my Indian friends who consider some of his buildings to be cornerstones of the Desi student community at Cal.  They know the owner is a slimeball, but they don't want to give up the gathering place he built, even though it was built through immoral means and used for immoral purposes.  I find it difficult to blame them for overlooking the history in cases where the legacy is actively beneficial in the present.  

If you have a choice, all else being equal, you should choose the apartment not owned by a convicted sex trafficker.  But in some cases, I can at least understand where people are coming from when they choose not to engage in a boycott
I don't get the STUDENTS line.  No one is accusing him of harming students, far as I understand, his crimes were against Indian immigrants in the 90s
Square One Management is run through Anchor Valley Partners ([https://anchorvalleypartners.com/about-us/company-profile/](https://anchorvalleypartners.com/about-us/company-profile/)), which was co-founded by Sidhardha Lakireddy, the nephew of Lakireddy Bali Reddy.

Berkeleyside wrote an article in 2013 detailing a libel lawsuit filed by Sid Lakireddy. [https://www.berkeleyside.com/2013/05/30/sid-lakireddy-sues-berkeley-rent-board-candidates-for-libel](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2013/05/30/sid-lakireddy-sues-berkeley-rent-board-candidates-for-libel)

In this article, Berkeleyside outlines Sid Lakireddy's family connection to Lakireddy Bali Reddy. While the basis of the lawsuit was to contest any notion that he was involved in sex-trafficking, the most important part of the article is that ""Sid Lakireddy moved to Berkeley after his uncle and cousins had been convicted. He came to manage his fatherâ€™s rental properties in Berkeley, and eventually formed **Everest Properties**, a management company for his **extended familyâ€™s real-estate holdings**. That included **property owned by Lakireddy Bali Reddy**.""

The article also mentions Sid leaving Everest Properties; based on Anchor Valley Partners' ""about us"" page, it's clear to say that Sid is now managing Square One Management.

If you're interested in the lawsuit itself, it was resolved after an apology. [https://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/09/18/suit-against-zoning-boards-tregub-dropped-after-apology](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/09/18/suit-against-zoning-boards-tregub-dropped-after-apology)
so theyâ€™re property managers?
Sid has sued several people whenever his name is associated with his uncle. He has very deep pockets and has no problem suing people.
No. Good property managers try to develop decent relationships with clients, especially because they want their clients to take care of the apartment they rent. Granted, the short term leasing game is played differently, but that doesn't give them an excuse to be complete assholes. Read their yelp page if you want to understand what I am talking about."
