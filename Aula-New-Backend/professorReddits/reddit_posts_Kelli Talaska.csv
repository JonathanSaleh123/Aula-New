Kelli Talaska or Katrin Wehrheim for Math 54?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ya0adv/kelli_talaska_or_katrin_wehrheim_for_math_54/,2022-10-21 11:03:42,lol rate my prof is scaring me,"Well I‚Äôm in talaska 10a and there is no rhyme or reason to it, she randomly decided to cancel this weeks quiz and have two quizzes next week instead because ‚Äòher cat bit her‚Äô?
I heard Wehrheims grading is far better
Yeah lol after seeing both ratings I realized I‚Äôm fucked either way
i do not recommend katrin wehrheim if you want to actually learn the material. super weird how the class was structured imo.
DO NOT TAKE WEHRHEIM.  SOME WHAT EASY A BUT THE PAIN IS UNBEARABLE TO THE POINT WHERE IT ISNT WORTH
After seeing the ratings, I am probably gonna skip MATH 54 and just take MATH 110
i say if ur ready to work talaska is prob better; her grading might be a lil bit harsh, but her lectures and hw are reasonable (at least they were for 53).
katrin is not a good lecturer.  I didnt learn hardly anything. im lucky to have taken 16a after that where i actually learned linalg
Kelli made me cry.
Needs a Diet Coke to heal the cut
very on brand - happy to know that some things never change
FAAAAR better. My only A+ at cal was their 54 class. But like the others said - you won‚Äôt learn shit
can you expand? lol 

if the class is an easy a, why is the pain unbearable?
if somebody makes you cry. you punch them
LMFAOOO NAH THIS ONE IS FUEL AHAHA"
Math10A/Kelli Talaska/Curve lol,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jxv3ug/math10akelli_talaskacurve_lol/,2020-11-20 10:57:06,does math10a usually get curved? does anybody know whether or not prof talaska usually curves grades at the end of the year (it's her first time teaching 10a),"At least when I took math 53 with her she applied her ""Talaska curve"" aka she decides what the fair grade distribution is. This should be in the syllabus lol
how significant was the curve? was it like ""an 85 is an A""... or....
It'll depend on the exam averages. Pretty much any STEM class Berkeley can be assumed that +1 SD is an A, like +0.6 is A- etc, with the exam percentiles corresponding to percentiles on Berkeley time. So I'd just check her past grade distributions or past distributions for 10A and figure out how you are doing relative to others in the class."
Math 53 with Kelli Talaska or Suncica Canic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bgmwcg/math_53_with_kelli_talaska_or_suncica_canic/,2019-04-23 15:50:58,"I am planning taking math 53 on 2019 Fall, but I can't decide between prof. Kelli Talaska and prof. Suncica Canic, any insight?",I've heard a lot of good about Canic.  Can't speak to Talaska but definitely try for Canic.
An Explanation of What's Happening in Math 54 Right Now,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10qa5ll/an_explanation_of_whats_happening_in_math_54/,2023-01-31 12:53:37,"**An update to this post can be found** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10t23lw/an_update_to_everything_happening_in_math_54/)**.**

Math 54 is joint ran by two professors, Kelli Talaska (she/her) and Katrin Wehrheim (they/them). We can go to either lecture, sections for either instructor, etc, etc.

Prof. Talaska had been feeling ill for a while now, in large part from trying to catch up with all the grading for her Math 10B class last semester which had fallen behind because of the strike, so she hadn't really put in the work into this semester's Math 54 class that Prof. Wehrheim was expecting from a jointly-run class which put immense stress on them from having to run everything by themselves for the past few weeks.

Prof. Talaska decided last week that it was probably best that she stop instructing the class for the aforementioned health reasons, which left Prof. Wehrheim with the job of teaching all 1000+ students which they obviously couldn't do, despite the math department's push for it.

The department also pushed for Prof. Wehrheim to instead teach alongside the (undecided) replacement instructor for Prof. Talaska, but given the current structure of the course (lectures and section are all group work essentially, worksheets are used daily and upload to a Drive folder, etc.), so Prof. Wehrheim decided that it wouldn't work out and that a new instructor would be completely out of the loop given how the class is currently being ran, so after thinking about it with family and friends over the weekend, they decided to take a leave too.

As such, we don't really know the future of this class, Prof. Wehrheim said it's unlikely to be cancelled, but that if we get new professors, neither we nor they have any idea how the class will be run, but Prof. Wehrheim insists we should fight for things that the class has already promised us and were outlined during Week 1 in the syllabus, as is stated by University policy (take home quizzes, projects instead of midterm/final exams etc), and so that's where things stand at the moment for the class. The GSIs seem committed to helping us and for that I'm really thankful, but it really is just uncertainty all around for them, and for us 1000+ students currently enrolled in the class.","Kelli‚Äôs medical issues caught up, it sucks.
We Need Alexander Paulin
#Number 1 public university
damn
Two professors with some of the worst ratings I‚Äôve ever seen come together to joint teach with a teaching plan even GSIs agree is ridiculous and then decide to quit because they realize it creates way too much unnecessary work for literally everyone involved. Thanks
Overworked, understaffed. Up the Union.
Man I remember taking math 54 with wehrheim, and I actually loved how much they actually cared and the GSIs ran some amazing sections. Sad to see this happen.

I will say strikes have effects and sadly this was one of the negative consequences :( in a perfect world the university would actually make changes to fix these problems but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if the two of them didn‚Äôt try to run a bizarre class system that doesn‚Äôt actually teach math or validate our understanding of it, but instead plays skateboard videos and cringe virtue signaling that compares being overworked to police brutality.
The real issue is that there exist classes with 1000+ students
a project in a math class ? wtf
All so they don‚Äôt have to refund money and keep the pump up.
All those coca colas Talaska has been drinking in lecture are finally catching up to them ig
You‚Äôre lucky Talaska stopped teaching this course. Took 53 with her a while back, god was she absolutely awful. Shit explanations, bad attitude, and even worse grading bins
From what I've heard about Talaska I'm surprised she hasn't been fired yet. I understand she has many health issues at the moment but it seems like she hasn't been doing her job properly for a while. Of course, I've never had her, so I could be totally wrong, but this is just what friends + RMP have said.
Some people just love to see the world burn
well hopefully this time they don't bring in 2 point something rated profs then...
At least y'all learned to calculate your privilege before the class got ruined 

/s
>Prof. Wehrheim ~~was~~ were expecting
If you are reading this, Paulin is top 3 teachers in the math department. Take classes with him every time you can.
gob ears!
lmaoooooooo
Exactly the comment I‚Äôm looking for ü§£
Faculty don't have a union (although maybe they should). Lecturers do have a union, and hopefully if these two profs are lecturers, the have been in contact with it.
Sounds like the strike was an important driver of this mess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Afaik Kelli Tallaska had already problems instructing pre-strike. I thought she was fine the two weeks I had her but MATH54 had a weird format with no formal lectures so it is not like she was giving long lectures.
I seem to recall the strike ended because an agreement was reached after the University made changes to the areas the strikers were demanding. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Don't you love ""calculating your level of oppression""? My favorite part of the lectures hands-down.
Go bears
STRETCH BREAK!
Literally every engineer and math student has to take it. It's pretty unavoidable
I took 54 with wehrheim and I can say I think the projects were actually good and I feel like I learned the material well in that class. The structure is a bit weird at first but once you get used to it it really is quite conducive to learning
Now see the problem I have is that she has a private tutoring site that charges students hundreds of dollars for exam prep for Math major classes at cal, and I‚Äôve heard people complain about her lack of availability last semester in office hour. Curious where she spent that time on.
I took a class with her freshman year and she was one of the worst professors I‚Äôve had at cal. On a personal level I‚Äôm sad she‚Äôs having health problems  but she was both a poor teacher and not particularly kind to some of her students.
100% true. I took both 1B&54 with paulin -- complete pleasure
yes, gob ears üëÇ
[They do, actually. ](https://ucbfa.org)
Any number of crises would produce a similar effect. Institutions that operate that closely to such a degree of dysfunctionality need more buffers built in.
I had her for 10A and prior to the strike, her grading conditions, inability to upload modules/notes on time, and more were a pain in the ass. At first I thought all her excuses were just excuses, but now I'm beginning to believe she does have fucked up medical issues.
Wait wtf is this
Not saying the class shouldn't exist. I'm saying it should be split into 5, each with 200 students.
Ya I agree
What I don‚Äôt get is if she has medical issues why doesn‚Äôt she leave? Berkeley doesn‚Äôt pay you if you take medical leave?
Wehrheim has asked their students to calculate their level of oppression by answering questions based on their ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life experiences.

edit: this is something done DURING LECTURE so it's kinda difficult to ignore
Why do you feel that way? 20-25 students per GSI section with 20 GSIs covers the entire class, and it's not like the professor's admin work goes down by a factor of 5 because you've cut down on the number of students.
Surely they have medical leave, but it's most likely a certain amount of medical leave like any other work place.

If this was a different job, there are usually more individuals who could take your work load and spread it enough to be fine, but being one of two in this environment? It doesn't work effectively.

Based on the above comment, it sounds like she'd need more medical leave than what she may have on the books too."

Choosing courses for premed (first sem),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cvdxkx/choosing_courses_for_premed_first_sem/,2024-05-18 19:33:34,"Hi!

I‚Äôm going into Berkeley as a MCB major on the premed-track and was wondering what classes you all would recommend! 

I don‚Äôt want to want to take too many classes due to the difficulty of starting as a freshman!

Please recommend classes!! ","Chem 1A/L for sure. Lot‚Äôs of bio freshmen take it their first semester so it‚Äôs a good way to make friends. Take your math course too. I‚Äôd recommend the 1 series because it‚Äôs just easier than 10. But if you‚Äôre confident in your calc/stats skills the 10 series will let you complete any stats requirements simultaneously. From there an easy breadth rounds out a pretty light semester (10 major prereq units + 3-4 breadth units). Use this light semester to join a club or two and try to apply to URAP even if you lack research experience.
as a freshman, i took Chem 1A/1Al, Math 1A, Colwrit R4A (English), and a 1 unit DeCal called PreMed 101
i definitely dont recommend the MATH 10 series because i have heard its a horrible experience and def hard. tons of my premed friends struggled and their GPAs suffered because of it too. 1 or 16 series should suffice.
Physics 8A, Chem 1A/L, and a math class (1A, 1B, 53, or 54 depending on if you've taken calc before)
Under no circumstances take Math 10A, it's a horribly designed course that will suck even if you're already comfortable with calc. You go through all of 1A/1B + content from some of the Math 5X courses in one semester, and are given basically no time to digest any of it. Needing to take three courses instead of two has almost zero effect on you over the course of your undergrad, so save yourself the pain and take stats + two math classes instead.
Take Chem 1A and a math class! That‚Äôs what I did and the workload isn‚Äôt too bad if the other classes you take are chill
Thank you so much!! Do you have any recommendations for pass/fail courses?
don‚Äôt take 10 series with Kelli Talaska
prehealth MCB student here.. definitely dont recommend taking 8A as a first semester freshman simply because you will be adjusting to college life and college-level courses. chem 1A and 1AL still require a lot of time and effort, you dont want to bombard yourself! 

  
most common first year schedule would be

CHEM 1A/1AL

MATH 1A/10A

ENGLISH R1A

PreMed101 DeCal (should be open for enrollment later in the semester!)
Thank you!! Do you have any recommendations for classes that are only 1 unit?
Thank you! What other classes did you take besides chem 1a and math?
For decals premed 101 is somewhat useful if you are unfamiliar with the premed pathway. Most courses can be taken pass/no pass. In general, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking a class pass/no pass unless you want to take it for some reason but don‚Äôt feel like putting effort into it. It‚Äôd be better for you to pad out your GPA with high grade average GE classes like Melc 10. Also look for classes that overlap in requirements like AC and social sciences
Thank you so much!! Do you have any recommendations for easy elective classes or courses that are one unit?
I took 8A first semester and it was fine :/ 

If you took physics in high school, the content is all review. I also didn't have to take any English classes cuz I got a 5 in AP Lit.
Do this (Physics 8A + Chem 1A/L) but take Math 10A and later 10B. I'd recommend this even if you got a 5 on Calc BC, finished linear algebra and multivariable calc and qualified for the IMO. Not only are those courses less difficult but they also fulfill the stats requirement for medical school if you take them together. This means you won't have to take Data 8 or another intro stats course in the future.

If you're feeling ballsy and are down for a 2 unit course you could take Chem 3AL. I took 3AL without having taken 3A and was completely fine with some basic chem knowledge from high school. The course is mostly busywork and the vast majority of the class gets an A.
OP seriously hear me out and take chem 1A & 1AL, math 1A, and english class if you are premed because med schools want to see you take R1A/R1B even if you passed out of it, and a decal or breadth!
Ehhh, not sure if 10A and 10B is worth it cuz you can fulfill the stats requirement later on by taking PBHLTH 142, which conveniently also fulfills an upper div elective requirement for MCB
Do you have any recommendations of professors to take for the classes listed above?
is math 1A a hard course? Im planning on taking it for my very first semester
True, that is pretty convenient. From personal experience though, I was a public health major and took PBHLTH 142 with Kang-Dufour. The course was a major pain in the ass, would not recommend. Curve is indeed generous but the class was poorly organized. Lots of annoying busywork in R and exam questions were not well thought through. Data 8 was worlds better and more useful.

Assuming OP is CDB on Track 2 (most popular) I'd recommend NST 110 and PBHLTH 150B for upperdivs, those courses are insanely easy and will give you more time to pump out research and beef up your AMCAS.
Lowhorn for intro physics and either Marsden or Robak for all chem. If none of them are available just go on BerkeleyTime and filter out professors that have historically awarded the lowest % of A/A-
and Chem 1A?
Not sure if you took 10A/10B yourself, but as someone who took the former it was by far the worst organized class I've taken at Cal, not just logistically but also foundationally. I had gotten a 5 on the calc BC exam before taking it, yet the pace was so egregious that I could barely follow along with the course. The only way that I can see someone doing well under those conditions is if they were able to literally 100% all of their AP Calc tests/exams, and even then they might be pushing into B territory without putting in hours of practice on top of homeworks."
