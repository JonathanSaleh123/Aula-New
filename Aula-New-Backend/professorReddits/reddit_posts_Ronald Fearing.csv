BEGINNINGS: 

On April 20th, 1969, People’s Park was born out of a derelict plot of land the UC had failed to develop into athletic fields. Cal students — like you and me — saw an opportunity to transform the unused land into a new community space. The creation of People’s Park was part of an effort to improve the neighborhood by addressing urban blight and to create a new free speech area distinct from the hotly-contested and police-regulated Sproul Plaza. 

As the park formed, thousands of different people donated food, equipment, trees, flowers, shrubs, and their own labor. A garden, playground, and meadow were constructed out of dirt and rubble. People’s Park became a place where students and residents of all stripes banded together to create a unique public space from the ground up.

OPPOSITION: 

A major facet of California Governor Ronald Reagan’s 1966 campaign was to crack down on California’s “liberal” public universities. He decried Berkeley as ""a haven for communist sympathizers, protesters, and sex deviants” and saw the creation of the park as an opportunity to exercise his power and political might. Reagan ordered the California Highway Patrol and Berkeley Police to occupy and destroy the park, decimating much of what was constructed. A fence was built to prevent any further community development of “university-owned land.”  

On May 15, 1969 up to 4,000 students rallied to protect the park. The police responded with tear gas and violence, as they had routinely done throughout the ‘60s in order to suppress anti-war and civil rights protests. Under the supervision of Reagan's Chief of Staff, Edwin Mease III — a man who prided himself on crushing protestors — police were permitted to use “whatever methods they chose.” Officers obscured their badges (to avoid being identified) as the number of protestors rose to over 6,000. 

As protestors fled from the violence, police opened fire with shotguns into the retreating crowd. Students watched as their friends were gunned down alongside them. Student Alan Blanchard was permanently blinded when he was shot in the head. Freshman Donavan Rundle recalled his intestines being “tucked back inside his body” by classmates as he bled out on the sidewalk. Blanchard, Rundle and 38 others were treated at local hospitals for shotgun wounds, with hundreds more seeking medical care for other grave injuries. Many more were seriously injured and avoided treatment out of fear of arrest. 

One bystander, James Rector, was shot and killed by cops while watching the police violence from the roof of a nearby building. He was twenty-five years old.

MILITARY OCCUPATION OF BERKELEY: 

In light of the mass violence against unarmed protestors, Governor Reagan stated ""once the dogs of war have been unleashed, you must expect things will happen, and that people, being human, will make mistakes on both sides."" He subsequently called in the National Guard to occupy and patrol Berkeley and prevent any further pro-Park activity.

National Guard troops broke up any assemblies of more than four people who congregated for any purpose on the streets of Berkeley, day or night. In the early summer, troops deployed in downtown Berkeley surrounded several thousand protesters and bystanders, emptying businesses, restaurants, and retail outlets of their owners and customers, and arresting them en masse. A memorial service for James Rector was held on Sproul that was attended by thousands, leading to hundreds of arrests. National Guard troops were stationed in front of Berkeley's empty lots and ordered to prevent protesters from planting flowers, shrubs, or trees.

On May 20th, Reagan ordered helicopters to drop teargas on Sproul and Telegraph protestors. Winds dispersed the gas over the entire city, sending school children miles away to hospitals. The airborne deployment of tear gas had not yet been banned from warfare under the Chemical Weapons Convention. In the words of Governor Reagan, ""If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement.""

VICTORY: 

Showing solidarity with students, 177 faculty members said that they were ""unwilling to teach until peace has been achieved by the removal of police and troops."" On May 23, the Berkeley faculty senate endorsed (642 to 95) a proposal by the College of Environmental Designs to have the park become the centerpiece of an experiment in community-generated design. In a separate university referendum, UC Berkeley students voted 12,719 to 2,175 in favor of keeping the park. International attention and outcry forced Reagan and the police to concede. 

THE PARK TODAY

CRIME:

Statistically, there is a high incidence of crime at People’s Park. The majority of this crime is drug use. Some of the people who spend time and live in the park suffer from addiction and mental health issues. As opposed to criminalizing these individuals, why not invest in more humane approaches? The destruction of the park will remove this “eyesore” from the eyes of privileged students, but it will not address any of the underlying issues facing park residents. Gentrifying the park will also displace the dozens of people who reside in the park because they find it to be a safe and welcoming environment. Believe it or not, that’s why so many people choose to congregate there. Poverty is not a crime.

BREAKING DOWN ACTUAL CRIME STATISTICS: 

To those of you who are afraid of these people, why? How many students have actually been victims of crime in Berkeley? Let’s look at the recently-available 2019 crime statistics. 

In 2019, the Murder Rate in Berkeley was 0.01 per 100,000 people, 5x below the national average. The Assault rate was 1.76, well below the national average of 2.50 per 100,000. As for rape and sexual assault, abolishing Greek Life on campus (a necessary step to address Berkeley’s high rape and sexual assault rates) requires an entirely different analysis. 

Okay, so your chances of being a victim of a violent crime are very low. What about property crime? In 2019, Berkeley’s rate was 59.27 per 1,000 people. That makes Berkeley safer than neighboring Oakland and luxurious Miami Beach, Florida, as well as dozens of other major cities around the country. Berkeley’s property crime rate is on par with San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Orlando. 

Rhetoric of safety and instilling a fear of crime has been routinely used to demonize and destroy communities of poor people and people of color. We shouldn’t fall for this age-old fear campaign again. While crime in Berkeley went up in 2020, it also rose in every single major and mid-sized American city due to the pandemic. It’s a fact that Berkeley is not a very dangerous place. 

HOUSING:

UC Berkeley needs to build more housing, but the park is simply not the place. The Chancellor’s office is officially considering building housing on the Upper Hearst Parking Structure and the Oxford Tract, but has elected to proceed with the Park. In recent years, it chose to build the Legends Swimming Complex (because surely Cal needed a fifth swimming pool complex) and the Underhill Parking and Athletic Complex instead of providing more housing. The University has also stated that it has been increasing the number of admitted students disproportionate to the number of available beds. Under the current plan, the People’s Park housing site is expected to create a maximum of 1,000 beds, which would house at most 2% of students. 

A proactive solution would be for the University to stop actively admitting more students than it can support. Furthermore, the UC should start to combat restrictive and archaic City zoning laws that restrict the height of new buildings and specify development types. These outdated laws protect panoramic views of the Bay and hasten gentrification, while preventing the construction of more plentiful and affordable housing for residents and students alike. 

COMMUNITY:

The park is not an empty lot, but a vibrant community for our society’s most vulnerable members. People excluded from other spheres of public life congregate and maintain enduring friendships in the park. Displacing these residents would take away a core component of their daily lives and send the message that privileged students deserve to upend the lives of those they deem inferior in order to enjoy a more insular lifestyle.

SUMMARY:

People’s Park is an emblem of Berkeley’s history of radical, compassionate politics. Building on the park would not only destroy this icon along with the legacy it represents, but also destroy a real, existing community. Paving over a green space used by vulnerable community members would be a final nail in the coffin for any image of Berkeley as an equitable, public university, and cement its transformation into an institution for students from elite backgrounds to preserve their status without worrying about interacting with those they feel are beneath them. We chose to attend Berkeley to improve the world, not to lock ourselves up in the ivory tower, close our eyes, and bulldoze away any reminders of injustice.

You conveniently fail to mention the robbery statistic. Berkeley's 3.37 per 1000 is over 4 times the national average. Robbery is a very violent crime, in case you didn't know. That brings Berkeley's total crime rate to 586 per 100,000, or 59.8% higher than the national average. Why omit this statistic? 

>Okay, so your chances of being a victim of a violent crime are very low.

Compared to either the rest of the state or the nation, no.

No one is holding Oakland up as the pinnacle of public safety. Furthermore, since you apparently are quite the fan of cherry-picking, we are less safe, property crime-wise, than Baltimore, Chicago, and even Detriot.

Furthermore, this entire analysis is nonsense. We are debating People's park, not the city of Berkeley. You yourself note that People's Park has an incredibly elevated crime rate for such a small parcel of land. That is why it is dangerous.

Irrelevant. People's park should still be built on. Every bed built is a win.

I totally agree. People's park should still be built on. All of these things should occur simultaneously.

The rest of your argument is entirely rhetorical, so I won't bother.

 People's Park should be torn down. The new building that houses hundreds if not thousands will serve as a symbol that the purpose of the University is to educate people to think critically and act rationally, not become swept up in the rose-tinted nostalgia of an era that they never even experienced.
Very good job on this. I get booed for it."
