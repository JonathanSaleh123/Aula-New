Glad to hear they're finally doing this.
This is awesome. Really pumped to search through some of the old stuff. Will be interesting to see what the daily cal wrote the day Stanford was established in 1891 =).
I hope these get up loaded to the Internet Archive.

ya i'm good
Tuesday - November 15, 1910.


This past weekend, The Blue and Gold triumphed over the Cardinal 25-6 in the annual Big Game held at California Field, crowning a fantastic season.  Even though this was to be the final bout for our seniors playing the game of rugby, there are current talks of facing the ruggers from up north across the border from Victoria, British Columbia, as they will be making a southern tour this winter.

As all good students were gaily joining the serpentine about the field, I wandered away to sit upon the greatest place on campus from which to gaze upon the coeds. As any person knows it is the Senior Bench which has the greatest views, so it was there I started my search for a companion for that afternoon.  The author will not mention  enough specifics to possibly offend or disgrace any of the lovely ladies of the campus, but I assure you, the views were stunning that day!  All decked out in dresses sporting ribbons and bows of Blue or Gold, they were quite the sight as they left the bleachers and walked through the campus, though there were a pelican or two who passed by, though I still made sure to give them a look for generosity, considering how good the day had been.  

There I sat in my officer's uniform so that all ladies would know of my character, before a gentle young creature was possessed to stop and return my stare, a very uncommon and rare occurrence.  Most coeds upon seeing that attentions being paid by those perched upon the Senior Bench usually bustled by without a look, knowing full well it could lead to some quite unscrupulous and personal conversations.  Yet this coed with the most enchanting smile and pretty ribbons festooning her dress had returned my gaze.  I was quite struck by the gesture, and I must confess was struck silent for a moment.

After coming to my senses, I quickly doffed my cap and rose to my feet with a grin, eager to make her acquaintance, and endeavored to find out where she was headed and upon what business she was attending, that I might find some way to assist her in some manner.  After finding out that she had a desire to walk about the oaks to the north and that she desired an escort for such a trip, my arm eagerly looped about hers and discreetly guided her to the quiet grove where our quiet congress and intercourse on the subject of her studies and my own are not to be shared in this column, for our mutual respectability.

Dammit you beat me to it.
It says there there is already a site they have created and posted 1964's Daily Cal's to.  It's [newsprint.dailycal.org](http://newsprint.dailycal.org).
Good show.

Don't play with my emotions like that.
You had better not be the MicMan from Saturday talking about that gorilla.
He was more than just a gorilla"
