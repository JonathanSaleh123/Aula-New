Has there ever been a transfer student who was able to work in a super competitive BAIR lab like Pieter Abbeel or Jitendra Malik?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xvtogo/has_there_ever_been_a_transfer_student_who_was/,2022-10-04 16:09:46,It seems all the students who managed to work with these legends are non-transfer students. I think time is the most important reason but still quite depressing,"There are many other (and better) labs than Abbeel and Malik
Transfer student here.  In my second semester, working at BAIR under a reputable professor in computer vision & embedded systems.  Stop stressing.  These labs aren't the end of the earth.  Calm down.  Find something you are passionate about.  Work on it independently.  Find a professor working on a similar topic and cold email them.  Bam, you have a position
Do you have an A in 189?
Don't look for labs based on prestige or competitiveness: look for labs based on your interest. If you're not interested in vision or RL but you care deeply about NLP, then these ""competitive"" labs are pretty useless for you.
My guy. You get jnto MIT, Stanford, CalTech by doing good research work not working in Pieter or Jitendra lab. The path of least resistant is to do research in an assistant prof lab that you enjoy since they most likely won’t have any absurd requirements for you to participate in their research.

Maybe if you had previous AI lab experience prior to transferring they would consider your application. You could even have reached out to one of those profs your freshman or sophomore year.
I mean those labs are hard to get into too
which classes did you take and what were you're grades if you're okay with saying them? and when did you apply/cold email
Professor Kurt Keutzer?
Yes! But I haven't taken 182 or 126 or 127 yet..
But isn't the name of the one who writes the LOR the most important? I always hear that if you can secure a good LOR from a superstar, you can go anywhere and if the writer isn't that famous, the LOR might not be good enough to get into a super competitive labs
as a freshman or sophomore at a community college??
Not rly, Abbeel is almost hyperbolic in his requirements for undergrad researchers. If you can get past “prestige”, go find a grad student project who is happy to give you a learning opportunity and integrate you in the experimentation process instead of using you as a code monkey.
At the time, I had just transferred and took cs 70.  I did terribly in cs 70, but had reputable embedded systems background.
Then just cold email. If they like you and your previous experience you’ll get in. 189 is the biggest hurdle for transfers as they likely can’t take it till senior year
I think people like Pieter and Jitendra are more well connected, but younger professors are just starting their careers and your success is more important to their success. For your undergrad research, it kind of matters?, but I think it’s less important. More important is to just do good work. If you publish a nature paper under an assistant no name prof and get glowing letters from him, it doesnt matter who signed that letter. A professor from berkeley still said u are amazing and you still got a paper published in nature. Assuming you’re not an insufferable personality and your grades are decent, that’s basically an admission in to all the top universities.
Yeah I knew some people at CC who did research with university profs… they had some kind of connection though I’m not sure what it was exactly. Even without the proper intro you could probably cold email or even just go to Abbeel’s office hours in person to meet him.
Thanks for your response. I'm in the same boat rn and I'm in CS 70. wdym by ""reputable' btw? Any internships/research exp?
Can i join super competitive labs with only 189?
Both internships and research.
No you have to have other things. Either exceptional coursework or previous experience. 189 is the hurdle to applying. Just email link resume explain in succinct but extreme depth why you want to contribute to their work and you’ll be considered
Did you get research experience at community college ? Damn
Thank you so much for the help!
Yes."
