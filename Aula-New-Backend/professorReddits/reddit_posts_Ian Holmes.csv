Best upper division BioE classes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mv28x6/best_upper_division_bioe_classes/,2021-04-20 15:34:02,"Hey, I wanted to take one of these two upper div BioE classes, but there isn’t a lot of (recent) info about the Professors and their classes.

1) BioE C131 (Introduction to Computational Molecular and Cell Biology) with Ian Holmes

2) BioE 147 (Principals of Synthetic Biology) with Adam Arkin

Any thoughts?","131 is relatively easy and so is 145. Both are pretty interesting from an intro and broad brush bio material standpoint.  But much of the comp and math part is pretty basic.  At least from a CS and Compbio perspective.  Both profs are highly accomplished, good to know them personally, but average as teachers. Don’t know about others.  CS 176 if it is ever offered again on the other hard is hard af but really good class.
Heard 131 was hard but didn't take it personally so don't know
CS 176 is hard af in the middle (Fall22). harder for me than any upper div CS class I've taken, but I liked a the first part of the course a lot. 131 was much easier/friendlier for pure BioE students that want some introduction to relevant coding (dynamic programming / ML) without the same depth of understanding for the algorithms or theoretical proofs that you'll have to learn quickly for 176."
