CS 70 Alistair Sinclair and Yun S. Song lectures,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/c5julu/cs_70_alistair_sinclair_and_yun_s_song_lectures/,2019-06-25 19:39:08,Why were they taken down? and did anyone download them?,"My guess is that they took it down to encourage people to go to live lectures this semester.
but I heard that other professors wanted them to be taken down.. asking since next sem I have the same profs so idk if there'll be webcast lol
When I took 70 with Song/Sinclair, they originally did not want to webcast. They only ended up webcasting so that more people can be enrolled in the class.
Because restricting access to information/education always turns out [so great](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/why-uc-berkeley-is-restricting-access-to-thousands-of-online-lecture-videos/2017/03/15/074e382a-08c0-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.7d12bfa83ab8) . Sigh.. I hate humanity sometimes
ohh I see huh that's odd, thank you!
After reading the article it seems Berkeley didn't have much of a choice or am I wrong.
Yeah they were forced to by the court, I was more making a statement about how Berkeley already had a problem and had to restrict lecture access from nonstudents, and how it was disappointing that professors want to restrict it from students as well.
thank you for the information! that's really annoying :/"
Alistair Sinclair vs Babak Ayazifar for CS 70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/br75t7/alistair_sinclair_vs_babak_ayazifar_for_cs_70/,2019-05-20 23:56:06,"Who’s the best professor for CS 70? I initially planned to take 70 in Spring 2020 with Babak because I want to take IMT DeCal next semester. However, because IMT DeCal isn’t offered next sem, I might consider taking CS 70 next semester. What should I do to prep for 70? For reference, I’ve only taken two math classes: MATH 1A and B with Paulin (I got A+ in both)","They’re both great professors but Sinclair has an enchanting British accent if you’re into that kinda thing
Can’t speak to Babak, but I had Sinclair when I was a student and he was pretty good. Not the best I had at Berkeley, but one of the better ones. He’s also a super smart guy who does really cool research—which is a nice bonus for a class like this—but he is a good teacher, on top of that.
I thought Babak was fantastic, but I also only watched two of his lectures (lol). I've heard nothing but good things about song and sinclair.

W.r.t. preparing for 70, it's a strange class to prep for. TBH I feel it's very much a class where you either get it or you don't. Your A+es in 1a and 1b are good signs but not guarantees by any means; the competition in 70 will likely be significantly stronger.

If you really want to overkill-prep for the class, try reading through the course notes from this semester. They're fantastic, and I did well in the class pretty much exclusively learning from them. You really have to go through them slowly though, you won't get anything at all out of skimming them. (I.e. convince yourself of all the proofs, do some of the optional exercises, maybe mark them up, etc.)
I’d do ayazifar for the no homework option personally. It saves a lot of stress. And if you really need to declare then you will probably already have a strong enough incentive to do the homework on a regular basis."
Should I drop 61c?,https://i.redd.it/qjyskkz9upbc1.jpeg,2024-01-10 17:43:34,"For reference, I got an B+ in 61a and A in 61b. Is it worth finishing the 61 series now, or delaying 61c for a semester?","That 11am -2pm break

Cs70 + 61c was high workload imo.  Idk ur exact situation but if ur trying to declare cs I’d drop it since u alr have 20 units.  Otherwise it’s best to get it over with
It depends on your situation, what your major in, what class are you, and what you are shooting for for a grade. In general, when these types of posts are done, you have to give full disclosure.
20 units is a lot but besides that u should be good. Just stay on top of the course work.
(lol i would personally drop physics cuz Ronnie sucks ass and the course staff is wack too) 

Lisa Yan is the best professor i have ever had so it might be worth it to take 61c just for that (imo better than Dan). and if you don’t need to declare then i would drop 70 (cuz of workload) and/or do what i first said (cuz of personal opinions lol)

BioE, but yeah college of engineering so no need to declare"
CS 70 With Sinclair?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8chlbj/cs_70_with_sinclair/,2018-04-15 12:35:16,"I'm going to be taking CS 70 in the fall, and Alistair Sinclair will be teaching the course. Since he hasn't taught the course in six years (?), I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on how he is as a professor, how much work/difficulty to expect, etc. to get a B+ or higher in the class.","I was a GSI for 70 the last time Sinclair taught it, in 2012, just before he stopped teaching to direct the Simons institute. He's extremely clear, well organized, and has a great British accent. Overall highly recommended.

The difficulty of the course depends enormously on your background. It's not hard to get a B+ if you understand the material, but if you don't have prior experience with proof-based math you might have to put in a lot more effort to get to that level. Take notes in class, review them carefully, do *all* the homework problems (work with friends so you don't get stuck, but make sure you solve all the problems yourself since that's how you learn), go to office hours liberally.
I don’t think any student at the school can speak for Sinclair rn since it’s been so long, but you should prob just take the class anyways. The lower divs are so standardized that you’ll learn the same information regardless of whose teaching it, and the curve is largely determined by department guidelines. The difficulty of the hw and test are obviously a factor to consider but imo the bigger factor is how important cs 70 is as a pre req to other classes so you should still take it as soon as possible.
I don't think matters and Prof Sinclair is a good professor. CS 70 is a very standard course on discrete mathematics and probability. Since it's very important, it's not a good idea to defer it. Don't worry about it, just take it."
