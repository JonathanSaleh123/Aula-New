Ron Hassner 

Edward Lempert","Iâ€™m taking a class with Ted Lempert right now. Heâ€™s great, and since he used to be in the California Assembly he has lots of inside knowledge/stories and first hand experience about politics in California. Really interesting stuff.
People tend to really like Hassner and his classes fill up the quickest (by far)
I've heard good things about Hassner and he teaches the super popular war class. Just remember PS5 is a pre-req for the class.
I took PS124A with Ron Hassner and I highly recommend taking any of his classes. His lectures are interesting and he designs his tests to be extremely straightforward by providing lots of prep.
Ohh I see that sounds really cool,  thank you!
ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ll make note of that! Thank you!
Hassner is amazing!!
PS5 prereq is no longer enforced (or they at least didn't enforce it last semester)"
