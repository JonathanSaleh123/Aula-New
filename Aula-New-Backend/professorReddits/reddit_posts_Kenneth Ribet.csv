Math H113 with James Conway and math 110 with Kenneth Ribet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/diz21d/math_h113_with_james_conway_and_math_110_with/,2019-10-16 18:14:36,"I'm planning to take math H113 with James Conway and math 110 with Kenneth Ribet next semester after completing math H54 this semester. For those who have taken math classes with any one of these professors, how do you feel about their classes and their teaching? Any advice is much appreciated.","Ribet is very chill and cares more about you appreciating math than rigorously learning the material. Personally found his exams to be easy and straightforward, but he expect lots of writing/justification.
You shouldn't have issues with Ribet's 110.  It'll be a fun class.

One thing about H113 with Conway is that he'll use Artin.  That's a (difficult) book that covers the material of 110 and 113 at the same time, and it expects that you've taken a course like 110 before(he uses that material to generate examples for motivation).  It could either be illuminating or difficult to understand, but try looking at some chapters to see if the material from 54 is enough to follow the examples.
Ribet is an incredible professor and he really cares about the students here. If you add him on facebook, he posts when he will be eating at the faculty club and he encourages everyone to join him. Also, if you didn't already know, Ribet proved that the epsilon conjecture is true, which Andrew Wiles needed to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. I havent taken Conway, but I've heard he is great as well. Taking Math 113 and 110 together is a great idea... you will learn a lot!
I'm taking regular 113 with Conway rn, and he is a great lecturer, but he uses Artin's Algebra textbook, which is a higher level read than most 113 books, using a lot of concepts typically taught with a 110 background, and his lectures are very proof-based, as he doesn't usually give much examples for something that really needs examples (i.e. quotient groups, dihedral groups, Orbit-Stabilizer Thm, etc). Additionally, idk if it's just me, but I find it difficult to keep up with his lectures unless I read the textbook ahead of time to understand what he's talking about. 

As for 110 with Ribet, although I have not taken a class with him, according to what people who have told me, absolutely go for it. Such a chill professor, and you'll learn a lot

Other than that, MUSA has Peer advising tomorrow, where you can ask people who've taken these classes if its worth it or not, so let me know if you're interested.

Hope this helps :)
I’m also taking H54 this semester (alongside 53 and 55) and intend to take H113 and 110 next semester... small world, eh? I was at the MUSA event today and talked to someone who took H113, who said when he took it the professor covered all of 113, 114 and the beginning of 250A. After that talk, I emailed prof Conway, who replied saying he hadn’t planned the class yet, but that I should get back to him in around a month, at which time he’d be able to tell me what his goals are (hinting at a rigorous foray into Artin). Regardless, by mid November you can probably reach out to him too and see what he’ll cover. I’m of the philosophy that foreknowledge of what he plans to cover, coupled with self-study during winter break, will allow me to circumvent any issues that may arise either from lack of experience on my end or any potential pedagogical oversight on his.
I'm taking 113 with Conway right now and I really like his lectures. I might take math 130 under him next semester just because I enjoy his style so much. I say go for H113 if you're looking for a good prof and don't care about GPA that much, because I think it's harder to get a good grade in the honors classes (they're more competitive).

I didn't find 110 super hard and if you liked 54 then it should be a good fit. Also I have heard only great things about Ribet.

Looks like a great schedule to me :)
Do you recommend taking 110 with him?
What about Conway himself, is he a good lecturer?
What is MUSA? I am a freshman so I might not have heard of it before. How do I find out more about it?
All 113 classes should cover the beginning of 250, it's just basic properties of groups. The only difference is Lang lol
Another student in H54 this semester, based on what I've read here I'm looking forward to 110 with Ribet. I can't wait to move past the algebras, so I'm hoping to get 113 done in the summer.
Which professor do you have for H54? Maybe we are in the same class haha.
Do I need a lot of 110 background for H113? I'm still unsure if I could handle honors upper div math classes.
Sure, I took 55 with him. He’s also famous and very sweet.
Conway is a fine lecturer.  I'll also mention that if you took H54, you'll probably be fine with the examples in H113.  Just make sure you have some experience writing proofs beforehand (not sure where you're at with that) because no one is going to show you how to write a proof in H113.
Not sure, haven't taken a class with him.
MUSA (Mathematics Undergrad Student Association) is the primary math club on campus, and they have an event Peer Advising night at 6pm in 1015 Evans, where you can get peer advisers who have taken these classes to help you through Spring 2020 class schedule
I don't think so. In my 113 section we have only gone over a few examples involving groups of matrices and such, but that doesn't use knowledge from 110 really (it's mostly 54 stuff).

110 will reteach linear algebra in a completely proof-based style that you may have seen in H54 (I didn't get the chance to take H54 or H53 so idk if that's how it is) and more concepts not covered in the intro linear algebra course.
I took CS70, would that suffice?
Oh, is that open to everyone? Or you have to be part of the group to join them?

Oh I see, sounds like its gonna be interesting and fun! Thanks for answering my question. :)
CS 70 is fine :)
Yes, probably.  That would depend a lot on how you felt about writing proofs in 70.  
My suggestion would be, go into H113 with a cautious but open mind, and if the first week or so is overly stressful, swap over to a regular 113 section.  Nothing wrong with those.  Thing is, H113 has always been taught be Wodzicki (and a small number of other very silly professors) who makes the class into a bit of a wild ride.  Oh, don't take anything with Wodzicki by the way.  We don't really have any idea how Conway will do H113 because usually H113 is just kind of... thrown to the dogs.
Open to everyone
Haha, sounds kind of scary, but I guess I'll just give it a try. Thanks :).
Oh sounds good. Thanks!! :)
Just keep in mind that you're never bound to these things when you enroll!  There's no reason to stick with something like that if you don't feel ready for it when the semester starts.  Especially when it's a math honors class, which really doesn't matter a whole lot beyond interest (and it might prepare you a bit better for possible grad courses).
How hard are his exams and his grading?"
