Stat 88 Wooseok Ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i7nu1k/stat_88_wooseok_ha/,2020-08-11 01:10:52,Has anyone taken a class with this professor? If so please let me know what the class was like! Thank you.,"Prof Ha has never taught this course before, so no one can give specifics on the specifics of him and stat88.

I have lots of experience with 88, and I had Ha for another class, so I can give some general tips.

The best way to succeed with stat88 is constant engagement with the material. That is,

- go to lecture, write down what’s on the board, ask questions during lecture if you’re confused, try to put away distractions since connections in topics can go by quick 
- after lecture, read the textbook. It’s a great textbook as it was written by Prof. Adhikari herself. The textbook contents should be almost verbatim from the lecture, so reviewing it afterward is a good way to ensure you grasped the concepts and review proofs that might have gone too quickly in lecture
- **go to discussion section**. The problems worked through in section are chosen and designed to **explicitly mirror** the homework problems to give you some problem solving tips ahead of time 
- start the homework early, not the day before it’s due, else you won’t absorb anything
- take a stab at the homework yourself for a day or two. Think about the problems. If you’re stuck, see if you can find a similar problem done in lecture, section, or the homework as guidance for how to solve 
- If you’re still stuck, go to office hours and ask questions. There are many office hours throughout the week, and the staff and Prof Ha are friendly and happy to answer questions.

The revamped version of Stat88 is interesting and engaging - you’ll learn a lot of cool stuff that delves deeper than data8. There’s a lot of material that flies by quickly though, so it’s important not to fall behind. 

Good luck and enjoy!
Thank you! Would you recommend this over Stat 20?
I have a biased answer to this, as I never took stat 20 and I’m partial to ds- focused courses.

I think that if you enjoyed Data8, want to know more about some light math behind some of the data8 topics, and don’t mind some intensity, you can get a LOT out of this course.

However, I think I did hear that 88 is a bit more intense than 20 (not by a lot but it’s not a coasting sort of course), and if you’re just taking 88 to check of a pre-req and don’t care about statistics, then 20 might be better. It would be good to get some opinions of people who took 20! 

The course material for 88 is online at stat88.org if you want to check it out! Textbook is linked as well.
As a separate heads-up: stat 88 is 3 units and may not fill the same reqs that 20 does, even of you petition your advisor"
Stat 88 with Wooseok Ha for Econ transfer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hazre4/stat_88_with_wooseok_ha_for_econ_transfer/,2020-06-17 13:45:28,"Give me the run down folks. How's the class/the professor? Also, I heard that Data 8/stat 88 is the way to go for Econ major prereqs. Can anyone give their experience? Thanks.",I’m taking this class too! I looked up the prof and seems like he is new.
