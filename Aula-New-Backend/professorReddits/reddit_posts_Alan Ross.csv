UGBA107 Summer Session with Alan Ross,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gpe10z/ugba107_summer_session_with_alan_ross/,2020-05-23 15:27:11,"I just enrolled in the business course, UGBA107 for the summer but am also taking UGBA155 and have an internship. How hard and time consuming is UGBA 107 in the summer? Is it definitely something manageable in addition to what else I have going on?  Or, would you suggest taking 1 of the 3 things off my plate? Is UGBA 155 pretty easy? Thanks!!","Im planning to take 155 too! Looking at the grade distributions, 155 looks pretty easy.. over 65% of the class got some sort of A last summer so you should probably be okay
Okay, good to know! For UGBA155, did you have to purchase a license for $27 for the first pre class assignment called SLPI 360?"
"Star Parker, a conservative activist, visited Alan Ross' Political Science 179 to address issues of urban poverty. She offered five policy proposals including ending abortion subsidies and welfare entitlement reform. She'd requested anonymity prior to event because she was concerned for her safety.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/04/13/conservative-activist-star-parker-speaks-urban-poverty-campus-class/,2017-04-13 23:45:49,,"From the description of her views given, I probably don't agree with most of them, however I am very glad she spoke to the class because I think that exposure to a wide variety of political beliefs makes for the most complete and best political science education. 

Also, I do think that a collapse of ethics is partially responsible for some of society's ills...though I may not agree with her proposed ways of fixing them. I think that had I heard her in person, I would be better fleshing out my own ideas right about now, as perhaps the students are doing, and which is usually a good thing. I am glad that she was received respectfully.
When I took PS179 we had the chair of the CA GOP (I think) come speak to us. I didn't have any problems with the guy speaking but I only agreed with him in the area of personal privacy/surveillance issues. Otherwise he talked about how liberals wanted everyone to ride bikes and live in high rises; no SUV's, no homes or whatever. 

He also took a couple minutes to explain how the transition to low-flush toilets crippled the sewer system in the bay area at the time. That was an unforeseen consequence so a lot of money had to be spent to revamp the sewer system so it could accommodate the lower flows of water--but I'm not sure I took away the message he was trying to send. At that time the drought in CA was in full force, so if he was trying to advocate for elimination of ""wasteful regulation"" then he was doing a pretty terrible job.

Anyways, with all that his talk went off without a hitch. It was absurd, but it didn't need me acting out to emphasize that point."
"Election: Lecturer Alan Ross was most surprised by the lack of enthusiasm toward Hillary Clinton among his students. Maureen Ochi Sides witnessed 3 professors break down in tears. The campus Progressive Student Association, or PSA, has seen a dramatic increase in attendance at its weekly meetings.",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/12/12/uc-berkeley-community-reflects-divisive-election-looks-forward/,2016-12-12 22:03:49,,"Thank you for mentioning the Progressive Student Association - it's so progressive! I hadn't heard of it before, so I will definitely check it out!
The traditional and expected thing for a progressive (shit-poster) like yourself to do would be to like the Progressive Student Association. If you truly want to do something new and unexpected (and progressive), then you should hate it."
"Councilmembers and mayoral candidates Jesse Arreguin and Laurie Capitelli spoke Wednesday during Political Science 179, a campus political science class.

"The Haas decision to not extend P/NP, then prevent people pursuing simultaneous degrees in L&S to P/NP is atrocious",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zhd4vz/the_haas_decision_to_not_extend_pnp_then_prevent/,2022-12-09 16:00:55,"Most of my Haas GSIs didn't strike because they already had cushy jobs, and my business ethics professor didn't even acknowledge the strike, saying that he hasn't been keeping up with the news. The fact that Haas admin is preventing us from even using P/NP for our other classes in our simultaneous degrees makes no sense. 

I'm so disappointed with how little Haas and my business professors and GSIs have engaged with this whole situation. If you feel similarly, here's a [petition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HK2nSOWe8mHJVyhiNzpVMmdQCuzM1VM6yIRtxslZIpY/edit?fbclid=IwAR0AbbKWqKD1CTRmIXk9AHcY68KGWrSQHSlA7fKJ-8yjvKlXlaO-j7_Zc3I) to sign. In all honesty, I don't think it will do much, but at least it's something.","Agreed... Why tf can't I pnp classes for my L&S major? I understand enforcing grades Haas classes but why do they get to decide what I do with another college
this is exactly how i‚Äôd expect haas to react
Look, it's not Haas's fault you couldn't pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

Ross' humor has escaped you.
Wait how can Haas stop us from using pnp for our simultaneous degree requirements? How do you know about that>
Alan Ross is the üêê can‚Äôt be saying that about him

That's actually so unfair. How can they not understand that the strike has affected l&s classes a lot:("

Lots of DeCals haven‚Äôt been posted on the courses page yet, so you still have time to find an open one as they get approved and added.

Alan Ross‚Äô Wednesday afternoon PoliSci 179 colloquium class?
I just enrolled! What's the class like?
It‚Äôs fun. He brings interesting speakers about various political issues. Usually it‚Äôs pretty lively. Occasionally there‚Äôs a dud but he tries to weed them out."
"Daily Cal criticizes Alan Ross's decision to include only two of the four mayoral candidates to speak to his Political Science 179 class ‚Äî excluding Guy ""Mike"" Lee, a member of the homeless community, and Naomi Pete. Ross's exclusion ""shows a remarkable lack of respect for the democratic process"".",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/02/02/let-the-candidates-speak/,2016-02-02 20:33:16,,"[deleted]
I had Ross before. He probably realized that few people actually wanted to listen to Lee. He's not obligated to let any of them speak at a lecture series that he hosts; Ross can pick whatever speakers he wants.
If Lee has any popular support whatsoever then he should start gathering signatures.

If a candidate wants to run for office it is incumbent upon them to demonstrate that they have supporters. If you give a platform to anybody who wants to run simply because they want to run you end up with anarchy.
Dramatic much?"
