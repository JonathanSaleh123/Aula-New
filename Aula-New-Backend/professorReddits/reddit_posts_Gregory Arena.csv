* **Strict rules that must be followed during this AMA**

**No harrassing or disrespectful questions. Remain professional at all times during this AMA.**
#

Critical questions will not be removed. You can be as critical of the ASUC as you want, and the ASUC is prepared to answer all of your burning questions, but you must ask these questions in a respectful manner. 

**No questions about specific parties or candidates.**
#

I do not want this subreddit to become an arena for either promoting or disparaging specific ASUC parties/candidates. The *only* scenario in which a specific party or candidate may be mentioned is if it's in regards to something else, and the name is used as an example or otherwise neutral side-piece. Even then, I'll probably remove that comment and ask you to reword it.

**People are watching.**
#

University officials are aware of these AMAs and I implore that you act accordingly. Every comment in every AMA will be held to the highest scrutiny. Again, that doesn't mean critical comments will be removed. I will never remove even very critical comments as long as they are asked in an appropriate manner.

Looking forward to your questions and let's make this another successful AMA. 

**Go Bears!**
