"TIL that Berkeley professors Andrew Isaacs, Armando Fox, and Vern Paxson are scouts for Sequoia Capital",http://www.wsj.com/articles/secretive-sprawling-network-of-scouts-spreads-money-through-silicon-valley-1447381377,2015-11-12 20:05:41,,"[deleted]
There's an easy way to get around it. Open the article, then click the email button on the left. Paste the link into your browser and you bypassed the paywall.

Or just click this link: http://on.wsj.com/20Qc8D1 
Go to the following page

http://www.capitalistconcept.com/post/6557763377/wall-street-journal-verses-the-financial-times

and at the bottom there's a link that signs you into the author's WSJ account. Now you can read any article!
Can you do this with the Financial Times? WSJ is practically free (12$ for a 12 week subscription), but the FT can be pretty pricey. 
Yes, you can do so using the Google news trick. Google News has partnerships with publishers to allow users to view three free articles per day (their ""[first click free](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/09/first-click-free-update.html)"" policy). You can abuse this for free articles.

Example: Take an article you want to read (like [this one]( http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/11/11/2144531/the-euro-was-pointless/)), then search for the article title in google news. Click the link from there and you will be able to read it for free.

To get around the ""three per day"" limit, do this in an incognito/private browsing window.
fun fact: FT is MORE expensive if you try to get the subscription as a ""student"" vs the normal option. fml

Thank you so much. You are awesome!
Good thing I'm not a student anymore! (Either way it is too pricey for me)
