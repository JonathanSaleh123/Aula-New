What the fuck? that's some Hannibal Lecter shit
There is an incredibly chilling trend of sexual harassment at this campus. Everything is coming out, now that strong women across the campus have the courage to step up and speak out against the terrible transgressions that they have faced from men in power who want to exploit women. The university has utterly failed in its effort to keep female students safe.
Theyre hot.  Theyd want to get on with things and stop sueing just cause someone showed interest in them. Good bye future career as any employer wouldnt touch them with a barge pole when they see this on their record."

"Blake Wentworth, a faculty member in the department of south and south-east Asian studies, whose case is still pending, allegedly told a graduate student: ""I could lose my job over this … but I’m so attracted to you."" He once allegedly came behind the female student and cupped his hand over her ear.",http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/06/uc-berkeley-staff-sexual-harassment-scandal,2016-04-06 21:06:56,,"[deleted]
Cupped his hand over her ear?  What?
Please at least give it some time before you make any accusations, his case is still pending.

I've taken a couple classes with Blake and he was my favorite teacher at Cal by far. Just the nicest, most interesting guy who really passionately loved his field. It's hard for me to believe he would do something like this.

If it turns out he did it, accuse away. But, at least wait until the case is no longer pending. 
This sucks.  Anderson was my DSP counselor and seemed like a really great dude, but it just goes to show that even nice people can make stupid fucking mistakes and use their power for evil/not good.  Here's hoping Cal takes out the trash sooner than later.
Honest question (you can downvote but this is for discussions sake): Does Berkeley have a higher number of ""sexual law breakers"" or are there more whistleblowers here driven by our stronger PC culture? Maybe the same thing happens at UCLA and UCSB but less people speak out?
Telling someone you think they are attractive is not a crime, and hardly unethical. On the other hand, being overly persistent about it can toe the line on harassment. 

Obviously the cupping of his hand over her ear begs for some needed context, but that sounds like he crossed a serious line.
You must ask the question within the question: how hard is it?

U of I student here. About 35-40k students and our SA rates are probably comparable, adjusting for certain variables. We get 2-3 non-mandatory 'mandatory' surveys, seminars, workshops a week. Lots of damage control after the Salaita lawsuit and just in general to prevent protests/revolts/boycotts/etc. Also hired new diverse faculty and are putting tons of money in a lot of new sj-related departments. Just a matter of how soon you can prevent that powder keg from going off. You guys were already susceptible after BLM, so any sj-related incidents (even the facile ones) only zero in that ever present microscope.
Telling 'someone' they're attractive is fine. Telling a grad student that, when you're faculty member, is messed up. There's an inherent power imbalance there and that student's going to feel awkward as hell around him forever, wondering if he'll escalate his behavior.
Yeah. This seems to be the thing that people need to be taught when it comes to sexual harassment. I didn't understand where the line is drawn either when I was younger.

The risk of the sexual advance being unwanted makes it so that you should avoid it, especially when you are in a position of power. A student worrying about their grades being affected because they rejected a sexual advance introduces a major conflict of interest.

In the workplace with peer coworkers (not superiors), the power you have over someone is that they rely on their job for their income, so they are forced to work with you. A single mistake isn't a problem, but repeated harassment does become an issue, creates a hostile work environment for the person rejecting the advances.
Apparently not, if you want to keep your job.
