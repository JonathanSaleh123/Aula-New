Fired employees: Cal Dining general manager Jeffrey Topacio in 2015 bragged to workers about his penis size and said a homophobic slur to a crying male worker. Adjunct professor of statistics Howard Dâ€™Abrera in 2015 sent a student a series of sexually harassing emails and spoke of killing himself.,http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/UC-Berkeley-previously-fired-7-employees-for-7230620.php,2016-04-06 21:05:47,,"Oh shit, I had D'abrera for stats about 2 years ago and always thought that he was an asshole that clearly played favoritism. Looking through his emails, the stuff he talks about like having orgies and giving the guy an F if he didn't accept his invitation to Australia is pretty sick. I guess this explains the whole controversy a while back where he up and quit mid semester. 

His investigation by the OPHD is an interesting read. Starts on pg 428:

D'abrera sounds like a character from Always Sunny.
