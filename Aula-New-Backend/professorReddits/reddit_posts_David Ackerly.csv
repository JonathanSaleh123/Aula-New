Spring schedule advice (pls help ðŸ˜” ),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jhknfk/spring_schedule_advice_pls_help/,2020-10-24 18:09:25,"I'm a freshman and kind lost on what classes to take. Rn I'm taking; math 1b, r1a, and anthro3ac. I'm also intended mcb. what would you think about this schedule?

Next semester I'm thinking about

1. chem 1a/1al with alexis shusterman
2. bio 1b with  David D. Ackerly, Bruce G Baldwin, John P. Huelsenbeck, Joshua D Povich
   1. would this class fill up fast???
3. not sure any good recs? I'm thinking of minoring in human rights so maybe a class for that?
4. lastly, i do want to try to take some sort of public health seminar and see if that's something i am interested in ... would also love any recs if u have any :)
