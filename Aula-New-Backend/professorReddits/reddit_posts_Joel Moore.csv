Thoughts on Physics 141A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w6c8gl/thoughts_on_physics_141a/,2022-07-23 12:37:31,Anyone taken Physics 141A? Joel Moore is teaching it. Thoughts on the professor too? Planning to take it with Math 110 and Physics 137B.,"I took 137a with Joel Moore in Fall 2020. Overall, he was very accommodating and nice. Not sure if he was the best instructor but I am def giving him the benefit of the doubt because it was the first full online semester and 137a was very basic and it’s kind of hard to systematically teach someone very intuitive (for him). I heard that 141a is also an easy class so it won’t be too much of a trouble.
Thank you for your response!"
