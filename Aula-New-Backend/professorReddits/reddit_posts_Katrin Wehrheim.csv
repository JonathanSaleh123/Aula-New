Kelli Talaska or Katrin Wehrheim for Math 54?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ya0adv/kelli_talaska_or_katrin_wehrheim_for_math_54/,2022-10-21 11:03:42,lol rate my prof is scaring me,"Well I’m in talaska 10a and there is no rhyme or reason to it, she randomly decided to cancel this weeks quiz and have two quizzes next week instead because ‘her cat bit her’?
I heard Wehrheims grading is far better
Yeah lol after seeing both ratings I realized I’m fucked either way
i do not recommend katrin wehrheim if you want to actually learn the material. super weird how the class was structured imo.
DO NOT TAKE WEHRHEIM.  SOME WHAT EASY A BUT THE PAIN IS UNBEARABLE TO THE POINT WHERE IT ISNT WORTH
After seeing the ratings, I am probably gonna skip MATH 54 and just take MATH 110
i say if ur ready to work talaska is prob better; her grading might be a lil bit harsh, but her lectures and hw are reasonable (at least they were for 53).
katrin is not a good lecturer.  I didnt learn hardly anything. im lucky to have taken 16a after that where i actually learned linalg
Kelli made me cry.
Needs a Diet Coke to heal the cut
very on brand - happy to know that some things never change
FAAAAR better. My only A+ at cal was their 54 class. But like the others said - you won’t learn shit
can you expand? lol 

if the class is an easy a, why is the pain unbearable?
if somebody makes you cry. you punch them
LMFAOOO NAH THIS ONE IS FUEL AHAHA"
any advice for math 54 w/ prof. katrin wehrheim?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/106y5i2/any_advice_for_math_54_w_prof_katrin_wehrheim/,2023-01-08 15:37:57,"wehrheim's rate my professor reviews are scaring me a little :,( people say their class is easy to get a good grade in but then say the class is painful, but that doesnt make sense bc if the class is easy (no midterm/final), why is it unbearable?","from what i heard, wehrheim is not very good at teaching, so ppl can find themselves struggling in classes that needs the knowledge from math 54. so it’s painful for future classes, but if you don’t need 54 knowledge, it should be fine. if necessary, i believe paulin has all his lectures videos from math 54 on his website.
Highly recommend enrolling in the slc adjunct. Ended with an A+ without attending any lectures and learned a decent amount from the adjunct (1.5 hours, 2 times a week)
Wehrheim’s 54 is really structured around the idea of self-learning as opposed to them lecturing and you taking notes (like a traditional course structure). The idea of the class is that you learn best by engaging in active learning, which entails you making lots of mistakes/engaging with the material on your own. 


The downside to this is that much of your learning must come from yourself and your own work as opposed to what you may be used to. Something I will note is that course policies are very flexible and forgiving (they don’t want to penalize you for making mistakes/make students focus on grades as opposed to learning) which is why it’s easy to do well
i am incredibly sorry you are in this course
This aged well
should I not bother attending their lectures and instead watch paulin’s?
Try it out and see what works for you, I would still definitely recommend going to discussions even if you don’t go to Wehrheim’s lectures though
isn't attendance graded tho"
An Explanation of What's Happening in Math 54 Right Now,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10qa5ll/an_explanation_of_whats_happening_in_math_54/,2023-01-31 12:53:37,"**An update to this post can be found** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10t23lw/an_update_to_everything_happening_in_math_54/)**.**

Math 54 is joint ran by two professors, Kelli Talaska (she/her) and Katrin Wehrheim (they/them). We can go to either lecture, sections for either instructor, etc, etc.

Prof. Talaska had been feeling ill for a while now, in large part from trying to catch up with all the grading for her Math 10B class last semester which had fallen behind because of the strike, so she hadn't really put in the work into this semester's Math 54 class that Prof. Wehrheim was expecting from a jointly-run class which put immense stress on them from having to run everything by themselves for the past few weeks.

Prof. Talaska decided last week that it was probably best that she stop instructing the class for the aforementioned health reasons, which left Prof. Wehrheim with the job of teaching all 1000+ students which they obviously couldn't do, despite the math department's push for it.

The department also pushed for Prof. Wehrheim to instead teach alongside the (undecided) replacement instructor for Prof. Talaska, but given the current structure of the course (lectures and section are all group work essentially, worksheets are used daily and upload to a Drive folder, etc.), so Prof. Wehrheim decided that it wouldn't work out and that a new instructor would be completely out of the loop given how the class is currently being ran, so after thinking about it with family and friends over the weekend, they decided to take a leave too.

As such, we don't really know the future of this class, Prof. Wehrheim said it's unlikely to be cancelled, but that if we get new professors, neither we nor they have any idea how the class will be run, but Prof. Wehrheim insists we should fight for things that the class has already promised us and were outlined during Week 1 in the syllabus, as is stated by University policy (take home quizzes, projects instead of midterm/final exams etc), and so that's where things stand at the moment for the class. The GSIs seem committed to helping us and for that I'm really thankful, but it really is just uncertainty all around for them, and for us 1000+ students currently enrolled in the class.","Kelli’s medical issues caught up, it sucks.
We Need Alexander Paulin
#Number 1 public university
damn
Two professors with some of the worst ratings I’ve ever seen come together to joint teach with a teaching plan even GSIs agree is ridiculous and then decide to quit because they realize it creates way too much unnecessary work for literally everyone involved. Thanks
Overworked, understaffed. Up the Union.
Man I remember taking math 54 with wehrheim, and I actually loved how much they actually cared and the GSIs ran some amazing sections. Sad to see this happen.

I will say strikes have effects and sadly this was one of the negative consequences :( in a perfect world the university would actually make changes to fix these problems but 🤷‍♀️
It wouldn’t be a problem if the two of them didn’t try to run a bizarre class system that doesn’t actually teach math or validate our understanding of it, but instead plays skateboard videos and cringe virtue signaling that compares being overworked to police brutality.
The real issue is that there exist classes with 1000+ students
a project in a math class ? wtf
All so they don’t have to refund money and keep the pump up.
All those coca colas Talaska has been drinking in lecture are finally catching up to them ig
You’re lucky Talaska stopped teaching this course. Took 53 with her a while back, god was she absolutely awful. Shit explanations, bad attitude, and even worse grading bins
From what I've heard about Talaska I'm surprised she hasn't been fired yet. I understand she has many health issues at the moment but it seems like she hasn't been doing her job properly for a while. Of course, I've never had her, so I could be totally wrong, but this is just what friends + RMP have said.
Some people just love to see the world burn
well hopefully this time they don't bring in 2 point something rated profs then...
At least y'all learned to calculate your privilege before the class got ruined 

/s
>Prof. Wehrheim ~~was~~ were expecting
If you are reading this, Paulin is top 3 teachers in the math department. Take classes with him every time you can.
gob ears!
lmaoooooooo
Exactly the comment I’m looking for 🤣
Faculty don't have a union (although maybe they should). Lecturers do have a union, and hopefully if these two profs are lecturers, the have been in contact with it.
Sounds like the strike was an important driver of this mess 🤷‍♂️
Afaik Kelli Tallaska had already problems instructing pre-strike. I thought she was fine the two weeks I had her but MATH54 had a weird format with no formal lectures so it is not like she was giving long lectures.
I seem to recall the strike ended because an agreement was reached after the University made changes to the areas the strikers were demanding. 🤷‍♀️
Don't you love ""calculating your level of oppression""? My favorite part of the lectures hands-down.
Go bears
STRETCH BREAK!
Literally every engineer and math student has to take it. It's pretty unavoidable
I took 54 with wehrheim and I can say I think the projects were actually good and I feel like I learned the material well in that class. The structure is a bit weird at first but once you get used to it it really is quite conducive to learning
Now see the problem I have is that she has a private tutoring site that charges students hundreds of dollars for exam prep for Math major classes at cal, and I’ve heard people complain about her lack of availability last semester in office hour. Curious where she spent that time on.
I took a class with her freshman year and she was one of the worst professors I’ve had at cal. On a personal level I’m sad she’s having health problems  but she was both a poor teacher and not particularly kind to some of her students.
100% true. I took both 1B&54 with paulin -- complete pleasure
yes, gob ears 👂
[They do, actually. ](https://ucbfa.org)
Any number of crises would produce a similar effect. Institutions that operate that closely to such a degree of dysfunctionality need more buffers built in.
I had her for 10A and prior to the strike, her grading conditions, inability to upload modules/notes on time, and more were a pain in the ass. At first I thought all her excuses were just excuses, but now I'm beginning to believe she does have fucked up medical issues.
Wait wtf is this
Not saying the class shouldn't exist. I'm saying it should be split into 5, each with 200 students.
Ya I agree
What I don’t get is if she has medical issues why doesn’t she leave? Berkeley doesn’t pay you if you take medical leave?
Wehrheim has asked their students to calculate their level of oppression by answering questions based on their ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life experiences.

edit: this is something done DURING LECTURE so it's kinda difficult to ignore
Why do you feel that way? 20-25 students per GSI section with 20 GSIs covers the entire class, and it's not like the professor's admin work goes down by a factor of 5 because you've cut down on the number of students.
Surely they have medical leave, but it's most likely a certain amount of medical leave like any other work place.

If this was a different job, there are usually more individuals who could take your work load and spread it enough to be fine, but being one of two in this environment? It doesn't work effectively.

Based on the above comment, it sounds like she'd need more medical leave than what she may have on the books too."
"Associate math professor Katrin Wehrheim and Troy Worde, of the Berkeley College Republicans, discuss the scheduled campus visit of controversial Alt-Right Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos.",https://ww2.kqed.org/forum/2017/01/25/students-push-for-uc-berkeley-officials-to-cancel-breitbarts-milo-yiannopoulos-event/,2017-01-26 23:59:21,,"First off, I thought that the German professor was terrible and basically played right into what the BCR wanted her to say.  And that was despite the fact that Kransy had a bias.  Her arguments were all pure emotion.

However, I didn't hear a good reason from the BCR about why the picked Milo, which is what I was most curious about.  They've lowered the level of discourse quite a bit from the likes of Ben Shapiro and the only reason I heard given was that Milo is provocative and will generate a large crowd and a lot of interest. But that's not necessarily going to make anyone engage in a dialogue and change their minds.  Seems like if you wanted liberals to change their minds about an issue like the gender wage gap, you'd want someone more like Shapiro than Yiannopoulos. 

There are a lot of interesting viewpoints expressed on both sides of the fence on this show. There's also a lot of mudslinging from both sides about how the other side is the violent hateful side. Like most talk shows, no one really came together or seemed to see any points they hadn't seen before. Also, the UW shooting was discussed by both sides with completely different facts depending on who was talking. It seems that no one can agree on the political views of the shooter or the victim.

edit: fixed school, thanks for pointing out the error
UW, not UC Davis. Shooter was there to support Milo. Victim may have instigated physically with shooter, per video:

From what I hear about Coward from his students, I don't think he's making new and shiny stop signs as much as he's building roundabouts (or new ways to approach math). After all, don't his students still understand the concepts of math he's been hired to teach? Is the point of making a stop sign to teach drivers to associate red with stop or convey the broader message that they should be driving more safely in the area around them? Just like how roundabouts have been shown to be capable of keeping drivers safe, Coward should be able to teach if his students are learning.
[deleted]
I guess it didn't sound like he was pointing out that it's a bad analogy, but merely trying to say something like ""Education should be about GO-ing, not STOP-ing"".  But the comment was short so it's open to interpretation.
Do you really think if he used a ""better"" analogy coward would have actually addresses the substance instead of just trying to paint these people negatively by the virtue of them using an analogy, or should they just find new things to compare this to that he might like?
Coward didn't actually say anything. He basically said ""this is the thing you're comparing department policy to,"" and then followed it up with the punchline ""wow,"" as if that somehow invalidates the analogy.
[deleted]
Like it or not what happened is simply what happened in his analogy, he did not listen to his employer, as so was not renewed. Coward may have problems with the analogy, but he's trying to sell ""these people think of you as like a hamburger/stop sign, where I think of you as people""

While he has some leeway, as a lecturer he has to listen to the Dept, he does not get to teach however he wants"
Math 54 Spring,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j61bdm/math_54_spring/,2020-10-06 01:16:18,"Katrin Wehrheim or Nikhil Srivastava? How was your experience with each of them? Who has the “easier tests” and which one should I choose to take Math 54 with?

I’m an international student so Wehrheim’s time suits better for me as compared to Srivastava’s, which is really early in the morning for me (think 4-5am ish).

Thank you!","dont know much about Srivastava but Wehrheim’s 54 was sooo easy, barely any homework (smth like 5 easy textbook problems a week) and the exams seemed to be easier than other profs from what i heard, and their lectures are also pretty good as well! might’ve helped that i took it with the adjunct course, but even then i barely put any effort into the class itself and got an easy A
Hot take but Srivastava is actually a rlly good lecturer so if u wanna learn the material well i recommend Srivastava
>Comment

yep! I took 54 with Wehrheim fall 2019, and it was a good experience. I also had an amazing GSI, so that made things better. We had 4 point weekly quizzes and assignments (m-w-f), but they're all definitely doable. Exams are doable too. I also have pdfs of both textbooks, so lmk if you need them.
If you don't mind, can you talk a bit about how things are weighted in that class?
This is Wehrheim's website from Fall '19: [https://math.berkeley.edu/\~katrin/teach/54/index.shtml](https://math.berkeley.edu/~katrin/teach/54/index.shtml)

You can navigate to logistics to find the weights!"
Math 54 or Stat 134,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kq6dez/math_54_or_stat_134/,2021-01-04 02:47:37,"Hey guys.

The classes I have currently on my schedule are:

Math 53
Stat 134
Cs61a
Colwrit r1a ( the 6 unit one )

I wanted to drop stat 134 and take math 54. For those who have taken both or those who know about both, is math 54 a lighter load that stat 134 or are they almost the same? Also, stat 134 is with Adam Lucas and math 54 is with Katrin Wehrheim.","Math 54 is way easier than stat 134
also want to add when i took math 54 with Wehrheim, they seemed to have the easiest exams. i barely studied for the midterms/finals (only briefly looked over past notes and did maybe 2 practice exams at most each time) and got over 90% on all the exams, and their lectures are also pretty organized and good!
Stat 134 is less work but is more difficult.

That's not uncommon for upper division Math/Stat courses. Lower division courses tend to have long tedious problem sets.

(I in took both Stat 134 and Math 54 in the same semester.)
Never take Stat 134 with Adam Lucas! Horrid professor
Ah okay. That said, What do you think about my schedule difficulty. I'm a bit confused because Im still not able to properly gauge the difficulty levels at Cal lol.
This sounds promising lol. But yeah the reviews i read on rate my professor said that but I didn't want to believe those cause they're pretty extreme.
I disagree with  

That's not uncommon for upper division Math/Stat courses. Lower division courses tend to have long tedious problem sets.

Although its true here
Seconded
I did Stat 134 and CS61A last semester and it was difficult but doable. I think my friend did Math 53 and Stat 134 together and he had a harder time. 

If you’re new to coding, I would advise against your current schedule and swap for math 54 instead. CS1A can be very time consuming if you don’t have experience with Python ( specifically recursions, OOP, etc. ). For CS61A, I recommend starting on projects early and studying past exams religiously. 

Stat 134 with Lucas was not a great time either. The content is definitely difficult but doable if you grind a lot of problems out. However, the worse part was the disorganization (ex: giving out practice exams with wrong answers and didn’t reply to any students asking for clarification up to the exam day) and lack of empathy for students. If you decide to take it, I 100% recommend taking the adjunct with Mike. I started the class with Fs and Cs on quizzes, but ended the class with an A. Finding a study group helps too because my friend and I met up every other day during dead week to study. The cutoff is pretty nice though: 

A+ 93,
A 80,
A- 75,
B+ 71,
B 67,
B- 63,
C+ 56,
C 49
C- 40

Keep in mind that exam averages are usually around the low 60s percent and final averages are historically below 50%. 

I took Math 54 in the summer and it was definitely a lot easier than Stat 134. Linear algebra isn’t a walk in the park, but you can definitely do decent by just memorizing rules. You can’t do that with Stat 134 because it’s a lot of problem solving. I personally LOVED Math 54, it’s much more intuitive. 

It really depends on you though. I think your schedule is doable but it won’t be easy if you don’t have experience with programming AND don’t have any experience with probability.
yeah that’s understandable since a lot of other 54 profs seem to make the class unreasonably difficult. if you have the chance, take the adjunct for the class as well! i’d definitely recommend it, i was only able to stay in the adjunct for part of the semester while taking 54 and i didn’t have to do any extra studying during that time because the adjunct prepped me so well. good luck!
Thanks for this! For next sem, I'm thinking of dropping stat 134 and doing stat 140 sometime later. So I'd have math 53, cs61a and the r&c. I'm now thinking if I should add math 54 to it.
Ah yes will definitely take the adjunct section! Thanks
I think it’s doable with Math 54! 

I heard Stat 140 is a lot better than stat 134. I wish I took it instead 😭😭
Cool. I think I'll take 54 too and see what happens in the sem. Yeah a lot of people said 140 is better
You should read up on the differences between the various probability classes at Berkeley:  http://prob140.org/about/

140 adds a computing and statistical inference component on top of what 134 offers.  It’s the preferred probability class for DS students and for some CS students.  You should have taken Data 8 prior. Also, Prof Adhikari is one of the great lecturers at Berkeley and her lecture attendance rates are always very high, especially since she rarely records any of her lectures."

Edit: fixed typo
I had Teleman; he's a very intelligent man and a fast-paced lecturer that can be hard to follow at times. However, I would always read the textbook before lecture and that helped a lot and made the class pretty enjoyable actually. When I was taking 54 I think he covered more material than the other professors, which is something I liked about his class. Pretty entertaining guy at times and an unbeatable sense of fashion. Tests were pretty fair with decent curves, so my friends and I ended up doing well in the class. I recommend him if you like lectures that are engaging and cover more content at the expense of being more of a challenge to keep up with and greater reliance on spending personal time (reading textbook/notes or office hours) to cover gaps in understanding.
