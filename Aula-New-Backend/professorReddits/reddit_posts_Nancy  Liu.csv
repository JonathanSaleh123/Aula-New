Which one’s easier: Psych 138 or Psych 181?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/127xbyy/which_ones_easier_psych_138_or_psych_181/,2023-03-31 13:01:36,"None of them have the professors listed and Psych 181 isn’t on berkeleytime. I see that Nancy Liu has taught 138 before but she’s not appearing on ratemyprofessor. Has anyone taken these courses in the summer and how would you rank the level of effort required to do well in the course? I’m going to take 15 units in session C-E, so I don’t want to take a psych course that involves too much reading/assignments. These are the only two that match my schedule besides 137 (which I’ll be taking), so I want to make sure I choose the easier one. Thanks y’all!",
