ECON C3 vs ESPM 15,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vziyyv/econ_c3_vs_espm_15/,2022-07-15 00:50:41,"I am an incoming L&S freshman planning to study biology and environmental science. I enrolled in ECON C3 and ESPM 15 and am choosing between the two (other enrolled courses include enrolled in MATH 1A, CHEM 1A/1AL, DeCal (total 10 units)). I've listed some attributes of each class below and am hoping that I can get advice or suggestions from people who have previously taken the classes.

ECON C3 Introduction to Environmental Economics and Policy

* Meets Social & Behavioral Sciences, L&S Breadth
* Professor Maximilian Auffhammer
* 4 units (total 14 units)
* Have never taken any econ related courses, absolutely 0 background knowledge in econ

ESPM 15 Introduction to Environmental Sciences

* Meets Biological Science, L&S Breadth (will meet with BIO 1A/1AL and 1B)
* Meets Physical Science, L&S Breadth (already met with CHEM 1A)
* Professors Robert Rhew and Patina Mendez
* 3 units (total 13 units)
* More interested in taking a course that covers both the scientific and social/political aspects of envsci

Any feedback would be appreciated.","econ c3 sucks take espm 15
really? mind elaborating?
i don’t know the professor teaching econ c3 this semester but it’s a pretty econ heavy class, if you have no econ background it would take some time outside class understanding what’s going on. also it’s not really “environmental econ” it’s just regular econ but all the examples are natural resources. if you don’t have to take it i honestly wouldnt
Heard that professor auffhammer is pretty chill and humorous, but I think I will choose espm 15 after considering your advice. Thanks a ton :)"
