MCB 102 in-Depth Review (Spring 2024),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ctn8cl/mcb_102_indepth_review_spring_2024/,2024-05-16 13:38:57,"When I was preparing to take this course I wish I had a detailed review like this, so hope this helps...

General thoughts: I would be lying if I said this class is ""easy."" It's definitely not a class you can not study for at all and get perfect scores in. You need to put in the work. But it's not impossible, and definitely not as horrible as some people make it out to be.

  
Part 1 (Professor Ahmet Yildiz):

I went into the first section of the course thinking I'd need to memorize a bunch of amino acids, pKa's, etc.. There was not a lot of that. Yildiz is a professor who prefers application/conceptual understanding over brute force memorization. Take this with a grain of salt because the fall/other professors may have a different approach to the first section of 102. There is still quite a bit of info you need to memorize, but not to the extent people make it out to be.  

His lectures are fairly dry. He did not know how to keep track of time/pace himself very well so he would often go thru only half a slide deck and need to pick back up during the next lecture. Thankfully he stuck to his word and did not expect us to learn info he didn't get to. Important to note that he has a fairly thick accent and talks quite fast so it can be difficult to catch every word he is saying at times. Nonetheless, his slides were pretty clear. 

Exam was difficult but honestly not as bad as Ochem exams were for me. There's a mix of mcq, true/false, short answer, calculations, etc... The calculation questions were the hardest imo. Keep in mind he's a biophysicist so you'll see some of his physics background show up in the lectures & the way he frames his calculation-based questions.  Regardless, the practice exam he gave from last year was definitely reflective of his exam. 

He was the only professor to hold in-person office hours (helpful) and did stop for questions during lecture. Unfortunate part was that very little practice questions written by him were provided besides the practice exam. 

Part 2 (Professor Evan Miller):

This section was quite content heavy, but was honestly my favorite section of the course. I attribute that to Miller's teaching. Miller is just amazing at what he does. He's super clear, succinct, articulate, knowledgable, and easy to follow along. His lectures pack in quite a lot of info but it never felt like that because he would annotate on his iPad alongside us as he taught. He always finished his lectures on time and was never in a rush. It's pretty obvious he has been doing this for a long time. He incorporated a lot of learning strategies in his section (active discussion/share-outs during lecture, pre/post surveys to assess student understanding, activities during discussion section, etc...). 

Miller provided plenty of practice questions that were reflective/helpful for the exam. We received numerous problem sets, 2 practice exams, and practice questions built into the lecture. His exam was really long but because there was so many potential points - each question was not worth a whole lot (more room for mistakes). He was very upfront with his expectations and very helpful in office hours (held via Zoom).

Miller's section did incorporate some Ochem mechanisms but there were only 2-3 mechanisms on the exam. His section requires a combination of pattern recognition, memorization, and application. Very little to no math. After doing a bunch of practice questions you really get a feel for the type of questions he likes to ask. 

  
Part 3 (Professor Ross Wilson):

People told me this section would be the easiest of the course. Not necessarily the case. 

Professor Wilson is an extremely kind and easy-to-talk to/down-to-earth guy. He was always smiling, laughing, and making it easy to approach him. Nonetheless, his section's structure was not very helpful. Lectures were pre-recorded videos from 2020 that we were expected to watch on our own time. During the scheduled lecture time, Wilson would occasionally (on select days) show up to the lecture hall and do a Q&A / mini-review of the most recent lecture videos. Keep in mind these pre-recorded lectures were often an hour or longer. Wilson also stuttered/mumbled a lot. He would say something and then start questioning what he himself said or take something back. Or he would post a ""correction"" to something he said in the lecture videos. When people would ask questions during his in-person sessions, he would often get thrown off or not have a clear answer. I'm sure he's a smart guy but not necessarily the best teacher. 

Wilson would provide really short assignments to complete (1-2 questions) but would then tell us that these questions were very hypothetical, not the best questions, too challenging, etc... Wilson constantly said he would not write such tricky questions on exams, but this wasn't necessarily the case. He was also constantly making comments about how he could have worded certain things better. 

He was nice enough to provide ALL exams he's given while he's taught this course. He told us the most recent practice exam (2023) was going to be the most reflective, which was not 100% true because that exam was much much easier than ours and had questions straight up copy/pasted from previous years. Our exam was much harder than I expected it to be because the fill in the blank questions/MCQ's were each worth a lot of points. Getting one word or question wrong was quite costly. It was sometimes unclear what Wilson was asking for, or two answer choices seemed correct for the MCQ. It was kinda shocking because Wilson made it seem like his exam was going to be the easiest/ most straightforward when in reality it was quite challenging.

Content-wise, Wilson packed a LOT into his lectures. It was hard to sense what was essential info and what was more supplemental/examples. The way he structured his lectures often felt out of order. The man did provide an ""elements to know"" list with essential terms/concepts however, which did help. 

I would argue part 3 was the hardest section of the course because of the structure/teaching style though Wilson is a hella chill guy. 

Overall thoughts:

This course definitely takes foundational concepts from Bio 1A and builds on it (with some added Ochem ideas/principles and a bit of math).If you liked Bio 1A you will probably enjoy the course content. The professors were pretty decent but had 3 different teaching styles/course formats so I could see people getting lost with expectations/deadlines/assignments if they didn't attend class in-person. It would have been nice if things were consistent across the three sections. 

One issue I had with the course was the lack of transparency regarding course grading. It took many weeks for the first exam to be graded and then the regrade process was a little chaotic. The professors never brought up grade bins during class nor was there anything about grades in the syllabus. I never knew how I was doing or what grade I might get in the class. People kept telling me that to get an A you had to do approx 1.5 stdv above average, which definitely caused some anxiety. 

If you have to take this class I'd recommend it in the spring. For the spring semester, you get a 4x6 cheatsheet notecard for every exam (not always useful but still better than nothing). Lecture recordings are always provided (which I heard isn't the case for all 3 sections in the fall). The professors ended up being very generous with the final grade bins for the course. We weren't provided with final cutoffs, but the head GSI suggested that approx 60 percent of the class got some form of A's or B's.  

I was fortunate enough to do well in the course, so here is my advice for future students... 1) Don't skip lecture/ always attend in-person! I never missed a single one so keeping up with the material was not an issue. It's super easy to get behind in this class yet significantly difficult to get back on track once you slip up 2) Attend professor OH: I did this off and on but when I did go they were helpful. 3) Go to all review sessions - I attended GSI review sessions, professor review sessions, and the SLC ones - you have nothing to lose by going (more exposure to material the better). 4) Grind out ALL the practice exams/problems provided. They are 100% the best way to prepare for exams. 5) Take good notes and actually review them frequently. 6) Make Quizlet or Anki your best friend: I used flashcards to prep for every section and studied them on the daily. 7) Ask questions on ED or during discussion section: GSI's are very kind & willing to help. 

I used the textbook a little bit for part 1 (was somewhat helpful) and did not for parts 2 & 3. You don't need it, nor would I recommend going searching for Youtube videos. Lecture has everything you need. Oh, and there's no cumulative final! Midterm 3 (section 3 exam) happens during the allotted final exam time. Workload for the class is on the lighter side - just some problem sets that are graded on completion.

All in all, I actually enjoyed the course to some extent. It was definitely a rollercoaster of emotions / a challenging journey, but I think if you put in a lot of work/effort and remain positive - an A is not out of reach. This is not a Bio 1A/1B or Chem 1A where you can simply study the night before and still do amazing (all 3 exams had averages between 55 and 60 percent btw). But it's not at all the horrible class people scare you into thinking - it's likely easier than the physics series here and some upper div MCB courses. I wish people didn't make this class seem like it's straight out of a horror movie, but at the same time hearing people's experiences definitely pushed me to work harder.

","This review accurately reflects the experience of the bulk majority of the students in this class in this particular semester. I agree with most of the points in this post, but I want to add some different takes.

Midterm 1 was difficult because the professor asked us to apply the concepts that we've learned from previous semesters that were distant from biochemical context to that of biochemical context that we will learn in MCB 102. For example, you will learn how to calculate free energy using equilibrium constant, K. You will also learn what pH means in biochemical context. However, you are not explicitly taught how to bridge the idea between using pH as a concentration of protons for calculating equilibrium constant, and eventually to deduce the free energy of a reaction using that idea. You do have all the ingredients to solve the question from the previous classes (Chem 1A...); but the responsibility to connect the dots of concepts, and specifically in biochemical context, was on you, not on the professor.

Midterm 2 was difficult because the test was very long. I think many students fell short because they were having a hard time identifying recurring motifs quickly. You will learn what glycolysis is. But you probably won't be tested on what a specific enzyme in glycolysis is; rather, you will be tested to use the concepts you learned in glycolysis and apply to a pathway you've probably never encountered before. So not only you do need to learn all the details of glycolysis, but you should also be ready to encounter something new you've never seen before. You should put some time to familiarize yourself with the things that show up in many different pathways; NAD(P)H, ATP, same enzymes shared, same substrates shared... and how and why they are shared. Thinking about those requires critical thinking, and some significant amount of time trying to group the distant ideas together into a common theme. You can do these quickly if you've done them before the exam.

Midterm 3 was difficult because it is extremely memorizing-heavy. Enzymes after enzymes, and even there is a list of about a couple of hundred different concepts/enzymes at least we should be familiar with before the exam. However, just rote memorization probably won't save you. Of course, students should know the details, but in my opinion, they should also think about how does a particular enzyme fit into the big picture of central dogma. Let's consider the sigma-70 factor in bacterial transcription. Why does bacterial transcriptional machinery need that? What allows bacterial transcriptional machinery to use that? Why is that needed for bacteria? Why don't eukaryotes have that? You will learn ""what"" happens in cells, but it takes one step further to think about ""why"" questions. Although you will be taught some answers to those ""why"" questions, the instructors still love to ask the ""why"" questions that were not addressed during the lectures and leave the students dumbfounded.

Aside from MCB 102 being a prerequisite for many MCBs and premeds, and being infamous for being a huge upper-division class, you'll learn a lot of useful content if you really are into the world of biology. Cheers to all of you who are taking this class in future semesters, and you guys got this. ~~I'm also quite happy that I'm done with this class lol this class was a huge stress ngl~~"
