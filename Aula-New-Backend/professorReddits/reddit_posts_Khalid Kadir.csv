What YOU can do about Professor Kohler right now.,https://i.redd.it/3px12qprs3ec1.png,2024-01-22 18:48:20,"For those who don't know, Professor Kristopher Kohler taught GPP 115: Challenges and Hopes last semester, and the semesters before that. His class was structured in a way that called out multiple institutions for enabling inequality and disabling development in foreign countries, and even in the U.S. Despite outstanding student evaluations, Kohler's contract was discontinued because he ""taught ineffectively"", what he believes to be an attempt to silence him for the previous call-outs.

As a student that took his class last semester, I found his class to be amazing, especially because of his lecture style, and I couldn't imagine the class, or even my future as a student and activist, to ever be the same without him. I think he did an amazing job at inspiring leadership and activating his students to make positive change, as it genuinely inspired me to get more involved. 

In an effort to get his reinstated, we, students from the class discord, created an email template that I want to share with you all. Please, if you took his class and want to make use of the lessons he taught us for fighting against injustice, send this to the following emails: 

Khalid Kadir, Global Poverty and Practice Minor, kadir@berkeley.edu

Clare Talwalker, Global Poverty and Practice Minor, ctalwalker@berkeley.edu

Daniel Fletcher Acting Chair, Global Poverty and Practice Minor, fletch@berkeley.edu

The email template is as follows:

To the administrative staff of the Global Poverty and Practice program,

As a student of Professor Kristopher Kohler‚Äôs Challenges and Hopes class of [year] who was inspired by his teachings, I am devastated to hear he has been let go from your program. Dr. Kohler‚Äôs course has been a staple of the Global Poverty and Practice minor for 3 years, and his sudden dismissal is shocking and concerning. His ‚Äúteaching effectiveness‚Äù is evident in his glowing student evaluation responses, in the outrage his removal has sparked, and in the glaring absence he leaves behind. We believe this decision is a mistake and will cost the Global Poverty and Practice program one of its most compelling advocates. Further, we request that Professor Kohler be reinstated to his previous position where he can continue to inspire students like me. 
[room for personal input, try to be specific! We want to show how much Kohler means to the program]
This institution has cultivated a reputation as a leader of change, unafraid to push boundaries and challenge old ideas, and we hope your administration will recognize Professor Kohler‚Äôs contribution to that vision.

Thank you for your time,
[name]","I don't have a strong opinion in this issue, one way or the other.  

It did confuse me, however because a professor generally isn't just ""removed"" by a decision of their immediate colleagues after one evaluation. The campus has extremely strong faculty protections through the Academic Senate.

It looks to me like there are seven faculty associated with the Global Poverty & Practice minor program. Mr. Kolher is one of those, and is listed as a lecturer in the program.  Here's a listing of the teaching faculty including a description of his background. [https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gppminor/faculty/](https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gppminor/faculty/)

Here's an announcement from when he was hired in Fall, 2021 that describes the programs he was hired for, and his teaching activities. 

[https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/kris-kohler-joins-dev-eng-gpp-programs/](https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/kris-kohler-joins-dev-eng-gpp-programs/)

My guess--only a guess--is that this particular minor program decided not to continue him as a lecturer, and that's implied in his email reference to the program not renewing his ""contract"".  If he were a tenured faculty member, or a lecturer with security of employment, it would not simply be a matter of whether a teaching contract is renewed or not. 

That's all, just wanted to add this to the mix for those considering the issue. 

It's totally aside from the merits of the arguments pro and con on his teaching. 

If any of my comments are wrong, I very much hope one of the faculty ""lurkers"" on this Reddit sub will step in and set the record straight with one of those typically very well informed ""Prof here..."" comments.
Surprised to see that this is gaining so much traction. I took GPP 115 with Dr. K in Fall 2022, and didn‚Äôt believe his teaching style was all that impressive or, for that matter, problematic. I get that his teaching touched on sensitive issues, but so do a number of other professors who‚Äôve been at Cal for longer. 
For reasons unrelated to the material, I never really felt that Dr. K was a particularly strong instructor. His response to waning attendance was to give students extra credit for showing up. In a class that was largely graded on papers, I never got below a 95% and never received feedback of any kind (which made it feel like nothing ever really mattered in the first place). With that in mind, he didn‚Äôt submit Fall 2022 grades until mid March (obviously the GSI strike played a huge factor there, but three months late‚Ä¶?).
Idk, I thought it was an‚Ä¶ interesting move to reach out to students about this. I wish him the best, but I highly doubt that this move will ever result in any kind of action by the University.
A little reserach goes a long way:

(1) He's not a professor. He's a lecturer.

(2) His contract wasn't discontinued. Lecturers start on 1-year contracts, then get a 2-year contract, and then a 3-year contract. At the end of every contract, they are reviewed and must be reappointed. Dr. (not Professor) Koehler was told that he wouldn't be reappointed at the end of his 2-year contract.

(3) ""Teaching effectiveness"" and ""some students like him"" are not the same thing. Departments examine a range of materials and evaluate lecturers according to a variety of criteria. You refer to his ""glowing student evaluations."" Have you seen these, or are you taking his word for it? What exactly were the critiques raised in the classroom observations? What else did the department examine, and what did they conclude? You haven't seen his evaluation; you have no idea why he isn't being reappointed. 

I get it--it sucks when teachers you like aren't around anymore. But Berkeley students have an alarming tendency to jump to the defense of people who have been let go/suspended/not reappointed sometime with little to no understanding of or concrete evidence about what happened. Witness the del Valle debacle from the fall.
Even if what you say is true this email is extremely inappropriate. It is itself grounds for removal so your email idea will never work.

Be honest: are you Professor Kohler? üëÄ
They wouldn't have fired him without cause, there is more to the story then people know.
What I heard from one of the gpp faculty member is that he was not fired but was not re-hired.
Lecturers are sometimes on short term contracts. Typically if you've been teaching at Cal less than 5 years, you are on a year long contract . This is his 3rd year, so that's probably the case here. Based on his email and that context, your assumptions are likely correct: for whatever reason the department decided not to renew the contract. 


Unfortunately, universities are relying more and more on contracted lecturers and adjuncts to teach undergraduate courses. They are cheaper and easier to fire if they say something perceived to be problematic. They sometimes hold positions at multiple colleges and also tend to rely a lot more on performance and student evals for job security. I'm not familiar with that program or department and I imagine that the truth of this situation is somewhere between what the department would say and what the Prof would...unless he said something truly controversial, I doubt that the dept would essentially lay him off based on one mediocre course observation. Regardless, this trend of contract labor in higher ed is ultimately not a good thing for research or instruction. Increasingly contingent faculty are teaching under a scarcity mentality and vying for ever dwindling job security,  a trend that will continue as red states continue to get rid of tenure at public universities.

Thanks for the insights, and this is very well put.
Lecturers teach on a series of contracts: the first three are 1, 2, and 3 years in length. After that, they teach on a ""continuing contract"" which, while not tenure, has no termination date."
cool classes for fun,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12xtwb6/cool_classes_for_fun/,2023-04-24 12:44:49,"Heyo, I‚Äôm a second-year meche and I don‚Äôt want my whole schedule to just be upper-div techs next semester. I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for some interesting classes to take just for fun? Currently looking into astronomy and philosophy classes, maybe some language ones, but open to anything

*if engineers need an upper-div humanities requirement, I def recommend Eng157AC with Khalid Kadir. Amazing guy and really cool class, pretty sure only offered in spring","Have you ever heard the tragedy of CS 182
KADIR IS THE BEST"
Should I take polecon 101 in the summer instead of the fall?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uckas1/should_i_take_polecon_101_in_the_summer_instead/,2022-04-26 12:15:09,"Taking 101 in the summer will lessen the work load on me for the fall, but the fall will have professor khalid kadir and ive heard great things about him. Is khalid worth it or should i just take it in the summer with richard ashcroft? Any experience with polecon 101 or either of these professors would be helpful.","I've never taken a class with Ashcroft, but I took PE 101 with Kadir and that was one of my best experiences ever at Berkeley. I would 100% take another class with Kadir, and many of my classmates there would say the same thing.
Took 100 in the summer with Ashcroft and 101 in the fall with Kadir. Ashcroft is pretty good, but Kadir is great. Imo the bigger reason to take it in the fall is 6 weeks isn't enough. The workload is pretty intense during the summer because it's condensed but also the class just covers a ton of content and 6 weeks isn't enough to fully explore and understand the ideas. Probably my favorite class I've taken in my 4 years so I'd definitely recommend taking it in the fall if you can."

Catterson. Literal godsend .
Tom Courtade was pretty amazing for EECS 126/127. Also Mike Zaletel for Physics 5A and Physics 112.
Josh Hug
Paulin
ALEXANDER PAULIN- structured lectures, notes, nice exams and SUCH A HELPFUL PERSON
I would add, for their importance in contributions to society:

Prof Robert Reich for PUBPOL C103 Wealth and Poverty.  Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

Profs Christine and David Romer for Econ 2.  Christine served in the Obama administration as the Chair for the Council of Economic Advisers.

In before all the Paulin and Denero comments
My favorite were David Presti and Terrence Deacon
TERRY FUCKING JOHNSON, teaches BioE104 and BioE 10(intro to BioE). He‚Äôs leaving us this semester but his last lecture is quite literally a bioengineering event. Hands down the best prof I‚Äôve had. Can‚Äôt believe he was not mentioned here
Prof McFarlane narratve writing
Professor Wendy Brown for Political Science (Modern Political Theory)
Robin Ball- MCB Department
i think hass is pretty good for math classes. Really liked yun song for stat 135, but he rarely teaches it.
Alex Fillipenko, John Denero, David Whitney, Andrew Packard (RIP), Paul Li

Edit: Stephen Hinshaw
Anant Sahai
There are several really good civ engineering profs. The two that come to mind is Claudia Ostertag and Evan Variano. I just really enjoyed coming to class and learning from them. Extremely nice, personable, super smart people. Love them
Karen Nakamura anthro 189
Weaver
Darcy Grigsby for art history, she is phenomenal and makes you want to LOVE art history. Take HA C11 with her (she has an award for teaching after all).

In the music department: Matthew Hough (hard classes but a very good teacher), Robert Yamasato, Amadeus Regucera
John Kaiser sociol150
Denero, Adhikari, Rao
Gireeja Ranade for EECS16A/B
David Landreth in English. Man uses the word ‚Äúcool‚Äù more than any human I‚Äôve ever met, and his energy is just ‚ú®üëçüèª
Underrated, but Whitney for CogSci
Paul Li for Cog Sci 1
I thought Daniel Sargent was the best in the History department.
Professor Grace Gu is fantastic to take practically any class under, and Pete Mardsen for Chem 1A was absolutely unmatched. 

A lot of the other MVPs have already been mentioned
  Joe for JOMAMA 100
Charman for any physics class he‚Äôs teaching
Darren Zook for any global studies class
Hilfinger for 61B

I like John Arnold and bediako
Noel Perkins is a new prof who just came from UMich but let me tell you this man has a gift for teaching. If you ever have a hard technical class, try to take it with him if you can (ME only to my knowledge)
Wes Holliday, super nice and caring prof. Love him!
You can assume that if a Prof is on either of these lists, they‚Äôre pretty awesome.

Only been here a year, but **Pamela Fox** is genuinely one of the nicest/most approachable people I've met. I would 100% recommend taking a class with her. Also **Mat Pyle** was incredible (and very enthusiastic to talk to you about his work), even if he did get off track a lot in class.

Dr. Hug. Not sure if he's still there. It's been awhile since I graduated lol
Eric Stanley for Trans 100, excellent lectures and energy!
Dr. Blonder for Bio 1B or IB 153, he is literally so amazing.
Hiroshi Murayama. I took his intro to quantum field theory class and it kind of made me fall back in love with physics at a point when I was pretty burnt out. He's super kind and an amazing lecturer, really skilled at explaining complex concepts in a comprehensible way.
Sofia villas-boas
Darren Zook! You will not regret taking a class with him
I was a physics major so here‚Äôs my opinion. By far the two best professors I‚Äôve had were Professor Irfan Siddiqi and Professor Michael Crommie. I had them for Physics 137A and Physics 137B. Even though it was quantum mechanics, those were some of the classes I ended up doing the best in. They‚Äôre both funny, entertaining, and explain unintuitive concepts in an accessible way for undergraduates. All professors could learn from them.

Username checks out ü§£
Forgot to add one more, Jelani Nelson for CS 170.  Awesome lecturer, great person, in the news lately for Karen fighting.
Can't speak to the rest, but +1 vote for Adhikari
Fillipenko is the greatest
No hilfinger? Sadge
Alexander Paulin for Math 1B/ Math 54.
I also had Zalatel for 5A and he was fantastic. Really great lecturer!
[deleted]
robert reich and his class are completely overrated
Yeah Scheckman is maybe the worst lecturer I‚Äôve ever had.
+1 for MacFarlane.
Yes her intro to physio is awesome
I second this. I recommend that everyone, not just cs majors take at least one of his classes
Seconding this
I 100% SECOND THIS.
was looking for this commentüôåüôåüôå
Rao - wonderful human being, one of the best in OH, inspired me to work my ass off in 70 - but a poor lecturer.  Similar category to Hilfinger without the sarcasm.
Definitely not Rao
I would say he‚Äôs a excellent lecturer , but I wouldn‚Äôt categorize him in the ‚Äúmust-take‚Äù category.  I‚Äôm probably just being picky about this, but in my time at Berkeley I had a lot of classes, including Paul Li, with outstanding professors and lecturers, but only a few which I would elevate to GOAT status.
I have Pete marsden for chem 3al this sem and 3b next sem so happy he‚Äôs my favorite professor so far
I had Grace Gu for solid mechanics. That class moves at the pace of a snail and the material is incredibly boring but she's a good enough lecturer to almost make up for it.
bediako underrated
Casey is the bomb
it is so funny to me I got downvoted for this LOL

absolute boss
STATS 134 (the probability class she used to teach) was a really hard class for me, but man Adhikari's lectures were great. I made sure to never miss them.
Crystal clear lectures and presentation, even for some of the more advanced topics. I don‚Äôt think there was a single lecture where a large portion of the class seemed confused en-masse. My understanding is that this is uncommon among professors who teach 126/127.
I might have taken it with you lol, I took her for Statics (ME C85) and Composites* (ME 127)*"
