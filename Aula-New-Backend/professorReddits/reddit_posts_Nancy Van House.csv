The Killer: ME Major’s Take,https://i.redd.it/xj71injm2zzb1.jpg,2023-11-12 11:56:47,"“If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you,” remarks Michael Fassbender as The Killer in David Fincher’s long-awaited return to cinema. The Killer is chock full of these bite-sized commentaries and philosophical musings that would hang nicely next to framed “art” like “Live. Laugh. Love.” Enduring boredom, you say? Hmm, how fitting. 

In the patois of the nihilistic, Fassbender describes professional killing as tedious work. Funny that Fincher chose a script whose theme best mirrors his on-set directorial style. Fincher is famous, or infamous (depending on whom you interview) for doing hundreds of takes to get a scene. I imagine that could be tedious too. Hell, maybe the opening dialogue is Fassbender on a hot mic and they just kept it.

It must be said that I worship at the altar of David Fincher.  A filmography that consists of works like The Game, Seven, Fight Club, The Social Network, Zodiac, Mank, Mindhunter, and House of Cards puts him squarely at legend status. I also fan-boy over Fassbender too. Despite my biases, the movie is just plain boring. The plot is as simple as it is predictable. It’s a mix of Day of the Jackal and John Wick, minus all the things that made those films compelling. Just because the “hero” waxes about tedium doesn’t mean we, the audience, want to wallow in it. 10 minutes of Fassbender opening a van door, closing a van door, looking in the van, driving the van, washing the van, dropping the keys off for the van… (I think you get the point) becomes a bit much and we get six chapters of it. 

The movie is action-lite, with only one major (and intense) fight sequence and an escape scene or two. This approach would be refreshing if the idea was to substitute gratuitous action for layered suspense.  We don’t get that. We get Peter Seller’s Being There with a gun. 

My final disappointment ends with the music. I have loved every collaboration of Fincher and Trent Reznor but The Killer’s score is made second-chair to constant needle-drops of The Smiths. I also love The Smiths but again… the repetition.  I have been waiting ages for Fincher and Fassbender to do a great film again and it seems I’m going to have to wait a while longer. How tedious.",Still not as good as flushed away tbh
Advice on RV Living,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16tf5jq/advice_on_rv_living/,2023-09-27 01:39:14,"Would I be able to live out of a small RV or a camper being towed by a truck? Preferable parked at Willard Park or any other area in town? 

I’m deciding between 1) converted van or truck with camper on the pickup bed for better stealth camping or 2) Truck towing a camper since they have more space for living. I’d prefer option 2 and like to make it work, but would i be able to leave the camper while I took my truck to s friends house for a few hours? Or would I have to worry about it being towed while i’m gone?","Showers? Food?
Parking in the RPP (Residential Permit Parking) zones in the neighborhoods around campus will mean the two hour enforcement is in effect.  Check the City's website for a map of the RPP zones; they extend fairly far out. To park more than two hours (during daytime enforcement) you need a permit which requires proof of residence in the zone. Willard Park is in one of those zones, so that won't work out.

Elsewhere in the City, outside the RPP zones, you'll have two parking challenges:

* \- monthly street sweeping (every block has it), which can be avoided, if you carefully read the signs (red and white);
* \- the three day limit (72 hours) on parking in one place. If you're on a residential street, it's quite possible a neighbor will call the police to have your vehicle marked, and then ticketed if it sits there more than 72 hours. You can generally get around this by moving it--even just further down the block, or to the other side of the street--but the situation does exist. 

Also, Berkeley is pretty well parked up, so places to put a truck towing a camper are hard to come by, just because of the sheer length of your rig. You'd need to find a location basically where three adjoining car parking spaces are empty at once. Your range of parking options gets much larger if you go with the van option.

I don't know about the leaving the camper while driving the truck away issue. Interesting question! I guess towed campers come with their own license plates? (I'm not sure).  But I don't know what the California vehicle code or Berkeley regulations say about leaving a vehicle that has no motive power on its own on a public street. It would sort of be like leaving a boat on a trailer parked on the street...not sure. 

Finally, be aware that there's a lot of fear / bias in Berkeley (and the Bay Area in general) against vehicle dwellers. They're generally typecast as sketchy, homeless, not-employed, likely to leave garbage piled or strewn on the street, and potential criminals. So at each location you park, you may need to deal with that stereotype. Probably by being very open and friendly with people on the block (telling them you're a Cal student just trying to save money on housing), and by being extremely neat, etc. 

That bias does apply in certain respects, but is not universal. I know someone who lived for a couple years out of a camper parked on San Francisco streets, working full time in tech and making pretty decent money. He saved enough on rent to buy a small house in Oakland. So there are people out there doing exactly what you're interested in--full-time student, or full time worker, willing / capable to live in a vehicle for a time.
Theres a mobile home park about 30 minutes away, it would be better to just go there. I think the monthly rate is about 750ish? Split with a roommate would be really cheap.
You should look for an RV campground or site, where you'll have a legal right to be there, and will have the appropriate things like water / electrical hookups, sanitation / waste disposal
Dude, the pandemic enforcement lull is over. They will tow you. Don’t.
Check with the city about this. I believe they've got some special secret exemptions or parking passes for uc students who live in their vehicles.
I doubt you w hear from people actually doing it rn …saw some YouTube videos on car camping so check it out
Id go w the van personally only need to buy one thing
Yeah good luck with the rv park. There's probably a wait list a few thousand people long."

Strange that one of them got away.  You'd think that if you have two guys on the second floor they are caught like rats in a trap but guess not.
Someone from out of town? You'd expect someone from Chicago to have more street-smarts. There were some mitigating factors though. The area where it was stolen from looks like a decent part of Oakland, and the van wasn't a huge target.

Not really sure how to feel,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n8wxon/not_really_sure_how_to_feel/,2021-05-09 22:36:49,"Some prior context, a homeless man lived behind the grass by Clark Kerr buildings 7/8 behind the palm trees, where he had his tent and belongings neatly arranged. I’d go by him on the path on my way to Covid, he’d smile and that would be our interaction. Never even the slightest problem.

I go outside this afternoon to see the police surrounding his area. My first thought was wtf are they doing there? He’s the nicest guy, keeps the area neat, and is just trying to keep going. 

Next thing I see is a stretcher leaving with a tarp pulled over a body. The coroners van then leaves, then the cops are left picking up his belongings. 

I can’t help but think if I could have done anything. How long was he left there? If I knew him better might I have known he was having issues? Had I called someone could he have been in a better spot surrounded by more people? It’s just so shitty, I can’t believe everyone is just fine with people living in situations like that. People need more housing, and need to be taken to the hospital / treatment if they have a mental health or drug problem. 

I don’t get how year after year, no new housing is built and people in obvious mental distress stay on the street day after day. 

Just needed to get this off my chest and tried to put it into words. If anyone knows organizations working in Berkeley that they’ve had good experience with, I’d love to get some recommendations to be more involved in positive change.","I found 99% Invisible's podcast series called According to Need really enlightening about homelessness in the Bay Area: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6FE9syVsFXLnY7vJLlp7Ni?si=0aad114e61e246c1

Although it doesn't give you a direct call to action, it really helps educate you on how help is distributed and that there is a severe shortage of long term stable housing, etc for homeless folks.
Encountering death in any facet can be a traumatizing experience. Just because you didn’t know this human well should not let anyone diminish how you take it emotionally. The Tang Center has counseling services available for all students I highly recommend talking about this experience with a mental healthcare professional.
I'm so sorry :(  What a terrible thing.  I'm glad you want to help, and I think that making some effort in improving things for people like him is a wonderful tribute to his life.  But please don't feel like you should have done more.  It's an overwhelming problem that people devote their whole lives and careers to, and make little headway.  You viewed him as a human being.  He apparently knew that, and that's a lot more than can be said of how many people treat the homeless.
My history teacher told the class that food isn’t a problem, neither is housing, we have the resources to house, feed, and take care of each other but because of our capitalist society is structured, these resources are not shared. Markets throw away food, homes remain empty, clothes in warehouses will be kept there until people purchase these items. Now I don’t think corporations and people will all of a sudden turn socialist but we could try to change this by getting the government to spend tax money on helping people who are homeless get back on their feet instead of spending money on the defense budget.
The amount of money spent on the homeless is misleading as it sounds like with billions being spent, why aren’t things better. The issue is how the money is being spent and where is that money going. The amount of money spent on the ‘tent cities’ is out of proportion for what they are getting.  Very little money has been going  toward any kind of long term solution.  New housing needs to built, not just shelters. As a long time resident of Berkeley I know that on the part of the people the will is there to do something. However, real estate is such a premium that getting any projects regarding housing is a very, very slow process. And in my opinion, UCB is a obstacle, they get what they want when they want it from the city, and housing the homeless is not a UCB priority.
My friend saw a man dying (presumably from an overdose of sorts) at the downtown Berkeley bus stop in front of Walgreens and not one single person out of the many college students around him had bothered doing anything. She had to scream repeatedly for someone to call an ambulance or even acknowledge that this person was there. The lack of empathy people have for those presumed to be homeless or struggling with addiction is absolutely insane. We all know poverty is caused by systemic discrimination and bigoted policy so why pretend like there is any difference between someone living in the cal dorms vs someone living in peoples park?
It’s a complex problem with not just requiring complex solutions but flexible solutions. I’ve directly and indirectly helped homeless. I’ve gotten some housed some back to their families. Sometimes it stuck; sometimes it didn’t. 

Some people on the street just need stable affordable housing, some need medical help that cannot be dolled out just in hospitals or clinics. Some people feel the need to live outside.  There’s no way for you to know whether you could have helped. It takes more time than just repeatedly saying hi to someone like that fellow. 

If you want to make a difference, I suggest https://www.berkeleyfreeclinic.org
Look, these people live outside in tents because they want to.  Either the shelters suck or they want to have the freedom of being outdoors, freedom to do drugs, freedom to have pets, etc..  No amount of housing being built will be used by the chronically homeless.  It's unfortunate he died, no one should have to be put in that situation.  The solution is incredibly complex, convoluted, and involves many factors including drugs, mental health, and tons of money.  Obviously as a college student you can't do much for the large macrosocietal problems, but there are plenty of places you can volunteer at such as food drives/shelters, city clean ups, etc.   Check out the berkeley food and housing project, or just search some more on google.

This issue is a lot more complicated than the common misconception that we just need to ""spend less on other things like the military"". 

California spent about $13 Billion dollars just on homelessness in the past 3 years. It is planning another $20 billion dollars in the largest ever budget dedicated to homelessness in history over the next few years as well. A huge problem is that this money is being wasted and not easily held accountable for how its being used. There still isn't a transparent and centrally coordinated strategy for really reducing homelessness across the board. The money flows into housing projects or relief programs that are barely making a dent in the issue. The problem could be not enough money sure, but a lot of it is also how that money is used. 

The issue is even more complicated by the fact that there is a complex web of policy, economic, and social factors that contribute to both reinforcing the massive problem of increasing homelessness. 

- the tech economy makes a lot of money but the share of that wealth is being centralized to a smaller number of people. tech companies make their executives and employees rich by comparison to the rest of the country which massively raises housing costs and living costs but doesn't raise wages as quickly for non tech workers.

- housing projects for low income or homelessness are subject to NIMBY effects. Because of the exorbitant housing prices, many owners are very sensitive about multi-family homes or just high density residential properties being built in their neighborhoods that could reduce those prices. It's not just greedy, imagine you're someone who has a couple of million dollars in mortgage payments to cover and you worked hard to achieve that...would you want anything to potentially reduce the value of your house? This results in building any sort of affordable high density apartments very hard to get approved from local government agencies. Some developers say it can take years just to get approved...

- the lack of legal enforcement. Due to recent changes to remove jail time or any criminal charges for a large number of street crimes like drug possession, vandalism, trespassing, burglary, etc. Crime is increasing and there's very few things that can get a homeless person off the street. Decriminalization of drug possession may seem humane, but it also results in many dealers preying on the homeless population by selling snd getting them addicted. This also contributes to the massive mental health issues that many homeless people experience.... which then prevent them from recovering and getting back on their feet or even taking proper advantage of the relief programs...

- the climate is very warm and survivable year round. people can literally live outside most of the year without too much fear from the elements. In that regard it's very attractive to homeless people to come here or stay here.

I mean what do you do? Do you raise taxes? We already have some of the highest taxes in the country. Force new housing developments? Depending on where you live very unpopular with homeowners. Try to get people into rehab or relief programs? Drugs and mental illness. Tougher enforcement of drug related crimes? Lots of progressives will oppose that.... It's really hard to get consensus on this issue which has led to the state throwing more and more money at the problem with little effect.

Edit: thanks for the silver!
In the bay it’s not a problem of resources - it’s whether those resources are made available to individuals who are addicted drugs and/or refuse inpatient treatment for mental illness. This guy could have gotten a hot and a cot if he wanted one.
Even if substance abuse treatment facilities were free you can't force people to go to them. If you drive around in a van that said free drug treatment and walked up to junkies on the street they would tell you to fuck off. Same with mental health issues. If they're capable of saying that they don't want to go with you then you can't make them. If you started giving away free houses then they would start looking just like the encampments and the health department would shut them down as a biohazard much like the show Hoarders. It's a very complex issue and free stuff is not the answer. I used to be homeless myself and have worked with multiple organizations surrounding this topic. There are lots of services available but you can't force people to have a completely different frame of mind.
Your history teacher is right.

Society has all the resources and no real ethical backbone to use them for good. People suffer needlessly. This is exactly why rent is sky high and no one is willing to do anything about it. This is why housing is being built at a snail's pace. This is why we deal out slave wages and expect people to somehow live on them. The big boys on top care about profit and nothing else. We are basically a post-scarcity society. It is greed and only greed with the pretense of a socioeconomic structure which prevents us from doing what should ethically be demanded of us. The oligarchs and plutocrats are fine with it because their pockets are bulging and their bellies are fat.

We hide behind ideology, where individuals are said to entirely responsible for themselves, the sole source of their problems. This simply isn't true. The society we have built is deeply flawed, perhaps beyond repair. Capitalism has failed us in manifold ways.
Honest question - what is the long term solution for the chronically homeless, especially the ones that have been living in tent cities for years, decades even?  How can we guarantee that these people would be getting housing, not just shelters?  How can we guarantee the housing is safe and clean?  And how can we guarantee that their lives improve given mental health issues and drug addictions?
Precisely. Especially because the billions aren't even reflective of the population of homeless. The counting methods are unreliable and the standard for defining homelessness is extremely narrow, excluding people who may have gotten a motel for one night, or may be couch surfing for a couple of days, etc. Anyone who believes 130,000 is the real count and that a billion and a half over the last three years is enough to address the crisis is grossly underestimating the problem.
>Look, these people live outside in tents because they want to

Bullshit. If there was housing available that was affordable to them and didn't have a bunch of extra restrictions like at shelters, of course most would use it.

>Either the shelters suck

Of course they do, if you can even get a spot.

>No amount of housing being built will be used by the chronically homeless.

If it was affordable to them of course it would be used by the unhoused. Many of them are just regular people with no mental health issues, no drug use and often have part time jobs and/or spend time volunteering with various groups like Food Not Bombs.
But why do red states still have high percentages of poverty then.
Totally agree - there’s also a free drug market here, so even if people want to stop using it’s immensely difficult because drugs are just readily available. You don’t get charged for possession of drugs as well (because the police force is so backed up it would be too difficult to keep up), so it’s just a mess. I think if people really cared about stopping this issue they would start to acknowledge, like you said, that there’s a lot of layers to it and drugs are one of those. It’s not a slam on people who are homeless it’s just the fucking truth and we need to be truthful to actually solve anything.
The “big boys” aka developers, would love to build more housing. It’s the homeowner NIMBYs who block new housing.
Good question.  Build it and they will come? 
Seriously tho, it’s a difficult problem and few will be happy with every scenario.  Welfare used to be a thing, universal basic income experiments are going in different areas, resident hotels used to be a thing, other countries have essentially government sponsored neighborhoods- we tried that in the US called them housing projects but resembled prisons. Hotel style/size apartments are often a great relief for women with kids as there is a feeling of safety with a door. Modular tiny homes for urban infill projects. Fair taxation policies, free education, universal healthcare - the list goes on and on but who decides which? The best way to solve the problem is for government officials to have the will to make changes that will be seen as unpopular in the short term.

I’m uneducated, what’s wrong with shelters?
I'm specifically referring to chronically homeless, mentally-ill/drug addicts here.  There is a reason why they don't take up housing, and those are the reasons I mentioned earlier.  I've done research and studied video interviews and I'm relaying the prevailing sentiment. Your proposed solution of ""Affordable housing"" here simply does not make sense for these people.  It is a non solution.  No housing unit will pick up someone who has a drug addiction or mental illness simply due to the property damage that it would involve. This is an undeniable fact.  Additionally, how ""affordable"" would this housing be for the people who can barely afford to get their own meals?  T  However, I do agree that affordable housing WILL help the people you seem to be conflating with the ones I'm talking about: those who are mentally well, drug-free, and just down on their luck.
> bunch of extra restrictions

what are these restrictions?
drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue. the police arresting people for possession (or not) does not affect the availabilty (or not) of rehabilitation programs
Yeah I agree...the side effects are all intermingled with each other and trying to just throw money at the problem won't solve it nor will trying to just solve a small part of it. You have to tackle it from all angles...the problem is that that requires tremendous political will and consensus building. I'm not so sure our current politicians are up to the task despite what they might say...
It's both. Low income housing is less desirable for developers to build instead of homes or luxury apartments because the profit margins are very different. Even the governments subsidizing the development of low-income housing doesn't reap as many rewards for them. NIMBYs only care about their home equity dropping and the special privilege of their precious neighborhood staying the same forever, which is unrealistic and damaging to the public majority.
It's been my online handle since way before that annoying product came into existence. I also own the twitter and github accounts, much to the annoyance of said company. At least the number of teens asking if I can give them free mango pods have subsided.
Account made 2010, damn, when did juul become a thing?
Many things. Some of the stuff I've heard second hand: In most places you have to show up very early to be able to get in due to a combination of odd rules and overcrowding. This precludes many kinds of jobs since travel for homeless people takes longer given lack of means of transportation. It's especially hard to find spots as a single man which means getting there early is critical. Staff are unfortunately often un/under-trained and seems to attract folks who enjoy their small positions of authority and end up acting like prison guards with little to no oversight. These are people who have the ability to blacklist you from one or more shelters if you don't do as they say. Then there's the lack of privacy. Risk of theft. Being woken up at odd hours almost every night from folks with mental issues (or just nightmares) yelling or folks getting into fights. No structures in place for trans folk. Lack of decent protective measures from Covid.
Dude, a lot of this is simply not true. Do you have statistics on whether people who are drug addicts become homeless, or is it that people who are forced to be homeless become addicted to drugs? I’d bet on the latter. Do you seriously think people *want* to live in shitty tents?
A lot of the unhoused people who have mental issues would not have those mental issues if they had stable housing and access to medication. Many of them would not have mental issues or would have much less severe mental issues in the first place if they'd never become unhoused. I've seen people go from completely stable and housed, to unhoused and stable, to checked into a mental institution and requiring medication for the rest of their lives where the triggering factor was the stress of being unhoused. It's scary to see how destabilizing being unhoused can be. Give people free access to good healthcare and housing they can afford (and sometimes that's $0) and at least you would stop a lot of people from ending up in a situation where helping them get back on their feet is seen by many as almost impossible due to the resources required. Saying that people who have mental illness or drug addiction will cause housing damage is pretty offensive. I have several friends with mental illness and/or drug addiction who have full time jobs and are stably housed. Yes it will take a lot of resources to help those people who are the worst off but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. This is one of the wealthiest places in the world so it's not a question of whether it's possible.
Yes that’s what I’m saying, can’t you agree that having  free range drugs makes it immensely difficult for addicts even if they WANT to stop to stop? It’s like, whether or not it’s criminal or public health, drugs should not be on the streets and need to be regulated. The only way to regulate drugs is to make laws stating they should not be sold or distributed aka make them illegal and chargeable for distribution(and no, I’m not talking about weed.)
Yeah, and ya know, each person has a different reason why they’re on the streets or continue to be. Sometimes people don’t use the resources (like shelters) because there are dangerous people in there (because yes, some people on the street are dangerous!) sometimes they don’t use them because they can’t do drugs there, or the curfews are frustrating, or just they want to be left alone. We’re all people and got to recognize that these people (while some are completely victims) do make decisions too. It’s like, we’ve chosen to acknowledge that we can’t force people not to be homeless because that infringes on their rights and now we have this complex issue. I work a LOT with homeless people here and have gotten criticized for my opinion, but honestly, it’s just based on the truth of working with them and asking what’s up and why they’re still homeless.
Low income housing is undesirable to develop because cost is so high and project timelines are so long - both mostly because of the NIMBYs
You could have sold that Twitter handle for some good money back at peak vape...
If you zoom out from California there is some truth to the underlying root causes being related to capitalism... a large part of why so many people in the U.S. end of homeless despite being the most wealthy nation in modern society compared to other developed countries is definitely the lack of social safety nets here. The decades of demonization of the word socialism coupled with the rampant misinformation and political polarization is making policy building extreme difficult. The result is that so many things can throw you into homelessness here in an instant--drugs, long term unemployment, medical costs, racial discrimination leading to a criminal record, and just sheer degree of economic inequality here...many people in the bay cant afford to buy housing or care for their family even working multiple jobs. While at the same time, any type of long term investment into your future like an education can put you in crippling debt which if you mismanage it can put you at rock bottom just as easily.

I mean people argue here about inequality and bootstrapping and what not...but the hard truth is if you have massive inequality in a society, it's not good for anyone. Starving people and drugged up mentally ill people fill up the streets of our cities and... eventually they are going to eat the rich.
Yeah but they're a shit company.

Van Life/ safety in Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mxnqn5/van_life_safety_in_berkeley/,2021-04-24 09:46:20,"I just got admitted! This is my dream school, but I grew up below the poverty line, so I'm building a van to cut some costs. Does anyone on here have experience with van life in Berkeley who would be able to direct me on what's safe/unsafe as far as parking or anything else? I'm a small girl and my van is NOT inconspicuous whatsoever. Is it possible to rent a parking space from someone at campus housing or park on campus somewhere? Actually, I've never been to the area, so any general safety information from any students would be great. Go Bears?:') !","[ Deleted to protest Reddit API changes ]
The parking situation near campus is pretty bad, but in your case, it's out of the question anyhow. The City of Berkeley has a ""doughnut"" parking plan, with all areas adjacent to campus for half a mile or more divided into zoned parking. The campus itself is the hole in the middle.

You have to be a resident, defined as someone with an address in a particular zone, in order to receive a parking sticker for that specific zone. The fun part is that residents of some properties aren't entitled to receive stickers, such as people who live in an apartment complex where the landlord is expected to provide parking. If you don't have the right sticker for your area, you're restricted to two hours of parking.

What this means is that you'll have to park some distance from campus in a non-zoned area, the closest of which is to the west of campus in a neighborhood which is OK during the day, but marginal at night. When you park there, you have to move your car every 72 hours or risk a ticket/towing. There are also street cleaning days that you should memorize. If all goes well, you get to make a 20 minute walk to and from campus every day.

I've only covered the parking situation. There's still noise, safety, police harassment, weather and the impact of all that on your grades to consider. Living in a van down by the river sure sounds fun, but the reality... maybe not so much. If you can avoid it, avoid it, at least for the first year.
This thread covered the same topic recently 

https://reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ms4s3f/any_advice_about_living_in_a_car_while_at_cal/

The city of Berkeley has been cracking down a bit more on van dwellers recently.  The only area it’s somewhat allowed is around Gilman on the west side.
Lived in my van behind a co-op for a year with my girlfriend. Honestly wasn't bad at all. Paid $100 dollars/ month to park, and $150 each for food. It was much quieter in the van then in the house. Studying showering cooking etc. could be done either in the house or on campus. Knew some people who parked on the streets, which would be a little less comfortable but still doable.
I think if you plan on van life while studying at Berkeley. I do not think it is humanely possible to park at Berkeley for free. The best bet is too shell out 400 dollars per semester for a S permit to park at one of the student lots. I have been to Berkeley a few times living in bay area and parking is almost as insane as San Francisco. Everywhere has no parking and if you find a parking spot at best it will be 2 hours free parking on the street. There is no unlimited time parking in Berkeley unless you have a residential permit or a student permit. As for safety I cant say much since I have only been there a couple times as I am a freshman with online school but I know there is BearWalk services where community service officers trained by the police department can offer buddy walks at night to escort you. That should be quite safe. Just use common sense and lock your van at night with windows open at a minimum.
Why are they cracking down on people living in a car but living on the street appears to be ok?
Let's clarify something once and for all: It is not illegal to sleep in a vehicle. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals [ruled](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/06/19/11-56957.pdf) in 2014 that ordinances against sleeping in vehicles is unconstitutional.

BPD, and I'm guessing, by extension, UCPD, probably still harasses people living out of their vehicles. Condensation on your windows is a dead giveaway, and is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid, particularly during the winter, when overnight temperatures drop into the 30s. They'll approach the vehicle, and wake you up under the guise of a welfare check. Then they'll feed you some bullshit about ""You know, it's illegal to sleep in  your car, but we'll just let you slide this time with a warning."" The reason they don't ticket you is because they are lying. Authoritarian types will claim this behavior isn't harassment, but what valid reason do the police have to disturb you when you're not breaking the law?

That exact scenario happened to me a couple years ago when I had a couple of beers on an empty stomach and decided it would be more prudent to take a nap rather than drive the less than two miles home. The officer was pretty pissed when I cited the ruling and started flashing his light all around the interior of my car, likely searching for probable cause to punish me for knowing my rights. When that failed, he asked me why I wasn't wearing pants and looked really upset when I pulled off the hoodie I had across my lap and asked him if wearing shorts was illegal too.

Once upon a time, Berkeley PD was considered a model police force with compensation in the top five, nationwide. Now there are more and more high school bullies on the force, living their best lives at taxpayer expense.

If you have to live in a vehicle, rent a driveway and you won't have to practice curbside law.
Whats it called
There's actually free parking in the residential areas further from campus. Most students go the full four years without setting foot in those neighborhoods.

BearWalk also has a specific operating areas, bordered by Cedar to the north, Milvia to the west, Prospect to the east and Derby to the south. The area described by those boundaries are all well within the parking doughnut, so at best, BearWalk will only get you partway home.

"Berkeley City Council approved 7-1 the purchase of a bulletproof van. Berkeley will pay $80,000 of its own money and DHS will cover the rest.

""The Police Review Commission has rejected a proposal to buy two German shepherd police dogs after opponents said the animals could intimidate poor people and racial minorities. ""

$80,000 will pay for two employees for one year to retrain kids. That's not even counting the fact that that's a shit wage and assumes no other overhead. You can't fund that kind of program with this kind of money that the article notes can't even be used with the civil forfeiture money.

I mean, I think cops deserve to have a bulletproof van or even paramilitary style vehicle when dealing with armed suspects. Dead cops aren't a good thing.  

In terms of feeding the homeless, does the city really lack resources on that front?  Do you think the business community wants to see more homeless hurting their businesses and the city's tax revenue?  
>Some community members said they would prefer that the city use the $80,000 for job training for youth, or to help feed and house the city's homeless.

I'd bet none of them have ever been in a standoff with an armed assailant. 
This is so progressive!
""Said another: “It is just a police department. You need to stop outfitting it like an army. It should not have military-grade weapons or tactics or training because it’s a civilian police department.”""

These comments make me cringe. There's nothing ""military"" about this van ... it's a van. There is hardly anything ""military"" about the tactical vehicles police departments often get from the military as surplus equipment. ... those vehicles aren't tanks, they're nothing more than a heavy vehicle with armor.


""military-grade"" ... a rifle is a rifle is a rifle.

""military tactics"" ... pretty sure that when someone is firing at the military or the police, or anyone for that matter, the tactics are basically the same. Training? It's all basically the same.

Unless they're expecting the police to walk around with nothing more than nightsticks, comments like the one above mean nothing.
seems like an entirely reasonable thing for a city of our size to own and a very reasonable price. 
Cheryl Davila is so progressive to vote against this gross misuse of public funds! It could have been spent on alleviating the housing crisis in which families and minorities are being evicted from their homes because of gentrification.

Not to mention Drumpf wants to deport millions of Americans, and if he steals our federal funding we need backup funds to preserve our sanctuary city.
A general rule of thumb is that an employee costs roughly twice as much as their wage/salary due to payroll tax, overhead, insurance, hiring costs, etc.  So perhaps only one person.

This would be an extravagance in some rural area that hadn't had a murder in decades, but gun violence is very real in Berkeley.
You really need to stop spamming this on every other post. 
Damn, beat me to it.

California doesn't need ANY federal funding lmao. For every dollar we give the federal government in taxes, we get 70 cents back.

The federal government doesn't fund us, we fund the federal government.
Fuck your shit ass sanctuary city bullshit. We have enough criminals here as it is, I don't want a bunch of assholes who can't even respect the laws of the country they want to live in so badly here. Kick em all out I say. If you have been here for 5+ years and haven't bothered to at least START the process to becoming a legal resident or citizen, fuck off.

I say this because I worked in the restaurant business for years and worked with plenty of so called border jumpers who at least had the right idea to pay their fines, get a lawyer, and start the process to becoming legal. I can respect that. But these people who just hide in the shadows and expect nothing to happen and then cry when something does happen are fucking STUPID. 
Y tho
Delete this.
I think the majority of immigrants who are living here illegally are trying to do just that: eventually start the process and become legal citizens. And I think that's the whole point of making cities ""sanctuaries"" — to ensure their protection and basic rights while they work towards that goal as they work, live and study here. 

Basically, I see where you're coming from but I think you're being a bit hyperbolic, sanctuary city politics aren't total bullshit.
Wrong on so many levels. Sanctuary cities are so law enforcement agencies within a municipality can forgo any responsibility for holding or detaining illegal aliens. 

Also, as soon as you start the process to becoming a legal citizen or resident ICE is notified and you become a low priority for deporationa enforcement. Not once did any of my cooks, dishwashers, or souz chef's run into any issues with deportation threats once they began the immigration process. "

My building had a similar situation in Fall 2020. Parents, family, and friends could not get a hold of one of the residents (he was a grad student).

Berkeley Police came in to knock on the door but nothing. They did not enter his room because they needed a warrant first. The family then called UCPD and they did enter the room. He had killed himself. Paramedics were called and eventually a Crime Scene van came as well..This all happened within 3-4 hours

Oh boy.
It's not thaaaat bad. I get that she as a person might not be extremely popular in particular, but she was the speaker of the house for a large portion of the last decade. That's one of the most powerful positions on the entire planet.

And Irvine is just one example, I'm sure there are plenty of schools out there that got waaay worse.

Overall it's pretty meh.

Because they campaigned very very hard to get him. Blame the commencement committee for this. 
It's UC Irvine's 50th anniversary.
BECAUSE BERKELEY STUDENTS WERE TOO BUSY THINKING ABOUT STUDY STUDY STUDY AND THEMSELVES TO ACTUALLY CARE.
Maybe because we walked out on Napolitano so violently?
I'd prefer that people in general would get over their desire to put a spotlight on political and economic elites as role-models.  Pelosi represents a failing and corrupt system, just like Obama. 
Irvine is far more indicative of a median, common experience than Berkeley. If you were to give a commencement speech about the perils facing public education, common american experience, etc. etc. Irvine is a far better choice than Berkeley to that end.

Further, it sort of reduces the image of radical leftist politics.

fuck man don't depress me more its already been a really shitty day
Meeting Pelosi is pretty easy if you live in California...lame indeed. 
I have no doubt that if Obama spoke at Berkeley, all hell would break loose.  (As it should, in my opinion.)
Please make this a thing and blame those protesters for something. That would be awesome. 
What did she do that you didn't like?

Edit: You've made plenty of posts on reddit since I asked you this question, so I guess you don't actually dislike Pelosi but just want to be mad at politicians without actually being informed.
Listen to his speech and ask again. 
I'm fairly certain that the only person fit to speak for him would be Noam Chomsky, and even then he would call him a sellout "
