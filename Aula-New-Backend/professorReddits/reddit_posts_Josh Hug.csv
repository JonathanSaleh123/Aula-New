Bro I straight up almost teared up when I finished the cs 61b slides I was catching up on because I'm a lazy fuck who doesn't go to lectures. I fucking love data structures and cs. This course was one of the most fun and satisfying experiences of my life.

I also just went to his bonus lecture yesterday, and what a cool fucking guy. I'll miss bro
I saw him use the restroom and not wash his hands

I'll be honest, I hated all most of my classes here because of the vibe I get from professors and TAs. I had a Math 54 prof tell everyone she will not respond to student e-mails, my CS 70 professor tell me he does not care about me during office hours, and an R&C professor that doesn't even know my first name in a 13 person class.

Josh Hug is the total opposite of the typical apathetic berkeley professor. I actually feel like he cares about me and the rest of the students in the class, even in one with 1,200 students. I'm not sure if this is because he used to teach at a private school (where you care about students), but either way I highly recommend all of you that are frustrated with this school to take a class with him. 

Prof.Hug if youre reading this, you are the reason I am **not** dropping out of here.","The only negative thing about Josh Hug is that he doesn't teach every course in which I am enrolled. Completely agree with your sentiments. I've never had a more dedicated and engaged professor.

""my CS 70 professor tell me he does not care about me during office hours"" 

vazarani seems like a nice guy... :/

I'm not a CS major, but all the good things I've heard about Professor Hug have piqued my interest. I'm considering checking out CS 10 in the fall if I have space in my schedule.
Hug was great :)

He put in an exceptional amount of time to help students in the class, especially those struggling, and he really cared about improving the quality of the class and assignments. 

He was maybe a bit overzealous in terms of the workload he threw on his students, but it was always in their best interest. Great prof. 
I think one negative thing about this class (not Hug specifically) is that he is trying to implement too many new things. But I guess that's inevitable as we are the first ones who is experiencing Hug's 61B.
He was the perfect combination of everything. He made the topic interesting, he taught data structures thoroughly, and he gave us good challenges.

I especially like that he pushes test driven development and good habits, like taking a step back to think about what data structures to use and their runtime. It really shows that he cares that we learn how to program and design programs well. Sure, it's a bit time consuming, but it's a joy to watch him teach, and finishing projects like Gitlet really give you a sense of accomplishment (cue jokes about not finishing Gitlet).

I don't want to compare professors or anything, but I'd like to make some suggestions of teachers you might like based on this post. I would really recommend Professor Oliver O'Reilly (Mechanical Engineering) and Professor Achilles Speliotoupolos (Physics). These teachers are both along the same vein as Prof. Hug: interesting, thorough, good challenges, and really care that their students understand their material.
Josh Hug is bae
Yep, his class was great. Also, pretty sure he reads reddit. :)
>teach at a private school (where you care about students)

I don't know where this myth gets perpetuated. You get the same kind of good and bad professors at every major research university, because faculty are not hired primarily on their teaching ability and most of their pay is not determined by how well/effectively they teach.

The person who is both an extremely effective teacher AND researcher is rare indeed. I think the only exception might be at MIT, but MIT tends to be the exception for a lot of things.

I will, however, say this. I think anyone that takes classes based on ""easy A's"" is profoundly wasting their time. Ultimately, you or someone you know, is footing the bill in terms of money or at least in terms of your time. You should get your ""money's worth"". Something I realized very early on and some people realize way too late is that you should sign up for classes (schedule and graduation time permitting) that have the interesting professors - not the ""easy courses"".

When you like going to class, you WILL put in the extra effort to do well in it, and in turn learn more from it. 

Robert Littlejohn in the physics department could teach quantum mechanics (or much other physics) to a kindergartener with enough time. But you will work damn hard in his class because the man is brilliant and engaging. Similarly Jean Frechet or Peter Marsden and Organic Chemistry, or Ratner in the Mathematics department, or Ann Swindler in sociology, etc.

When I was originally accepted to Berkeley, I had in my mind that I was going to work hard with some of the brightest even in ""elective"" courses. And I made sure to do so at every available opportunity. I can easily imagine burning out if I hadn't done that with less than stellar teachers (even if they might have noble prizes-looking at you Smoot). 
Yes. His facebook profile picture is creepy as fuck.
You think your lucky he's your Professor? He's My Uncle. Yeah. Best friggin' Uncle ever. He only visits us in Texas every 6 months though ;(. Yeah, bet you wouldn't guess he was born in Texas.
With that gitlet project, it's clear Josh Hug is a wannabe Hilfinger.

He wants to be known as ""that hard professor"" like Hilfi.
I mean Hilfinger isn't apathetic or bad... just really hard and a lot of work.
vazirani sucked so much it was an incredibly horrible experience taking 70 with him
As a former CS 10 student - YES. YES. YES.
that gitlet..
I'm having uncomfortable flashbacks to Ratner's 1B class...
Yea I went to a midwest public liberal arts university, so while of course some profs were better than others, they were for sure mostly judged on their teaching. It's not a private/public thing. 
 I'm not taking any class based on the fact theyre easy As..fuck all of my courses were the worst way to get As. That's why finally having a good professor in a hard course made the experience less depressing.
YES. PETE MARSDEN for ochem. 

My friend has Ann Swidler for sociology. I'm taking another soc class with that friend and it's interesting how many times Swidler is referred to by the professor I'm taking my current class with.

Hilfinger is also great, as is Garcia for CS 10 (and 61C too I guess). 

I also really like Rosemary (Rosie) Gillespie for ESPM 132 (spider bio) - nicest professor ever and just a really awesome class overall.  And that class even has exceptional GSIs - [Maddie (who's been featured in a video!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq-r20mlGes) and Valle (UGSI).

Also Robert Full for IB 148 (animal physio). He's kind of like Dan Garcia (SO ENTHUSIASTIC) but for bio. It's amazing. 

Now that I think about it, I've been fortunate to have quite a few amazing professors. But I still lament that I've never had Denero, Hug, or Abbeel/Klein.
EINHORN IN HISTORY!!!!
Go to his office hours lololol
I mean, i would say he is apathetic, and that's the problem. He wants you to do lots of work, but he is less interested in helping you learn the skills necessary for that. Hard work is fine, Hug in fact has the exact same projects, its just that he actually helps you learn the material.
He just hates his teaching requirement IMO
[deleted]
well it's either him or Sahai...
I really liked that he gave a project without any starter code, I just wish that the project was a bit more manageable ;-;
Wasn't saying you were and I am sorry I implied that. I was soapboxing.

Math 54, CS61 series, etc. are all grueling courses almost regardless of who you take. I just wanted to point out how much better you will feel if you try whenever possible to take courses based on the instructor first and foremost. 
Finkle is Einhorn!  Einhorn is Finkle!
[deleted]
Hilfinger is not apathetic. He may appear to be a lot, but he cares deeply that his students learn the material. I emailed him at after 2 in the morning and got responses. He is difficult, he demands a lot from his students, but he is responsible for generations of Berkeley CS students coding skills, mine included. 
wot
i heard sahai was at least passionate or whatever about discrete math, vazirani straight up gave no fucks at the end of the semester and openly admitted to teaching some things wrong. he was almost never prepared during the examples in class
Personally, I thought the project was manageable. Although I finished it on time, the big issue is that it was assigned right before spring break. If that had not happened, more people would probably feel better about that project.
Alright, thanks for the suggestions. I'm gonna check out this Littlejohn guy.
Yea, that's true, and its probably unfair to say he is actually apathetic, he cares, but it doesn't show in his lectures, and that is a big problem. If you have to go to office hours to realize that your teacher actually is trying to teach you, that's no good.
I found that I learned almost nothing from lectures. Giving large, difficult projects does not in itself make you a good teacher. His projects were good, I enjoyed them, but his teaching was terrible. I don't doubt he cares, but he fails to teach. When hug assigns the same projects, they are not as hard. Why? Because he teaches the requisite knowledge in order to accomplish them. The only thing Hilfiger demands of his students other professors don't is that they teach themselves.
Sahai is a phenomenal lecturer, and he really cared about the students. However, his homeworks were hell (taking 18+ hours per week). Both instructors have their pros and cons.
Eh. There's no silver bullet. Sahai can be very patronizing to students.
I fucked up by starting it the night before it was due.

Definitely manageable if you managed your time correctly, but we're college students. Who does that?!
There are plenty of teachers like this. You just have to hunt for them.

Littlejohn also teaches only the graduate level Quantum Mechanics course in the physics department. Colloquially it's been called ""like getting a drink of water from a firehose""
Just because he isn't the best at lecturing doesn't mean he's apathetic... He does try to explain and demonstrate the material well, even if his style is not the most engaging. He's really helpful when you ask him for help, too, as others have noted. (As long as you've looked at the documentation and specs beforehand. :P) I feel that he really cares a lot about his students based on my experience with him in 61B and 164.
You don't though, all you have to do is bug-submit
FWIW Hug does not give the same problems. Yes Hilfinger may not be the best lecturer, but his reader is absolutely well written, he is always answering students emails. Additionally, that last thing is something that more people should not take for granted. The ability to teach yourself from documentation and manuals is a skill which will last a lifetime, and help you a ton in future classes and beyond. I see from you're other comment that you were in his 61A which I never had, but his 61B class taught me a lot, and a know many of my class mates reminisce on it fondly now. I'm sorry you didn't like his class, but I got a ton out of his class.

Sinclair can be the silver bullet! :D (his hair) He was a really fantastic professor when I had him for CS 70.
Its not that he isn't good at lecturing, its that he chooses to lecture badly. He seems to enjoy confusing students, and he LOVES to condescend to the whole class. He would regularly make statements implying that the class was lazy, or just stupid. I have never heard him answer a question in front of the class clearly, and without a snarky remark. Not a single time. He ether doesn't answer it at all, or he is kinda a dick about it. If he had just read a cs text in front of class it would have been a more educational experience.

And to be clear, the class was pretty easy for me, I had had significant programming experience before taking 61A.
I took 61a from Hilfinger and 61b from Hug/Hilfinger with Hug lecture so i got the good teaching and the good projects for that class. Reading documentation is important and great, but it does not excuse a teacher from teaching. His unofficial motto is RTFM, and that is a problem. That does not show a teacher who wants to teach and it does not show a teacher who respects his students.
I heard he has a boss accent too
Sinclair hasn't taught in years.
Oh yeah totally! Super posh. Insert other British stereotypes. 
Yeah, I had him freshman year and now I'm a senior. "
Cal After Dark: An interview with professor Josh Hug,https://youtu.be/1qrGSg6DydY,2019-03-14 21:14:15,,"If you're gonna shoot with full daylight out the window, you need to light them better. And why the hell is the camera shaking during an interview, was even a $10 Amazon tripod too much to ask for
This is really cool. Hug is such a blessing. 

But I have to say that I wish they had a better interviewer. 
when hug says he likes [sneaking into things](https://imgur.com/AHMOLKu)
Ok I watched from about 8 minutes in and I feel like the interviewer really isn't meeting the professor halfway. The professor is going into some really interesting stuff and aside from short affirmatives, the interviewer isn't really doing much. I'm sure the interviewer is an interesting person too, but it doesn't come across in this particular video.

Couple of missed joke opportunities (honestly this is why I'm commenting, because these jokes only work on this post and nowhere else):

The part about him sneaking in was so fascinating and there was a lot to work with there.

* ""Anyone watching the video probably wouldn't know this, but this interview was actually scheduled with a completely different professor and professor Hug just...snuck in. And here we are.""

* ""I'm actually a huge fan of sneaking in to places too. A couple years ago I snuck onto campus and no one's noticed ever since.""

The standup paddle board thing was pretty unique too.

* ""I like to do standup squared which is where people meet up and do standup comedy on standup paddle boards. The audience does get a bit pushy sometimes. Literally. If they don't like your jokes they push you off your board.""

This series has a lot of potential and I'm sure it'll fulfill it given time! 

Apologies if any of that came off as pretentious.
rotating 180 degrees for better lighting also seems out of the option
i dunno.. the interviewer kind of matched the whole high school film club vibe they got going on.
I feel like most of those are trying too hard to be funny.  Like the interview was funny because Hug is an interesting guy but I don‚Äôt think the purpose of the interviewers should be writing jokes.  The second one could definitely come off as natural but the other two just seem a bit forced rather than a casual interview with a professor which is the vibe they‚Äôre going for I think.  I don‚Äôt know how this works but I imagine it‚Äôs not really a scripted production like many TV interviews, but is instead more like a regular chat.
Yeah true
Sure, they're not great jokes. I agree that the interviewers don't have to be comedy writers.

My point wasn't so much ""this should be funnier and these are jokes that should have been said."" My point was that even within that unscripted, casual conversation, there was potential for one end of the interview to be more interesting, whether that was with jokes or something else. Jokes are what I'm personally drawn to, so I suggested those. It seemed like kind of a dick move to criticize sans suggestions, and that's why I included the list."

Question about LIFE,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17jls0w/question_about_life/,2023-10-29 21:54:58,"Question: If you just do what you want to do (whatever it is you think you‚Äôre passionate about based on your past experiences with it, the thing that excites you more than anything else you could possible study/work on in your career), will everything turn out fine in the end?

Life is too short to be chasing someone else‚Äôs dream right? Coming from an immigrant family, as many of us do, financial stability and raising a family are the two biggest expectations my parents have for me. Since deciding I don‚Äôt want children and realizing I have, what you could call, unconventional life aspirations, I realized I could do and be anything I want. When Hug told us ‚Äúlife can be anything you want it to be‚Äù in one of his optional lectures last spring, my life was CHANGED (I love Josh Hug so much). Of course I forgot his words at times since then but it‚Äôs really been coming back to me recently in the midst of course selection, trying to materialize my plans for this summer, and considering possible post-CS career paths. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs a form of escapism or a coping method because trying to be ambitious in school and in corporate America is hard. But also‚Ä¶ I think what I‚Äôm feeling is a totally valid and common experience that we don‚Äôt talk about enough.

Just another rant. Thoughts?","‚ÄúLife can be anything you want it to be‚Äù

‚Äî white guy who went to Princeton
Your feelings are valid. Living someone else's dream for you can be challenging because you are the one doing the work and sacrifice. That's not to acknowledge the sacrifices your family made to help you get to school. 

The cool thing about operating in your PASSION is that ideas come that wouldn't otherwise, fortitude/effort to continue grows when times get tough, and the opportunities are endless when you are chasing something you actually care about. Most importantly, you find a sense of happiness, peace, and joy within that I think is missing from many out in the world today.

Another cool thing about life is that you can pursue many things and decide to change your mind. Not much in this world is finite. It's all about BALANCE. But how you show up to your life every day is so important, and you show up BEST when you are happy/content within.

I am no expert, not giving life/career advice. But I speak from experience as a woman who took the adventurous route through life/school/finding my passions. I can tell you, there is nothing sweeter than loving what you do every day. Figuring that part out can be challenging. Totally worth it. 

Best of luck with whatever you choose. You could be authoring a map for the ""road less traveled."" It's an adventure.
I think yes, but you need to adjust your expectations for financial stability. This may mean living in a place that is cheaper and less desirable in the end. Also consider that whatever you want to do may bring it‚Äôs own criteria of success than can be difficult to achieve besides money. 
But generally it is true that we are producing a lot of unhappy people because they do what they think they should do rather than what they want. Being unhappy and financially stable may be worse in the long run than being happy with modest means.
See how well doing what you‚Äôre told worked out for people when Covid hit. No guarantee you‚Äôd be happy going to college, getting a 9-5 job, marry, house, 2 cars, kids, blah blah. I realize I don‚Äôt want kids either. No point living the American dream 40 years down the line if I‚Äôm not happy right now.
No.
Reminds me of what my dad used to say ‚ÄúIf you love what you do you‚Äôll never work a day in your life‚Ä¶ because you‚Äôll be over there with all the other unemployed people‚Äù which in hindsight is a fn hilarious thing to say to a child. Lol. 

You should like what you do. And it should be your choice, not someone else‚Äôs. But I will say that cycles of poverty are hard to break and if you are a low income kid with financial aid at a Top University, you want to end that cycle of poverty and help your family. Which to some people is worth a life time of work you don‚Äôt LOVE but tolerate (Or maybe learn to Love!), because you Love your family more. And THATS OKAY. 

Money isn‚Äôt everything, but GOD DAMN does it help. The value of a dollar is different for each person and not everyone has the luxury of getting to follow what they love or what genuinely interests them.
StopüíÄbut didn‚Äôt he go to UT Austin and teach at Princeton
Seriously, what's wrong with being a white guy who went to Princeton? They literally give you all the financial aid you need if you're dirt poor and are accepted. Source: I was dirt poor and was admitted there with full financial aid. Think before you speak, nerd.

I see! Oh well, it's a shame, because those first 2 Itai's Git intro videos might be some of the clearest, and most well explained Git videos that I've ever seen. Thank you for the confirmation though!
I didn't find any alternatives, but I was able to complete the project with the videos/lessons available on the website, so don't let that discourage you. You can join this server that is composed of people who went through the Gitlet project, and would be more than happy to help you out any step of the way: https://discord.gg/ARsBVr2cs5
That's great, thanks so much!"
Professor Hug saving lives,https://www.ktvu.com/news/rescue-crews-search-for-man-in-pacificas-rough-waters,2020-12-08 21:35:16,,"He saved a lady *and her puppy*. Should be the next president.
lol the anchor called him John Hug
Goddamnit, classes just ended so we can't talk with him about it in lecture.
Legendary
King shit
Professor Hug is by far the best Professor I have had here <3
Witness says he dropped this in the water: üëë
favorite professor at Berkeley by far
hug is literally an angel sent by heaven
first he saves your career, then he saves your life
i LOVE him
Now I wish I'd taken 61b with him :(
What a badass! <3
Awesome professor and clearly a great person, thank you Josh Hug!
A real life superhero
1:50. you can thank me later.
I fuckin love professor hug
there's nothing this prof cannot do
Fuck I LOVE HIM
If I can be even 1/10th as cool as hug, I'll die a happy man
We‚Äôll see if Josh DeNero can one-up him...
Just about to say that lol, you got to it first
Actually we can. Afaik he's hosting live Q&A's today and friday during normal times (1-2 PM).
Bruh why‚Äôd they mute him halfway through üò¢
Coolness is best assessed on a logarithmic scale. If I could be within 1/100th as cool as Josh Hug, I‚Äôd call that a win.
Nice, for 61B, right? I'm in CS195 so I forgot about that.
Yeah it's for 61B :). How's CS 195 with Hug btw? I want to take it with him specifically and am waiting for Fall '21 to take it in case he teaches it then, and want to know if it's worth the wait.
It was pretty fun and interesting! Three essays over the course of the semester that are peer-graded on a 2 point scale, weekly lectures with accompanying reading, and this time we had a lot of interesting guest speakers come in. I generally recommend it."
"CS61b, CS70",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uryo5j/cs61b_cs70/,2022-05-17 15:53:02,On average what grades do people who got an A- in cs61a make in cs61b and cs70? cs61b and cs70 both with josh hug btw.,"In 61B A- or A typically, 70 is harder to estimate since it‚Äôs not really related
because nobody else has mentioned it yet: 61b with hilfy (this sem) has very difficult projects, but exams aren‚Äôt weighted as heavily - i think you can fail every exam and still end up with an A- or A. hug on the other hand is more exam-heavy so i believe it would more closely echo your grade in 61a than during a hilfy semester (the projects are still difficult though, and gitlet looks to be a returning staple).

like others have said, the classes are difficult in different ways. 61a is hard because the tests are brain teasers. 61b is hard because you have to do projects without handholding for (likely) the first time ever. 70 is hard because it‚Äôs a lightning-paced math course.
Based on my own personal experience those 3 courses have little to none correlation. I got B (yeah ik it‚Äôs bad as hell) last semester for 61A, but 61B this semester is almost too easy for me. Had technical difficulty for midterm 2, half of my answers were deleted by my iPad, still got easy A. For 70, fucked up the final, expecting something like B+ or, if lucky, A-. There is virtually none overlapping materials, so based on my personal opinion, you are gonna do just fine. Plus 61B next semester is taught by Hug, and 70 is taught by Rao and Ayazifar. Literally nothing to worry about.
Makes sense, thank you!
Thanks! that gives me a great idea of what to expect ahead. Appreciate you!
Somewhat similar experience!"
CS61B projects,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j0lr2v/cs61b_projects/,2020-09-26 22:44:29,"I am doing the public version of CS61B 2018 course by Professor Josh Hug. I already did the CS61b course before but at that time there was no way i could grade my work. But now thanks to professor Josh Hug, CS61B 2018 autograder is publicly available in Gradescope. I am doing the Project2 and doing it alone is so stressful. Should i skip these projects, would it be a big deal for learning the cs61b material. I am using the publicly available material to learn the material that a Berkeley CS student should learn. I already have completed cs61a, b, c and math1a, math1b. Now i am looking for ee16a,b, and cs70 but before that i want to take advantage of this publicly availabe autograder for cs61b. Any tips or suggestions for me would be very very helpful. I would appreciate any advice regarding this or for future advance courses like cs162, cs188 etc.","I would argue (as would many others I'm sure) that the projects in these classes are where you really learn the most material.  So it's probably smart to work through them.
 Your post reminded me how I had learned 61b alone from the 2018 spring public version ‚Äî I skipped some projects too, for that generation of your own world, and that Bear Map, I only finished both half of them. You have to admit that all the projects are difficult, and when doing all projects alone, it makes them even more difficult.
can I ask how to use gradescope to grade your project, i signed up to this autograder but when i upload the project it keeps saying that the files are missing, any help please?

""I already did the CS61b course..."" Okay that's it get the fuck out of here before I burn your house down. One more CS post and I'm a flip something...

We all know how you've been coding since you were in the womb and are already streets ahead of every kid at Cal who's majoring in something tech related, but for fuck's sake shut the fuck up before I rip your throat out.
I expected this as professor also said it. Any tip for doing them alone?
thnks to share
use the github option for uploading files
no stuff remain almost same
just skip the post man lmao
Sure!  First of all, make sure you've followed the preliminary lab setup stuff at the very beginning of the course to make sure you have set up the debugger and the java visualizer in a way that's easy for you to use and access.  

I worked on these projects alone (while in the class) and I used the debugger and visualizer constantly as I was coding.  I would never wait til the end, I would test every piece as soon as I finished writing it.  This meant that only one or two times did I end up needing to search for a bug through a huge block of code.  Most of the time I would find them instantly.

Second, I would say it's smart to have the lecture video playlist up on a different screen and to reference the lectures as you code.  Most of the things you'll be doing in the projects are discussed in the lectures too.  I know project 2 is rough because of the algorithms you need to implement (if we had the same project 2, but also probably still even if we didn't - I think I took the Spring 2019 version with Hug?).  So for me it was often helpful to have the videos to the side talking through the steps of that algorithm in a particular situation, and then as I coded I would make sure what I was writing would follow the same steps for that example.  Most of the time this just helped me to move more smoothly through things.  Sometimes it would help me to identify a key misunderstanding I had about a particular algorithm.

Maybe a third tip would be to keep a piece of paper and some markers or highlighters handy, or if you have a whiteboard with dry erase markers that's perfect.  Before you write a line of code you should have the objects drawn out on the board like how the java visualizer would draw them, and you should draw what you want to happen.  Then write the code which makes that happen.  This is similar to following the videos, but it works better for some people if they learn better through drawing diagrams (I certainly do).  I think a lot of the algorithms in 61B are really intimidating in concept and in text but drawing for yourself what they actually do makes them a lot more intuitive.
i did, actually this is the only option but it keeps saying that files are missing
thanks, that helps a lot. i will use these tips.
as you mentioned the error i think the java files are not on the exact directory hierarchy where autograder is expecting. Make sure you pulled the spring 2018 version of cs61b github repository. And the hierarchy should look like this- cs61b/proj0/NBody.java"
EECS Funding Town Hall Materials,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/t1a3jm/eecs_funding_town_hall_materials/,2022-02-25 09:56:41," If anyone is curious how the EE/CS Funding Town Hall went, here are the materials!

Someone who‚Äôs watched it/participated, may you bless us with a tl;dr?
Is it possible to pitch to the Bay Area VCs to fund/donate to eecs department? :(
- Per surveys, the current 3.3 declaration model leads to widespread anxiety and mental health concerns, while significantly disadvantaging URM and students with less prior experience. This has led to L&S CS having 3-4% URM lately compared with EECS's 22%.
- Out of MIT, Stanford, CMU, UIUC, UW, and Berkeley, Berkeley has the lowest full-time employment count in CS and by far the highest ratio of FTE to CS degrees issued.
- The College of Engineering receives about $54 per student credit hour (where a credit hour is 3 hours * number of units) relative to the $100-120/SCH funding received. To make up this deficit, we rely on savings from faculty going on leave (which scales directly with the number of faculty, **not** the number of students), or methods such as philanthropy, one-time allocations, fixed allocations, concurrent enrollment, etc. (which do not scale directly with the number of faculty or number of students).
- The gap between costs and funding received means the department is operating under greater and greater deficits.
- For Fall 2023 and beyond, a new proposal is in the works to have ~270 L&S CS freshmen per year. 200 will be accepted directly at time of admission into UC Berkeley, and 70 slots will be reserved for those who did not apply for CS initially but wish to transfer into the program after a year. 50 slots reserved for transfers, direct admits only.
- Potential measures for existing students include reducing the size of lower division courses, prioritizing EECS and L&S CS-intended students over undeclareds, allowing for alternatives such as Math 54 over EECS 16B, etc.
Looking at the draft plans, I would say if it gets approved, it would be a University of Washington style admission process.
Probably; something we wanted to talk about but didn't get to was external funding for EE/CS. One of the topics proposed was if we could get funding directly funneled into a fund for TA budgets instead of being stuck at the administrative level but that needs more digging into before we can concretely say that's a possibility.

Apple hardware for example though has been directly funding some EE/EECS courses, highest being CS152 I believe, and honestly if you're at an internship it might be possible to talk with people about funding the CS side. Opening a conversation tactfully shouldn't hurt anything.
> while significantly disadvantaging URM and students with less prior experience. This has led to L&S CS having 3-4% URM lately compared with EECS's 22%.

This is nuanced.

* EECS hit 22% a single year (last) because they changed admission criteria (remember CS is on academic merit - EECS is more holistic, that is subjective). It's back to 12% this year regardless.  I also don't think it is fair to use the word ""disadvantaged"" (at least in a meritocratic sense) until we have enough data on the GPAs of different groups under this revised admission system.
* LS CS has a significantly higher representation of women (28% vs 20% for EECS).  This bellies the ""less experience"" claim and also suggests the EECS admission criteria is actually *disadvantaging women* (they get in at higher rates under the more meritocratic assessment - and may be more risk averse to apply directly to EECS which can lower their chances of getting into Berkeley)

One thing Berkeley should consider is transferring rejected EECS applicants to the general L&S pool - which at least reduce the bias toward risk taking EECS produces.

On another note, did the video cover why money is not being transferred from other departments given demand for CS?
what's the impact of less FTE? i can see how there are less classes offered, but how less FTE affect class sizes? I would say barely; I would've thought the main variable for scaling classes is hiring TAs to scale with the increased grading and discussion sections and office hour
I thought it was weird that the L&S admit size was ""tuned to get the same admit rate as EECS,"" since he also speculated that people will be more likely to apply L&S to avoid being shut out of Cal. If they try to keep the rates the same the CS admit size will grow, but if they hold onto the CS admit size the CS rate will instantly be worse than EECS. It's just inherently unstable. With any luck they will get to a unified applicant pool quickly because alternatives all end up with miserable game theoretic angles.

I am at least glad that they noticed that the UCSD lottery was a dumb idea (seems like they realized last year, before it failed).
Oooo this is such a good idea, I imagine it will be a win win for both the company and the school.
It makes sense at the university level but not at the department level.  As someone reminded him, if your majors want 189 but can't get in, the play is to make your own customized 189 with blackjack and hookers (e.g., Stat, IEOR); if you do it right, you ask your dean for the added FTE and your department funding grows!
I think something that's also been a bit of a concern is if we actually **do** manage to get private funding and wind up relying on that, how much control do private corporations (or VCs) have on how we teach our courses, what we teach, and more. Almost like when politicians rely on funding from corporations.

The company's main asset would be establishing a direct pipeline to their company, but I'd imagine as a company, they'd want incoming students to have specific types of knowledge, which may not be what the course wants to teach (or primarily) teach and that could cause a conflict of interest.

So all in all... _complicated_!
It also seems large such a dangerous place to put the department in? The university should never *ever* be able to suggest that a department go beg industry for funding, and if EECS starts funding large parts of its TAS budget through it I don't doubt that the university will start expecting them to continue to find external funding and therefore never bother growing or expanding their budget."

You are receiving this email because you are an L&S student currently enrolled in EECS16B. This message is to inform you of two important changes to L&S CS graduation requirements.

* ***Effective immediately***: A grade of P in EECS16B earned during Spring 2022 will satisfy the graduation requirements for L&S CS for all students, regardless of graduation year.¬†
* ***Pending approval*** from the College of Letters and Sciences: The EECS16B graduation requirement may be removed entirely for L&S CS students. We anticipate that this decision will be made by L&S between April 5th and 8th. We have no indication whether L&S will accept this proposal, so do not drop the class assuming that it will be approved.

**Please note that if you opt to P/NP a course, you must earn a grade of C- or better to receive a P.** In other words, if you change from a letter grade to P/NP, and earn a D+, you will receive a grade of NP. A grade of NP is not sufficient to graduate.¬†","I failed it once barely, taking again this semester, so itd feels like i went through all that hard work and suffering for nothing.

I'm a first year L&S CS taking this class. I am not very sure whether to P/NP or letter grade. Any advice? What is the benefits of each? Will p/np hurt grad school applications?
Let's go guys! Make sure L&S hear us as well by signing this petition to remove EE16B major requirement.

Where are people getting this email? I'm currently enrolled in 16b and I haven't received this.
stop i love your flair and this comment was a wild ride LOL
I would say the P/NP would be neutral for grad school, a P does nothing to your GPA? ( if you pass) there are many more important upper div classes i would think theyd look at. Going Graded, you can pass with a D-, whereas you need a C- for P/NP. To me personally going graded has a benefit since I'm just trying to graduate at this point, and just like CS.

Four EECS technicals for first semester?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hqj36e/four_eecs_technicals_for_first_semester/,2020-07-13 09:59:29,"Hi, I'm an incoming EECS freshman. Is it insane if I take CS 61A, CS 61B, CS 70, and EECS 16A first semester?

I have a lot of coding experience (I've built multiple apps) and I've won awards in coding competitions (Gold division in USACO). Plus I've done proofs before in a math summer program. And since the professors are John DeNero, Josh Hug, Satish Rao, and Gireeja Ranade respectively (which I've heard are the easier professors for each of those classes), is it doable?","Tbh tho... finishing nearly all CS prereqs in your first semester is some major clout. Might as well throw in ee16b in there too for the true speedrun
Denero is not easier for 61a, people just like his teaching style.
I could see 3 (say 61A, 70, 16A) if you‚Äôre a solid independent worker, but that still leaves you with no time for anything else.  The experience in general helps, but the coding expertise is somewhat mitigated in 61A because of all the templaticizing (for lack of a better word).
Frankly, if you've made usaco gold, you won't find 61a/b hard.

Have you made aime multiple times? Would you consider yourself to be a (very) strong math student? If so I'd say this is pretty doable. I know people with similar-ish backgrounds who've done 61a/16a/70 + breadth, and if I could redo my freshman fall I'd probably take that courseload. 61b will essentially be breadth-level workload for you with your background, since 1) you're a fast coder and hug's projects aren't that long and 2) usaco gold means all the data structures material will be review.

Also, it's not like you can do anything fun this fall anyways, might as well grind lol.
That is insane, even with your experience. It‚Äôs the amount of work those 4 classes together have that would make your life miserable.

At most take 3 technicals, and add a H/SS or AC or R&C for your last class if you are really rushing to get through your requirements. Also you should look through the class websites (just google them) to get an idea of what stuff might be new and maybe even take a look at the hw and projects.
Add CS189 with Sahai too while you're at it. Don't want you to miss out on a legendary teacher teaching some Machine Learning.
baaaad idea
If you're confident, you can do CS 61A, EECS 16A and CS 70 + a humanities class; wouldn't recommend adding CS 61B to that. But remember you have other requirements beyond the CS classes. More common dedicated EECS schedules are like CS 61A + EECS 16A + Math 53 + Humanities and CS 61B + CS 70 + EECS 16B + something else for the spring which is a more balanced schedule.
dont do it.
This was my friend's first semester schedule, except he had one more AC class. He was plat in USACO and did some google challenge (basically like you). You'll be fine :^) Good luck bear!
It‚Äôs quite possible you could do it, I had a friend who had similar CS experience going in and they got through that exact schedule their first semester pretty effortlessly. But I would say it‚Äôs a risk, and won‚Äôt get you exceptionally far ahead compared to taking three.

Although that‚Äôs far above what I or most people are capable of / ready for at Berkeley you seem to have a very strong background and people of that type can sometimes pull some crazy stuff off if they don‚Äôt get distracted or lose discipline from what I‚Äôve seen from friends and classmates.
yeah would not do that. Is there a reason you want to take all 4 in the first semester?
F
if you're trying to do any clubs / research most definitely would not recommend this. it's not about the difficulty of the classes but rather the sheer workload - 61A/61B tend to have conflicting project deadlines - CS70 is a pain in the ass and EE16A isn't a walk in the park either. you could do 61A/70/16A if you have a strong discrete math/linear algebra background but don't push yourself too hard first semester - you are just discovering college after all!
With OP's background 61b will likely be lighter than most breadths. USACO gold means he already knows all the data structures material.
There's something to be said for balance and variety in a schedule beyond workload + I know Hug's projects are easier than Hilfinger (with whom I took 61B) but that's still going to be a decent amount of work even knowing the material."

I'll start: 

**[Meredith Fowlie](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/meredith-fowlie)** leads some of the best lectures I've ever attended. She's fantastic at explaining complicated concepts, she's extraordinarily engaging, and she's really open to students asking questions and asking for help. She's also absolutely brilliant, has published some of my favorite papers about environmental economics, and her office hours are incredibly informative and helpful. 

**[Daniel Kammen](https://erg.berkeley.edu/people/kammen-daniel-m/)** is possibly the most knowledgeable person in the energy sector with whom I've ever shared a lecture hall. His Energy and Society course may be my favorite class that I've ever taken, and I still use some of his toolkits as reference points. He's also incredibly humble and approachable, especially considering his insanely impressive career trajectory, and somehow managed to find time after class to talk to anyone who wanted to chat about energy. 

**[Abigail Martin](https://www.abigailnmartin.com/)** has had an incalculable impact on the way I view environmental problems and energy transitions. She's one of the first professors I've ever learned from who approaches environmental economics with such a heavy emphasis on sociological consequences rather than traditional economic impacts, which is super refreshing. Her lectures are super compact, and she manages to pack a ton of information into a short amount of time without being monotonous or boring. I admittedly am only a few weeks into her class, but she's an absolute badass and I love learning from her. 

Who are some of your favorite professors, and what did you love about them and their classes?","Paulin. Best lower-div math professor by far
Seth Lunine in Geography department. He teaches a couple AC courses called Bay Area as well as another class called California. My favorite class he teaches is a Friday class called Urban Field Study where you spend the day exploring various locations throughout the Bay Area such as numerous trips to Oakland and San Francsico. Highly recommend as a final semester course to anyone looking to fill in some final units.
Philip Geissler, quite possibly the best chemistry professor.

Wodzicki. Never met a professor who cares as much about students‚Äô development as him. What other professor would be willing to spend 6 hours after class talking to the class‚Äîmath, life advice, stories, etc.

He approaches teaching as mentorship rather than covering textbooks. Don‚Äôt understand why people say to avoid him. His class has been the best class I‚Äôve taken at Cal and it‚Äôs not even remotely close‚Äîit‚Äôs the only class where you‚Äôll find things not found in a textbook.

edit: more information to clear up the ridiculous amount of misconceptions surrounding his teaching, he *requests* non-graduate courses for the opportunity to mentor budding mathematicians. Additionally, he constantly reinforces the fact that no one aside for prodigies (and maybe not even them) learn the content in lectures alone. He constantly talks about how he struggled with abstraction as well, about how he would get lost in lectures. This puts to rest the unhealthy misconceptions and misgivings that people have in mathematics about ‚Äúmathematical talent‚Äù since he was reading university texts in middle school and so might be called a ‚Äúprodigy.‚Äù His philosophy is that lectures are for supplementing‚Äîteaching to think, providing intuition, and encouraging students (so he handled what content is covered in a very organic manner). The current lecture model where you go through chapters is a remains of the days where books were so expensive that students could not afford them. He‚Äôs trying to prepare you to think *deeply and originally* about mathematics, not to learn certain concepts in a black box.

&#x200B;

The man gives everything he has to *teaching* and he expects the same in return.  That is precisely the reason why he gets negative reviews. In this world of polite distance, it may make people uncomfortable. For others, the class alone is worth the cost of admission into Cal.
Not a professor, but Ryan Hass is probably the best math teacher I've had at Berkeley.
Austin Hedemann is one of the best parts of the physics dept here
\+ 1 on Fowlie. Incredible professor and so caring. [Richard Allen](https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/richard-allen) in EPS is also wonderful; great course, and he is an awesome lecturer.
Josh Hug and Zvezda Stankova. One taught me patience, one taught me pain..
Prof Ryan Edwards for Economics!!
Shusterman explains concepts well and is really easy to ask for help. She genuinely cares about her students!
1. [Mathew DeJong](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/dejong). Very nice man. Very good at explaining stuff. Encourages discussion in class. Runs a very nice class with a smooth organization. 

2. [Evan Variano](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/variano). Literally the nicest, most compassionate prof I‚Äôve ever had. He brought jelly beans and his dog to class often. Very nice and funny and prepares you well for the FE exam. 

3. [Adda Athanasopoulos-Zekkos](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/adda_zekkos). Super nice. Loves how she hand graded the homework‚Äôs and handed them back. Really nice to see a prof super passionate about the class. 

4. [Tracy Becker](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/tcbecker). Honestly Becker may be my favorite prof at uc Berkeley. Nicest woman ever. Great at explaining stuff. Amazing at literally everything. I loved her class
Ula Taylor. so knowledgeable and passionate about AA studies. AA 116 is one of the best classes i‚Äôve taken throughout college
from a bio student perspective.

Mary Kelsey from Sociology is always the best on my list.

also John Kuriyan (mcb) and Leslea Hlusko (ib) but both are not at cal anymore
JIM CAMBEL. ECONOMICS
Y'all, if you could say something nice to your favorite professors the next time you see them, I bet they'd love to hear it. I work at Berkeley and passed along just a handful of the compliments here with a note that they've made a positive impact.   
Some of the responses from your favorite professors:   
""Wow and thanks. I feel like this person must be talking about someone else. Way too kind. It is incredibly nice to hear this.""   
""Thank you so much! That made my day!""   
""Thank you for sharing this. Indeed, I'm grateful for the affirmation - one never knows if lectures are landing well this early in the semester. So nice to hear.""   
""Why, thank you! It's a great feeling to be noticed for doing good work.""   
""Thank you for sending that to me. I have been fortunate to have many wonderful students.""  


Thank you all for contributing to this positive thread!
Trevor Murphy in the AGRS department. I took his class on Greco-Roman magic and it was clear that he was having just as much fun teaching about magic as we were to learn about it. He teaches in a very classic lecture style.
Ani Adhikari! I had the great fortune of taking Data 8 and Stat 134 with her, and she's just one of the best lecturers in the Stats dept. - let alone in the university.
Darren Zook. Politics of South East Asia. Super nice guy very funny and charismatic. Super interesting class and relatively easy as well.
It‚Äôs still early in the semester, but professor Jim Campbell is amazing! I love going to his lectures. He makes the material very approachable. Last semester I really liked Jeremy Sanchez, and Harvey Dong is legend!
John DeNero is the best. Julien Lafortune was pretty great too, as was Ryan S Lundell-Creagh. Oh James Campbell was great too.
James Sethian is by far the best professor I had. I feel like I learned more in that one semester of Math 53 than I did in all my previous math classes combined. Plus, his lectures were incredibly interesting and fun, most of the time I forgot it was an 8 am because I wasn‚Äôt falling asleep.
[Jay Keasling](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/keasling) (ChemE/CBE); I was actually in his first class as a prof in 1993 and I thought he was terrible. Turns out, that was probably me and not him.  I ended up having him for ChemE/CBE 162 Control Systems. I never really had a prof explain and teach a complicated subject so well. 

It's now been 30 years later, and even though I mainly work in software, the control theory I learned seems to pop up all the time. For comparison, I also took the general engineering grad level version at Stanford, and the instruction competency was night and day.

And a shout out to [prof Clark's](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/clark) kinetics class (cbe142)
Can‚Äôt spell Hawkins without a W
Dr. Christine Palmer American Studies department absolutely brilliant
Professor Fish in Poli Sci, along with Gurowitz. Great, knowledgeable, and approachable.
Rosenzweig. He teaches ugba 192 edible education they were very inspiring and knowledgeable, always invited very interesting and influential guest speakers every week. 

Huntsinger. She teaches espm 186 Grassland Ecology. Shes super nice, very accommodating and presents very valuable information, definitely an expert in her field and the class was very well organized and informative.

So many others, Brashares, Carlson, Chapela, Stephens, Lightfoot
Since this is a sub for the city of Berkeley as well, I‚Äôm gonna add Linda MacAllister at Berkeley City College!! She‚Äôs been teaching sociology for over 20 years and her academic focus is on death! Cal tried to hire her multiple times but MacAllister rejected them bc she‚Äôs for the people. Genuinely, an incredible teacher and academic that I feel so lucky to take classes with. I‚Äôm dual enrolled just to keep taking classes from MacAllister bc there is a true love for sociology without all the bullshit of bureaucracy and elitism around it!!
Robin ball! She was the nicest and made a relatively intro class exciting for everyone that was involved. Loved her passion
Edwin Lin and John Kaiser from sociology
Christopher Lowman, Josh Hug, Kurt Spreyer
Prof Whitney was a great CogSci professor. And he‚Äôs also an excellent department head. 

Prof Filippenko teaches one of the most interesting classes in the most engaging way. He seems like a super cool person too.

Prof Hinshaw is excellent and an absolute legend. It feels like an honor learning from him.

Prof Steven Piantadosi seems like a really nice guy and his future is bright in research. 

Prof Mikiko Siva is super super nice. One of the easiest classes I took at Cal, but it was fun.

Also RIP Prof Andrew Packard üòî
Karthik Shekhar was an amazing professor in the Chemical Engineering department
JOSH HUG!!
Dylan Sailor from the classics department is probably the best professor I had as an MCB/Data major. He handled the transition to remote classroom gracefully right when the pandemic started. I had him for Classics 34 and he was so good that I took him again for Classics 35. Great storyteller and really draws you into the Greek epics/tragedy. I think he has been teaching ancient Greek language or something recently, but if he‚Äôs ever teaching poetry I would HIGHLY recommend ‚Äî a STEM student who greatly underestimated the possibility of being interested in poetry.
Kent Puckett in the English Dept. Amazing lectures, kind and gracious with student interactions, creates interesting assignments with no busywork, plus he is funny. My favorite class at Cal.
Matthew Walker for psychology of sleep. Super nice dude, incredibly interesting and useful subject presented in an extremely easy to digest manner. Fucking loved every minute of that class.
My guy paul pierson in poli sci. Guy absolutely understands how the country works and can explain it like im 5.
Carol Clover, my undergrad film thesis advisor and easily one of the most intelligent people I‚Äôve ever had the privilege to take classes and learn from.
Timothy Clarke in the philosophy department!
Dr Khalilah Beal Uribe is the best math professor that I‚Äôve ever met! She always make sure that students are engaged in the class and her test is fair. A great teacher whose aim is making students understand math but not making students failing in math.
Hilfinger
Max Auffhamer (environmental econ) - overall such a cool dude, and a great prof
Vivek Subramanian - I took 3 semiconductor device physics courses from him. He was my favorite lecturer. He moved to Switzerland a few years ago.

Also loved Dan Garcia. I almost failed 61C but I learned so much I never cared what grade I got.
STEVEN LEE: English BETH Piotote: comparative Lit

Laleh Behbehanian. Everything a professor should be. Cared so deeply about her students, the material, and the future of her class.

Nikhil srivastava is amazing
Paulin the goat
Professor Ranade!
Professor Lihua Zhang for Chinese! Amazing professor and so, so passionate about what she's doing ‚Äî her love of teaching and languages is contagious!
Pauli Li! His enthusiasm and passion!! Switched to Cogsci after taking his class. Sadly, he doesn‚Äôt teach anymore. :(
Prof Alex Filipenko!!!!! 

One of the most passionate and engaging professors at Cal. Seriously, you will not regret attending one of his lectures of Astro C10. 

Words cannot express his incredible ability to teach. Made me feel like I could actually DO astrophysics, and do it well. My major is the farthest thing from it (environmental studies). :)

&#x200B;

Tip: Go to Wheeler on halloween. He dresses up as a ""black hole"" and ""emits gamma ray bursts"" (AKA throw candy at the audience). Not to miss!!
Also, Dr. Crystal Chang is a literal icon and we stan. She rocks and I LOVE the way she engages the class in her lectures. Truly and intelligent and excellent professor, extremely approachable and makes time for her students. Loves walking and talking with students after class about lecture content (shout out poltical economy 101 !!)
smh srivastava erasure
SRIVASTAVA??? HE GOATED AS WELL
I took California my first semester at cal years ago and it was one of my favorite classes I ever took. Seth is amazing.
I took his Urban Experience class a couple years back. Great professor and a super cool guy in general!!
Rest in peace for real.
i still have videos of him singing is chemistry songs with his guitar in my camera roll. truly the best professor i‚Äôve ever had.
YES I scrolled down to comment about him but it‚Äôs so cool to see someone already did. I loved his class.
YESSSSSS delay was amazing in Fall 2020, he hand made all the lectures and was sooo good at explaining them
He truly is!
Taking him for the first time now and he‚Äôs great!
Could u recommend a class taught by Wodzicki? For context, I‚Äôm taking math 110 and math 113 atm
100% agree! His grading is a little stricter than others but he is also easily one of the best lecturers I've ever had
He is the best! Always so passionate in teaching. I remember he held extra office hours in a cafe in downtown Berkeley before exams. What a dedicated prof!

Edit: this was pre-pandemic
Taking 61B with hug right now but let me say.. i took stankova‚Äôs math 10A and i‚Äôve never had an experience quite like that one. definitely one of the ways to inaugurate yourself into berkeley lol
Honestly I really liked taking 53 with Stankova.
I‚Äôm with both right now and this is accurate. Soooooo very accurate. Especially for the latter.
I love her!
THE. BEST
So awesome that you did this!! The professors are excellent :,)
love Prof Campbell, he changed my mind about microecon with his 100a class!
DeNero is great. Was super glad I got to take his Data100 course
Aaaaaaaaaanouncements
I agree, and I took his classes over 25 years ago.  I still remember him climbing the chalkboards to connect concepts on different boards.  His classes were so engaging and entertaining.
Fish is a HOT take. He‚Äôs super smart but I couldn‚Äôt stand his lectures or his personality. Agree on Gurowitz though, I took three classes with her and learned a ton
I saw her at the picket line during the strike multiple times. Based and a great lecturer.
i love both of these profs <3

I have absolutely no idea who you are or what you're talking about.

i cant accept any other answer but srivastava![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage)
Same, he‚Äôs a legend and why I went from a MCB to a chem major. I miss him dearly (ALtho I didn‚Äôt have much personal interaction with him)
[deleted]
His classes are some of the best classes I‚Äôve ever taken, and then you find out he designs most of the coursework for physics LDs too behind the scenes ‚Äî and most of the trouble with those was the professors anyway.
I took Russian Poli Sci and it was great. Since he did his Phd in Russia, super interesting!

CS61B Academic Honesty Email Curiosity,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/36c9qi/cs61b_academic_honesty_email_curiosity/,2015-05-17 22:52:14,"Just received another real-time email from Josh Hug from CS61B regarding academic dishonesty:
""If you:
1. Copied an answer from someone else's final.
2. Discussed the morning exam before taking the evening exam.
3. Copied code from another student on any project (note: we are just now processing most of the project plagiarism cases for the semester, owing to the significant time required)

Then you have until noon on Tuesday to come forward by emailing me and/or your TA. Between the MOSS software we use for plagiarism detection and the multiple versions of the exams, much of our evidence is unequivocal.""

I'm so curious to why copying answer on the final is the first point he made. How is that even possible, and how would they even catch that? There are so many students in 61B, so many tests to grade, so how would they have the time to cross-examine everyone's test to see if they cheated or not?","Here we go again ladies and gentlemen, our timely end of the semester CS class cheating scandal. 
How about this (TA here, not for 61B): 1. If you did cheat, as the email states, it's pretty incredibly hard to talk yourself out of it if you are flagged. They know. They often just need you to say the words, and even then, they will still file a report with Student Conduct. 2. If you somehow didn't cheat, and were flagged, you need to explain how you had similar code, or test answers.  This is usually solved by whether or not you were sitting next to a person, you can prove you've never met them, had contact, etc.  Honestly, the chances of being flagged and have not cheated in some respect is like .01%, but regardless, just be honest.  

Regardless, and this applies to everyone on this sub, if you've cheated, JUST COME FORWARD.  I know that TAs, Profs, and the entire staff will be so much more forgiving if you just admit your fault.  Just say you're incredibly sorry and ashamed, and while you may see a serious grade penalty, in the order of a letter grade, it's a MILLION times better than getting a letter to Student Conduct, and potentially, expelled. You want forgiveness, and not pissing off TAs even further who want nothing more than to be done with your case.

Edit: Just wanted to clarify something. The worst possible scenario you can be under is that you are accused of cheating, YOU KNOW YOU'VE CHEATED, and still try to deny it will really bullshit arguments like ""It must be a coincidence,"" ""I've never even TALKED to people about this project"" etc. etc.  This will cause you to be smited in the worst possible way. Don't be that guy or gal. Best Possible scenario? You, right now, with this email in your mailbox, makes you realize ""Fuck, I'm caught."" You immediately email Prof. Hug with Title ""Incredibly Ashamed and Sorry"" and you write the best apology letter you can muster.  That will most likely not save your grade, but this is the one window to come forward, you might as well.
Well if you do quick sort on all the cheating papers then you can get it done in O(nlog(n)) duhh..
prepare your anus
I have zero personal experience with this, but I have to believe that cheating is not uncommon.  It's not that hard to understand why desperate people in incredibly competitive situations, who feel their chances at success slipping away, would make a bad choice.  

It IS a bad choice.  Chances are you will get caught.  But having been caught, you can choose to admit your guilt, sincerely repent, and learn a valuable lesson, or risk probable expulsion.  Given that you are not a uniquely flawed and horrible human being, but just someone who made a bad choice, I think the proper response is pretty obvious.
Better fess up, OP!
It's an e-mail sent to everyone, they obviously can't manually track down everything as the class is impacted and thus would take a looot of time to sort out the cheaters from the fair players. Therefore, they use intimidation and scare tactics to identify cheaters..which seems to be working on you. 
Time to get the popcorn. I'm amused by this spectacle every time it rolls around. You'd think they'd learn to not cheat by now.
This is not really true. MOSS makes it pretty easy to catch cheaters on projects, even when they try to obscure the evidence of the copying. Also, it is certainly possible to catch cheaters on exams in large classes and it has happened before.
Well it's a different batch of students each time, each of whom thinks that he or she can get away with it.
Liberal Arts here.  Can you explain in broad terms how MOSS works for the curious?
Of course there's still a chance someone could get caught, I'm just saying that the probability of being able to get away with cheating on a physical test is much larger than say a class of 200 people.
Well, we don't know the exact details because knowing them might make it easier to cheat, but to my knowledge MOSS is a scarily accurate program that compares the structure of different peoples code, so even renaming things won't throw it off. It's been in use for awhile now and from experience I've seen it catch a lot of cheaters.
Simply put, it's kind of like Turnitin.com for project code. 

I actually talked to Turnitin people once and they said they actually acquired a copy of MOSS, so the two products might become one sometime.
Well, it might help a bit that they have every single test scanned... in addition to knowing who sat next to each other.
The details aren't especially secret. For instance, [here](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigmod03.pdf) is a paper explaining the basic ideas behind MOSS. I really don't think knowing the details of how it works makes it easier to evade because the details are somewhat complicated and it's also just a very effective program.
turnitin seems cool but honestly, if a gsi/prof doesn't have time to read 20-30 papers and give insightful feedback, they are ""doing it wrong."" 150 years ago, all student work would be done IN LATIN.
But caught in the action? No. In order for them to take advantage of the fact that they have the information of the people that sat next to each other, they'd have to go through the work of having to suspect that people have cheated in the first place. Also, cheating isn't limited to just looking at other people's tests.

What I'm trying to say is that with a large class size people could still physically cheat without getting caught. Whether or not the staff is capable to detect that is up to them. 
I meant that in the sense of we can't actually look at the code for MOSS to see exactly how it is implemented, but of course it uses methods already explained in the field and we can make reasonable assumptions about it, but its exact details are obscured so people can't figure out exactly what gets past it.
Wait, do you know what turnitin.com is for? 

Professors still have to read all of the papers and give insightful feedback - that's not what turnitin is for; it doesn't do any real grading for you. It checks for plagiarism by comparing it to its database of writing/documents found online as well as all other submissions previously or currently submitted into turnitin, and gives a percentage similarity to other documents found online. Anything more than a few words is a red flag.

MOSS does the same thing but with project code.
My point is that IF there's any flag that shows something doesn't add up, such as unusually getting a high score on the Finals, but like 2%s on the midterms... they can then use the scans on the subset of all students they suspect of cheating. 

Obviously, there's no way they would go through all 1000 students, but with 10+ TAs/Readers, they can easily go through the scans of students they suspect of cheating and compile all evidence. Yes, the majority of them will get away, but the point is... if they suspect you of cheating, they will likely have good evidence.
""Never rely on security through obscurity.""

One of the tenets of security....
lol sorry I just finished taking CS 161
There is this online editing thing where you mark up the papers via their tool, including being able to drag and drop the ever-useful markup ""awk."" And built-in ""rubrics"" -- which might actually be pretty useful for high school essays, now that I think about it
That's a fair point, I'll give you that. 

Although that's kind of mean with the whole 2 % midterm thing, what if the kid really did improve? Hahah
Sidebar: would you recommend 161 and can I take it concurrently with 61C?
Oh huh. Didn't know that.
Yes (especially if Wagner is teaching), and probably not. 161 assumes you already know C and machine code. So if you don't, you should definitely take 61C first.
I second /u/MeetMeAtThePub. 

I took it with Dawn Song, who teaches a modified version of Wagner's, I believe (which is awesome if you don't like math like me, because I heard Tygar's version is *all math*).  There were 3 different parts: security in OSes, web, and networks, with 3 projects, 3 problem sets, 2 midterms, and no final. It was abnormally easy. The projects are also really fun (WE GET TO HACK INTO THINGS!) and in general everything is on the light end.

No, don't take it with 61C. IMO:

- Required prereqs: CS 61C
- Recommended prereqs: CS 162, CS 168

You need to know C for the OS project, as well as how memory (stack/heap) works, which requires CS 61C at the least and preferably 162. I also found that the network part of the class was made significantly easier because I took CS 168, so a lot of that part of the class was review to me (especially since I've actually had to build a firewall for CS 168 before). 

Definitely take it if it sounds interesting to you. The second project (web) is one of my favorite class projects that I've ever done. 
Okay thanks!
Okay, understood. Thanks for your input!
You're welcome. :)"
CS 186 or CS161 (or CS188)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n0oj1n/cs_186_or_cs161_or_cs188/,2021-04-28 13:52:35,"I'm planning to take CS170 alongside one of these classes. I'm having a hard time deciding between 186 vs 161. There's perks to both. 186 is being taught by Josh Hug who's goated and I've heard that knowing databases is actually kinda important in SWE industry. However, I've heard that this class is similar to hilfinger 61b in terms of workload which is a pretty exhausting time. For 161, it seems like it covers some pretty cool topics. I don't know how applicable it can be to industry, but I'm assuming that can be. I've also heard that it has a low workload. Can anyone vouch for this? The only thing is that I hate coding in C lol. Also, another option is 188 since I heard it's one of the easiest cs upper divs in terms of workloads, but they're trying to increase the difficulty. I've also heard that this class is completely useless in terms of practicality. I plan to take it at some point, but idk if i should do it next sem. I wanna devote a lot of time for recruiting next sem so lmk what y'all think!","not 100% on this but hug is probably just teaching the class in name, usually the lectures are pre-recorded from an old semester (by a different professor) and the class is run by TAs
Took all 3 of those classes throughout undergrad. Personally, 161 was my favorite since the projects and topics were extremely interesting. 186 uses prerecorded lectures, and all the (solo) projects are extremely time consuming - to the point where it‚Äôs hard to get help in OH since everyone‚Äôs attending them. 188 was interesting as well, but more theoretical/less applications as 161 so it was conceptually more difficult but still a pretty low workload.
There is only 1 portion of C coding in 161 and that's for project 1 which really isnt that long. For 161 the longest time suck is project 2 but before and after that it is quite smooth sailing. 188 has more projects but they are all relatively short, probably half the size of a 61a project. 188 exams and content does contain some more math/theory/probability stuff so be ready for that.
I'll second this: if you're looking to take a Josh Hug style class definitely don't take 186. The projects and exams are written with an ego more bloated then the legacy SQL databases they teach about, and the lectures are pre-recorded and quite old. Overall I loved 61B, but 186 did not give me the personal Josh Hug wholesome experience. If you want (a) Hug, take 195, don't take 186. I really did love 188 though
How is the workload for 161? What class could you compare it to?
I would say that 161‚Äôs project workload is slightly higher than that of 188, but since it‚Äôs conceptually easier it took me a lot less time to study for exams so it kinda evened out. Disclaimer though: I took 161 the semester that covid became a thing, and I have heard that they added a new project that was in beta my semester (aka was less work when I took it) so the workload might be higher now. But even with the new project, the workload is still a lot lower than that of 186, 61A/B/C, etc.
Ok, sounds good! as long as it's less than 61b or 61c lol

Theater 10: How difficult is getting into this class? Is there a good possibility I won't get it if I say that I'm only available for the 12-2 section?

Data 100: I really want to take another course with Josh Hug because I have him in 61B rn and I love him. But is the class hard if I haven't taken data 8 and only learned linear algebra through 16A? Should I take Data 8 next semester with the hot indian dude and then take Data 100 in Fall 2020? I might also want to double major in DS.

CS 70: Should I take the intro to mathematical thinking before CS 70? I'm really dumb when it comes to math and I even postponed math 53 to next spring, so the thought of taking 70 terrifies me. Should I take 70 spring 2020 with Sahai, Fall 2020 with not-Sahai, or just next semester without having taken that decal?

Thank you I'm just really stressed and I got a 35/100 on this 61B project and I just wanna cry, so every bit of help is really appreciated.

FYI I'm pretty sure sahai is not teaching CS70 spring 20, babak ayazifar is. Where'd you get that info ?
theater 10 is so much fun! literally just show up and you get an A (seriously don't miss class-- there is no outside work). just make sure you kill the audition and use an actual monologue from a play (do not use anything from a movie or tv show, trust me). and don't use a super famous play like hamlet lol

I've heard some suggestions on this subreddit of going through the material on you own over break being useful since the notes are very digestible. That courseload itself seems pretty maneagable, but if you wanna take the semester to do the decal first you have have plenty of time and don't need to declare asap like cs majors do.

I was accepted in the early cycle and I'm currently looking for housing so I wanted to ask you for some tips/recommendations if you have any!

Also I wanted to ask if there is a free gym at the university or not and shall I look for an apartment with a gym/swimming pool or not.","Tips for housing: search UC Berkeley Facebook housing groups/ Craigslist/ Zillow. Be wary of scams, if it seems too good to be true it probably is. If possible, don‚Äôt sign a place until you (or a trusted friend) has seen it in person. 

The university does have free gym and pools! (Google berkeley RSF)
Definitely look on Berkeley Facebook groups, most ppl are students or recent alumni. If you can, I would also look in places like Albany and El Cerrito, you can sometimes find cheaper options bc they‚Äôre not right next to campus. if you do look outside of berkeley tho, make sure it‚Äôs near a bus stop (51B, 52, F, 79, 36, and 6 go straight to the campus so ideally those but you can always get a connecting bus which is what I do) since it‚Äôs free for students OR a bart station but you have to pay fare for that
Welcome to Cal!
Yes--free gyms and pools on campus, although they are often crowded. A lot of gym, pool, and field space is monopolized by Intercollegiate Athletics.

Very few apartment buildings in Berkeley have pools. It's just not common here, probably because the weather is temperate, and also because apartment building owners near campus don't really need to provide extra amenities in order to get tenants. The city of Berkeley does have some public swimming pools. 

There are a number of private gyms in Berkeley. I personally can't tell you anything about their quality, price, etc.
Tips for housing: im currently looking for a 4th roomate so I that's an option you're interested!!
 Also RSF (campus gym) is free for students
Oh also Cal Rentals!
Thank youu!! I will definitely look into these places.
is this the real Josh Hug?
Hii, ig we can talk abt that cuz why not!
Actually it isn't free. Every student pays for it out of their tuititon.

Edit: And it's a lot.
Interesting, is it good?
Ahaha yeah thats true oof
I think so! It‚Äôs basically a site where people can advertise housing. You need a Cal net ID to log in so it‚Äôs a bit more secure than something like Craigslist. I think you can find roommates on there too."

How to cure CS 61B PTSD?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/126vtyy/how_to_cure_cs_61b_ptsd/,2023-03-30 11:51:38," 

Three years ago, I took CS61B at UC Berkeley for the third time and struggled a lot. I didn't even know how to start the final project and barely passed the class. I had dropped the class two times before as I couldn't even solve Hilfinger's Enigma challenge. Back then, I felt that I was mentally slow to process all these materials and couldn't find a good way to digest all these things. My estimation of big O was always wrong, and my code was always running the slowest in class. Choosing the appropriate data structure or algorithm for a given situation was always a mystery to me. Coding in Java and debugging were painful as hell. I hated the fact that CS61B gave no iterative feedback for assignments and projects, and allowing multiple submissions was meaningless unless I knew what went wrong and how to fix it. I was defeated and questioned whether I had the proper IQ for this industry.

Now, I am on track to becoming a data scientist or data analyst. I always convince myself that as long as I avoid developing deep reinforcement learning shit and work for the non-tech industry, I will thrive. But with the massive waves of layoffs and ChatGPT and Xcode copiloting replacing data scientists and analysts with low skills, I feel like it's the most urgent time to pick up the SDE skill sets that I have left behind.

Some questions for you all: Should I take CS61B again during the summer, or should I join a boot camp? What are some of the best boot camps that you would recommend? Is Leetcode helpful for beginners (Yes, I classify myself as a beginner)? What side projects do you recommend that I should do so that I can at least pass the resume rounds and get some interviews? I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS & ADVICE!","You shouldn‚Äôt take 61B again, you‚Äôd also have to pay to take it over the summer. You can redo some assignments if you want, but even that‚Äôs probably not worth it.

I think it‚Äôs still a bit early to be afraid of being replaced by machines, and if it does because something we have to worry about, I doubt a CS boot camp is going to save anyone.
Just take the class. It‚Äôs not like it requires any amount of talent to pass or anything. Just do practice problems/go to office hours when you need help/learn the material seriously. I‚Äôm also going to guess that the PTSD affects your performance, so might need to address that if it is of notable concern.

I know it might seem pretty hopeless when you‚Äôre alone trying to solve a problem and there is no help available; that‚Äôs why you form study groups. Because it seems to me like you are just tackling assignments by yourself, and struggling to complete them alone.

[deleted]
I see. If CS boot camps aren't that helpful, how tangible do you think it will be to self-educate and become a software engineer in 1 to 2 years?
This is how I know you're not the real Josh Hug, he'd never laugh at someone in a situation like this.
If you took 61B and passed I think you are a more competent software engineer than you think. That‚Äôs totally feasible."

Grind leetcode so u get familiar with the data structures and algorithms so u don‚Äôt have any conceptual difficulties digesting them when u see those in class
This is pretty good advice, I‚Äôd just go on the 61b departmental YouTube channel and on hugs channel and watch the videos. You can also access previous iterations of the course website where there will be an abundance of materials including discussion worksheets!

U learn as you do. You don‚Äôt learn by watching a video. If you don‚Äôt even know this you might as well switch to humanities already.

Learning by doing is not the same as reinventing the wheel, and it‚Äôs sad that you assumed I was referring to the latter. I assumed it was common knowledge that one must somehow expose oneself to data structures(via videos/books/whatever works for you) first before being able to apply it on problems, the same way it should be common knowledge that one must first pull pants down before being able to pee, so I omitted this part in my original post, but apparently this is not common knowledge to you and you demand further clarifications from me on this. Now you have it, you are welcome. 

Sorry for getting you triggered but your points remain null.

CS61A or CS88 for data science minor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/r0ylbu/cs61a_or_cs88_for_data_science_minor/,2021-11-23 22:35:35,"I'm taking Data 8 this year (would probably end up getting a middle or low B) and is thinking of doing a data science minor. Would CS61A or CS88 be better for it? What are each's strengths and ""weaknesses""?","61a staff strongly suggests taking 88 if you're doing it for data science // have the option to take 88 over 61a, primarily because 88 teaches you all the parts of 61a that would be relevant for a foundation in cs. 61a spends its last third going into content that's generally not very useful outside of cs -- your time is better spent honing the relevant parts in 88!
Tl;dr: if you gotta ask, take cs88. If you want more of a challenge, Use 61a materials since you can download the labs/hws and all the other materials publically available.
Cs 88 strengths are that it covers the fundamentals, and if you want more practice, or want to challenge yourself more, everything from 61a is at your fingertips. 

Cs61a has a very fast pace, which is a weakness or a pro depending on a number of factors. I think cs88 has a better pace for learning, for most people who are even considering this question.

Also, Cs61a midterms/tests are quite the challenge, where‚Äôs cs88 is much less stressful. Again, you can grab the 61a material to test yourself or practice more, I did at times when I felt good about the material.

I took cs88 and had a great experience in cs88, as well as in cs61b with Josh Hug.
[deleted]
61b is listed for DS majors, not for minors. However, is it better to take 61b than not taking it anyways (cuz my major is a social science & am bad at most STEM stuff)? Will I be unprepared for other DS minor classes if I don't take CS61a?
I would say that you should be ok with 88, unless you are planning on taking CS classes as your elective(s).  In which case you would have to take CS 61B and/or CS 61C and/or CS 70.  Which sounds like a rabbit hole you don‚Äôt want to go into.  Also, if you do intend on taking the Data 100 pathway, that requires the one year of Calc and Linear Algebra as a prereq/coreq.
I took cs88 and 61b. 61b is a really great course when Josh Hug teaches it!"
CS61B or CS70 over the summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/a1xaqs/cs61b_or_cs70_over_the_summer/,2018-11-30 14:42:03,"I want to take either 61B or 70 next summer. Which would be a better choice, or would you recommend taking neither over the summer?

(I'm a freshman in L&S, intended CS. My 61A grade will probably be a B+ so I'd need to do pretty well in 61B/70; other CS/math courses I'm taking are Math 1B currently, and EE16A next semester. 

My current plan is to audit 70 next semester, take it during the summer, and take 61B next Fall).","61B over summer is taught in a lab-based format (61bl) So you would be doing somewhat lengthy lab assignments as opposed to watching lectures. Projects/exams are similar though last summer they included some functional programming on a couple of the exams. 

If this sounds interesting then go for it. I havent personally taken 61bl but I AI'd for it last summer and it seemed pretty cool albeit mildly janky at times. 

I would personally take 61B next spring with Josh Hug and take cs70 over summer. Mostly because Josh Hug is one of the most universally loved professors in the CS department and you will have an AMAZING time taking 61B with him. CS70 probably isn't as important as 61B so you might as well just knock it out over the summer (grading is arguably a bit better for 70 over summer as well).
I took CS 70 over the summer (2018) and it was definitely a lot of work. Monday to Thursday there is lecture every day so it is easy to fall behind given how much time it takes to do the homework assignments. If you don't form a good group of people with whom you can work on the homework with, it will be pretty tough to get good grades on the assignments. Some people I know cheat by looking up past homework solutions online but for obvious reasons you should avoid doing this. In addition to this, the lectures aren't webcasted so if you want to do well in the class you need to attend every live lecture (or watch previous semester webcast I guess). 61bl from what I have heard is also tough because of the barrage of projects and exams. Keep in mind that during the summer the usual professors aren't teaching the class so there is a possibility that you end up with shitty instructors. Overall I would only recommend taking 61bl/70 over summer if you are adamant on trying to declare as soon as possible. If you had to choose one I would go with 70. Otherwise, just take the class in the fall.
if you're getting a B+ in 61A i'd go the safe route and not take either over the summer.
CS61BL is easier over the summer than regular 61B. I personally found that it was a well-run class that covered most of the material than 61B would cover and it is easier to score a good grade in if you're worried about your GPA. If it's your only class over the summer, you'll have plenty of time to work on the projects and absorb the material.
Thanks! I probably won't take 61B over the summer then since I feel like having more time on projects during the semester would be more helpful. Did you take 70 over the summer? If you did, then did you find the pacing too fast or was it alright?
Do you think 70 would've been easier during the semester then? And what math classes had you taken prior to 70 (and did any of them help?) Thanks for the advice btw!
I've heard that CS70 might actually be easier over the summer despite the faster pace, is that true? That's partly why I'm considering taking it over the summer instead of during the semester.
Since I don't want to take both 61BL and 70 at the same time, which one would you recommend taking over the summer? It seems like most people I talked to recommended 70, but I'm guessing you took that during the semester?
I did not. My roommate did though and he found it OK, but he also prepared a fair amount beforehand in the preceding weeks (session C starts like a month after school ends). 

Taking it over the summer is a popular choice so you will be in good company if you choose to do that.
I took Math 54 and EE 16a prior to taking 70. I'm not sure if that level of ""mathematical maturity"" really helped; apparently it helps if you have taken 16a and 16b before.
I thought it was kind of nice to be the only class I had to focus on all summer. Still hard as hell and you be focused on it much of your waking moments, but overall I think it's less stress than during the regular semester. Especially if you can find a consistent study group
Take 61B. 70 is best done over the semester when you have more time to digest the material"
