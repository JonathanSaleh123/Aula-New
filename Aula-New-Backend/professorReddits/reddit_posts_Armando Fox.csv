"TIL that Berkeley professors Andrew Isaacs, Armando Fox, and Vern Paxson are scouts for Sequoia Capital",http://www.wsj.com/articles/secretive-sprawling-network-of-scouts-spreads-money-through-silicon-valley-1447381377,2015-11-12 20:05:41,,"[deleted]
There's an easy way to get around it. Open the article, then click the email button on the left. Paste the link into your browser and you bypassed the paywall.

Or just click this link: http://on.wsj.com/20Qc8D1 
Go to the following page

http://www.capitalistconcept.com/post/6557763377/wall-street-journal-verses-the-financial-times

and at the bottom there's a link that signs you into the author's WSJ account. Now you can read any article!
Can you do this with the Financial Times? WSJ is practically free (12$ for a 12 week subscription), but the FT can be pretty pricey. 
Yes, you can do so using the Google news trick. Google News has partnerships with publishers to allow users to view three free articles per day (their ""[first click free](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/09/first-click-free-update.html)"" policy). You can abuse this for free articles.

Example: Take an article you want to read (like [this one]( http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/11/11/2144531/the-euro-was-pointless/)), then search for the article title in google news. Click the link from there and you will be able to read it for free.

To get around the ""three per day"" limit, do this in an incognito/private browsing window.
fun fact: FT is MORE expensive if you try to get the subscription as a ""student"" vs the normal option. fml

Thank you so much. You are awesome!
Good thing I'm not a student anymore! (Either way it is too pricey for me)

Fall 2023 Schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1239doe/fall_2023_schedule/,2023-03-26 20:07:58,"Background: Want to graduate next fall for internship and job reasons; need to take 5 technicals (17 units minimum) to accomplish this goal (only requirement of the five is that one has to be EECS16B).

Taken:

FA22: 61A, 61B, EECS16A, SOC 113AC - 16 units

\- A+ in 61A, 61B, SOC 113AC,

\- EECS16A was not too difficult but just didn't like circuits so didn't want to study much (avg grade)

SP23 (currently): 61C, CS70, CS186, CS194-244(Star Assessments with Dan and Armando Fox 3 units), Engin 125 (Ethics 3 units) - 18 units

\- Doing well in all classes except CS70 (around average - I don't study and highly dislike that no programming takes place in the class)

Planning out different schedules (fairly set on CS164, open to suggestions for others; also ideally I take an upper div ECON class such as 138 for fun as P/NP - but not set on it):

1.) EECS16B, CS164, CS161, EECS106A, CS194-177 (Decentralized Finance 1 unit).

2.) EECS16B, CS164, CS170, EECS106A, CS194-177 (Decentralized Finance 1 unit).

3.) EECS16B, CS164, CS170,  CS161, CS194-177 (Decentralized Finance 1 unit).

4.) EECS16B, CS164, CS170,  194-26 (Computational Photography), CS194-177 (Decentralized Finance 1 unit).

5.) EECS16B, CS164, CS170, 194-26 (Computational Photography), EECS106A

Any thoughts on these schedules (or any ""must take"" classes before graduating) would be highly appreciated! Not looking to have my nose in the books the whole time - (currently still have time to pledge a frat and be somewhat active in a tech club). I also generally like programming/doing projects much more than theory and have a fairly strong background in robotics.

Edit:

I am interested in Computational Photography 194-26; just haven't had too much info on it (difficulty wise); appreciate any advice or opinions please drop them down below!","IMO you shouldn't be rushing to graduate so soon, you're probably only going to have this type of experience once in your life, maybe try 4 semesters at least. But if you are dead set, I'd vote for option 3 since 170 and 161 are very valuable classes. I also think taking classes like CS 162 and 189 would be very valuable, but taking either of those on top of any of the options would be a killer.
[deleted]
why the rush? (If you‚Äôre a freshman)
Got it - appreciate the advice!
Why is 161 valuable? Have you benefitted from understanding certain portions of the class in industry? If so - what industry roles? Thanks!
Correct
I don't love the school environment and don't feel that I am learning as much as I was when I spent time programming on my own vs. taking classes. I also have an internship offer from a company I am very excited about and want to capitalize on a return offer; not having to worry about re-recruiting in this market.
all i can say is you're cracked"
shoutout to Peyrin for answering Ed questions at 5:31 am 6 hours before the final <3,https://i.redd.it/5191remoyd6c1.png,2023-12-14 20:26:55,,"I'm actually not even sure if the man slept before the exam, he was working practically all night making last minute fixes and printing in Soda ... respect
yeah pretty sure he was up the entire time and just took a quick nap between 8am-10am based on his another ed post lol (he said not to freak out if he didn't respond in the morning bc he'd be taking a nap until 10)

Blueprint - Technology for Nonprofits!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/178q28/blueprint_technology_for_nonprofits/,2013-01-24 21:52:42,"Hey Berkeley Bears,
     My name is Jay and I am part of a new club on campus called Blueprint. We seek to work with campus and local organizations whose missions are to create community and promote social welfare to implement technology that would be useful to them.


Our first projects will be web and mobile applications! The club is very similar in style to CS169 and our faculty sponsors include David Patterson and Armando Fox. An example project that we are talking to Oakland Children's Hospital about is a scheduling platform for Doctors, Nurses, and Volunteers for their training. We want to make organizations efficient and help them with their missions. This is particularly important because nonprofits usually do not have the resources to fund such projects.

Check us out! Our applications are due Sunday February 3rd!
