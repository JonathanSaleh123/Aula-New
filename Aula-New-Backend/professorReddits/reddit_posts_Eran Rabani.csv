Chem 120A with Eran Rabani?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/146y4k9/chem_120a_with_eran_rabani/,2023-06-11 09:23:00,"Wondering if Rabani is a good lecturer & grader for Chem 120A, or should I wait and take the class with Neuscamman? Thanks :)","I didn't take it with him myself, but some friends of mine did and they seemed to have liked the class much more than I did (I took it with Whaley). 
I did take Chem 96 with Rabani though and he seemed like a very personable/intelligent guy, so I think it would be a good class to take under him.
I'll take it with him then! :)"
