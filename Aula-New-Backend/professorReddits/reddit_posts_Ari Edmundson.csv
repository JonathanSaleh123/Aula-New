ESPM 167(Kurt Spreyer) vs DATA 104(Ari S Edmundson) for DS ethics,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q698vg/espm_167kurt_spreyer_vs_data_104ari_s_edmundson/,2021-10-11 16:57:48,"Which one do you think would be a lower workload? I just need it to fulfill the DS Ethics requirement, nothing more.","My old roommate took data 104 iirc and he really really hated it. Said it was more work than he expected. 

i had kurt spreyer for espm 50ac and he seemed alright (tho 50ac is known as kind of a joke). his exams weren't too difficult imo. he is really strict on not having laptops in his classroom but ppl would usually sit in the back and use them anyways
