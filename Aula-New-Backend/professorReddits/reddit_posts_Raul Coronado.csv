Chicano 20/Raul Coronado?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11gckpg/chicano_20raul_coronado/,2023-03-02 12:10:20,"Hi, can anyone tell me about this professor or the class in recent years? I looked at the general Berkeleytime distribution for the class (lots of As) and then for the only session taught by him (1 A in a class of 47 for Fall 2016), and then the professor’s Rate My Professor entry. In regards to Chicano 20, he got a negative comment in 2016 and a great comment in 2021 (2021’s grade distribution does not show up on Berkeleytime for some reason), so I really don’t know what to expect from him.  

I just wanted a class where I could relax a bit more, but this is actually compounding my stress with my unexpectedly difficult MCB course. Help…","It was a pretty chill class when i took it in 2021, no complaints
I took his class that fall of 2016 lol I was a freshman and I thought it was a lot. I read the Rate My Professor review, and honestly, its spot on. I did pass the class with an A- tho
I was beginning to think nobody on Reddit would have taken this class. What if you do somewhat poorly on the exams? Like, is there any leniency in terms of grades? 
I actually made this post also because I think I didn’t do that well on the first BCourses midterm.
Yep. A bunch of people got A- grades, apparently… How about the positive review for 2021? Do you think he might have changed something? Also, could you tell me more about the class format, e.g. exams and other assignments? I’ve been trying to find a syllabus, but I can barely find any information on his Spring 2021 session.
I ended up pnp'ing the class cuz I only did the bare minimum. Overall my test grades were like a 60% and I still got a P.
Did he seem friendly or anything? I think he said in class that he was more uptight with his appearance or something before COVID, so I’m wondering if COVID changed something.
yeah I thought he was, but also it was through zoom so I never talked to him in person"
