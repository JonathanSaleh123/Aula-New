Take Earth and Planetary Science classes!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mwbkcc/take_earth_and_planetary_science_classes/,2021-04-22 11:40:10,"Hello everyone. I'm writing to put Earth and Planetary Science classes on everyone's radar for the upcoming phase 1 enrollments. This fall we will be teaching breadth courses on climate change, earthquakes, the oceans, and introductory Earth science.

I personally will be teaching EPS 102: History and Evolution of Planet Earth (M,W,F 3-4) and I would really like to get people with diverse backgrounds taking the class.

This class covers the origin of our solar system, the origin of life, Earth's climate and tectonic history from the recent ice ages to global catastrophes billions of years ago, the evolution of life from microorganisms to complex animals, and more! The class has no prerequisites other than high-school level math, chemistry, and physics. Anything you need to know is taught.

Average grade in the class: B+. Most common grades A or A- depending on the semester.

Example comments from recent course evaluations:

•*The course does a really great job being accessible to students outside the EPS department. I took it as a breadth class and was daunted in the beginning looking over the syllabus. Even though many students had taken EPS 50 as an ""unofficial"" prerequisite, I didn't feel like I was disadvantaged coming in with zero knowledge. It was well organized to build understanding from the ground up. I also think Professor Stolper is an engaging lecturer and he took the time to go over key concepts patiently multiple times to reinforce them, which is surprisingly uncommon. I think this course should be publicized more as an alternative to classes like Chem 1A which students from other departments take for the Natural Science breadth. I learnt a lot more than I thought I would as the class (not being central to my major) was low priority for me but ended up being one of my most interesting classes at Berkeley.*

•*Professor Stolper is a very strong, engaging lecturer. I really enjoyed the way that he explained the course concepts, and his style of teaching ensured that I always felt included, even within the lecturing format.*

*•It was like listening to a well–made podcast: lots of compact, in depth, well–explained info*

Main criticism? I have bad handwriting. This is true.

*His handwriting is a little yikes but he knows it and will try to rewrite for you.*

Other classes to consider:

EPS 7: Introduction to Climate Change (M,W,F 2-3)

EPS C20: Earthquakes in your backyard (T/Th 11-12:30)

EPS 50: The Planet Earth (T/Th 2-3:30)

EPS 82: Oceans (M/W/F 10-11)

UC Berkeley","Took EPS C20 last semester and had loads of fun! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a cool class to fulfill their Physical Science breadth
Have not taken this class, but can attest that the EPS department is a fun one! I have taken an enviro science class (80) and the oceans one (82), and both were definitely fun, informative breadths that I actually enjoyed going to!
EPS classes are wonderful! Looking forward to taking 102 in the fall!"
