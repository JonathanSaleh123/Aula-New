Engin7 Appreciation Post / Review with Professor Mohamad M. Hallal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18gcbjd/engin7_appreciation_post_review_with_professor/,2023-12-11 19:21:35,"I want to begin this post by expressing my utmost respect and appreciation for Professor Hallal and how he transformed the Engin7 (E7) curriculum. I remember reading online and hearing from my upperclassmen friends that Engin 7 was a horribly run class with very little proper structure and guidance in place. However, my experience this semester with Professor Hallal completely shattered all of those preconceived notions. This is the first year that the course shifted gears away from MATLAB and moved towards Python implementation (we still covered a little bit of basic MATLAB functionalities regardless). Despite being a new professor, Professor Hallal has proven to be an approachable, thoughtful and reliable instructor. 

**Course content:** It is an intro to programming course so the contents are obviously not going to be out of this world. In fact, I would say all of the content is very accessible and easy to grasp especially if someone has a solid understanding in calculus and linear algebra. If you have experience with basic python syntax and how iteration and recursion works, then this class requires very minimal studying outside of the provided lectures and labs. 

**Labs:** Most labs were not difficult. It felt as though some labs were pretty tricky but I honestly feel as though the level of difficulty is perfect. Although I said the course content is relatively light, the density is still there so I really enjoyed how Professor only sprinkled difficult problems and made most of the labs educational but still manageable and enjoyable. 

**Grading:** Professor provides bins and he goes off pure points. It seems fair. I haven't taken the final as of yet but I don't see myself struggling to get a good grade. 

**Exams:** Like I just said, I haven't taken the final so I may be speaking too soon. However the two midterms felt very fair and reasonable. Both in difficulty and grading wise. 

**Course support:** I think this is where I was kind of taken aback with the quality of this course. I heard that the support structure was few and sparse but I felt very supported and heard. Professor is a very busy man so I have no idea how he does it.  He offered one on one meetings in this fairly big class (400+ students). If you couldn't make it to the in person lectures, he would always provide an alternative option to make up the points (a bcourses quiz of the day kinda thing). 

**Resources:** Lecture recordings were solid and prompt. Ed discussion is well maintained. The slides, annotated slides, notebook solutions, and everything were all useful. The UI of the bcourses page is easy to navigate and it felt nice to use (sometimes the bcourses page is just so ugly that it makes learning the course content such a turn off, I wish instructors realized this. Professor Hallal did a very good job at making navigating the course resources very nice). 

**Overall Conclusion:** I enjoyed taking this class. The implementation of the numerous numerical computation techniques were interesting and it felt like I was learning! Might be my favorite class so far at Berkeley. Overall rating 9/10. There's always room for improvement but it was such a good experience. Learning shouldn't make me want to hurt myself. It should be supportive but yet rigorous and Engin7 run by Professor Hallal is exactly that, in my opinion. Just felt like I had to write this appreciation post because I feel as though the information you can find on the course in this subreddit is no longer reflective of the state Engin7 is in under the guidance of Professor Hallal. ","Strongly agree - the way this class was organized felt perfect.
glazing crazy, he wasnt even that goood this semester
Copy paste this for the course evaluation next time
glazing cuz the opinions of engin7 found on the sub is overwhelmingly mid/negative so i gotta tip the scales :p"
