Anthro 3AC with Daniel Fisher,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/runfzt/anthro_3ac_with_daniel_fisher/,2022-01-02 16:04:18,"Howdy! I was wondering if anyone has experienced this course with this professor. If so, do you have any tips for me? Background: pre-med, intended MCB, not the greatest reader (but I will work hard!).","I didn't take it with this professor, but Anthro 3AC is one the MOST painfully boring classes ever. I lost count of how many times I embarrassingly fell asleep in class. You are graded only on a few assignments and the reading is quite dense and boring. 

It depends why you need to take this class?
I thought Professor Fisher was good but I didn't take this class with him.
easy A if u stay on top of things. as an anthro major i always stay on top of things.
Oh dang… honestly I can’t find any other course I should take that would be a little easy :(((
Thank you!
Thank you!
Just for an easy course for GPA boost? Or breadth requirement?
For AC req! And to just reach the minimum units, lol. I’m taking Chem 3A, Bio 1B, and Theatre 10.
Take ESPM 50AC if available or wait till you can.
Or if you’re into acting, take theater 25ac. Super easy and fun
Thank you! Will drop.
Ooh, thanks for the suggestion! Love acting, hoping to pursue a minor in theatre and performance studies! :)
You can always take a decal to get to the unit limit FYI.
th25ac would def be very enjoyable then! Super interesting and relevant to anyone who's interested in theater
IIRC Fisher has an anthro of film class that he said he liked to teach when I had him for 100. He was a very engaged professor and cared a lot for his students."
Tips for Anthro 3ac with Daniel Fisher,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xh880p/tips_for_anthro_3ac_with_daniel_fisher/,2022-09-17 22:36:26,"So I have Anthro 3ac with Prof Fisher, which is heavy on reading and notetaking, not my strongest suit.  Any tips for how to do well in the class, things to focus on and things not as important? Also what can I expect for the quizzes and the midterms?",
ESPM 50AC (Kurt Spreyer) vs. ANTRHO 3AC (Daniel Fisher),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k09soi/espm_50ac_kurt_spreyer_vs_antrho_3ac_daniel_fisher/,2020-11-24 09:45:27,"i've registered for both of these American Cultures Classes, but I need to drop one.

I've heard Spreyer was a little difficult this semester, is that true?

I'm taking CS 70 so I can try and declare computer science so I want to take the easier class.

Any advice would be appreciated.","I took 50AC with Kurt a few years ago and it’s so easy. Just attend section and do the assignments and he will give u the A. Final project is super open ended and I don’t even think there were any legit exams.
I am in ESPM 50AC right now and have taken ANTHRO 3AC.

DO ESPM 50AC no doubt. It's super easy.
ESPM 50AC is great. I remember having to do a couple of quizzes, a project, and a few papers. It’s really not that bad, but you may have to get a course reader unless they provide you all of the materials now
When I took it there was an in person essay prompt based exam, but with zoom u it's probably been relegated to just something on bcourses which is much less stressful"
Anthro 3AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kfsqs9/anthro_3ac/,2020-12-18 12:16:16,"For those of you who have taken Anthro 3AC with Daniel Fisher, what is the workload like? How were the exams? What does a typical week look like for this class? I would appreciate any specifics. Thanks! Could I also get the same advice for those who have taken MCB 50 with professor Beatty?","I'm taking it too! It seems like this is the first time that the teacher is teaching this course, and he's rated moderately high for difficulty on ratemyprof, so I'm lowkey scared
following! I’m taking 3AC in spring too
hey there! I am signed up to take Anthro 3AC with Daniel Fisher this upcoming semester, so I was wondering how the experience was (if you did end up taking it?)
Hey. I did end up taking it. Since it was all online for me, it might be a different experience for you. However, I do gotta say that my experience was heavily based on my GSI since lecture was asynchronous. My GSI was terrible, just talking the whole time and being rude to his students. But in terms of workload, there would be readings and you would post your thoughts on it as a mini reflection paper weekly. From what I remember for exams in bcourses, there were multiple choice questions. There are big essays as well, and once again, your GSI basically makes or breaks it since they grade it. Any other specific questions?
Lectures are actually going to be online again this semester. The only thing that’s in person is my discussion section. I’m honestly so anxious about the whole GSI make-or-break factor because I don’t think we choose our GSI’s :(( I wanted to drop but I can’t find a course to replace this one. Are there any tips you’d have for me for doing well in this class? I’d really appreciate it!
I never really paid much attention in the class, but the only thing to worry about are essays. For that, check in with your GSI about the format that they think is best, then use that format. As long as you go with what they prefer, you should be fine. In regards to make or break, definitely try to switch discussions if need be to a GSI that truly cares about the subject and is capable of breaking things down with students. For me, I did not enjoy nor care for the class because of my GSI. I do recommend making a post on this subreddit for a variety of opinions and tips. Anything else?
Got it. Thank you so much for the advice, I will go ahead and make that post. That’s all I have for now, appreciate it a lot.
Sounds good. Good luck next semester!"
anthro 3ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/147bsiv/anthro_3ac/,2023-06-11 18:48:36,anyone who has taken this class that can give me a review on it? thank you!,"dependent on professor. i took it w daniel fisher and he was a terribly boring lecturer and overcomplicated things, but I had a great gsi who made the class so much better. readings are long and boring, but concepts not difficult at all. if u put in the work easy a imo"
how do you find instructor emails before class starts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/whnupz/how_do_you_find_instructor_emails_before_class/,2022-08-06 06:03:33,i need to contact an instructor asap so pls help hhh the directory doesnt seem to provide contact info?,"If you know their name, just use the emails auto directory
Go to Calcentral > My Academics > Click a course name in the Fall 2022 section > click on the instructor name colored blue. It should lead you to a page with their information
hi! I just tried this for an instructor & it just had their UID but no email. how would I contact them in this case? (also sorry for asking, I’m a freshman and an international student, so I’m really lost rn)
i did that, but it only had their uid… does that mean im just out of luck or is there an alternative?
I’m kind of good at finding stuff like this. Give me a few prof names and I’ll give it a shot
