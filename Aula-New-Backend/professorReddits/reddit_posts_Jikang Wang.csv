Math128A w/ Ming Gu or Math104 w/ Jikang Wang,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/162c485/math128a_w_ming_gu_or_math104_w_jikang_wang/,2023-08-26 17:52:01,"I've only taken Math53 and Math54, which of these two classes would be better suited / easier for me to take this semester?","My friends in math think that Math128A is cringe (especially with Gu).   
One of my peers who took Math104 said she suffered and barely passed because she hadn't taken the Math55 prereq.  
I would say both classes are feasible if you have enough time to study and go to office hours, but it would require a lot of extra time if you don't have Math 55. 128A is probably a little easier if you have coding experience, but they also require a group project if you take it during fall or spring. My math friends think the best order is Math 55 â†’ 110 â†’ 104 â†’ 185 â†’ 128a, but I've only taken 128a so I can't accurately say anything about the others.

I took Math W128A with Persson over summer, and I came in with Math53, 54, and E7, which were the suggested pre-reqs. However, my math 54 knowledge was shaky because I took it with Wehrheim over covid, and they covered eigenvalues in april when it should have been covered much earlier. I could have gotten an A- if I went to office hours, but I was too busy with other classes/research and ended up with a B.
Okay got it, thanks for the advice!"
Math 113 and 185,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bwby00/math_113_and_185/,2024-04-05 00:22:07,"Should I take them concurrently next semester?

Also I'm not sure which prof should I pick for each. Right now 113 has Mladenov and Rui Wang, and 185 has Pasqualotto, Korotkikh, and Jikang Wang. If you've taken classes with them, how was your experience?","I think it's okay to take these two classes concurrently. 

I took a class with Rui Wang before, tho not on algebra. I think her teaching was okay, but in terms of logistics it was pretty chaotic and she was also not very responsive. Overall a pretty meh experience.
i previously had a bad experience with mladenov with his class being quite difficult but curious about the 185 profs
no you will die"
Math 113 Spring 2024 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1778p93/math_113_spring_2024_professors/,2023-10-13 14:05:14,"Hello looking for advice on math 113 professors for next sem. 

Options: Nicole Gonzalez, Kendric Schefers, Owen Barrett, Jikang Wang, and Aleksandra Utiralova

For reference I am taking math 110 this sem and haven taken all the math 113 prereqs. ","[deleted]
How hard is the final for her class? I have midterm in an hour and I am very behind so i don't think i will do well. Going to need to clobber."

What's with all the free space on Thursday and Friday??? Oski would be absolutely disappointed, and you'll bring shame to your family for generations.
easy! maybe add a weekend job for extra cash?
I thought you wanna have lunch with me :/
Dude is speed running college ðŸ’€
Never know there are 7am classes
Holy shit how many units is this
certainly there's a Friday PM seminar you can fit in there...
too many empty spots
No weekend classes? I hope you are doing an internship or fellowship too.
Only if you're ok with graduating later smh my head
Youâ€™re slacking off on Friday evenings.  Surely there must be a Chem 1a or EECS 16x class you could have taken with a Friday evening lab.
you forgot to  schedule time for crying
Itâ€™s enough to train a LLM
lil bro is taking math 202B and math 105 at the same time
Where are the extracurriculars? Need to join at least 5 clubs, one per day of the week
Too much free time, maybe get a job? ðŸ¤”
Rookie number
When I was at Berkeley I actually became Evanâ€™s hall. So like step it up
Too much free time Tu/Th mornings.
Looks like youâ€™ve got a bunch of lines of smarties
You forgot to add Yogurt Park to 6pm Friday.
Only one lab that goes to 10pm? Weak sauce.
There is no way you wonâ€™t have conflicting final exam times
I'm assuming your weekends are free, pls add some online classes to it
YOLO
Glad you got your r5b in
Seems a little light, maybe you should try applying yourself lol
add a few decals to cover the gaps after 9 and 10
That ChicanX studies class is gonna be tough
lol this is edited right?
where is cs70?
bro's gonna levitate to class
Itâ€™s Scandinavian so they are probably practicing daylight saving /s
itâ€™s alright I have seen people took 105 AFTER taking 202B
CS70 --> EECS 126"
