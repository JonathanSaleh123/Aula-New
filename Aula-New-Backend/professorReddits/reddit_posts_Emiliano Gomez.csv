1b with Arun Sharma or Emiliano Gomez?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cg7h04/1b_with_arun_sharma_or_emiliano_gomez/,2024-04-29 12:08:13,Title. Which would you reccomend more? ,"Sharma is not good at lecturing but is lenient with submitting stuff late & makeups. Iâ€™ve heard his grade bins are also pretty lax but not too sure
I didnâ€™t take precalc or calc before I got to Cal but I had the pleasure of having Sharma for 16a and now half a semester of 16b (he took over for Talaska mid year due to her medical issues, but she was terrible) and he is pretty good. His office hours are crazy, theyâ€™re daily, and he answers on Ed anything near instantly and at nearly all times. Even when he was a GSI for 16b before he took over the class, he made his own worksheets for students when Talaska failed to do so. Most people arenâ€™t a fan of his lectures, but thatâ€™s the only criticism of him. His midterms can be a little challenging if you donâ€™t do the worksheets, but as long as you practice and do homework youâ€™ll do fine. Heâ€™s shifted bins to be lower and he curves midterms up. So overall Sharma is very organized, provides plenty of review sheets, and is fair with grading, but you may need to do a bit of self studying
Sharma responds ed discussion posts within the first milisecond and is very helpful in general, has 3 different office hour slots every week. However his exam can be quite difficult as they donâ€™t follow the same question format from your HW. I took 2 of his math classes and Iâ€™d say youâ€™ll def learn stuff, hes very good with answering your questions
Currently taking Math 114 with Gomez. Heâ€™s great and Iâ€™d recommend him - very available for office hours, and cares a lot about his teaching & his students. My one criticism is that he goes a little fast in lecture sometimes, though I think thatâ€™s partly the nature of the class Iâ€™m taking with him and he will probably slow down when heâ€™s teaching 1B.

I donâ€™t know anything about Sharma.
Sharma a cool dude, hosts lots of office hours
arun sharma is great"
Emiliano Gomez or Suncica Canic for Math 53?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y93qu7/emiliano_gomez_or_suncica_canic_for_math_53/,2022-10-20 10:03:00,"I'm trying to plan my Phase 1 classes for next semester, but I do not know which teacher to take for next semester. Apparently, Gomez was a Math 16B professor previously.","Gomez is one of the nicest professors I've taken, and he always makes class fun to go to.
Canic is usually the best 53 prof out there, this is Gomezâ€™s first time teaching it so no clue
Canic 100%, amazing professor, beautiful notes
Both are very competent instructors, so take whatever section is most convenient. Shouldn't be a radically different experience either way."
Math 1B in fall 24,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bxfsp3/math_1b_in_fall_24/,2024-04-06 09:34:00,"I am gonna take math1b in the fall and there are two lectures by different profs, Arun Sharma & Emiliano Gomez. I would like to have some advices on whom I should enroll with? 

&#x200B;","Sharma is a great professor
I had Sharma for 16A he was very helpful I had no calc experience passed the class and will be taking 1A with him after taking 1a this summer nicest guy and has an insane office hours schedule

why? genuinely want to know, I'm also choosing between Gomez and Sharma"
Trying to decide on a Professor Recommendation,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/118r0yj/trying_to_decide_on_a_professor_recommendation/,2023-02-21 22:30:40,"I'm in the process of applying to transfer out of Berkeley to another school, and I'm figuring out which professors I should ask for a recommendation. I need two, and they specifically have to be from a math or science professor. My main problem is that all my classes were huge, and I honestly don't think attending office hours every so often helped much to get my professors to notice me. I was wondering if anyone had experiences on getting recommendations from the following professors, as well as advice on how to approach asking them for the recommendation. Currently, these are my only options:

1. Alexander Paulin(Took Math 1B last semester with him, got an A-)
2. John DeNero or Hany Farid(Currently taking CS61A with them, doing alright in the class)
3. Satish Rao(Currently taking CS70 with him, could do better, but not terrible)
4. Emiliano Gomez(Currently taking Math 53 with him, could do better in the class ngl)

Thank you for any help in advance.","Paulin for sure â€” Iâ€™d recommend him even if you got a lower grade. Heâ€™s a genuinely good guy who would always go out to help a student 

Denero would probably not agree to write you one given 61A is such a large class, or even if he does I bet itâ€™ll be pretty generic and thus less impactful 

Not sure about Rao but Iâ€™ve heard good things from Gomez so Iâ€™d shoot my shot with him
Thank you so much for the input! I think I'm gonna take your word and reach out to Paulin & probably Gomez. I think it's a little easier to approach the latter, since I have class with him, but how do you suggest I approach Paulin? Should I just email him, go to one of his OHs, or something else? I'd also appreciate any tips on how I should say it."
Math 53 Professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e6esdd/math_53_professor/,2019-12-05 01:18:42,How are Prof. Philip Wood and Prof. Emiliano Gomez for Math 53? Thanks!,"I donâ€™t know Wood, but I can strongly recommend Gomez. I have him for number theory right now, and heâ€™s been an amazing teacher. Heâ€™s compassionate and works hard to make the material enjoyable and understandable for students. (Not to imply itâ€™s easy! Number theory has been pretty challenging, haha)
How are the assignments and tests that Gomez usually gives out? Is he a good lecturer?
Homework has been fairly challenging (with a few *very* hard problems), but he gives hard homework with the understanding that students can come in to office hours or use Piazza. (His office hours are very helpful). I wouldn't be surprised if his approach is slightly different for Math 53, however; number theory is an elective upper division course with under 40 students.

Tests have been very fair. If you have a solid understanding of the material, you'll do well; he's not thrown out huge curveballs.

And yeah, I'd say he's a good lecturer. He tries to make lectures engaging, and makes a point of clarifying ambiguous points from the book."
Math 1B (Paulin) vs 16B (Gomez)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g3d4th/math_1b_paulin_vs_16b_gomez/,2020-04-17 16:31:54,"Hello! Has anyone had experience taking math 16b with Emiliano Gomez? Iâ€™m taking Math 1A this semester, but my friends told me 1B is going to be difficult! My intended major is Business/Economics. Which class is easier? More enjoyable?

Any advice would be appreciated! :)) thanks!","Paulin is an ABSOLUTE MATH GOD. DEFINITELY TAKE HIM IF U HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. Not to mention that he's an absolute snackðŸ˜‰
I am currently in 1B and can say that while it is challenging, it is definitely doable. Paulin is a fantastic teacher (just won the distinguished teaching award!) and explains things very clearly. If you donâ€™t understand something, he has 10 hours of office hours a week so easy to go to those. Furthermore, Math 1b unlocks more opportunities down the road in Business and Econ (classes, research, etc) that you wouldnâ€™t have access to if you just took 16B. I havenâ€™t taken math 16B so I canâ€™t speak to it in detail. However, many friends have taken the class and say it is really hard. So 16B isnâ€™t easy per say, just slightly less content perhaps. For these reasons, I would just do 1B. Teachers make a big difference, and even if it is more content, it is hard to beat being taught by a distinguished teaching recipient!
I second the other comment; Paulin is an incredible professor. Difficulty wise though, Math 1B will be harder. I took 16B and then 1B (decided to pursue a math minor), and I can say 1B was much more rigorous. 

If you aren't trying to pursue higher-level math and want to keep your GPA up for Haas, definitely go with 16B. Keep in mind though that if you end up doing econ and want to do 101 series (which is much more mathy), 1B would probably be more helpful.
Gomez is a great teacher. He sends out lecture notes days earlier and plans out the semester very fairly. Homework is not too heavy and he is very fair with midterm content. I have him for Math 53 right now and he has been super helpful during this tough time.

On top of this, Gomez also offers clobber policy(use grade on final as grade for midterm).

Would highly recommend!!
Paulin is an awesome teacher who's also been insanely accommodating with the current situation. He does give a lot of homework though usually
Tbh 16b is fine if youâ€™re comfortable with math, having taken both 1B was comparatively much harder. Iâ€™ve also taken a Haas econ class and none of the math was anything beyond what we learned in 16B, so youâ€™re definitely fine for Business classes at least if you only take 16B."
Self studying math 110,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dglctw/self_studying_math_110/,2024-06-15 09:09:33,Are there any resources for self studying the class? I canâ€™t seem to fit this in my schedule. ,"I did math 110 with Olga Holtz. We used linear algebra done right. You can find the book online and just work on the problems in the book.
I couldnt find a math 110 course directly but many schools use linear done right. Axler himself also has a video series on YT. I know UCR has a lot of the solutions in the book posted somewhere too. There is also a GWU course.Â https://blogs.gwu.edu/robertwon/2024/02/02/linear-algebra-done-right-course/
You wonâ€™t be able to test out of it if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re asking. If you want it purely to know the content the course textbook is Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler. When self studying I usually work through the chapters and do every nth question where n is some number between 2-5 depending on how many the questions there are.
Sheldon Axler's textbook is available online with accompanying videos on his website! (https://linear.axler.net/)
Thereâ€™s also a YouTube channel by the author that goes over everything in the book.
+1 for linear algebra done right, i took 110 with emiliano gomez"
Math 53,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cnmo1i/math_53/,2024-05-08 19:39:23,"Has anyone taken their math 53 final yet? If so, would u say it was difficult? Im extremely scared i wont pass, i already dropped it last semester because of sethian so this is my last chanceâ€¦","Don't worry about it. Last year, I straightup got a D on the final and still ended up with an A in the class. The curve is very forgiving
It wasn't too bad. If you go through the practice final and the finals with solutions here: [Exam and Syllabus Database - Tau Beta Pi, California Alpha Chapter](https://tbp.berkeley.edu/courses/), you should be fine imo.
Its not difficult. Do you need some heads up?
Who'd you take it with? Canic says she doesn't curve but I was mean on first midterm, within one std deviation on second, and within 2 on final, really just want that C-
Wow, I took it fall 23 and got a 70% on the final and ended up with a C. Curve was horrible and no clobber policy.
Thank you!!
Any advice would be gladly appreciated!
Took it with Prof. Emiliano Gomez"
"Fall 2015 Math 53, E. Gomez--teaching style?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/399t4d/fall_2015_math_53_e_gomezteaching_style/,2015-06-10 00:49:03,"Hi y'all!  Upcoming junior here that's finally mathing again after Fall 2013 Math 1B.

So I was trying to do some research on this professor/ instructor, but all I could find was this [page](https://math.berkeley.edu/people/staff/emiliano-gomez).  Ratemyprofessor has nothing on him, so I was wondering if anyone knew anything about his teaching style, the format of his lectures and tests, etc.?  Has he taught before or is this is first time teaching at Cal?  All the page says is that he is the Math Diagnostic Testing Project Coordinator.  

Thanks so much! (: ","Gomez has taught before, I've taken Math 151 and 152 with him. Those classes are focused on mathematics in the secondary school curriculum, so he has experience on how to teach effectively. He's a great professor and does his best to help the students as much as possible, I couldn't recommend him more. In addition to office hours, he would respond to any emails I had about the homework and was very helpful and kind.
Thanks for your reply! That really is helpful.  So do you think that his curriculum will be similar to previous semesters?  
I didn't take Math 53 with him, so unfortunately I can't say what his curriculum is like compared to Math 151/152 since they are very different classes. I don't see any reason for him to do anything different though.
Alright!  Thanks for the information.  (:  I'm glad to know that he's a helpful professor!"
Should i drop math 110,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xekzfp/should_i_drop_math_110/,2022-09-14 19:44:37,"Im taking math 110 rn and idk if I should drop it or not. I've been doing well enough so far but the proofs in the hw is getting increasingly tedious (I'm spending multiple hours for some of them), so I'm thinking it might be best to drop it in case the proofs get even harder. Has anyone who has taken 110 with Gomez before? How difficult do the proofs get after matrices? The sum notation for matrices is super confusing for me so it's really hard to do proofs with matrix indexes and the like. Do you get used to it?","Itâ€™s Emilianoâ€™s first time teaching it and Iâ€™m in the same boat. So far, office hours have helped a lot but without 55, the class is much more difficult. It just takes more practice."
