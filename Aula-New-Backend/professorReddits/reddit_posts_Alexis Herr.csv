"anthro2AC, history 178, or psych 136",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/t6ilog/anthro2ac_history_178_or_psych_136/,2022-03-04 05:07:36,"Hi, I'm an IB major and I'm planning to knock out some breadth courses for summer 2022. Has anyone taken these courses and knows which has a lighter course load/ is easier for a good grade. Thank you!

\-anthro2AC archaeology w/ Christopher B Lowman (heard anthro2AC was boring but this specific prof has good reviews)

\-history 178 holocaust w/ alexis herr (UPPERDIV)

\-psych 136 human sexuality","Highly recc anthro 2ac as someone taking it now. The course material can be interesting for some but Prof Lowman really does his best to ensure that students are doing well (aka open note quizzes, multiple attempts on said quizzes) and even if you're not interested in Archaeology he has a lot of fun anecdotes for you to engage with! Its also super light and easy on grading :D
Anthro with lowman is literally a free A.  Also pretty interesting imo
Anthro 2AC. Literally the easiest class I've taken here at Cal. Prof. Lowman is also a 10/10 professor.
Anthro 2AC
Psych 136 is fun. It can be quite easy if you've learned biology, or have had some scientific knowledge about biological sex/gender/sexuality in general. you have to finish reading a whole ass book, which can be a lot if everything is new. but since you are a bio major, and the exam is open note, just going through the book once is fine. plus attending all the discussions could get you an A.
oh i actually meant that im an intended bio major, plus I'm really bad at reading. is it like a whole textbook or just book? would u still recommend for people who cant read really well?
It is a whole textbook. But its language is very simple. Personally i am bad at reading too. English is my second language. But I do find it very easy to read. The hard part for you might be some of the biology things, such as how the hormone cycle works for women's period. Personally I feel that that is the most difficult thing."
