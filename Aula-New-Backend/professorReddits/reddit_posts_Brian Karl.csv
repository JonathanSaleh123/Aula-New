ANTHRO 3AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n0kvbf/anthro_3ac/,2021-04-28 11:04:35,Has anyone taken ANTHRO 3AC and/or professor Brian Karl ? Or does anyone have any recs or advise for a minor in anthro ?,"I took Anthro 3AC with Brian Karl for summer bridge last year; truthfully, the lectures were rather boring but as long as you do (most of) the readings and listen/participate it’s a relatively easy A.
i took 3ac not with karl; i thought the class was okay. agree not the most interesting, but one of the easier As ive gotten at cal
i took it fall 2019 with fermei and yurchak— it was pretty easy (crash coursed before the midterm and final and got an A) but i’ve heard it’s gotten a little bit more difficult since then; also depends on if you pay any attention at all. 

that being said, while on the surface anthro 3ac doesn’t seem like the most interesting class at Cal, it’s the one that has been the MOST applicable to my life. like, seriously! i took it with a friend and we regularly talk about concepts we learned in that class as they apply to our everyday life (even two years later!) because it is an anthro class and the concepts will very much show up in your experiences w the world (for example, understanding family relationships, the anatomy of languages, cultural relativism). i think it’s a fantastic beginner anthro class if you’re willing to (at the very least) pay attention in lecture. i will say, if you can at least /skim/ the readings (if not attempt to read them), the lectures will make more sense and actually become... exciting?? dare i say? 

all this to say, i cannot comment on the grades/difficulty since i has a different professor but the content took me by surprise in being more relevant than any one of the other famous Berkeley classes. there’s also something really cool about reading something in class and then seeing it be applied in real life— makes you feel like your education is actually worth something!
As an incoming freshman, I just got Anthro 3AC with Karl. How is workload and readings? I know you had it in the summer. If you convert the load to semester, is it too much, medium, or on the light side? Thanks!
Were the lectures recorded? I'm wanting to take it this summer!
oh wow thank you! that was super insightful and yea i want to see what anthro is all about and it’s cool to see how applicable it is so i’ll definitely check it out !!"
