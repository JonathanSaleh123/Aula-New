EE 126 with Kannan Ramchandran,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s1lcbq/ee_126_with_kannan_ramchandran/,2022-01-11 11:31:49,"I have heard some really great things about Kannan about teaching 126 and I really wanna take the class but I have a time conflict and I know that 126 in the fall did not have recorded lectures or notes (based on what i read off of the website). Has anyone taken the class with Kannan or does anyone know if the lectures are recorded or not? Or are there notes like CS 70 or EE 16B?

&#x200B;

Thank You.","There are no notes. There is a textbook that some people read.
Oh gotcha. Is the textbook enough for the hws and the exams or are lectures important?
which textbook are you referring to?
Iâ€™d say the textbook is enough. Lectures are reinforcements. Doing problems is the best way to get better at this class
Iâ€™m referring to Walrand(followed closely by Parekh). Though I think sp22 will use B&T
Gotcha thank you!
Forgot to mention that there are notes for various topics, but not for everything."
Thanks to EE 126 TA's from a Premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uvn79m/thanks_to_ee_126_tas_from_a_premed/,2022-05-22 16:39:24,"Just finished EE 126 this past semester as a pre-med kid, and holy shit I truly just want to shout-out to all the TA's in this class. Definitely would have f'd up this class if not for all the help I received from the staff. They're literally goated ðŸ’€ Don't get me wrong, Dr. Kannan Ramchandran is a fantastic professor who explains everything very well, but the TA's can definitely run this course on their own, especially with the goated notes the TA's write. Anyways, I was so ready to bomb my GPA to take this class bc I didn't know what else to take (I've taken almost every other computational bio classes available xd) and was completely ready to screw up bc of all the horror stories I've heard about this class. However, I truly have learned so, so much from this class and it was (kinda) def worth it to risk my GPA to learn about the content of this course :')

No jokes, couldn't have gotten an A- without the staff's timely and constant replies on Piazza and the discussions/office hours :'))))))

Edit: if you're like me and you're not an EECS major and math isn't your exact specialty but still wanna take the course feel free to hmu - but fr tho I promise no matter what grade you end with you literally learn so much ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©

Thanks :D","[deleted]
