Is there any undergrad doing research with Trevor Darrell or Michael Jordan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w3rqbx/is_there_any_undergrad_doing_research_with_trevor/,2022-07-20 10:09:33,It seems most undergrads do research with Pieter Abbeel or Sergey Levine. Are there any undergrads doing research with  Trevor Darrell or Michael Jordan?,"I worked with one of Mike's students while as an undergrad at Berkeley.

Even his PhD students don't really ""work"" with him, they are all quite independent and doing their own research and Mike sort of provides general feedback about things like direction and whatnot. If you want to work with some of his students, just look them up, see what they are doing and fire them an email. Typically you'll get no response because most undergrads aren't able to meaningfully contribute to ML theory research (unlike groups like Abbeel or Levine which are far more applied) but your email should try and convince them that this is not the case for you.
Michael's probably playing basketball.
Thank you for your reply! Btw can I join ML theory groups as a PhD even though I did my research in applied field as undergrad?"
LeBron James-backed pizza place in Berkeley closes permanently,https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/lebron-james-blaze-pizza-berkeley-closure-18341031.php,2023-08-31 15:49:23,,"""near the Durant Food Court"" is a bit of a stretch
Wild way to say nationwide corporate chain
bro what the fuck the 5.00 half pizza carried me through so much of the year damn this is sad… surprised this happened bc i went there a ton and there were always quite a few ppl :/
Blaze was awesome :(
Damn who remembers the free pies on 4/20
I always thought Blaze was overrated if I’m being honest.
Cuz Bronny didn’t choose Cal. Datz what happens.
pi day made them go bankrupt💀
Can’t have shit in Berkeley :(
like literally why. we all buy the pizzas. they have customers. 😭
Michael Jeffrey Jordan would never
Why doe
Would u say yogurt park is near dfc?
They were free then?? I only remember $3.14 for a pie on pi day
k well this is the opposite end of the block, & on Bancroft
Probably, but it's at least a third closer than Blaze was

Edit: Reconsidering, I don't even think Yogurt Park is ""close."" Unless you call it in the same neighborhood, which also applies to Blaze. Probably my limit of what I consider close would literally be just that block, and maybe extending across the street to places like Abe's/Blondie's or Crossroads on the other end. But not much farther
Shit that’s what I meant"

I'd like to draw a connection to elementary/middle/high schools in my neighborhood: some of them are known to be ""good schools"" because of high test scores or whatnot. So does that mean they are better at teaching? Are the teachers better there? Or is it just that these ""good schools"" are in better parts of town and so the students who attend these schools are more privileged and have the resources to focus on their education?
> 
> I think the same thing is happening at Cal and at any other university that receives a lot of applicants: There's limited space so only the top people (however you want to define it) are admitted. When you have a bunch of top people in a school, naturally it's better. Naturally, great achievements happen at that school. Naturally, more people want to apply because they hear about the school's achievements. Naturally, more professors want to apply. Naturally, the school only lets the top professors in. Naturally, those top students graduate and as a whole make more money. Naturally, those top-notch alumni can donate more money back to the school. Naturally, the school has more money to fund its amazing students and professors. Naturally, it's a ""great school"".
> 
> Now of course, this cycle has to start somewhere. I believe that it started because this university, and so many other ""top"" universities, are old and have had time to grow. And then when other universities pop up, naturally, prospective students are skeptical of them until they're established, and so prospective students naturally apply to established universities before they consider the newly created institutions. Naturally, this more established university has a lower admittance rate than newer universities. Naturally, a lower admittance rate gives off the vibe it's a better place, and naturally the university can only admit the top applicants who achieve more, on average, than students at less selective universities. And there, we're in that cycle.
> 
> Key realization: When ""top"" universities go around the county encouraging students to apply, it's not because they need to get their name out and convince students that they are good universities. They are already well known. Everyone already knows they're Ivy league or whatever. I believe it's mainly to get more people to apply so they can boast lower admittance rates. Because, come on now, you can't tell me you haven't looked at the admittance rate of a school to see ""how good"" it is.

A student replied:

> 
> Yet Berkeley is said to be better at CS than all but two of those schools. In fact, the only reason people think these other schools are more prestigious than Berkeley is because they have lower acceptance rates. If Berkeley cut its admit rate one year, Berkeley wouldn't be a safety school to top achievers - it would be the goal. 
> 
> I think Berkeley is so highly ranked due to our accomplishments. You can't deny what this school has accomplished. We've made major advances in every field. And that overrides our high acceptance rate to make us a top school.

> By the way, I'm not saying Berkeley should cut its acceptance rate to boost its prestige. It would work, but it's contrary to our goals as a public school. I'm saying that admit rate does affect prestige - people will always be impressed more by what they can't have.

A student wrote:

> Berkeley still has low admission rates compared to all or almost all the other UCs. Not to mention that it has low admission rates compared to other schools around the country. So Cal and many of the Ivy Leagues and UCLA, Stanford, and CalTech are also said to have good CS programs -- and they all have low admission rates. It seems that almost every school that has a ""good CS program"" has a low admission rate. No? So for the most part, I'd say that schools with a ""good CS program"" admit only the top students.
> 
> Still, I'm wondering: What do Berkeley's achievements in CS have to do with the quality of the CS program? Achievements don't give any information about how well students learn CS, right? What does it mean for a program to ""good""? I know magazines and news outlets like to come out with their rankings every year--but are they really legit?

Not all rankings are meaningless, and even the most questionable ranking system probably has some truth in it. Its not logical to just dismiss these rankings because its unclear exactly how they measure a school's quality. I'm also curious why you think these notions are ""baseless"" and ""evidence-less.""

Trying to then give an ordering to the schools where there is a best school and a second best school, and so on is such an empty? futile? subjective? venture. If you look at US news's rankings today you see that princeton is in first place and harvard is in second place. Are you convinced princeton is a better school than harvard? If you go to harvard will you think that you're not getting the best <any of the qualities that make a good school, good> as you would have received at princeton?
How about if you go to the 3rd place school?...honestly, would you feel that had you gotten into a school higher on the list, then you'd have gone to a ""better"" university? Can you honestly say that your education would have been better if you had gone to a ""better"" school?

> I don't buy it. I don't see any truth in princeton being better than harvard or being better than Cal. It's just another school. And after all, we're each in only one or two or three majors.

Now of course, you wouldn't go to some random college that opened up a year ago and expect them to have their CS program be as well run as in schools that have been in the business for like 40+ years. But randomly pick any school that you hear people talk about and it will be a fine school, if you personally like it.

As long as you like the school, you can't go wrong by going to get a CS degree at, for example, UCSD instead of Stanford or CalTech or Berkeley.

Furthermore, there are even even schools that you know of that suck in some of the metrics and they are still considered a  top school. Like Cal has bad CS class sizes and yet, we're fine here because we make it work. And guess what, it's still a top school in their rankings. 
> 
> Here's another way to see it. I think it's a bit like picking a country to live in (assuming you know the language and culture of any country you choose). Is living in the US better or worse than living in Canada or the UK? Is living in France better or worse than living in Switzerland? I mean, clearly living in the US is better than living in some poor country in the middle of a war, but if someone came out with rankings about which countries are the best to live in, would you believe their rankings? I wouldn't. If they tell me italy is two places ahead of germany or that Japan is 5 places worse than Australia I wouldn't believe them because they don't know enough. They can quantify rankings based on their own preferences but they can't tell me where is the best place for me to live . They're all good enough countries! The best country for me to live in depends on my own preferences. And on top of that, it really depends where I live in said country, and how I live, and so many other factors.

> OP, I think you are trying to extract too much from these rankings. I completely agree with you that comparing schools based on single-digit ranking difference is a subjective matter, and people should perform their own research to figure out what they want from a school. However, the fact that no ranking system can these subjective opinions is not be a reason to disregard the rankings completely. They do their best to capture the differences between schools.

A student replied:

> There is some good discussion going on here, especially with regards to how much we should regard rankings. I think a high ranking (in a particular subject) is more indicative of the faculty quality. Indirectly, this attracts top students, and hence, after years of this process, sometimes some people want to go to a particular school because of who they might be surrounded by (this includes other students, not just instructors). Along the lines, this gets blurred as an outright reason to attend the school, when it probably shouldn't; because, as stated above, going to a higher ranking school does not therefore mean you are learning CS ""better"". Being in a better ""environment"" however, thats kind of subjective, and entirely is based on what someone deems ""better"".
> 
> I picked Cal EECS over schools some people may not have (a couple ivies included; not bragging just making a point). Whereas someone else might have gone to the highest possible ranked undergraduate university they were accepted to. Are my reasons better? I don't know, I don't think so. So to the OP's point about what makes a school better, I think these things are indeed subjective and it may not be possible to extract a host of useful information. Not because they are doing an inadequate job at making the rankings, rather, some people just care about different things when it comes to picking a school. The rankings may ""try"" to capture that, but as most people may agree, its still incomplete.

I suppose I take issue with the fact that yes, the rankings are opinions that could be plain wrong and yet, I think, ever since they've started coming out annually, it's been an obsessive race to get into the top universities. People take them to heart too seriously. So in a sense, the fact that people take them so seriously, makes me want to hold them up to a high standard. But, at the end of the day, they are indeed just opinions of some people working at a news outlet. They never promised to be accurate. I should chill.

> 
> 5. The schools that you hear commonly about (living in CA) aren't all ranked highest. UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara aren't regarded super highly in rankings but you hear about them a lot. I'm sure they have decent grad and retention rates. Nitpicking who has a few percent higher here or there doesn't matter. They're all great. Seriously, if your school makes it to the us news rankings, how worse can it possibly be compared to the top 30 in the rankings? Also, UT austin is 56 in the rankings and you see it as highly ranked--so yeah, whatever. the 56th position is also great. And so is 57th and 58th and so on. I really think if a school is known enough to be in the top 100 it's good. As long as enough people (students, faculty, and administrators) apply to be part of learning, teaching, and managing the school, it will be a good place b/c the school will be able to pick the best people out of those who apply. And the cycle of greatness kicks off from there.

And, we're still getting good rankings despite that. Personally, I don't care too much about teacher-student ratio because that's the average of the school and vary greatly between different classes.
