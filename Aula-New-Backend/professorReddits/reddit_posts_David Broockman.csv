Prof David Broockman,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/r5uzbl/prof_david_broockman/,2021-11-30 11:17:46,Hey. Has anyone taken Introduction to Empirical Analysis and Quantitative Methods with David Broockman? How was it? He doesn't have a Rate My Professors.,"Prof. Broockman is one of the best lecturers I've ever had at Cal. I know he's new, but he's absolutely a Godsend. He's brilliant and such a great teacher. I learned so much taking W164A with him.
Ahhhh! I love prof broockman. Taking pols3 rn and it’s not that hard. He re-designed the class to accommodate more students starting out with coding. Class is focused primarily on group work (done in lecture) and there are no tests, just 1 problem set per month. Highly recommend!!!
I’m taking it this semester and I LOVE IT! Prof. Broockman is an awesome guy and you can tell he genuinely wants people to pass the class. He and the GSI’s literally walked us thru the course
Good prof, hard class.
Thank you so much

"David E. Broockman at Stanford and Joshua Kalla at Cal published the study ""Durably reducing transphobia: A field experiment on door-to-door canvassing"". They found a lasting shift in opinion and the effect was the same whether the canvasser was straight, gay or transgender.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/science/doorstep-canvassing-can-shift-views-on-transgender-rights-study-finds.html,2016-04-08 13:15:15,,"Hopefully these results are true. Don't want the same thing happening again to a study like this...
