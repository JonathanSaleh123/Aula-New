"Which Professor would you guys pick for math 54, Vera Serganova, or Lin Lin?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vhyqh4/which_professor_would_you_guys_pick_for_math_54/,2022-06-21 23:47:02,"I'm trying to pick the better professor for this upcoming Fall, I was wondering about your guys' experience with these two professors. 

Worst comes to worst, if they are both awful, do you guys recommend just taking Honors Linear Algebra with Peng Zhou? Thanks in advance","Math 91 David Nadler, the newest linear algebra class, this is the classes just added this semester and it is an acceptable alternative to Data Science Major Requirement for Math 54, Nadler is by far the goat of mathdepartment (second to Paulin).
I'm wondering the same as well. Currently enrolled in Serganova but having second thoughts...
This class will not fulfill the CS requirement."
Stankova or Serganova for Math 54?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16r54yw/stankova_or_serganova_for_math_54/,2023-09-24 11:38:11,"Hi, so next semester I have to take Math 54, and the two professors teaching it are Zvezdelina Stankova and Vera Serganova. I'm trying to decide which one I should take. If anyone had these professors, I'd love to hear your thoughts on their classes. Thanks!","Serganova is alright. Accent aside, lectures aren‚Äôt the best but I liked the structure of her class (no hw grades, grade is based on exams/easy weekly quizzes) and I thought her quizzes and exams were extremely fair. She‚Äôs no Paulin, but I think her class is a step up from most of the recent 54 instructors (Talaska, Sheu, Wehrheim).

If that class structure sounds good to you I‚Äôd go for it!
Personally I like tons of homework and quizzes so that midterm is a walk in the park, no, not that Park.
I had Stankova for 110! She‚Äôs really thorough and is an excellent lecturer. Really felt that her teaching helped me build good conceptual understanding. Thorough means homework is long though, fwiw. Would rec.
Always Stankova she‚Äôs üêê
I had Stankova for math 1b and she‚Äôs a good lecturer and her notes are the best I‚Äôve seen here, but she gives a lot of hw too. It really prepares you for the exams though.
Thank you very much!
Thanks for your comment!
Thanks for your insight!
Okay, thanks!
I guess if it prepares you for exams then it‚Äôs worth it. Thanks for your input!"
Math 54 professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bj1g6p/math_54_professors/,2019-04-30 02:51:26,"So there is Vera Serganova, Constantin Teleman, and Katrin Wehrheim who will be teaching in the fall of 2019 and I‚Äôm not sure which one is more preferred than the others since rate my professor seems inconsistent","[Thread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bfj22p/math_54_fall_2019_prof/); [Thread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bfyfg0/math_54_with_telemanserganovawehrheim/)

In general, I highly recommend using [push-shift Reddit search](http://redditsearch.io/) to look for frequently asked questions!

Edit: fixed typo
I had Teleman; he's a very intelligent man and a fast-paced lecturer that can be hard to follow at times. However, I would always read the textbook before lecture and that helped a lot and made the class pretty enjoyable actually. When I was taking 54 I think he covered more material than the other professors, which is something I liked about his class. Pretty entertaining guy at times and an unbeatable sense of fashion. Tests were pretty fair with decent curves, so my friends and I ended up doing well in the class. I recommend him if you like lectures that are engaging and cover more content at the expense of being more of a challenge to keep up with and greater reliance on spending personal time (reading textbook/notes or office hours) to cover gaps in understanding.
lol poster of the second thread deleted it already?
I linked it because someone gave feedback about Wehrheim, but it's otherwise redundant with the first link yeah."
