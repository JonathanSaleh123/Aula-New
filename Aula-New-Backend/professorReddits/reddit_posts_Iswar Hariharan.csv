NEED ADVICE MCB MAJOR! MCELLBI C62 or MCB 132,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wd1exc/need_advice_mcb_major_mcellbi_c62_or_mcb_132/,2022-07-31 15:55:13,"Hi I am currently a rising sophomore (MCB + data minor), and I am trying to decide on a class to take in my Fall semester. I'm deciding between MCELLBI C62 - drugs and the brain with David Presti or MCB 132 - biology of human cancer with Iswar Krishna Hariharan- both from what I have heard, are amazing professors. I will be taking CHEM3B, CHEM3BL, and physics 8A at the same time. Since I didn't get into an R1B, I want to do a bio class instead.

**MCELLBI C62** \- I am really interested in this class and have always wanted to explore neuroscience and psychedelics a bit more. It is also an easy A so a GPA booster class is always a plus. However, this class does not add to my major in any way. I simply wanted to talk to prof Presti and I think I can explore this side of bio by myself.

**MCB 132** \- After taking Bio1A over the summer, I am really interested in pathogenesis and cancer research, so in terms of content, I would prefer this class. It is an MCB elective class so one less class to take in the future. I really want to learn from this professor as well but will it be too much work considering the other classes I am taking? Is it a bad idea to take an elective as a rising sophomore because at the end of the day I still want to do well in this class and hopefully get an A.

They're both offered at the same time and only in the Fall semester. I am siding towards MCB 132 right now but, again, will it be too much work?

**Edit: Ended up taking MCELLBI C62 to not stress myself out too much since I will also be joining clubs and decals.**","MCB senior here, I would advise starting with the lower div elective while you still are taking your chem and physics, just a lot of work for those classes. Set yourself up for success, you can always take 132 next Fall when you don’t have such high workload classes.

nothing wrong with taking an upper div elective as a sophomore, but also not sure what the 132 workload is like. I think if you take it, you will have a full schedule and a lot of work but it should be okay if you’ve done well in stem classes thus far
Yea, the concern is that MCELLBI C62 isn't a lower div elective (as far as I know I don't think any of the MCB electives are lower div). It's just a class I was interested in, so it doesn't actually add anything to my major- so I'm worried it's just a waste of a class which is why I started considering MCB132 which actually is an elective and will help me out in terms of fitting all my major requirements into the 4 years.
I am a rising junior and decided to take MCB 102 next semester cause I am taking physics 8B and MCB 104 so I want to spread out my classes... fingers crossed we do not get dropped
Hey so I ended up taking MCELLBI C62 instead because I didn't want to add more hard classes on top of physics 8a and chem3b/l.
if you plan well, you should have plenty of space in 4 years to take things you’re interested in. no rush for 132, do it because you really want to. In my opinion the MCB major (with no double major/minor) can be finished in 3-3.5 years without significant overloading, so you should have a semester or two of space to work in extra classes.
oh sorry, I forgot to add that I was planning on doing a data minor"
