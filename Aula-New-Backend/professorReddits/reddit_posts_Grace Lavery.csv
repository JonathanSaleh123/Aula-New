What do you think about these quotes from Berkeley professor Grace Lavery?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tet2ko/what_do_you_think_about_these_quotes_from/,2022-03-15 09:35:12,">""There's something about being treated like shit by men that feels like affirmation itself, like a cry of delight from the deepest cavern of my breast... To be the victim of honest, undisguised sexism possesses and exhilating vitality."" -Grace Lavery

>""A woman is a person who is, or has been, presumed to adopt a passive role in sexual intercourse and a reproductive role in economic life."" -Grace Lavery

These are real quotes from Berkeley Professor Grace Lavery. I find these quotes to be very troubling and very sexist, yet when I brought this up I was accused of transphobia.

I am not transphobic but I honestly don’t see how anyone could read these quotes and have 0 issue with what she’s saying. Can someone explain to me so I can convince myself these quotes aren’t sexist? I don’t understand how saying this things are okay nor do I accept that these definitions are what “women are”.

Throwaway because sensitive topic.","[deleted]
Sounds like you're in need of context for those quotes. How lucky that context has been provided in this very thread!
sounds like TERFs taking things prof Lavery says completely out of context

love to see some saucy little ellipses in there, I'm there's no way these excerpts could have been choicely selected to prove a political point /s
The first quote makes me think of this passage from MLK's Letter from Birmingham Jail (the bit up to the first ellipses).

Maybe try reading that and see if her statement makes more sense in a similar context.

The second sounds like an attempt to separate the social role of ""woman"" from the biological category of ""female,"" so I can see how pushing back on that could read as transphobia.
Username checks out
It's my take that she's expressing a very positive female side and response to sexism.
Sounds like she has a weird kink tbh
I agree that these statements are not necessarily sexist and their interpretation depend on the context in which they are said, which is not provided.

But I think OP shouldn't have specified the person who made these statements to get unbiased opinions of what people think of these statements. I think it's easeir to come to her defense given that she's a trans woman and a Berkeley professor. Maybe more people would have found these statements sexist if they didn't know that Prof Lavery said them.
He's a pornsick freak who abuses his wife, no surprise he's been uttering such autogynephilic tripe.
So it’s women’s fault that men treat trans women badly?
Finally some truth
This was so long ago I don't really even remember what it was about all that well. But that would not have been my point.
Rereading the thread, I think this person's comment does a good job explaining the quotes.
