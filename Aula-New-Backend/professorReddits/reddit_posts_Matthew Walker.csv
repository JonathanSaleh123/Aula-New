Trying to decide between two Psych courses.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mytfpm/trying_to_decide_between_two_psych_courses/,2021-04-26 02:05:47,"I'm split between these two courses, any suggestions?

1) Developmental Psychology; Professor Jan Engleman

2) Psychology of Sleep; Professor Matthew Walker

Both are going to have online lectures, sadly.","[deleted]
Psych of sleep is very easy and incredibly fascinating, everyone should take it if they can bug the class gets filled up so fast it’s hard to get a spot. Many people will tell you it changed their sleeping habits or influenced them in some way. One of my favorite classes taken at Cal so far
Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

even if I have a very early enrollment time, I don't think I can get in without being a psych or cog sci major. they have 84 seats reserved for them both, and exactly 168 seats total. do you think it's worth trying?
Hi When did you take psych 133? did you take it in person?  
I'm curious if the exams for this class are online or in person.  
I saw in fall 2024 has this class. its a in person class.
It is! Since it is online he will probably allow most people on the waitlist in! :) you can email him about it too, he takes a long time to reply but he will probably reply eventually about waitlist stuff
Waitlist yourself for the class"
"Matthew Walker, a Cal professor of neuroscience and psychology and leading sleep evangelist, is the author of the new book, Why We Sleep, about the downside of pulling an all-nighter. He's served as a sleep consultant to the NBA, NFL and Pixar Animation Studios, among other Fortune 500 enterprises.",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/10/17/whywesleep/,2017-10-18 22:32:33,,"Perhaps he should talk to the computer science professors. Many of them seem to believe in all-nighters.
Any reasonably intelligent student knows when/when not to pull all nighters.  
  
DO pull the all nighter:  
  
- HW/Paper/Project due and you're not gonna finish in time  
- You literally don't know shit about the midterm material the next day  
  
DON'T pull an all nighter:  
  
- Before an exam that you've *been* preparing for  
  
Like, if you've literally never seen the material before (We've all been there) then an all nighter is worth it. It's not worth it for reviewing though.
I would make a great sleep consultant. I slept so many places that I can teach you how to find a good spot crash any time of day. Like under porches, in bushes, bart, even the dorm laundry room. I even set up a hammock once in a handicap bathroom stall. Slept like a baby, a drunk baby."
Best psych upper div courses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jub02t/best_psych_upper_div_courses/,2020-11-14 14:49:29,"Also as context I’m interested in going into ux design/marketing but am also interested in mental wellness 

But am open to any interesting course recommendations :)","Matthew walker’s psych of sleep class
psych 131 with prof hinshaw :) really great professor and the material was really really interesting (about mental disorders)"
UGBA 10 as a freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cd9yua/ugba_10_as_a_freshman/,2019-07-14 16:38:03,"Hi! I'm an intended CS and Business major! I am pretty certain I want to take LS 25 and CS 61A, but besides that, I'm really lost. I was thinking of taking UGBA 10, but lots of people don't recommend it? Could someone explain?

Otherwise, it'd be awesome to get some advice on how to choose classes. I know EE 16A would've been great, but it clashes with LS 25 which has a really cool topic this fall! There's so many good courses out there, but they don't work because of schedule conflicts, being full, etc.

In context, here are the requirements I have to fulfill:

* Arts/Lit (fulfilled by LS 25)
* Bio (eww... )
* Philosophy and Values (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Social/Behavioral Science (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)
* International Studies (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Reading and Comp B (None of the ones that still have spots sound great and I don't like writing essays...ideas? Spring?)
* American Cultures (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)

&#x200B;

And the courses I'm considering. Thoughts on courses/teachers appreciated:

* Intro to Human Nutrition (Marc Hellerstein, Joseph L Napoli)
* Human Biological Variation (Leslea Hlusko)
* Psychology of Sleep (upper-div) (Matthew P. Walker)
* Principles of Business (Judy Hopelain, Omar Romero-hernandez, Daniel G Mulhern, John Briginshaw)
* Seminar on Social, Political, and Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine (David Malcolm Potts, Darlene D. Francis)
* Design and Activism (Greg Castillo, Achvabenzinberg Stein)

&#x200B;

But I'm conflicted because I have a lot of requirements to fulfill, and I can't do most right now, but I also don't want to take extra classes and get behind...","Just do Econ 1 or UGBA 10 so you can knock out one of the business pre reqs alongside one of the CS pre reqs. I'm guessing you passed out of Math? Olney is a great Econ Professor and the course isn't too demanding/hard but I also wouldn't take it easy and push it to the side.
UGBA 10 as a freshman is totally fine - I commented on another post about it but it’s essentially a consistently medium-load class. Exam every 3 or so weeks, different professors so different style to get used to every 3 weeks. Multiple choice exams which are fine as long as you use the past practice papers available to you. I don’t think it’s that bad but if you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

In terms of the bio breadth, you could consider MCB C61 or C62. C62 is offered in fall and is called Drugs and the Brain while C61 is in spring and is about Brain, Mind, and Behaviour. I believe both are crossovers with Psych so they’re both very interesting classes, but may be a bit heavy on the neurobiology part with diagrams and technical terms and everything that goes along with that, in case you’re not super interested in that. Lots of memorisation but not super difficult classes. I found C61 was quite interesting even though I’m not a STEM major, and Dr Presti is definitely very interested and dedicated to the topics covered. If you’d like to know more about that course, I’d be happy to discuss it in greater depth."
