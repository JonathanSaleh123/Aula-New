Mind Beyond Brain by David Presti is my personal favorite so far. Such a cool and intriguing read
I think Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is quite popular
Why we sleep by Matthew Walker
Human Compatible by Stuart Russell
Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani
Second this! Took a seminar with Presti where we read this and it was incredible!
Is this Algorithms book designed for beginners?
Sure
Found the book on Amazon. Is there a solutions manual either from the textbook authors or from the open source community?
Does https://www.overleaf.com/read/krjkstdxfccv#75768a work for you?
Thanks. Is it a solution to every problem in the book? Did you generate this set of solutions?"
