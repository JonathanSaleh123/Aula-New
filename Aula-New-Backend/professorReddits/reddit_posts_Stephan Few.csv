Looking for Interns,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ut9cho/looking_for_interns/,2022-05-19 11:06:37,"Hi all!  


I am a 29 year old startup founder of all of 2 months and I am looking for an intern! I've been seeing a few posts about not having an internship role and thought that I would throw my hat into the ring.  


This is not a bougie position like you might find at Google or Microsoft, but it will hopefully be an impactful one.    


**The company:** I am creating a low cost electric vehicle charging network that takes traditional costs from 15k per slot to 200 dollars a slot. My hope is to promote electric vehicle adoption through this technology, then use a good portion of the funds gained to promote less car centric cities, battery technology research, and other climate change focused goals.   


**Your role:** Seeing as this is a startup, ideally you would be wearing many hats, but leveraging and growing your existing skillset. This could range from helping to design and manufacture the mechanical or electrical aspect of the product if you are EE or ME focused to helping to design the companies branding, product end-of-life care policies, environmental policies, and customer interactions if you are less STEM focused. It really depends on your fit!

&#x200B;

**This role can be remote** if you would like and will be compensated.  


**About me:** I am a Latinx/Chinese graduate from UC Davis with a degree in Physics (with an Astrophysics emphasis) who has a background in marine biology and environmental outreach. For the last seven years I have worked in tech, first as a spacecraft operations specialist for Google/Terra Bella, then when acquired, I moved to Planet Labs as a Spacecraft Telemetry Electrical Engineer. During the pandemic, I worked for Zoox, which soon after starting was acquired by Amazon.

If you are interested in the above position, please send me an email at [stephan@moonfive.tech](mailto:stephan@moonfive.tech) and we'll set up a meet and greet!  


If you are already interning, but would like to keep in touch, feel free to fill out the form here (on my very rough and ready site) to keep in contact: [https://www.moonfive.tech/get-involved](https://www.moonfive.tech/get-involved)  


Cheers!

Stephan","Whats the pay boss man
I will send you an email!
Is there any specific skills that you're looking for programming wise?
I’m in LA but this sounds very interesting to me. Is that to remote or can you work with that?
It really depends on what you can contribute! Technical applicants that can help with design and implementation, I’m planning for 3-5k for two months (depending on experience levels), more if funded of course. But non technical STEM would be somewhere in the ballpark of 2-4k, with a bump of funded.

Of course, if someone wants hourly due to other commitments and they are a good fit, I could see anywhere from 20-30 an hour, again, depending on area of impact and experience.

This is all coming out of my pocket for what I’ve saved up to do this project. That being said, if the project is funded, anyone who helps will be compensated with back pay plus what that received. 

I want to be as fair as possible, so if you think I am lowballing, please let me know.
The stack that I'm using right now is  
**Backend/Database:** Python (Flask), Postgresql  
**Application:** Dart (Flutter), though it's pretty similar to Javascript, so JS experience would be good.  
**Device side software:** Python (Circuitpython/Micropython). Potentially moving to C/Cpp down the road, but not during the scaffolding phases.
Send me an email and we can chat!"
