"BAMN rape survivor Stephanie Nicole Garcia: ""The Senior Editorial Board, by condemning the militancy of our movement against rape, betrayed the struggle for women's liberation and the fight for equality. Daily Cal should not be a reactionary mouthpiece for the conservative campus administration.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2015/12/01/337715/,2015-12-01 21:27:38,,"Just skimmed it, but this caught my eye:

>The documentary “The Hunting Ground” reveals how administrations resisted at every step, covering up these crimes and thus becoming accomplices to the rapes and sexual assaults.

Isn't that the joke of a documentary that edited a bunch of Wikipedia pages to match their narrative, including a lot of *very* questionable stuff about the Jameis Winston case that was pretty much shredded apart?  I'm immediately made skeptical of the whole piece by the fact that they choose to use that clown show to further their argument.
Its articulate, and well written but confused. Martin Luther King Jr, and Fredrick Douglass  where not part of the same civil rights movements, time period, or philosophical traditions. MLK was influenced by thoreau and gandhi civil disobedience. Its hard to call Dr. King Militant. Though we was obviously for direct action. Fredrick Douglass outright (bravely), fought his way out of slavery, militantly. 

MLK fought a system of laws both on the streets and in through normal political channels  - encouraging people to vote etc. 

BAMN is fighting a series of people by making aggressively public accusations.

Its confused to equate BAMN and MLK. Their means are totally different.  Besides By any means necessary is Malcom's Comment anyway. 

Worse. BAMNS ideology results in a kind of ""radical justice"" where a rapist has no legal history and is free to rape else wear if their ""witch hunt"" doesn't result in the ""rapist"" ""moving to cuba"". Real rapists are free to rape. Innocent people have name dragged through the mud.

Also, its absurd on face to call UCB's administration conservative. 
The constant false dichotomy that BAMN and it's members propose is always disgustingly authoritarian. You can fight for a better system for survivors without blatantly slandering an alleged rapist who had all of their charges dropped by local law enforcement.
You should be skeptical because BAMN is an extremist, anti-intellectual, and violent organization. 
There's no sense is trying to reason through the actions of an extremist.
Actually never heard of them.  Just looked them up.  It stands for ""By Any Means Necessary?""  Sounds pretty hostile/extreme to me.
Modern day feminism is anti-intellectual, so that's probably where they got that attribute from.

Pushing for equality is anti-intellectual? K..........
BAMN protesters will completely shut down if you try to engage them in conversations about their viewpoints. They are terrible people. 
Safe spaces are anti-intellectual. Removing due process for rape accusations is anti-intellectual. Should I go on?"
