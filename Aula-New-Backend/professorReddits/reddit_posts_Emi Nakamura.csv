What are some easy econ electives?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cwv8u2/what_are_some_easy_econ_electives/,2019-08-28 20:13:04,I'm a transfer student and I wanted to take a light load my first semester. I'm currently enrolled in ECON 134 (Macroeconomic Policy with Emi Nakamura) but I'm debating whether or not I should switch to ECON 131 (Public Econ with Danny Yagan) or ECON 182 (Monetary Econ with Galina Hale). Any suggestions?,"Nakamura is excellent; I wouldn’t switch.
Do you have any advice for the class? Is the grading tough? Is she approachable?
I would look at BerkeleyTime for grading. And yes, she’s approachable."
