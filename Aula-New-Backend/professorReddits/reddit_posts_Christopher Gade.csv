Psych W1 with Christopher Gade,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pvq57s/psych_w1_with_christopher_gade/,2021-09-26 01:55:11,Has anyone taken psych w1 with Christopher Gade? What do you think about the class? Howâ€™s the class graded? Howâ€™s the workload?,"took it last semester was pretty good. the big things for him were the essays and tests. three tests and  three essays optional final but if u do better on the final he drops the lowest of the three previous tests.
The W1 is a fully web-based course and his lectures were incredibly boring for me. I felt like it was a waste of effort as there were better options available. I really think it depends on whether you can sit through obsolete 2hr lecture videos where the guy just reads off a script and clicks through slides. The material was very dense too, since Psych 1 is intended as a weeder class. I dropped it after 2 weeks so I think it depends on people's preferences and how much they can handle before they lose their sanity.
I took it last semester. there weren't any essays but we had 3 multiple choice midterms and a final exam. (PSYCH 1 has essays, not W1) we also had weekly assignments which were these multiple choice quizzes through this online textbook module/website (pretty much unlimited attempts)

I didn't end up watching any of the lectures since I didn't feel like I got anything out of them. I just used the lecture slides to study for the exams and did fine (got an A)

I think its a pretty low workload class overall, but don't expect to learn much from it
For w1, can we drop one of the lowest midterm exam grade as same as the PSYCH 1?"
What Classes to Take?? Can't Decide for Summer 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dj4utj/what_classes_to_take_cant_decide_for_summer_2024/,2024-06-18 16:33:07,"Hey guys, I'm taking three classes in the summer (not sure if that is a lot, but it is 11 units) and this is my first time doing classes in the summer. I just finished freshman year and in terms of workload, my first class is relatively alright (Stats 2) with Lucas so far and I'm planning on taking Music 26AC with Carla Brunet and Psych 1 with Christopher Gade. I heard Gade is good for Psych 1 (I think?) and I'm only taking Music 26AC since I heard it is a good GPA booster. In general, I need some advice- should I take Music 26AC or Psych 1? I'm on the pre-med track just for clarification but if not, take both? ","i canâ€™t speak for stats or music, but psych 1 w gade is very easy!
Thank you! How would you say Psych 1 w gade is easy? Is he a good grader and is it doable in the summer? I wanted to finish it now then later, so I was wondering.
as itâ€™s relatively low work load and very doable to do well! i only rmr the midterms as assignments and the final could replace a mt, or you can just not take it if you were doing well. they grade very easily, tbh i forgot i was even in taking the class most times
ahh ok thanks!"

Psych 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w2cvvr/psych_1/,2022-07-18 15:59:44,"Iâ€™m enrolled in Psych 1 with Christopher Gade- does anyone have any experience with this class? Iâ€™m taking it as a breadth RC and because I think Iâ€™d enjoy the subject, but want to make sure it wonâ€™t be too heavy in the workload/distract from my required courses.

Any other breadth recommendations for those interested in Med/anything health related that isnâ€™t a bio or physical science breadth (Iâ€™m in CNR)","Itâ€™s light. Just stay on pace so you donâ€™t have to put in 5-6 hours before every exam. Also, do your best to get good scores on the first three exams, so you can drop the fourth exam (which happens to be the final).

The first three exams cover content from each third of the course whereas the scope for the final is everything, which means you might have to restudy things and it just becomes a timesuck. There is one exam drop.
i recommend reading some of the reviews on RateMyProfessor if no one else comments. [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=847170](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=847170)
As a fellow psych 1 taker, I appreciated this info ðŸ˜„"
