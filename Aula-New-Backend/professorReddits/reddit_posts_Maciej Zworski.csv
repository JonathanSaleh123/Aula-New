Maciej Zworski or James Sethian for math 53?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13s1fhi/maciej_zworski_or_james_sethian_for_math_53/,2023-05-25 20:01:04,,"Sethian
Avoid Zworksi like the plague 

But imo this is a shit situation to be in cause there’s no “clear winner”, both are loaded with demerits and have little to no merits
Sethian, best professor I’ve had at Cal
Zworski is hilarious, lovely, and probably one of my favorite people at Cal.  But Sethian will almost definitely be a clearer lecturer.
Not Sethian"
Physics 5A and Math 53 pairing opinions appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14qvxg8/physics_5a_and_math_53_pairing_opinions/,2023-07-04 17:49:32,"Hello everyone! Incoming freshman and an intended physics or astrophysics major here. I will be taking PHYSICS 5A this fall and I will be pairing it with MATH 53 (both Tu + Thu). There is only one option for Physics 5A, which is from 9:30 to 10:59 AM. 

The problem is whether I go with 

1.) Prof James Sethian at times 8:00 to 9:29 AM 

2.) Prof Maciej Zworski at 2:00 to 3:29 PM. 

What are your opinions on the teachers? Should I take back-to-back classes or avoid doing so? Thanks in advance!","Sethian is an amazing lecturer who I say is the best prof I’ve had. However, I will say that his rendition of 53 involves a lot of work. I think at the start of the semester it averaged somewhere around 75 problems per week which may be a lot to do on top of 5A. I don’t necessarily think there’s a problem with taking back to back classes tho; last semester on Tuesdays I had classes nonstop from 9:30 to 3:30 and I still did fine.
I see, thank you for your reply! I will definitely take that into consideration when picking my classes."
IEOR + Haas/DS incoming freshman fall class,https://i.redd.it/so7s7pvs983b1.jpg,2023-05-31 08:36:41,Is this courseload managable? if not which one should i cut? thankss,"IMO physics isn't a class you should prioritize, since it's not needed for most IEOR breadth classes and it may hit your GPA hard. To give you an idea i didnt do my physics till junior year lol.

I'd prioritize D8/61A instead (if you wanted another class), otherwise you may just wanna drop 7A and not add anything else since your first sem is gonna be a transition and your other classes aren't easy either IMO.
Don't do Physics yet
You’ll be busy the whole semester but it’s doable
I’d drop physics
No, take into account office hours and the time you need to study + internships and extracurriculars

Unless you’re a physics whiz, physics will actually take you a lot more time than is actually listed on your schedule to get you to score high enough around the averages"
Any suggestions on which course schedule to choose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14bqu3k/any_suggestions_on_which_course_schedule_to_choose/,2023-06-17 06:13:04,"Hi guys, I'm an incoming freshman, and I'm interested in majoring physics (and trying to do some research at cal). I've made these two different shedules, which one should I choose?

Why would you do physics 5a and 5b together? Isn’t 5a a prereq to 5b?
Second schedule looks very reasonable"
