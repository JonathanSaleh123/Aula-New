Warning - Craigslist Con Artist still at large,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35n3a6/warning_craigslist_con_artist_still_at_large/,2015-05-11 14:23:04,"There is a con artist operating out of Byron, GA targeting students in the Berkeley area.

They have multiple posts for multiple apartments claiming to be offering a 1br/1ba apartment for under $800/month, but that they have moved away from Berkeley and want someone to take over the apartment.

On further communication, they send stock photos that they claim are of the apartment, and ask for up-front cash payment to be sent to Georgia before they overnight you the keys.

It looks like this scam artist has been operating for years now, according to this article - http://calibermag.org/articles/warning-craigslist-con-artist/ - using the same stock photos.

I've contacted the Byron police and am hoping that providing my email correspondences with the scammer will help bring him to justice, but if anybody else has been targeted by this scammer, please PM me about your experiences - the more evidence we can gather, the better.

Be careful - never rent without setting foot in the apartment, and never send money without a contract! Be wary of scammers.

Also, if anyone has a single bedroom available for under $850/month, PM me ASAP; I need a place to live next year.","[deleted]
A bunch of generic names...then Pato Karrot. Brilliant

If you've sent them money in the mail, you should contact the local FBI office.  Mail fraud is a federal offense.
Byron is otherwise known as a really shitty little interstate highway stop-over with a third-rate outlet mall and [this big peach](http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/ga/GABYRpeach_7941.jpg), which isn't even close to being [the biggest or coolest giant peach in Georgia](https://allensroadtoboston.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/gaffney_peach_water_tower-1.jpg). 
How someone could fall for this is beyond me. Yes, we should be able to trust each other's words, but really? You fell for that? 
I've unfortunately been scammed as well. What a sinking feeling. New name: Marcus Delvalle. You still send money to Melinda Burrows though.

>Hi,

>Hope this email find you well, thanks for your interest in my apartment The apartment will be available for as long as you are willing to rent. My fiancee and I currently relocated back to Georgia because of my new job that's why the apartment is vacant. Moreover, are you very clean, kind and easygoing? Because my fiancee and I spent a lot on our property, so we want someone who is meticulous to take care of the apartment. I'm looking to rent this unit out, long and short term is allowed.
  
>The apartment is located at 4607 Connecticut Ave NW Washington, DC 20008, Apt 815. The rent is $1,050/month and the damage deposit is $600. The unit is available for immediate move in.

>I want you to drive by to the building today to view the exterior of the building. I'm not available to meet with you for viewing as I'm out of state. Get back to me when you check out the exterior so that I can forward you the full interior pictures and application form then we can proceed to how the keys will be delivered to you.

If you are dumb enough to fall for that you probably deserve to lose the money and learn a valuable lesson. 

Oh, hey, that sounds great, let me just... WAAAAAIIIITTT A SECOND, this sounds familiar...
*Ha* That'll throw them off their tracks!
That's the one! Word for word. Where was this listing for, and how much did he try to wring out of you?

Actually, it might be best to take this to PM.

He was Guadalupe when he messaged me hehe
Is Attempted Mail Fraud a thing? I haven't actually sent him anything, but I'd like to sting him for whatever I can.
Maybe it's the biggest peach that serves no practical purpose.  The second peach is a water tower, is it not?  Also, fuck Daniel-Mark-Craig-Gibbs-Scott-Tim-Joseph-Pato-Ashley-John-Steven.  Like this rental market isn't hard enough without Georgia McAsslick clogging up the Internet with his peach scented lies.
""What exactly happened? A 17-year-old girl ran off the road texting her boyfriend, and I quote, ""doesn't the Peachoid look like a giant"" - And then she lost control of the car.""

President Frank Underwood once stood by that peach
What on earth made you think I fell for it? I very clearly said that I knew it was a scam and that none of the information they provided was legitimate.
Seriously, wtf? Perhaps spoiled, naive (international?) students whose parents don't speak English well enough to help? Bizarre. 
Prime minister aint doing shit
I ran across the same person a couple months ago when I was looking for a place. It was for a 1 bdr a block or two from the north gate for around $800/mo.

There was another guy running a similar scam for a 2bdr in the outer sunset I ran across at the same time. The guy was trying to get $2k. 
There is one of these (or more) in SC, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and I think one in N. Florida.  Maybe still in south Georgia, making one more of them.  Can't remember.  I was just lazy and got the wrong picture because, really, fuck you.

(not a peach anymore -- they painted it white iirc)
...I'm not sure if you think your suggestion is unrealistic or not? That's the prime target for scams like these: international students who aren't used to the American rental market, whose parents take care of the finances. "
