"Who are some of your favorite professors at Berkeley, and what did you love about them and their classes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10s68l0/who_are_some_of_your_favorite_professors_at/,2023-02-02 16:44:15,"Thought it'd be nice to have some positivity around here (no negative vibes allowed)! I'll start: 

**[Meredith Fowlie](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/meredith-fowlie)** leads some of the best lectures I've ever attended. She's fantastic at explaining complicated concepts, she's extraordinarily engaging, and she's really open to students asking questions and asking for help. She's also absolutely brilliant, has published some of my favorite papers about environmental economics, and her office hours are incredibly informative and helpful. 

**[Daniel Kammen](https://erg.berkeley.edu/people/kammen-daniel-m/)** is possibly the most knowledgeable person in the energy sector with whom I've ever shared a lecture hall. His Energy and Society course may be my favorite class that I've ever taken, and I still use some of his toolkits as reference points. He's also incredibly humble and approachable, especially considering his insanely impressive career trajectory, and somehow managed to find time after class to talk to anyone who wanted to chat about energy. 

**[Abigail Martin](https://www.abigailnmartin.com/)** has had an incalculable impact on the way I view environmental problems and energy transitions. She's one of the first professors I've ever learned from who approaches environmental economics with such a heavy emphasis on sociological consequences rather than traditional economic impacts, which is super refreshing. Her lectures are super compact, and she manages to pack a ton of information into a short amount of time without being monotonous or boring. I admittedly am only a few weeks into her class, but she's an absolute badass and I love learning from her. 

Who are some of your favorite professors, and what did you love about them and their classes?","Paulin. Best lower-div math professor by far
Seth Lunine in Geography department. He teaches a couple AC courses called Bay Area as well as another class called California. My favorite class he teaches is a Friday class called Urban Field Study where you spend the day exploring various locations throughout the Bay Area such as numerous trips to Oakland and San Francsico. Highly recommend as a final semester course to anyone looking to fill in some final units.
Philip Geissler, quite possibly the best chemistry professor.

Edwin Lin the GOAT üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
Wodzicki. Never met a professor who cares as much about students‚Äô development as him. What other professor would be willing to spend 6 hours after class talking to the class‚Äîmath, life advice, stories, etc.

He approaches teaching as mentorship rather than covering textbooks. Don‚Äôt understand why people say to avoid him. His class has been the best class I‚Äôve taken at Cal and it‚Äôs not even remotely close‚Äîit‚Äôs the only class where you‚Äôll find things not found in a textbook.

edit: more information to clear up the ridiculous amount of misconceptions surrounding his teaching, he *requests* non-graduate courses for the opportunity to mentor budding mathematicians. Additionally, he constantly reinforces the fact that no one aside for prodigies (and maybe not even them) learn the content in lectures alone. He constantly talks about how he struggled with abstraction as well, about how he would get lost in lectures. This puts to rest the unhealthy misconceptions and misgivings that people have in mathematics about ‚Äúmathematical talent‚Äù since he was reading university texts in middle school and so might be called a ‚Äúprodigy.‚Äù His philosophy is that lectures are for supplementing‚Äîteaching to think, providing intuition, and encouraging students (so he handled what content is covered in a very organic manner). The current lecture model where you go through chapters is a remains of the days where books were so expensive that students could not afford them. He‚Äôs trying to prepare you to think *deeply and originally* about mathematics, not to learn certain concepts in a black box.

&#x200B;

The man gives everything he has to *teaching* and he expects the same in return.  That is precisely the reason why he gets negative reviews. In this world of polite distance, it may make people uncomfortable. For others, the class alone is worth the cost of admission into Cal.
Not a professor, but Ryan Hass is probably the best math teacher I've had at Berkeley.
Austin Hedemann is one of the best parts of the physics dept here
\+ 1 on Fowlie. Incredible professor and so caring. [Richard Allen](https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/richard-allen) in EPS is also wonderful; great course, and he is an awesome lecturer.
Josh Hug and Zvezda Stankova. One taught me patience, one taught me pain..
Prof Ryan Edwards for Economics!!
Shusterman explains concepts well and is really easy to ask for help. She genuinely cares about her students!
1. [Mathew DeJong](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/dejong). Very nice man. Very good at explaining stuff. Encourages discussion in class. Runs a very nice class with a smooth organization. 

2. [Evan Variano](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/variano). Literally the nicest, most compassionate prof I‚Äôve ever had. He brought jelly beans and his dog to class often. Very nice and funny and prepares you well for the FE exam. 

3. [Adda Athanasopoulos-Zekkos](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/adda_zekkos). Super nice. Loves how she hand graded the homework‚Äôs and handed them back. Really nice to see a prof super passionate about the class. 

4. [Tracy Becker](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/tcbecker). Honestly Becker may be my favorite prof at uc Berkeley. Nicest woman ever. Great at explaining stuff. Amazing at literally everything. I loved her class
Ula Taylor. so knowledgeable and passionate about AA studies. AA 116 is one of the best classes i‚Äôve taken throughout college
from a bio student perspective.

Mary Kelsey from Sociology is always the best on my list.

also John Kuriyan (mcb) and Leslea Hlusko (ib) but both are not at cal anymore
JIM CAMBEL. ECONOMICS
Y'all, if you could say something nice to your favorite professors the next time you see them, I bet they'd love to hear it. I work at Berkeley and passed along just a handful of the compliments here with a note that they've made a positive impact.   
Some of the responses from your favorite professors:   
""Wow and thanks. I feel like this person must be talking about someone else. Way too kind. It is incredibly nice to hear this.""   
""Thank you so much! That made my day!""   
""Thank you for sharing this. Indeed, I'm grateful for the affirmation - one never knows if lectures are landing well this early in the semester. So nice to hear.""   
""Why, thank you! It's a great feeling to be noticed for doing good work.""   
""Thank you for sending that to me. I have been fortunate to have many wonderful students.""  


Thank you all for contributing to this positive thread!
Trevor Murphy in the AGRS department. I took his class on Greco-Roman magic and it was clear that he was having just as much fun teaching about magic as we were to learn about it. He teaches in a very classic lecture style.
Ani Adhikari! I had the great fortune of taking Data 8 and Stat 134 with her, and she's just one of the best lecturers in the Stats dept. - let alone in the university.
Darren Zook. Politics of South East Asia. Super nice guy very funny and charismatic. Super interesting class and relatively easy as well.
It‚Äôs still early in the semester, but professor Jim Campbell is amazing! I love going to his lectures. He makes the material very approachable. Last semester I really liked Jeremy Sanchez, and Harvey Dong is legend!
John DeNero is the best. Julien Lafortune was pretty great too, as was Ryan S Lundell-Creagh. Oh James Campbell was great too.
James Sethian is by far the best professor I had. I feel like I learned more in that one semester of Math 53 than I did in all my previous math classes combined. Plus, his lectures were incredibly interesting and fun, most of the time I forgot it was an 8 am because I wasn‚Äôt falling asleep.
[Jay Keasling](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/keasling) (ChemE/CBE); I was actually in his first class as a prof in 1993 and I thought he was terrible. Turns out, that was probably me and not him.  I ended up having him for ChemE/CBE 162 Control Systems. I never really had a prof explain and teach a complicated subject so well. 

It's now been 30 years later, and even though I mainly work in software, the control theory I learned seems to pop up all the time. For comparison, I also took the general engineering grad level version at Stanford, and the instruction competency was night and day.

And a shout out to [prof Clark's](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/clark) kinetics class (cbe142)
Can‚Äôt spell Hawkins without a W
Dr. Christine Palmer American Studies department absolutely brilliant
Professor Fish in Poli Sci, along with Gurowitz. Great, knowledgeable, and approachable.
Rosenzweig. He teaches ugba 192 edible education they were very inspiring and knowledgeable, always invited very interesting and influential guest speakers every week. 

Huntsinger. She teaches espm 186 Grassland Ecology. Shes super nice, very accommodating and presents very valuable information, definitely an expert in her field and the class was very well organized and informative.

So many others, Brashares, Carlson, Chapela, Stephens, Lightfoot
Since this is a sub for the city of Berkeley as well, I‚Äôm gonna add Linda MacAllister at Berkeley City College!! She‚Äôs been teaching sociology for over 20 years and her academic focus is on death! Cal tried to hire her multiple times but MacAllister rejected them bc she‚Äôs for the people. Genuinely, an incredible teacher and academic that I feel so lucky to take classes with. I‚Äôm dual enrolled just to keep taking classes from MacAllister bc there is a true love for sociology without all the bullshit of bureaucracy and elitism around it!!
Robin ball! She was the nicest and made a relatively intro class exciting for everyone that was involved. Loved her passion
Edwin Lin and John Kaiser from sociology
Christopher Lowman, Josh Hug, Kurt Spreyer
Prof Whitney was a great CogSci professor. And he‚Äôs also an excellent department head. 

Prof Filippenko teaches one of the most interesting classes in the most engaging way. He seems like a super cool person too.

Prof Hinshaw is excellent and an absolute legend. It feels like an honor learning from him.

Prof Steven Piantadosi seems like a really nice guy and his future is bright in research. 

Prof Mikiko Siva is super super nice. One of the easiest classes I took at Cal, but it was fun.

Also RIP Prof Andrew Packard üòî
Karthik Shekhar was an amazing professor in the Chemical Engineering department
JOSH HUG!!
Dylan Sailor from the classics department is probably the best professor I had as an MCB/Data major. He handled the transition to remote classroom gracefully right when the pandemic started. I had him for Classics 34 and he was so good that I took him again for Classics 35. Great storyteller and really draws you into the Greek epics/tragedy. I think he has been teaching ancient Greek language or something recently, but if he‚Äôs ever teaching poetry I would HIGHLY recommend ‚Äî a STEM student who greatly underestimated the possibility of being interested in poetry.
Kent Puckett in the English Dept. Amazing lectures, kind and gracious with student interactions, creates interesting assignments with no busywork, plus he is funny. My favorite class at Cal.
Matthew Walker for psychology of sleep. Super nice dude, incredibly interesting and useful subject presented in an extremely easy to digest manner. Fucking loved every minute of that class.
My guy paul pierson in poli sci. Guy absolutely understands how the country works and can explain it like im 5.
Carol Clover, my undergrad film thesis advisor and easily one of the most intelligent people I‚Äôve ever had the privilege to take classes and learn from.
Timothy Clarke in the philosophy department!
Dr Khalilah Beal Uribe is the best math professor that I‚Äôve ever met! She always make sure that students are engaged in the class and her test is fair. A great teacher whose aim is making students understand math but not making students failing in math.
Hilfinger
Max Auffhamer (environmental econ) - overall such a cool dude, and a great prof
Vivek Subramanian - I took 3 semiconductor device physics courses from him. He was my favorite lecturer. He moved to Switzerland a few years ago.

Also loved Dan Garcia. I almost failed 61C but I learned so much I never cared what grade I got.
STEVEN LEE: English BETH Piotote: comparative Lit
Hilfinger
Laleh Behbehanian. Everything a professor should be. Cared so deeply about her students, the material, and the future of her class.
Anant Sahai, best 70 prof
[removed]
Nikhil srivastava is amazing
Paulin the goat
Professor Ranade!
Professor Lihua Zhang for Chinese! Amazing professor and so, so passionate about what she's doing ‚Äî her love of teaching and languages is contagious!
Pauli Li! His enthusiasm and passion!! Switched to Cogsci after taking his class. Sadly, he doesn‚Äôt teach anymore. :(
Prof Alex Filipenko!!!!! 

One of the most passionate and engaging professors at Cal. Seriously, you will not regret attending one of his lectures of Astro C10. 

Words cannot express his incredible ability to teach. Made me feel like I could actually DO astrophysics, and do it well. My major is the farthest thing from it (environmental studies). :)

&#x200B;

Tip: Go to Wheeler on halloween. He dresses up as a ""black hole"" and ""emits gamma ray bursts"" (AKA throw candy at the audience). Not to miss!!
Also, Dr. Crystal Chang is a literal icon and we stan. She rocks and I LOVE the way she engages the class in her lectures. Truly and intelligent and excellent professor, extremely approachable and makes time for her students. Loves walking and talking with students after class about lecture content (shout out poltical economy 101 !!)
smh srivastava erasure
SRIVASTAVA??? HE GOATED AS WELL
I took California my first semester at cal years ago and it was one of my favorite classes I ever took. Seth is amazing.
I took his Urban Experience class a couple years back. Great professor and a super cool guy in general!!
Rest in peace for real.
i still have videos of him singing is chemistry songs with his guitar in my camera roll. truly the best professor i‚Äôve ever had.
YES I scrolled down to comment about him but it‚Äôs so cool to see someone already did. I loved his class.
YESSSSSS delay was amazing in Fall 2020, he hand made all the lectures and was sooo good at explaining them
He truly is!
Taking him for the first time now and he‚Äôs great!
Could u recommend a class taught by Wodzicki? For context, I‚Äôm taking math 110 and math 113 atm
100% agree! His grading is a little stricter than others but he is also easily one of the best lecturers I've ever had
He is the best! Always so passionate in teaching. I remember he held extra office hours in a cafe in downtown Berkeley before exams. What a dedicated prof!

Edit: this was pre-pandemic
Taking 61B with hug right now but let me say.. i took stankova‚Äôs math 10A and i‚Äôve never had an experience quite like that one. definitely one of the ways to inaugurate yourself into berkeley lol
Honestly I really liked taking 53 with Stankova.
I‚Äôm with both right now and this is accurate. Soooooo very accurate. Especially for the latter.
I love her!
THE. BEST
So awesome that you did this!! The professors are excellent :,)
love Prof Campbell, he changed my mind about microecon with his 100a class!
DeNero is great. Was super glad I got to take his Data100 course
Aaaaaaaaaanouncements
I agree, and I took his classes over 25 years ago.  I still remember him climbing the chalkboards to connect concepts on different boards.  His classes were so engaging and entertaining.
Fish is a HOT take. He‚Äôs super smart but I couldn‚Äôt stand his lectures or his personality. Agree on Gurowitz though, I took three classes with her and learned a ton
I saw her at the picket line during the strike multiple times. Based and a great lecturer.
i love both of these profs <3
seconded!!!
I have absolutely no idea who you are or what you're talking about.
why would this be about you
Your username should be MainCharacterSyndrome65433
>smh srivastava erasure

i cant accept any other answer but srivastava![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage)
Same, he‚Äôs a legend and why I went from a MCB to a chem major. I miss him dearly (ALtho I didn‚Äôt have much personal interaction with him)
[deleted]
His classes are some of the best classes I‚Äôve ever taken, and then you find out he designs most of the coursework for physics LDs too behind the scenes ‚Äî and most of the trouble with those was the professors anyway.
I took Russian Poli Sci and it was great. Since he did his Phd in Russia, super interesting!

Ok, thank you!

Energy and Society (ENERES C100/ PubPol C184) question,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15lzc4j/energy_and_society_eneres_c100_pubpol_c184/,2023-08-08 17:19:15,"I'm a fourth year American Studies major enrolled in Daniel Kammen's energy and society course in the fall to fulfill my physical science breadth.

Same goes for more technical science.",I took it last fall -- it was pretty bumpy at times ngl but if you stay up-to-date with the work and go to labs you'll be able to make it work

What is an ""energy professor""?
Kammen is very brave. Kudos to him for refusing to be part of an anti-science farce of an administration. More intellectual leaders who were swept up into Drumpf's administration need to make this same stand to show that orange cheeto monster what intellectuals think of him.
Maybe he needs a 'safe space'. He obviously can't debate.

He teaches in the Energy and Resources Group:

You think saying 'Drumpf' makes you intelligent?
Yeah, idk. Trump's first statement against the events did seem a bit weak to me, but people are always just hungry for blood the moment Trump says (or tweets) ANYTHING.
His CV is insane.
That account is a regular troll on this sub.
It's the second statement he made the day after that people are mad about.

What's wrong with that comment? 

In Britain you had Corbyn criticize the violence from ""both sides"" in Venezuela, and he wasn't really criticized at all for that statement. Is it because it's Trump?
TBH I TL;DR'd it before I could discern the actual papers he published when he was starting out."
