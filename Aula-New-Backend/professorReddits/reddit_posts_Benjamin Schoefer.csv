ECON 101B with Benjamin Schoefer,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ev1v9k/econ_101b_with_benjamin_schoefer/,2020-01-27 22:36:27,"Does anyone have any insight on how to do well for his class? Are his exams fair? 
Rate my professor didn’t have anything on him","Can’t say much but 101B last semester was pretty horrible. Terribly structured in terms of workload. Discussion and lecture were optional and barely related to problem sets which were often times basic algebra/calculus. Final and midterm were pretty hard too
Were the mid terms based around the problem sets?
OP, take this with a grain of salt, as Schoefer didn't teach 101B last semester! 

I'm also in 101B and the first lecture was long as fuck and his accent is challenging to understand....oh well
Loosely"
Fall Schedule,https://i.redd.it/3f47pmbtnecb1.jpg,2023-07-16 15:43:06,This is my schedule for the fall trying to declare Econ and trying to double in CS. I’m aware that it’s going to be intensive but it’s really my only option.  Wondering if anyone had any tips tackle all these classes at once. Thanks.,"Upside down staircase again but the other way instead. It’s not that bad tbh. Didn’t they say that you could only major in one high demand major or no?
Wouldn’t recommend 101B if you’re taking 1B at the same time. It just feels like you won’t be ready mathematically
Ok I hope it’s not too too bad. That’s only for freshman. L&S advising said I’d be able to which is cool.
The thing is I kinda have to if I wanna declare Econ because the 100 series is full. I think I’ll be alr since I took up to multi in hs and I’m gonna try to refresh before the sem.
Oh you’re a current student? If so then you’re fine.
I’m a one year transfer.
You need to declare cs by summer then shouldn’t be too bad if you have experience
Yeah I think it’ll be alr. I have minimal experience but I’ve been prepping this summer. Need a 2.7 this fall for Econ prereqs and 3.3 for CS prereqs by summer."
