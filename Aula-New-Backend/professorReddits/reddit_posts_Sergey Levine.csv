CS 182 with Sergey Levine,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kuvzgv/cs_182_with_sergey_levine/,2021-01-10 21:18:37,"Any reviews for Sergey is appreciated

Taking it upcoming semester

Any midterms / finals?

If there's a syllabus and you can copy paste / link it, I would appreciate it

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!","I don’t think he’s taught it before but it ideally would be a similar trajectory of Cannys
I believe 2 midterms, one final project and a few assignments. This is Levine's first time teaching this class though

What is the best way to prepare for the class?"
Is there any undergrad doing research with Trevor Darrell or Michael Jordan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w3rqbx/is_there_any_undergrad_doing_research_with_trevor/,2022-07-20 10:09:33,It seems most undergrads do research with Pieter Abbeel or Sergey Levine. Are there any undergrads doing research with  Trevor Darrell or Michael Jordan?,"I worked with one of Mike's students while as an undergrad at Berkeley.

Even his PhD students don't really ""work"" with him, they are all quite independent and doing their own research and Mike sort of provides general feedback about things like direction and whatnot. If you want to work with some of his students, just look them up, see what they are doing and fire them an email. Typically you'll get no response because most undergrads aren't able to meaningfully contribute to ML theory research (unlike groups like Abbeel or Levine which are far more applied) but your email should try and convince them that this is not the case for you.
Michael's probably playing basketball.
Thank you for your reply! Btw can I join ML theory groups as a PhD even though I did my research in applied field as undergrad?"
