Math 104 Fall 23 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12tfzom/math_104_fall_23_professors/,2023-04-20 14:36:40,"There are currently three professors for 104 this fall. K Beal-Uride, Eric Chen, and Ryan Hass.

How do they compare? I saw on berkeleytime that Beal-Uride and Eric Chen gave better grades, although they only taught for one semester.","[deleted]
Hass 100000% man that man is a gem of math department
From what I have heard, they are all great, seems to be a lucky semester to take 104!
Thanks for the info. How's grading with Hass, tho? On berkeleytime he is below average grade of 104.
thanks but isn't he a tough grader?
lucky! thx

Math 104 Prof?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12wjein/math_104_prof/,2023-04-23 10:37:45,"Has anybody taken 104 with Professor Beal-Uribe or Professor Eric Chen? I couldn’t find much information for these professors.

If anyone has taken or is taking 104 with any of two professors, how do u feel about the class? I’m also curious textbook they are using and the grading scheme they have (if provided).

Thanks for your help!","I took 104 with Chen last semester, his lectures are recorded, and he sticks to the textbook pretty firmly. His exams are also pretty similar to the practice problems and he curves fairly generously.
I’ve heard very good things about chen
Thanks so much for the reply! Do you remember which textbook did he use, rudin or ross?

Thanks so much for the reply :)
Yes he is a great teacher and a very nice person
*Elementary Analysis* by Ross.
No, only one midterm and a final. Traditionally, Berkeley has 2 midterms for math classes so keep that in mind.
Thank u!!!"
