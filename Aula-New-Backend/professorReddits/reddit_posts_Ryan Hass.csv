Ryan Hass vs Theodore Zhu for Math 104- Summer 21,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nz4e4v/ryan_hass_vs_theodore_zhu_for_math_104_summer_21/,2021-06-13 12:52:25,"Can anyone give some perspective on who I should go for out of these 2 for Math 104 this Summer? In particular, if someone could give any insight into their respective workloads especially during the summer? It seems like Zhu is a GSI who has taught this course previously during the summer as well (so no info on Berkeleytime). I’m considering taking it P/NP so maybe that context could also help. Thanks!",Teddy Zhu is really good; he was my GSI for 104. Not sure about Haas but I don’t think you can go wrong with Zhu.
Math 104 CE,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cnkhfl/math_104_ce/,2024-05-08 17:50:16,"Hello, I am currently a CCC student, and I want to be able to take Math 104 or 110 in the fall with UCB Concurrent Enrollment. I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this program and could tell me a bit more about it, such as when is the registration date, how hard it is to get a class, good professors, and the difference between CC math and upper div math. Thanks in advance

Math 104 Fall 23 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12tfzom/math_104_fall_23_professors/,2023-04-20 14:36:40,"There are currently three professors for 104 this fall. K Beal-Uride, Eric Chen, and Ryan Hass.

How do they compare? I saw on berkeleytime that Beal-Uride and Eric Chen gave better grades, although they only taught for one semester.","[deleted]
Hass 100000% man that man is a gem of math department
From what I have heard, they are all great, seems to be a lucky semester to take 104!
Thanks for the info. How's grading with Hass, tho? On berkeleytime he is below average grade of 104.
thanks but isn't he a tough grader?
lucky! thx

I mean you'll never forget what u learned with him tho
Mind sharing what textbook u used? I prob need some preview

Best instructor for math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y9htuz/best_instructor_for_math_104/,2022-10-20 19:54:50,"Out of Krutika Tawri, Ryan Hass, Khalilah Beal-Uribe, Mengxuan Yang, Zhuhai Ding, Olga Holtz. Appreciate any comments on teaching styles and fairness of the exams. 
I heard a lot of good things about Hass. Very outstanding. Don't if I should choose him since other smart math majors would def choose him and the class is curved.","Hass is an all around great choice. As you seem familiar, I won't elaborate apart from noting that his 104 is on the easier side. What I can say is this: absolutely do *not* take Beal. Awful and apathetic.

Holtz is the only other option who is a regular faculty member. She's known to be quite tough, but definitely thorough and reasonable. If you want to take a deep dive into analysis, she's the best option.

All the rest are postdocs/visiting scholars who are brand new.
I have Krutika Tawri for 185 rn. The lectures are easy to understand and the pace is decent. Hws are long in terms of number of problems, but the difficulty is not hard. The midterm was also not too difficult. I would recommend taking 104 with them. Dunno about the others…
Bro hass all the wayyyy. Idk abt his being on the easier side cuz his exams are def challenging, but i can understand that his lectures and explaining concepts make understanding 104 possible. Honestly, just take Hass.
Hi! Haas's class already filled up for non-math majors :/. If I'm looking for a easier grade (because my GPA matters quite a bit to me), which one of the other professors would you recommend?
[deleted]
But she also j reads off the book? And sometimes she j skips proofs of important theorems. I do agree with the rest of ur comment tho. IMO she might be good at lecturing but she's not good at teaching.
Yang, Ding, and Tawri are all new postdocs, so I can't comment on their style/experience at all, sadly.
I am in the same boat as you. Where do you end up with?
Her 110 is considered challenging. You'll definitely experience linear algebra in its full force. But 110 is an amazing class, and Olga will give it the energy it deserves.
Yeah ur right. That’s def a fair criticism. What I wanna say is that, if someone else is a solid 10/10 choice, go w them. But, they make a solid backup, and as far as profs go, you can very easily do way way worse, or so has been my experience.

I believe she uses Axler, yes."
Math 104,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mt4j4b/math_104/,2021-04-17 19:39:50,Which professor would y'all recommend for math 104: Professor Ryan Hass or Koji Shimizu?,"Take Ryan Hass. I'm with Koji right now and it is *awful*. He refuses to explain things in office hours, and his tests are brutal on another level (even compared to other 104 sections). On top of that, he doesn't drop any midterms or hw, so mess up even a little bit and you're screwed. He grades generously but in a really inconsistent fashion. Avoid the stress and just enroll with Hass, it'll be better I *promise you*.

On a more personal note, Koji has been very tone deaf when addressing students stuggling with mental health during the pandemic. He literally responded to a crying student by telling them to eat chocolate.
Hass is a great guy. Never had him as a prof (time conflicts) but had the pleasure to speak with him and just a super chill guy."
Math 104 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n04b51/math_104_professors/,2021-04-27 18:59:39,"Hii

I was wondering which professor I should take Math 104 with. Has anyone taken this class with either Professor Ryan Hass or Professor Peng Zhou? Are their exams hard?

&#x200B;

Thank You!!","Hass is considered phenomenal for 104 by everyone I've spoken about him with. Peng Zhou can be a bit rushed/disorganized. All of this is anecdotal however, as I have only heard from friends.
Don’t take it with a prof that teaches out of Ross, that book is ass
I'm currently in a class that uses Ross and I'm finding it perfectly satisfactory. It's definitely more accessible than say, Rudin, but it still covers everything important to a reasonable degree. Most professors use Ross for that reason.
Ross hardly covers any topology. It might seem satisfactory in the moment but in hindsight it really isn’t good enough for a class like 202a"
Lovejoy 113 syllabus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j3eg7e/lovejoy_113_syllabus/,2020-10-01 11:37:26,"Hi everyone, just wondering if anyone who's taken Math 113 with Jeremy Lovejoy has a copy of his syllabus, as he doesn't post them on his Berkeley page. I've heard he's pretty good and I'd just like to see how he structures his class/what the pace is. If anyone's currently in his class, how does he deal w/lectures & exams while remote? Thanks ahead of time and go bears! 

P.S. I'm also taking 104 in Spring, what teachers are good? Currently only Koji Shimizu is listed, who I've heard good things about, along with Ryan Hass.","in the class right now, here's the syllabus:

[https://math.berkeley.edu/\~lovejoy/Math113F20](https://math.berkeley.edu/~lovejoy/Math113F20)

I will say though his lectures aren't anything amazing imo, they're definitely not bad but I've eventually resorted to external resources because his lectures don't bring much new insight. the class in entirely asynchronous and we get 24 hours for exams though, which is kinda nice.
Ryan Hass is the best, great lectures and really nice guy who makes himself available for OH and emails. 

Summer discussions were kinda awkward but I think most zoom classes are like that.
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it!"
Math 126 difficulty as first upper div?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dind2f/math_126_difficulty_as_first_upper_div/,2019-10-16 03:29:07,"EECS and math sophomore here, I'm going to start taking my first math upper divs next semester. I know for sure I'm going to take 110 and H113. How hard is Math 126 considering that the only prereqs are 53 and 54? Would taking PDE's after analysis be better? For context, 126 is being taught with Ryan Hass next semester who seems pretty hit or miss from reviews. In terms of my math background, I got A's in 1A, 1B, 53 and an A+ in CS 70.","I took 126 before 104 and I still think it is the hardest non-graduate class I've taken at Berkeley.  Also one of my favorites, it was so so interesting.  But damn, that class should REALLY require 104.  Though it varies from professor to professor, we were doing some stuff in there that I didn't fully understand until taking 202B and learning functional analysis.  I would really not recommend taking it with 110 and H113, that's already enough trouble.  You can always enroll and see what you think (because sometimes it's more physics/engineery ""learn to solve PDEs"" style which is totally doable, and sometimes it's more ""holy crap distribution theory lots of 3 lecture long proofs and lots of multivariate analysis"") but I do really recommend taking it at some point.
I can’t comment about 126 in particular, but that seems like a bit much for your first upper div math classes. Upper division math tends to be a lot more abstract and proof based than lower division, and the transition can take a bit to get used to. It’ll depend on you; how comfortable with / how much do you enjoy proofs? 

Of course, some people take very well to the transition, and you might be totally fine. But 3 upper divs (with an honors course) is a pretty rough way to test that. If nothing else, might be wise to have a backup plan (have a gen Ed or other class ready to swap in, that kind of thing).
Oh damn ok. I was under the impression that 126 was one of the easier/more computational upper digs. I’ll probably wait to take it after 104 or 202 then. Thanks!
I may have just been in a strange 126!  But I also hear it's difficult from other people who have taken it later, so it might not just be me."
Help: Which Professor should I take for Math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/djhxai/help_which_professor_should_i_take_for_math_104/,2019-10-17 20:54:00,"Currently my options are; **Nicholas Miller, Mariusz Wodzicki, Ryan A Hass,**  **Yu-Wei Fan,**  **Sebastian Eterovic, Rui Wang,**  **Philip J Wood**

Thanks for the help!","Not wodzicki if you value your sanity.  I've heard very good about Hass.
I have Hass right now for 104 and he’s a wonderful teacher! Lectures are very example based, and he walks around the classroom chatting with students. Neat notes for if you miss a class, very fair midterm 1 (aside from one question but whatever), and generally available.
Echoing the comments about Hass - he's a very engaging lecturer which I find relatively uncommon among professors, and his assignments are reasonable
Can vouch for Yu-Wei Fan! amazing chalkboard work, his clarity in lecture is superb, and he answers every question thoughtfully and precisely. Every student who’s gone to his office hours lauds him for his helpfulness.

He is also great at managing admin stuff, keeping us students well informed about what material will be covered, and about upcoming deadlines. 

11/10 in my book. And I come from CC, where I feel like I had great professors, but was definitely coddled.
Not Wang. She means well but the language barrier and accent makes her hard to understand, at least for me.
Rui Wang, and I cannot stress this enough. Crystal clear lecturer (unless you have an issue with her accent - see another comment below) and is incredibly helpful during office hours and always open to questions. Of all the classes I've taken at cal so far, analysis with Professor Wang probably made me smarter more than any other class has. I found it difficult initially, but that is by virtue of the difficulty of the material and my inexperience coming into the class - not because of quality of instruction. She uses Rudin, and will give you a rigorous foundation in basic topological concepts that should prepare you well for 202 A/B. She structures the class logically, so that you get a complete treatment of the constructions of the reals, and almost everything is generalised to topological spaces and metric spaces, unlike other sections which may just state a completeness axiom for the reals, and then specify all work to the reals for the majority of the semester and do some basic work with metric spaces in the last two weeks (making for a very boring, and much easier class). You will also get some very basic introductory concepts in functional analysis which few of the other sections bother introducing at all (equicontinuity, uniform convergence, arzela ascoli).  I would take her again in a heartbeat. The only possible qualm you may have is her accent, and that the class is rather fast paced if you do not have any background in proof based math at the level of abstraction that 104 goes into (I did not. Many others found the pace just right or too slow even). I for one, did not find her accent particularly hard to follow."
