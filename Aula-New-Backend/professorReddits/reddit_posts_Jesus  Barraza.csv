Art and Chicano classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u7hd1z/art_and_chicano_classes/,2022-04-19 15:29:54,"Hi has anyone taken the following classes or had the following professors:

&#x200B;

Chicano 130 - Jesus Barraza: Mexican and Chicano art history

Chicano 135b - Raymond Telles: Contemporary Latino film/Latino Narrative Film Since 1990

Art 8 - Allan Desouza: Intro to visual thinking

Art 119: Global perspectives in contemporary art

&#x200B;

If so, could you pls comment on how interesting the courses were and about how much workload they had as well as the structure of the class. Thank you!!","[removed]
Art 8 is pretty easy. Would like to note that it is an ""introduction to visual thinking"" and not an introduction on how to do art.
Jesus’ class was awesome! And he’s a super chill prof. :)
Hi I was wondering how much the workload was for art 119? I wanted to take it with cs 70
?

is it mostly analyzing art? or do you not make art at all throughout?
Tell me more! I’m gonna take his class this fall
I didn’t end up taking it sorry :(
Was Chicano 135b heavy workload or hard? I am taking chem 3a so want to know if it will be too much
There are 3 projects throughout the course in which you will work on to create art pieces, but it's not a traditional art class where they show you how to draw, paint, etc.

Okay thanks! Not sure but people who are taking it say it’s bad"
