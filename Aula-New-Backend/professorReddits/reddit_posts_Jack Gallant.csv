COGSCI 127 difficulty?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u5tbtz/cogsci_127_difficulty/,2022-04-17 11:41:57,"I was wondering how doable COGSCI 127 is if I have no prior experience. There are no required prerequisites but I haven’t taken any psych/cogsci courses. I plan to take this with Data100, Econ100, and a Stats course. 

Any other tips would be great too!","I took this class with Jack Gallant Fall 2021. So this only applies if you’re going to take it with him…He sent out an email saying anyone who hasn’t taken basic psych or cogsci should drop the class.  

Personally i don’t think the class was too difficult. His class was also data science driven but the psych aspects (e.g., anatomy, and famous case studies) might be hard but it’s not impossible to catch-up to speed. Seeing that you’re in data100 i’d say go for it. It’s a great class.
Hey, I just pmed you :)"
