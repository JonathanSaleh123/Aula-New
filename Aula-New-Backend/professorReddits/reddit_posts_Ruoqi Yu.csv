Which is the best lab Stat class and core Stat classes in general,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qax4zh/which_is_the_best_lab_stat_class_and_core_stat/,2021-10-18 15:04:41,"I'm and MCB/ Stat double major and I was wondering what courses I should take as my Stat core. For I initially had this planned:

Core Stat (non Lab) = 

1) Stat 157 - Seminar in Probability (Forecasting) 

1.1) If 157 wasn't available, Stat 155 - Game theory 

2) Stat 156 - Causal Inference 

Core Stat (Lab)

1) Stat 153 - Intro to Time Series

1.1) If I didn't like 153, then Stat 159 - Collaborative Statistics

1.2) Maybe Stat 151a - Linear Modeling

Now that 157 is full, I have no clue what should fill the gap since I can't take 155 this semester due to reasons. 

Additionally, I have no clue how Stat 153 with Professor Ruoqi Yu is gradewise and I don't know whether I should take that or Stat 151a. Can someone tell me their experiences in these classes I would prefer to get a good grade since my GPA is not too hot right now.

TL;DR: What are the 3 statistics core course requirements I should take/ which classes did y'all like and enjoy the most (and of course did well in) without spending like 20 hours a week on it?",
