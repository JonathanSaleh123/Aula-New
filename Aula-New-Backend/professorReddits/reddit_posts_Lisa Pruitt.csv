I’m an incoming 5th year Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechatronics/Controls. However, I’m also interested in taking ME C223 - Polymer Engineering, with Lisa Pruitt.  The class seems interesting, so I wanted to know it anyone has taken this class I’m curious to know how the class was like (lectures, projects,etc). Thanks!",
"Five UC Berkeley faculty have been selected as recipients of the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award, Cal's most prestigious honor for teaching. They are: Wendy Brown, Political Science; Georgina Kleege, English; Anne Joseph O’Connell, Law; Lisa Pruitt, Mechanical Engineering; Irfan Siddiqi, Physics.",http://teaching.berkeley.edu/distinguished-teaching-award,2016-03-22 21:17:15,,"If anyone's anybody they know receiving that particular award means they're fucked for moving up on the academic ladder. Almost no-one who receives that award moves up from the professorship rank they received it at.
Alexander Coward gets snubbed once again!
maybe if you're an assistant prof., but for someone like lisa pruitt, no, that would be completely wrong
Do you have any evidence of that?
Well, I did say ""*almost* no one"".
Not really, a friend who worked at Cal and then later became an adjunct told me. She's been here for at least two decades, knows how things go."
