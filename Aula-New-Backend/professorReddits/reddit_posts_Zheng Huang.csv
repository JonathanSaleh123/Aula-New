Econ 101A w/ Zheng Huang vs 100A w/ Campbell?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1calb3l/econ_101a_w_zheng_huang_vs_100a_w_campbell/,2024-04-22 13:32:18,"Thoughts? I wanted to take 101A because of the research opportunities it opens up, but I heard Campbell is a much better professor. Is Zheng Huang that terrible?","what compelled you to post this 5 times
oops computer glitch, sorry"
Econ 100A w/ Zheng Huang,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uypw2f/econ_100a_w_zheng_huang/,2022-05-26 21:19:05,Has anyone taken Econ 100A with Zheng Huang in the summer? What are your thoughts on the class?,Iâ€™m taking the same class this summer. How was your experience?
ECON 100A or 100B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11fg2vj/econ_100a_or_100b/,2023-03-01 12:05:26,"The professor for 100B is Nicolas Depetris Chauvin. He has no reviews at all so does anyone know about him?

What about Zheng Huang? Are they a good professor for 100A?","Taking 100B with Chauvin right now, so far so good donâ€™t really have any complaints
I would highly recommend 101B with Jon Steinsson if itâ€™s offered next semester. One of the best lecturers and a star researcher in the department - heâ€™s clearly very passionate about teaching macroeconomics, and the material is fantastic - heâ€™s in the process of writing a textbook based on his version of the class so he basically gives everyone access to a wonderful in-depth explanation of the lecture material on day one. The workload is probably one of the lowest out of all the 100/140 series classes (like 5 short problem sets and 2 exams?) and the curve is usually very very forgiving. 101B also has exactly the same prerequisites as 100B, and doesnâ€™t use any fancy math unlike 101A and 141.
I took 100A w/ Zheng Huang last summer. The problem sets and exams were straight forward. Huang was very good at explaining concepts. I had no complaints.
I took 100B with Hawkins last semester, but heâ€™s not teaching right now (some people said he left). Iâ€™m with Jim Campbell for 100A right now and I absolutely love him! Heâ€™s amazing and his lectures are engaging. He very relatable and he works out how to do the problems and apply what you are learning instead of only lecturing on the conceptual.
what math did you need to do well in the class?
Can you share any tips for this class in particular? Taking it over summer 23!
Yeah thatâ€™s all good but a midterm a month is a bitch for folks taking many other classes.
Math 1A and 1B are more than enough for 101B. They teach partial derivatives and a few other basic ideas from 53 along the way but theyâ€™re very easy to pick up because the class isnâ€™t computation heavy and itâ€™s just a handful of operations applied in predictable ways to rather simple functions.
Thatâ€™s true. Three midterms is no fun. I do like how it takes the pressure off a little. In classes with only one midterms thereâ€™s a lot more pressure to not fuck up. That being said, I did have three Econ midterms in one day this semester. That was brutal. So I guess it does just depend on class load. After that I feel like I can accomplish anything though! (wellâ€¦until I get my grades backâ€¦then Iâ€™ll probably just cry ðŸ’€)
For Campbell?"
ECON C110,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y52seg/econ_c110/,2022-10-15 17:17:38,Has anyone taken ECON C110 (Game Theory) with Zheng Huang? Thoughts? Recommended or no?,"hard as fuck? Tests cover things you will never practice in class. Only assignments are 2 midterms and a final. Hopefully there is a curve.
Was there a curve?
I think so, was never explicitly said. I went up almost a letter grade"
