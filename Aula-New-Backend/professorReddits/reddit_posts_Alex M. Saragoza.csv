The case against Optional P/NP,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fl4w3w/the_case_against_optional_pnp/,2020-03-18 22:49:52,"Whatever the school officials decide, **it should not involve students picking an option (ie. Optional P/NP).** 

1. For most students, it creates unnecessary stress to pick which one, determine the curve, and so on. For professors, many were not prepared for the sudden shift to online, and any granular measurement of comparative performance is difficult to assign. These issues have all been well enumerated in other posts. 
2. Students who are already most affected by COVID-19 are further disadvantaged. A popular argument for making P/NP optional is that those applying to medical school, grad school, declaring GPA-capped majors, etc. (some also consider industry) will be negatively impacted with a semester (or more) of P/NP marks. They would like to continue taking their courses for grade because they are already doing sufficiently well in that class (and this is a valid reason for sure) and would like to see that effort reflected in their transcript. However, to keep up with grades, students now must have (1) time to study despite the madness surrounding (2) reliable internet. Furthermore, if a grad school panel compares 2 Berkeley students, who are otherwise very similar, except one took a semester of P/NP in technical courses whereas the other did not and received fair grades, it’s only conceivable that, all things equal, the grad school panel would elect the student with measured success over the student whose academic potential for that semester (or more) ranges from A to C-. You get the idea.
3. Let’s pose a situation. Jane comes from a low income family, and got into Berkeley on scholarships study MCB in order to become a doctor (premed). When Jane goes back home due to COVID-19, she has to take care of her family (who may have underlying illnesses), buy food, deal with implicit xenophobia, etc. Even if Jane were doing well in her classes, she would prefer spending less time on these classes, and focus more on survival. Now, compare to Alex, a well-off student living in Beverly Hills. When Alex goes back home, his parents make him food and he has access to reliable high speed internet. Alex is also doing well in his classes, and has aspirations of declaring CS this semester (taking CS70). Clearly, Alex is in a much better position to study more, and would be a strong proponent of making P/NP optional. As a side result, we also hear from more Alexes because they actually have the time to go on social media to voice their (valid) concerns. 
4. **Who loses more here if a policy is implemented for optional P/NP?** College is supposed to equalize the playing field – even if you came in with little experience, or from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background, you could be equally successful as your peers from various other backgrounds. College is for us to grow as individuals and intellectuals; the competition is a useful aspect of that, but only if the competition is fair and equitable. That competition is always secondary to student learning, safety, and health. 

This is a problem that has no good solutions. **I’m all for mandated P/NP (as MIT has done) or the proposed AFA suggestion, as these both equalize the playing field far more than letting students of vastly different backgrounds pick an evaluative metric that only useful for comparing themselves to their peers.**","I think the more schools that employ mandatory p/np the more grad school admission will have to take this unprecedented event into account when making their decisions if they haven't already.

I was skeptical of the mandatory p/np but it's making more sense to me now.
I just wish they would make a decision already. This entire process has just added another layer of stress for everyone
[deleted]
If I’m paying tuition, I want to be able to make my own decisions about my academics. I want to be able to choose whether or not I take a class for a grade or p/np
Yeah but what about for CS? The department can’t take everyone for CS so if they give all As then they might raise the gpa cap even higher to compensate and weed out more people.
This is an unpopular opinion, but most people probably support mandatory P/NP because Berkeley doesn't curve well. But the 20% of people that are about to get better grades to differentiate themselves for grad school are going to naturally get outvoted.

Coming from a low income background where it took me 4 years to finally develop the skills needed for getting good grades, this semester will help my GPA a lot (and boy did I make sacrifices for it). I think for the minority of people that do well it's not fair to have mandatory P/NP. It seems to punish a lot of people who have worked very hard and made many sacrifices.
My family and living situation has always been in disarray. My family has encountered many many problems (health, lack of money, deaths etc...) throughout my entire life. It was no different this year. I worked as hard I could to succeed my first semester through all these problems, but it was lackluster. This semester I truly made a difference and I really need these grades that I put incredible effort into because I need to declare. Even now, at home I have no where to study quietly in our one bedroom apartment. I have much more responsibilities now because of the corona outbreak, such as shopping for my elderly dad while also having to watch out for his health (he is ill). Nonetheless, I'm still putting my utmost into my courses disregarding my sleep because I want to continue my strong semester. A mandatory P/NP will ruin all my efforts so far and thus, I don't feel strongly about it. This is just my opinion from my own perspective, I hope you all well in these arduous times.
I completely agree. Optional P/NP is an awful idea - anyone in a difficult situation who wants to go to grad school is no better off than they would be with regular grading, since a lot of the people they're competing against will then have a semester (or more) full of regular grades. It also hurts people who are in a position to study because it'll screw up the curve - anyone who isn't going great, even if their circumstances aren't particularly difficult, will probably choose to P/NP.

The only people truly hurt by mandatory P/NP are those who wanted to use this semester to differentiate themselves from their peers - to make up for poor performances in the past. But I think it's much fairer to judge anyone by their performance in a regular semester than their performance in this chaotic mess, where (as you said) the playing field isn't level.
Yes this is really the only good solution. Everyone needs a equal chance to succeed, regardless of their circumstances. Since grad schools will see this is happening all over the US, it will be understood. It's time we realized what other students could potentially be going through instead of only caring about our grades, etc. We need to stand together. Enough reputable schools (MIT! Wellesley, Yale, etc) who regularly send many students to the most prestigious grad schools are doing this. COVID-19 is affecting us all, grad school admissions officers included. 

I think departments would need to discuss how to work out their GPA caps because of this, maybe make it not so hard to get into a major or give students a chance to explain of they had intended to do better in a certain class they were taking this semester. Holistic admissions.

But all in all yes. Thank you for saying it so well.
i think one main issue with this argument is that not every school in the country is doing a mandated pass/no pass, in fact most schools are not! this means mandating this would put all berkeley students at a disadvantage compared to the majority of students who will still be getting letter grades.

i have also only heard of mit doing a mandated pass/fail. mit is on the quarter system which makes this much more feasible for them. as a school on the semester system, making grades mandated pass no pass first of all discounts all the work students did for the first half of the semester but also has a huge impact as we would have 7 semesters affecting our gpas instead of 8. 

i understand a lot of your points but as someone who doesn't thrive on online classes and has to take care of someone with an illness i would still like my classes to be graded with professors and grad students going a little bit easier on us. i understand that mandating a pass fail seems to equalize the playing field but i think mandating it also causes a lot of unfair issues of their own. some people need letter grades for this semester whether it be because they are a graduating senior and need a boost before grad school or need a certain gpa to get into majors or for a multitude of other reasons. because of this i think optional pass no pass is the best option to make everyone at least somewhat happy, it is a compromise between doing nothing and mandating it for everyone.

also in regards to your scenario, everyone is feeling stress from coronavirus. just because someone is wealthy doesn't mean they aren't taking care of someone with an illness or they aren't juggling other stresses too.
I think optional is better than nothing. If they force it it screws over grad school admissions. If all schools don’t do it and you’re taking very important classes for research and such you will have a significant disadvantage since even though it’s a bad situation with such limited spots the professors want to see performance in key areas. If you give people the option to p/np then you can try to take away stress of the major requirements that aren’t super important and leave grades for ones that matter
How realistic is it for either optional p/np or mandatory p/np to actually happen? I haven’t really heard anyone besides students on social media talk about this.
OPTIONAL ALL THE WAY! 👏

• Some people may have FINALLY had this semester go their way and deserve that GPA boost if they earned it!

• There are undeclared majors (ie. Computer Science) who are relying on this semester’s grade to declare. Changing it to P/NP could affect how well they need to do the following semester in a class.

• Students may be trying to get out of academic probation or financial aid holds due to their grades in previous semesters. They need the OPTION to keep these letter grades!

• Students may also have off campus scholarships that depend on their GPA every semester.

• Students may be repeating classes for a better grade and you want to make them retake it AGAIN?

• A passing grade is a C- or higher. Those that may be expecting to receive a D for the semester could’ve still passed out of their major requirement (unless it’s a requirement that needs a C- or better) but now they get an NP...

There just seems to be too many negative cases that would result from a mandatory P/NP.

Just give everyone P/NP as an OPTION and people can take it if they want to. Seems like the better option answer to me. 🤷‍♀️
Sorry I don’t know much about this - if it’s mandatory P/NP will those classes still count for your major? Cuz if not that’s fucking over a lot of people
How many people oppose this? I vehemently oppose this, I want my grades. If I'm in the minority, then so be it, but I want to know how many people you are representing.
i have a friend who needs the grade in this class to raise his gpa in a class to declare. if it’s not optional, he ultimately can’t declare. for reasons like this and others, i’m opposed to having all grades be p/np. it would be more helpful to choose what classes you want p/np, and get a grade for the other ones.

although you also make some good points. honestly it’s a really tough situation, not sure what the “right” answer is.
I’m glad you mentioned the fact the whether or not they decide if P/NP or not, it should NOT be optional. Speaking for myself here, Making informed decisions is really hard to do and evaluating what the ‘best’ decision given the circumstances just adds unnecessary stress
You’re right. College is a place where the playing field should be leveled, and optional P/NP most definitely does not achieve that. It benefits the students who have the privilege of being able to choose, and drastically hurts students who cannot choose due to circumstances out of their control.

Out of regard for those students who are suffering more than I could ever comprehend, I believe we should have P/NP for everyone or no one.
This was this morning and it was the Econ 2 professor, a friend sent me a screenshot of the email. He also told me that some form of P/NP is definitely happening and will be released at the latest by Monday. I think this is probably the most utilitarian option because optional P/NP first off has so many more problems that mandatory P/NP. Also, there’s an argument that grad school knows the situation that all students are in right now and thus wont care as much about students grades this semester if they’re applying to grad school. This whole thing basically ensures everyone must be P NP but if students still want to show that they excelled in a particular class they can have their grades shown but it won’t affect GPA whatsoever.
I’ve heard a professor said mandatory P/NP but with the option to “unmask” grades, meaning if you choose to unmask grades people can see what grade you actually got on your transcript but that grade won’t count for anything or count for your gpa, just help people like (for example) going to grad school so that admissions officers could recalculate what their gpa should’ve been. Thoughts ?
lmao rewarding the comments against mandatory pnp so it gets noticed... I c u
Absolutely agreed. Thank you for posting this and for articulating it so well
Agreed. Optional P/NP is the absolute worst option and would perpetuate massive unforeseen inequalities resulting from these stressful circumstances.

Edit: not advocating for mandatory P/NP. Just saying optional P/NP should not happen. Also, as you pointed out, it seems that the most vocal students are probably in better situations.
100% agree
if it’s not optional, then let’s say Jane gets a C while Alex gets an A. Is this a better scenario than Alex getting an A and Jane getting a Pass? mandatory seems better than optional but optional seems better than nothing
what is the proposed AFA suggestion?
As someone (junior) who completely burnt themselves out last semester taking 19 units, I'm pretty conflicted. On one hand, my GPA fell quite a bit due to my overloaded schedule, on the other hand, I am doing extremely poorly this semester due to burnout, mental exhaustion, and loss of interest. Optional P/NP would let me focus on the one important upper div/grad class I'm trying to do well in (strongly related to my research), instead of being stressed out over bullshit lower divs. P/NP for all would take a lot of stress out of my life, but it will also significantly devalue the class I'm invested in. If nothing is done, my GPA is fucked anyways, I won't get into grad school, and I can't get a job. My mental health has already went full downhill since February so everything going to shit isn't exactly shocking me. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Yes. I was also initially very hesitant to support mandatory over optional pnp but after hearing about the shit that some students are currently going through, I think mandatory pnp is one of the few equitable ways to implement grading for this semester even though it may impact things like major declaration (which impacted majors would have to work on figuring that out internally ofc). hoping that campus updates us in the coming day or two to provide guidance since every other school seems to be communicating such initiatives at around this time.
yup, I was initially very against it since I was apprehensive about it coming up in admissions/recruitment later but now I'm in favor of normalizing it in the wake of a very abnormal situation

it's better than making people stressed for no reason by presenting a heavy choice to make.
Agreed. Its worldwide, not just a few school. Individual depts would have to bend their reqs a bit, but it's an understandable situation
It will be default p/np and students will be able to *opt in* for a letter grade.

edit: lol, downvote me if you want, but I'm not giving an opinion.
Berkeley making timely decisions? Dream on!
Absolutely agree. This mandatory p/np and “A’s for all” nonsense hurts students in the long run.
You'd be fine if those were P/NP if you just take 202/250 (which presumable you are if you are worried about ""getting into a good math Ph.D. program""). And your recommendations are what really matters for applications. I agree with original post.
exactly, take the p/np if you need it but don't force everyone to give up their hard work and research opportunities.
I get that it’s more fair to have it be mandatory, but I’m one of those people that was using this semester to improve my gpa. I finally got into easy and interesting classes as a second semester senior, and this was going to help me improve my gpa right before applying to med school this summer. Now, even though I was going to get good grades anyway, med school will just think I got good grades because of Covid-19 and easier grading. Or they’ll just see all Ps, which won’t help my gpa like I was depending on. It’s a lose-lose. Rip
Quick question: how do you deal with an already impacted major with GPA requirements now having far more students eligible than they expected?  You mention making it not so hard but unless the school does something ridiculous like hire enough staff for the number of students they need to be able to differentiate somehow.
Just wanna say that MIT is not really on a quarter system. Their spring term starts early February, which is preceded by a four-week pseudo-term called the Independent Activities Period.
Wellesley is semester system I think! + also maybe Yale
Other schools have done it so it could easily happen here
My professor mentioned through zoom that many professors, along with him, are actually advocating for the p/np option. Based on what he said, I think he prefers the mandatory option.
Departmental changes could be made to accommodate. There are pros and cons to each and each fs with a different group. Theres no perfect s ol lotion unfortunately. None of us couldve seen a pandemic coming
Yes it would, that's the point
I agree, I'm paying out of state tuition to go to this school and putting in tons of hours every week in 20 units and I would be livid if all the work and stress I've put in is just thrown to the wayside.
I am absolutely with you. The lack of vocal support for the opposition is worrying to me, but I think it’s just an “unpopular opinion” people aren’t comfortable voicing.
I want my grade for at least 2/4 classes. The other 2 are bullshit (but still technical) lower divs that I need to graduate that I can give less of a shit about.
the dept would have to change their standards or make some sort of exception I am guessing? maybe they would get it idk
can you post the email?
Isn't this the same as optional? Those who apply to grad school will still be pressured into getting that Letter grade
When was this and which professor?
lmao imagine trying to put yourself on the same level as peers who worked much harder than you in the name of ""equity."" what a joke. The fact that you have the time to get on reddit and make a big fuss about making p/np mandatory like this makes it obvious that you aren't even one of the people that is severely affected by coronavirus, ur just one of the benefactors from a potential mandatory pnp policy. How about, instead of coming here to complain, why don't you go study so you can get your grades up?

Come at me with all your downvotes, they simply validate my point lmao. The top 20% is always gonna get outvoted by the other 80%. Even if we did something ridiculous like making every semester A's For All when Coronavirus is gone, it'd still draw heavy support from the majority of students.
maybe a grade bin shift? but there's also drawbacks w that but it would prevent super low grades. ik theres a petition somewhere for mostly as and b+ as lowest ... not sure,,
but this is the same as optional p/np - places the same pressures on students who might be considering grad school but don't have the means to work efficiently or are struggling rn due to covid19
you’re right, i was mistaken MIT is on semester. HOWEVER freshman fall for MIT students is already mandatory P NP. Most students do the worse their freshman fall and try to increase their grades. At Berkeley, we don’t have a freshman fall that’s mandatory P NP which means a lot of students do poorly because of adjusting to college and weeder classes and then come back and do much better during spring. A mandatory P NP would mean grad schools would assume that freshmen springs went pretty similarly to their falls even if the student had actually improved by a lot. This is not an issue at MIT because everyone gets P NP grades their freshman fall so even if this semester is P NP grad schools don’t have bad freshman fall grades to assume their spring grades were like. Just a thought.
true but Yale hasn’t actually adopted No Fail Yale, it is a petition.
that's good to hear
just whether or not this happens, optional p/np shouldn't happen
That’s what I thought. Thanks!
I agree with you in some sense, but your parents are likely the ones paying out of state tuition, and many students here don't come from that sort of wealth. Not to be snide, but it's worth noting. I'm not saying you're loaded, but consider the student who couldn't have afforded out of state tuition to begin with, even in state tuition, and doesn't have a healthy place to study right now. This is a lot of students. I feel the same frustration as you, but it's a petty frustration compared to those facing more severe circumstances, who without this change would be more seriously negatively impacted. There's a big disconnect between those who want to earn a high grade, and those who are more focused on just surviving while simultaneously trying to earn a high grade, because of their economic status. What is the solution? I don't know, but this issue is revealing a lot of the differences between student's experiences. Last similar thread some student gave the whole ""suck it up and study harder"" spiel. Turns out they were living with their parents and reportedly had a lot of disposable income based on their post history. It must be understood that life can be actually genuinely difficult for some students on the level of basic needs, not just with respect to, and in addition to academics. Maybe this whole issue will make some students more aware of how narrow sighted their perspective is...
Yeah I really hope the mandatory advocates are the vocal minority but it's hard to tell.
it’s cs lol, they definitely won’t. but it would be awesome if they did.
I'm saying that's what it's going to be, not that it's my plan.
It might be a bit simple to use these case studies. I come from an impoverished background where my parents fought their way to make sure I don't have to worry as much about having to work (although I do now, because my parents lost their jobs). I get pretty much complete tuition from a need-based scholarship, and I would rather my work this semester be graded. I'm taking 22 units, I worked my ass off, and this is my last semester to improve my GPA to look good for grad school. I would find it deeply unfair to both me and my parents if I don't get awarded the grades I worked hard for. Yes I know there may or may not be many people that have worse situations than me due to coronavirus, but I've also been fired and had my summer internship cancelled, sooo I would really prefer having something that I worked hard for so far be worth it.
i agree with bluesjey. The situations and scenarios being used to advocate for a mandatory Pass No Pass assume a lot. First they assume that just because someone comes from an impoverished background that they automatically are going to struggle and want a Pass No Pass. Second they assume that those not from impoverished backgrounds are incredibly privileged and aren’t facing any difficulties with corona virus when this is in fact untrue. Many from other backgrounds are still facing problems like taking care of those with illnesses, providing child care for younger siblings, etc.
Of course I understand this and I am fully in support of advocating for students who do not have similar privileges to the ones I have (which aren't too great to begin with, by the way, but that's not what matters here and I do accept that many Cal students are in much worse situations).  At the same time I refuse to settle for a solution which I feel is being presented less as a method of advocacy for students in such situations and instead more as a method for people who DO have privilege to chill out and enjoy the spring.  Which groups of people don't necessarily live or die with the way their transcript looks when they move on to their next part of life?  The people who disproportionately are included in consulting/technical clubs.  The people who have a prebuilt network.  The people who can pay for GRE test prep and such.  There IS a solution here which is MUCH more intentional as a method for underserved student advocacy than ""everyone's forced to get P's on their transcripts!"" and I'll be the first to admit that I can't come up with that solution on my own because my thoughts are heavily biased by my current experience with the semester.  So are the thoughts of every other student on this campus.  So I'd really hope the school doesn't decide to make a huge, sweeping change which may come across as very unintentional to some (and maybe not to others).
Historically, you can petition when applying to a major to have them consider the grade you would've received even though it was given as a pass. If the university mandates a pass, there's already a mechanism for this (in addition to the fact that hundreds of freshman will likely be in this situation if they took the classic 61A fa19, 61B sp20, and CS70 fa20 and so they'll probably be ready to consider it).
i just don’t know if it’s worth the risk honestly. the petition is rate is extremely low. it’s different than meeting the gpa requirement with just 2/3 of the classes, and getting a P in the other. there’s many situations where all three classes are needed to meet the gpa cap, and if one of those is P you would have to petition, which as ive said, has a very low acceptance rate. 

also the grade you “would” have gotten might not be accurately represented in gradescope (or whatever they use) because even though they say they don’t curve, at the end they tend to boost everyone’s grades by a certain number of points. they do not disclose this number or add it to gradescope, it’s just something you see represented in your final letter grade, which in this case, you wouldn’t receive.
My point was mainly that tons of people will be in this situation. Generally many people get good grades in Hilfinger's 61B. If that's taken out of the equation with P/NP (by default) and it's just 61A and CS70 which are relatively more difficult to get high grades in, I would guess that TONS of people will be petitioning and so they will likely develop a policy around. Additionally, with how responsive the CS department has been, if a forced PNP policy is released we most likely won't have to wait very long for them to respond with how they will consider a pass for the purpose of declaration. 

Also, while I haven't tried it, I assume that when you substitute a pass for a letter grade retroactively you go through the professor and ask them what you would've gotten rather than just using grade scope because they need an authoritative answer. If they boost grades at the end, your grade (before it was turned into a pass) will also have been boosted in whatever records they kept.

In other words, have faith in your professors. They're not looking to screw us over. If only those who got a 3.3 on 61A and CS70 were allowed to declare, the CS major might be looking a bit more sparse and sad than they'd like.
yeah I see what you’re saying. i would also hope they would create some sort of policy to address this. thanks for bringing up these points! we’ll just have to wait and see what their decision is now.
[deleted]
what point are u making? in a way its easier for them to declare if this goes thru because they just need to pass both courses and have gotten a B+ in 61A
[deleted]
good point. yeah i honestly don’t know how they’re gonna handle this. p/np for cs majors would possibly lead to them to do something else to weed ppl out. 

and with an influx of declared cs majors, the petition process will undoubtedly become more rigorous.
[deleted]
yeah i’m curious too lol. also very nervous lol, i’m also trying to declare cs."

> 
> As we move toward a series of events that start this Sunday on campus, I want to first express my deep regret about the stress this is causing for many members of our campus community and the burden it is placing on people to continue their regular routines in the midst of what will cause a disruption here. The ideas likely to be expressed by some of the speakers next week run counter to our [Principles of Community](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community), particularly the one that affirms the dignity of all individuals and encourages us to strive to uphold a just community where discrimination and hate are not tolerated.
> 
> As we all work to uphold these principles, we must also fulfill our legal obligations as a public university. This includes allowing our registered student organizations to plan and conduct events and invite outside speakers.
> 
> Below is the latest information we have about the “Free Speech Week” events being planned by California Patriot for Sept. 24-27. We will post updates [here](http://news.berkeley.edu/campus-update-on-free-speech-week/) as details are confirmed and as safety and security plans proceed. The University of California Police Department (UCPD) is conducting security assessments and will provide updates soon about possible building and road closures and campus detours. UCPD officers and colleagues from other agencies are committed to preserving safety and security, and to minimizing the disruption of campus life by people who are neither members of the university community nor invited guests. Some faculty and staff leaders may choose to temporarily relocate classes and programs in order to minimize disruption. Thank you for appreciating that we find ourselves amid a great deal of uncertainty.

> Carol Christ, Chancellor","Can we talk about how unbelievably fucking embarassing this actually is for Milo? 

Considering already over half a dozen people (Damore, Mac Donald, Murray, Peterson, Malice, I think at least one more I'm forgetting) have all come out and said they were never actually invited or just aren't going anymore, it seems like the truth is apparent: **Milo boasted to the world that a bunch of conservative and alt-right figures are going to his party when he actually never invited them and they want nothing to do with him**. His brand is *that* toxic and he's *that* desperate. I am almost certain that another half of the people of this updated-updated-updated-list will not come, and likely barely know they're on it, or are just ignoring Milo like the embarassing cringelord he is. Ann Coulter tweets 20 times a day, isn't it weird that she hasn't tweeted that she'll be here in less than a week? Steve Bannon has basically never done an event like this, and we're supposed to believe that he's going to come speak on Sproul steps because Milo says he will? LOL after the embarassment of next week I hope dailycal, berkeleyside, SF Gate expose this ridiculous fraud for what it is: the most pathetic, disgusting loser in school boasting about all of the cool people who will totally come to his party, when most of them refuse to even acknowledge him. Sad!

Edit: note that Erik Prince is off the list now too after his PR people said he had no intention of going. Free speech week speakers dropping at a rate of 2-3 per day...

Edit 2: SABO is off too. God they're almost half gone...
She's honestly just in a shitty position to represent the University. Stop Milo from coming and you get bad press regarding the university's commitment to free speech. Let him come, and you have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in security to protect the students from Antifa.
Relevant survey results in the news:

* [Views among college students regarding the First Amendment: Results from a new survey](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/09/18/views-among-college-students-regarding-the-first-amendment-results-from-a-new-survey/) 
I'm trying to figure out how many undergrad scholarships [$600,000](http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/15/berkeley-spent-600000-for-security-at-ben-shapiro-event/) could buy. Let alone what Bay Area communities have had to shell out for these recurring circuses.

It's not a stretch to think they're doing this on purpose – draining dollars from Cal's real mission.

I'd like to see Patriot Prayer, Milo, BCR and all their fraudulent scammers be sued and the proceeds going to something – anything – more constructive than their masturbatory ego-crusade.
Even Peterson dropped out now? Who actually are the rest of these people? Why are they even coming to a university? 

Edit: and that toxic British woman too! This is a bloody letdown.
Free speech does not condone hate speech.  Why are they allowing these hate-spewing imbeciles to have this public stage?
Out of curiosity: how many students have been hurt by antifa?
She's just a shitty person who's drunk on liberalism. 
Everyone's fine limiting hate speech until what you say is considered hate speech. What a fine line we're crossing here. 
Or, you know, anytime BCR invites a shitty person, us and the community can stop throwing a hissy fit so that $600,000 can actually go to students.

Awesome lesson you're trying to teach kids these days dude. Threaten violence and you actually might get your way.
Sued for what?
It could house some of us homeless students. Or at least begin to help us out. According to the Homeless Student Union, 10% of Berkeley students are affected by homelessness. If the university actually cared about us, if BCR actually cared about doing some good in this world, all this money, all this time, all this effort, could be used on people who are actually in this world suffering right now. Instead, a bunch of privileged fucks spend their money and the university's money (read: the money WE pay to the university) on their little circlejerk oppression sessions. There are countless suffering here. They're ignored.
u need grounds to sue. firing blanks is just more money down the drain.
Approximately 7 four year scholarships
They should have enforced the laws early on instead of emboldening Antifa.  
Jordan Peterson was gonna speak? That would've been tight.
> Why are they even coming to a university?

I encourage you to show, listen, and have an open, sincere, honest discussion with them. If you can behave maybe each side will walk away more enlightened about the thoughts and interests of their fellow man.

> This is a bloody letdown.

Pretty sure you won't let it remain a bloodless letdown
Legally, it does.
Think about the consequences of not letting someone speak.
The problem with labeling ""hate speech"" is that the term is so loose you can essentially classify it for anything, to a point that a group can even silence you if you say anything remotely contrary to theirs.

And plus, hate speech is protected under court of law.
Hate speech isn't even a real thing, it exists only in your mind.
[deleted]
All of them.  Their behavior lessens the reputation of the school.
Let's try moving it away from the Left/Right, Anti-Fascists-Are-The-REAL-Fascists paradigm and into something more neutral.

Say there's a horrible child enabled by a power-drunk, enabling mother who repeatedly craps in the pool. The kid, not the mom, who's too busy trying to get drunk and screw everyone (over) in sight. 

This is A Bad Thing. Cholera and all kinds of nasties, so the entire pool needs to be drained, disinfected, refilled, chemistry re-balance, the works. A *bitch*.

OK. Who's to blame and whose responsibility is it. First time, dumb kid's fault, our responsibility. Everyone pays for it because that's the cost of owning a community pool. There's always that *one* glue-eating child who shits in the pool. Fine. 

Okayyyy. Second time, dumb, enabling, screw-everyone-over-in-sight, drunk Mom's fault, our reluctant responsibility. Hey. Sucks to be her but then again, she lives with That Thing, so we'll turn a blind eye to her swiping our vodka from the community club house wet bar. There's always one in every neighborhood, right? 

Not OK. Third, fourth & fifth times. We suggest It stop crapping in our pool every couple of weeks and she be a freaken' parent and while she's at it, buy her own damned vodka. The attention-seeking, glue-eating, six-time crapping child and her awful drinking-all-our-booze harridan reacts poorly: ""Show me where in the bylaws it says you're not allowed to crap in the pool more than six times. Besides, you don't *have* to open your mouth or eyes or nose while swimming. So really, YOU'RE the Cholera-spreader!"" Then she swipes your drink, downs it, hits on the poolboy (poor poolboy!) and collapses into a drooling stupor.

Question: if she announces she and her spawn will be at the pool this Sunday, at what point is it her and His Poopiness' responsibility to clean the damn pool they crap in every few weeks, and stop being ours?
Considering their proposed list of speakers (supposedly justifying a three-day fiesta) consists 80% of people who not only aren't attending, but were never asked to attend? Fraud.

They should have gone with, ""We have six local nobodies who desperately need to goose sales at their online stores before they start serving time for all the assault charges they've racked up in the past year, so we're doing a televised (*cough* smartphone count, right? *cough*) marathon. C'mon down!"" 

But their telling the truth is like asking the Wicked Witch of the West to take a lengthy shower. The only thing left at the end is endless wailing and green viscous slime.
If you actually cared about devoting this money to homeless students, you wouldn't have advocated for violence against BCR in the first place, thus necessitating these exorbitant security expenditures.
*sigh* 

You're going to *make* me pencil it out? Monster!

1 school year, undergrad: [$14K.](http://financialaid.berkeley.edu/cost-attendance)

$600K wasted at *one* event by UCB that these Neo-Nazis hope will goose sales at their shoddy WordPress stores or earn an extra $0.0005 per YouTube viewer.

That's about 43 academic years. Assuming UCB costs are the same as what Reg Fees are (remember what they say about ""assume""?). 

So those are 4 years of Reg Fees covered for 11 students. That's life-changing. 

But it could just as easily be 1 year for 43 students. Or half-fee stipends for 86 students. Not life-changing, but still amazing.

Room & Board is a whole different vase of roses. So are grads or out-of-state students, but we're penciling in here. 

That's only **one** Neo-Nazi self-love fest. Not counting the six already dribbled out the sphincter of BCR & their Mercer/Koch daddies. Not counting the ones they're planning.

So… If these jackasses are so concerned with UCB's undergrads, why aren't they giving out half-year stipends for 100 randomly selected students? Or Hell, why aren't their sponsors paying the full freight for this year's class? They earn more just off their interest.

Oh yeah. They don't give a damn about students. Or Berkeley. Or California. Or the United States. It's all about them. Not us. *That's* why.
It would've been funny, I'll give you that.
yeah, bucko
these aren't discussions, they're just gonna be speeches.
There's no need to talk to Milo, to Horowitz, to Gellar, to Bannon, to Coulter. They're all professional bigots, and it's a fools game to talk with that.

And wow, got me. You really struck deep to the core of the problems of political hate speech by calling me violent. Bravo
The consequences of not letting someone speak is that they don't end up speaking. 
So the answer's exactly what I thought it'd be: no idea. Good to know.

And you're terrible at covering up your biases, my man. You can't include the ID of a single attacker, and just happen to also mention that this attacker is 'Antifa', without mentioning all the other attackers. Yeah, 31 people may have been injured. That says nothing about the culprits, and nothing about the supposed danger to students (students specifically) presented by antifa.
>you can't be against the spread of fascism AND for supporting homeless students!!
Sam Hyde would've been funny, JBP would've been awoken master status
i hope you entertain my genuine curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHPfAtPiXXs
what is your opinion on the speaker and the content of his talk?
What is your opinion regarding 

+ punching nazis
+ punching out of that one nazi wearing dude in Seattle two days ago
+ antifa riots to stop speakers at Berkeley
+ antifa
+ charges against Yvette Felarca for assault and inciting a riot
+ charges against Eric Clanton for assault with a deadly weapon

Have you ever donated to antifa or bamn?
The chancellor and several faculty members discuss free speech and answer the question of why those ""hate-spewing imbeciles"" are being given a public stage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QVcYpuLrXg
Yes, that's an obvious immediate consequence. And then what? Do you think the speaker and their supporters will be happy? What do you think other people who aren't supporters will think? Would society as a whole believe that their right to open speech is strengthened or weakened after seeing that some people aren't being allowed to speak?
[deleted]
So when you choose to support violence against BCR, which forces the administration to spend money to protect them, this supposedly doesn't contradict your support for funding homeless student services.

But when BCR benefits from this protection, protection that would not be necessary if people like you didn't threaten them with violence, you absolve yourself of any involvement and accuse BCR of being the source of the expenditure.

The lack of self-awareness is appalling.
I don't get the fascination with Hyde. I swear I've never seen a funny thing he's done, but everyone swears up and down the block he's funny. What gives?
It's inoffensively bland imo. Yeah, it's true that the dominant strain of Islam in the ME has a lot of problems. But he's not really providing any new idea for why that is, no material analysis of why that cleric said that about numbers. And he's, more or less, describing scientific advancement as quantifiable by Nobel Prizes-- which is just silly. It's what I expected: a physicist speaking out of field. Nothing more, nothing less.
What NDG is saying can't be compared to Milo or Ann Coulter.  NDG brought attention to the scientific contributions Islam contributed in the past, and expresses a hope that Islam will do so in the future.   NDG isn't expressing hate at Muslims.  He isn't saying Islam is fundamentally evil and will bring down western civilization.  NDG isn't conflating ISIS with the average Muslim.  
1) Great!

2) Great! He also was reported by the police to have been threatening others.

3) Sometimes justifiable.

4) Great when they're stopping fascists!

5) Inciting a riot is a BS charge, but she was caught committing assault. Dunno if it was self-defense or not. Do know it was a Nazi, but that doesn't necessarily invalidate the charge.

6) Sounds like he may have committed it. Glad nobody died, assuming the guy he hit was indeed not a Nazi.

7) lol that's not how those groups operate. And no, but I was arrested for protesting, and antifascists who I'd never met before offered me help, picked me up, brought me tea, and were the nicest ones involved at any stage in the process. They're just normal people.
Their supporters can make a fuss, but this campus should be a safe space for its students. Trans people should *not* have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate, undocumented immigrants should have to face the threat of being uprooted and sent back across the border in their own community just as Jewish people should not have to watch a person stand up on a stage and tell them they should be gassed for who they are. People don't become xenophobes just because xenophobes are denied a platform to spread their views. Rather, existing people on the far-right become more vocal. This is a matter of protecting members of our community against hate-speech.
[deleted]
there's no accountin for taste I guess
in terms of the list you wrote, milo horowitz gellar bannon and coulter, could you rate worst to the least worst?
i understand what you mean and agree with you. i was just trying to pick his brains and understand his perspective on things thats all, thus as i mentioned, my genuine curiosity.
It cracks me up every time. Conservatives are shocked and amazed when people show up to protest and demonstrate, with no bribes involved. Just passion and ethics.

I guess they're so used to that easy Mercer, Koch & YAF moolah subsidizing their ""protests"" that they assume everyone else has to be on the take.
So you're fine with

+ punching people
+ riots

You say you'd be glad had Clanton killed a Nazi.

You've seen the video of Felarca assaulting people and are claiming it may have been self-defense.

Lulz, okay, you're not violent, no not at all, I've got you completely wrong on that.
There's several points in your comment I want to address:
1) ""Campus should be a safe space for its students""

Yes, true. That is why during such events, the school has been spending tons of money in order to ensure that it is safe for students. Students are told well in advance the dates and times of these events and know very well of the possibility of violence. They can easily avoid getting hurt by staying indoors.

2) ""Trans people should not have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate, undocumented immigrants should have to face the threat of being uprooted and sent back across the border in their own community just as Jewish people should not have to watch a person stand up on a stage and tell them they should be gassed for who they are.""

True; in an ideal society, everyone would always be happy 100% of the time. There would be no conflict between people, implying that no one would have differing ideas. Then, everyone would be exactly the same. This is not the world we live in. Everyone is different, and everyone has different ideas. This is why we require freedom of speech: to give everyone the opportunity to express different ideas. Therefore, you cannot stop someone from organizing an event to give a speech, because you don't know what they're going to say. You can take action AFTER something harmful happens, but beforehand people have the right to plan to give speeches. 
This is exactly what the problem is -- people are trying to silence the speakers before they are even given opportunity to speak. This is censorship and a clear violation of freedom of speech, which is not allowed in our democracy. This is why Berkeley and the issue of free speech is all over the media and why those who do not understand the details of what's happening think that the left is becoming intolerant of freedom of speech and differing ideas.

Trans people SHOULD confront the idea that their sense of identity may be illegitimate, because then they can critically analyze why they do not agree with that idea, form a strong argument for why they believe in a different view, and then educate others on why they hold this view.
Undocumented immigrants SHOULD have to face the threat of being uprooted and sent back across the border in their own community; without ever realizing this threat, what would motivate them to fight for equal rights and fight to be recognized as capable humans deserving to stay in the country?
Jewish people should not have to watch a person stand up on a stage and tell them they should be gassed for who they are; obviously, and they have a choice not to attend such an event. Fortunately, the majority of people aren't terrible people and now realize what a tragedy the Holocaust was. Such an event would not attract supporters today.

3) ""This is a matter of protecting members of our community against hate-speech.""

Again, this is where the problem is. Open discussion of ideas is absolutely vital in a democracy. If some ideas are not even given the opportunity to be expressed, then what makes your ideas allowed? Just because you believe they're right and ""good""?

The way to address ""hate speech"" and the likes is to 1) ALLOW it, 2) DISAGREE with it, and 3) EDUCATE others on why you believe it is wrong. If the speech turns out to be more than just speech and is affecting things like your ability to succeed in your job and workplace, take legal action. Otherwise, remember that the majority of people aren't heartless trolls and actually have basic morals and empathy. Therefore, letting people express shitty ideas that most people don't even agree with to begin with and won't actually affect anyone's lives outside of their speech is the best (and only) solution. It is also the one required by law. Otherwise, our democracy will turn into an authoritarian dictatorship.
Also a notorious spree killer. He can't keep getting away with it!!!
I honestly don't judge in negatives. Bannon's the only one with any value, since he's actually been in power. But the rest are just laughable nobodies, only with a big following.
It seems like most of their talking points are projection. Racists have a hard time believing leftists could be against racism; people who are bribed have a hard time imagining altruism; etc. It's pretty pathetic
I support people stopping Nazis, yes. It's more concerning that you don't...

And I didn't say that.

And yes, like a good American, I do believe that evidence contrary to the current evidence may preserve one's innocence. Again. More concerning that you don't...
>Yes, true. That is why during such events, the school has been spending tons of money in order to ensure that it is safe for students. Students are told well in advance the dates and times of these events and know very well of the possibility of violence. They can easily avoid getting hurt by staying indoors.

You're deliberately misinterpreting what I'm trying to say. Violence according to the WHO is ""the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation."" Violence can be institutional in nature and not restricted to the direct use of force. Hate-speech is threatening speech that can lead to mental health issues and trauma. Mental health is just as important as physical health and mental health issues can be life threatening in nature.

>This is not the world we live in.

But we can and should make it so. We have power as a collective. The power to stamp out hate and we should start at home.

>This is censorship and a clear violation of freedom of speech, which is not allowed in our democracy.

First of all, the law does not dictate what is ethical nor what is right for a community. The law is outdated and myopic.

Secondly, Creating a threatening environment drowns out other voices. Certain forms of speech can infringe upon other forms of speech. For example holocaust denial drowns out Jewish voices. Imagine you're a Jew and you have a coworker who constantly engages in holocaust denial, what kind of environment does this create for you? Now imagine you appeal to your boss, who responds that your coworker has an inalienable right to free-speech and that a hostile work environment is an unfortunate consequence of this. In such a situation you would either react emotionally, come to work with a persistent sense of fear and anxiety or quit your job. Normalizing hate-speech has a silencing effect on its victims. We have to pick sides, do we defend the speech of the oppressed, or the oppressor?

Thirdly, hate speech isn't free speech. It is threatening and almost always leads to mental trauma for those it is directed against. It falls under the WHO definition of violence. When we confront speech-speech we are merely acting in self defense.

>without ever realizing this threat, what would motivate them to fight for equal rights and fight to be recognized as capable humans deserving to stay in the country

Wow, okay. I'll have you know that trans people face discrimination and judgement in their everyday lives. They have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate all the time. The same can be said for undocumented folks who live in fear of being deported. They should *not* have to face a speaker in their own university deriding them from an elevated platform. It isn't a discussion, it isn't a learning experience. Anti-trans ideas have been scientifically and logically debunked. Tearing apart undocumented families is ethically repugnant. In the same vein Muslims should not be told that they're all savages and that their families deserve to be bombed in the Middle East. How is this so different from the persecution Jews once faced? Why is holocaust denial not okay, but xenophobia against other minorities perfectly fine?

> Open discussion of ideas is absolutely vital in a democracy. 

Open discussion of hateful ideas that have been debunked is not conducive social progress. If a student group invited a Jihadist to speak, should we let them spread their ideology?

>If some ideas are not even given the opportunity to be expressed, then what makes your ideas allowed?

The fact that my ideas don't discriminate against minorities over factors that they have **no control** over. Hate-speech has a very specific definition. ""Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.""

>Otherwise, remember that the majority of people aren't heartless trolls and actually have basic morals and empathy. 

You don't seen to have any morals or empathy given what you just wrote. Nice diatribe on how trans people should have to confront the issues that drive many of them to suicide on a daily basis (spoken from a platform of blind hatred, context matters). You seem like a great human being. 

cant disagree with you there. thanks for your time
>And I didn't say that.

>>  Glad nobody died, assuming the guy he hit was indeed not a Nazi.

That's explicitly what you said.

I believe in stopping Nazis, but I don't believe in thought crime or speech crime.

You believe bad words justify mob violence and vigilantism.

You believe you can watch a video taken from start to end showing an unwarranted assault on a person holding a flag and say ""maybe there is a context that justifies that"" and then turn around and say to others ""you don't believe in evidence!""

You believe in violence.   
You believe in mob violence.  
You believe in vigilantism.  
You don't believe in due process.  

You believe you are not violent and that you are a good person.


>You're deliberately misinterpreting what I'm trying to say. Violence according to the WHO is ""the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation."" Violence can be institutional in nature and not restricted to the direct use of force. Hate-speech is threatening speech that can lead to mental health issues and traumas. Mental health is just as important as physical health and mental health issues can be life threatening in nature.

I was not ""deliberately misinterpreting"" what you said; your phrase ""safe space"" was vague and I understood it as physical safety. However, if we also take into account mental safety, the university has also been spending tons of money to provide counseling and other forms of psychological help for anyone who needs it. And let's be honest: how much mental harm can a troll (who again I will emphasize that most people think is ridiculous, especially at an openly liberal university where liberal thought dominates) have on a person after speaking at a university for a few hours? No one is forcing anyone to attend the speech. If the speaker says something ridiculous, this will actually HARM their reputation and hurt their cause more than help it. However, again I want to say (because you didn't address this point at all) that if you can stop one person from speaking, then NO ONE has the right to speak. This is the critical point. It does not matter whether you agree with the speech or not, but the right to express ideas is the fundamental basis of a democracy. Without this right, it would NOT be a democracy. Our society would NOT value equal rights for ALL people.

>>This is not the world we live in.
>But we can and should make it so. We have power as a collective. The power to stamp out hate and we should start at home.

When I said that ""this is not the world we live in,"" I mean it literally. Everyone is different. It is IMPOSSIBLE for everyone to be exactly the same. Because of this 100% guaranteed fact, there will ALWAYS be conflict of interest between different people, because everyone's needs and values are different.

And back to your comment, that is definitely true. But, stamping out hate DOES NOT equal silencing people. Refer to all of my previous comments for why.

>First of all, the law does not dictate what is ethical nor what is right for a community. The law is outdated and myopic.

Yes, it does. That is the exact purpose of the law--to determine what is right and wrong, specifically because of the point I mentioned earlier: everyone is different, and there always is conflict of interest, so the law is there to regulate this conflict. The law is NOT outdated or myopic; the law is constantly changing to fit the needs of a constantly changing society. If you find fault with the law, you should work to change it.

>Secondly, Creating a threatening environment drowns out other voices. Certain forms of speech can infringe upon other forms of speech. For example holocaust denial drowns out Jewish voices. Imagine you're a Jew and you have a coworker who constantly engages in holocaust denial, what kind of environment does this create for you? Now imagine you appeal to your boss, who responds that your coworker has an inalienable right to free-speech and that a hostile work environment is an unfortunate consequence of this. In such a situation you would either react emotionally, come to work with a persistent sense of fear and anxiety or quit your job. Normalizing hate-speech has a silencing effect on its victims. We have to pick sides, do we defend the speech of the oppressed, or the oppressor?

Creating a threatening environment does NOT drown out other voices. 1) Letting a speaker talk to a crowd of people who voluntarily show up to hear the speech is not ""creating a threatening environment"" for anyone who is not at the speech. 2) Because of 1), your example about workplace harassment is NOT equivalent to an event with voluntary participation (which again is frowned upon by the majority of people). 3) No one is normalizing hate speech. Allowing someone to talk is NOT normalizing hate speech: it is allowing someone to exercise their freedom of speech. The actions taken after the speech would determine whether anyone is normalizing the speech. 4) Stopping people from giving speeches is by far the easiest way to ""drown out"" voices.

>Thirdly, hate speech isn't free speech. It is threatening and almost always leads to mental trauma for those it is directed against. It falls under the WHO definition of violence. When we confront speech-speech we are merely acting in self defense.

Of course. But are the speakers who are invited to talk saying ""I will give a talk on why I hate ____ people and why these people should not exist""? Or are they saying that they'd like to facilitate open discussion of conservative ideas?

>Wow, okay. I'll have you know that trans people face discrimination and judgement in their everyday lives. They have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate all the time. The same can be said for undocumented folks who live in fear of being deported. They should not have to face a speaker in their own university deriding them from an elevated platform.

They do not have to face the speaker. They have a choice to intentionally ignore people who aren't government officials and have no true power over them, and fight back if they choose. No one is forcing them to listen. The university is not telling them that they are illegitimate by allowing people with other opinions speak. And the university cannot stop people from speaking, because again, we have something called freedom of speech in our society that is powerful and necessary.

>Tearing apart undocumented families is ethically repugnant. In the same vein Muslims should not be told that they're all savages and that their families deserve to be bombed in the Middle East. How is this so different from the persecution Jews once faced? Why is holocaust denial not okay, but xenophobia against other minorities perfectly fine?

Please...allowing someone who can be actively ignored speak at a college does not tear apart families.

>Why is holocaust denial not okay, but xenophobia against other minorities perfectly fine?

Neither are okay. Now, you're ""deliberately misinterpreting"" what I'm saying...

>""Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.""

Ben Shapiro's last speech was ""Say No to Campus Thuggery."" Have the other speakers explicitly stated that they will be promoting ""hate speech"" at the university? If not, then the university must allow them to speak.

>You don't seen to have any morals or empathy given what you just wrote. Nice diatribe on how trans people should have to confront the issues that drive many of them to suicide on a daily basis (spoken from a platform of blind hatred, context matters). You seem like a great human being.

Attacking my character I see...very mature of you. I just wanted to educate everyone on Reddit and help my fellow bears. And twisting my words out of context...exactly what you were accusing me of doing to you (even though I did not). 

It's a FACT that trans people need to address their identity in our society today, and a FACT that any other minority needs to do the same, because they have no other choice. Because at any given time, a society values certain things over other things, meaning no matter what, some people are going to feel worse than others. This is a fact that has always been true and will always be true because of the point I mentioned earlier that everyone is different. However, people can fight back and need to fight back for what they stand for.

If we're going to compare empathy levels, I'd say I have more than you... have you deeply analyzed what's going on, or are you just following the crowd of mass hysteria, labelling certain people as ""good"" and ""bad,"" and taking the radical stance to completely stop people from exercising their rights just because you believe they're ""bad""? Are you being empathetic to everyone or only to select people you personally agree with? Have you even listened to some of the speakers before? Are you actually thinking about the consequences of stopping people from speaking?

And actually, I'm a minority in every sense of the word, if we're going to be personal about this. I have my own struggles that I face on a daily basis. But I don't have to go to events that I don't agree with. I don't have to listen to people who don't have power over me and my life. I don't have to let trolls weaken me. I let them play their games and watch them lose because they won't get far with such actions. Not because it's the easy thing to do, but because it's the smart thing to do.
What are the pros of letting someone talk? 1) It's the law 2) Media doesn't portray the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals as intolerant of other ideas 3) The reputation of the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals improves 4) Because the reputation is good, other people may actually consider adopting liberal views 5) More people have liberal views, leading to a better country 

Cons: 1) Some people may temporarily feel offended; however, the university is going above and beyond in direct emails to students and staff about support services to address this 2) We spend a lot of money on protection of speaker and students against Antifa

What happens if we do not let someone talk? 1) Media portrays the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals as intolerant of other ideas 3) The reputation of the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals suffers 4) Because the reputation is worse, other people avoid adopting liberal views 5) Fewer people have liberal views, leading to a country that panders even more to the majority versus the minority 6) Legal action will definitely be taken against the university, resulting in even more resources spent on this issue instead of simply letting people talk to begin with
nothing against you but  i dont think its that surprising to find people who believe nazis should be punched.
if you were on the street one day and see person B walking up to person A and harasses him, disses his mom and what not. would any of us be shocked if B got punched? not to mention the law would be lenient towards the person who threw the punch in that case. now consider the ideology of nazi and what they've done. to embrace that atrocity and wear it proudly in public its quite disgusting. i wont punch but if i saw someone do it i wouldnt say i didnt see it coming.
>However, if we also take into account mental safety, the university has also been spending tons of money to provide counseling and other forms of psychological help for anyone who needs it.

Providing psychological care to someone who's mental health you're damaging through your acceptance of hate-speech is analogous to providing first aid to someone you've just punched in the face. Don't do it in the first place.

>And let's be honest: how much mental harm can a troll (who again I will emphasize that most people think is ridiculous, especially at an openly liberal university where liberal thought dominates) have on a person after speaking at a university for a few hours?

This is your inability to relate to the struggles of trans people, undocumented folk and Muslims. If you were insecure about your sense of identity, if you were faced with the threat of being deported everyday, if your people were being bombed in the Middle East, you'd think differently regarding your university providing an open platform to those who would disenfranchise and imprison you. It creates a hostile environment. 

It isn't simply being exposed to the ideas that harms people, its knowing that your university and your peers and your community don't care about safety and that when people attack you, they're not going to stand up for your interests. We don't want to send that message to the oppressed.

>Without this right, it would NOT be a democracy. Our society would NOT value equal rights for ALL people.

This is false. Countries like Germany and France have limits on hate-speech because it is a detriment to a safe civil societies. Certain ideas can be violent and have no place in an inclusive society. This isn't about democracy, this is about self-defense.

>Creating a threatening environment does NOT drown out other voices.

Are you seriously telling me that a room full of holocaust deniers isn't going to drown out Jewish voices? Or that a room full of trans people aren't going to drown out trans voices? Giving Islamophobes an open platform sets a precedent for a hostile environment against Muslims. Knowing that your university allows people to go on stage and call you a savage on account of who you are, will drive out Muslims from the community or at least cause them undue anxiety. 

>Stopping people from giving speeches is by far the easiest way to ""drown out"" voices.

Hate speech isn't free speech.

>But are the speakers who are invited to talk saying ""I will give a talk on why I hate ____ people and why these people should not exist""?

This is *exactly* what the speakers are doing. Have you ever watched a MILO video or are you just here to LARP?

>Please...allowing someone who can be actively ignored speak at a college does not tear apart families.

This is deliberately taken out of context. I'm talking about the idea that families should be torn apart. This idea is ethically repugnant and shouldn't be provided a platform. The same can be said for holocaust denial.

>Ben Shapiro's last speech was ""Say No to Campus Thuggery."" Have the other speakers explicitly stated that they will be promoting ""hate speech"" at the university? If not, then the university must allow them to speak.

Have you seen the schedule? There's a whole day dedicated to why Muslims should be excluded from society, again you don't seem to know the facts.

>Because at any given time, a society values certain things over other things, meaning no matter what, some people are going to feel worse than others.

I'm making it clear that nobody should be made to feel bad about something they have no control over. Its an ethical principle. Oppression is not inevitable, it is a product of society and we should fight against it.




Hate-speech can lead to serious emotional trauma. Speech doesn't take place in a vacuum, some voices suppress others and we have a responsibility to stand by the voices of trans, undocumented and black and brown students. A jewish person should not have to intellectually debate a Nazi on whether or not they should be gassed. A black person should not have to defend the idea that they're not a different specie. A trans person should not have to validate their existence. An undocumented individual shouldn't have to argue that their life is that just as important as the life of someone born in America. Mental health is a real issue and the claim that speech cannot be violent ignores its importance. On a campus with a history of trivializing mental health concerns, this comes as no surprise. Hate-speech regardless of its rationale, is highly damaging to individuals. In this context, **shutting down hate-speech is merely self-defense.**

Free speech is in-principle, **logically incoherent**, which is exemplified by Karl Poppers Paradox of tolerance. Imagine a society where the state enforces free speech, now imagine a group that explicitly opposes free speech poses a real threat to the status quo without the use of violence; the state now has two options, to allow itself to be dismantled, which would end ""free speech"" or to restrict free speech. In Popper words:

>Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.

Rawls too, pointed out that a society must preserve itself in the face of intolerant, hateful views like the ones that will be provided with a platform here at Berkeley:

>While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.

You might be surprised to find that speech is already curtailed in the US, **the principle is already compromised**—it does not exist. There are laws related to “obscenity, incitement to violence, copyright infringement, press censorship during wartime, whistleblowing” and “restrictions for the incarcerated.” Hate speech is as damaging as many of the items I've listed. Again, this is a matter of self-defense. 
> not to mention the law would be lenient towards the person who threw the punch in that case.

Maybe but probably not.   
*the Supreme Court has effectively limited the exception to only include abusive language, exchanged face to face, which would likely provoke a violent reaction.*

It is, but it is probably not a ""fighting word"".


>  i dont think its that surprising to find people who believe nazis should be punched.
Would you say the same thing about people walking around campus espousing

+ pro-Communist beliefs?
+ pro-Israel support?
+ pro-Palestinian support?
+ anti-feminist support?
+ anti-vax support?
the law looks through the lens of a utilitarian. i have no arguments with regards to fighting words however the extent to how much of a law is enforced is very subjective. 
many things can be analyzed with relativity. in a bell curve of horrid ideas with atrocities written in probably every modern history text book in the world, i would think the nazi ideology and what it represents sits pretty far up the bell curve compared to that list wouldnt you agree? just like you wouldnt react the same way between an ant bite and a shark attack.
I'd say speech is speech and speech is different than actions and behaviors.

I'd say a small group of assholes going to Nazi rallies and deplored by all is much less a danger to society than antifa which as you can see in this thread enjoys popular support and is a radically undemocratic organization, eager to assault people to within an inch of their lives and engage in rioting.

And communists in the US? Communists have killed anywhere from 20 million people to 100 million people https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes

Compared to the nazis that we are encouraged to punch, the communist threat to humanity is so great clearly it justifies punching people who pass out or wear communist propaganda.

Punch those guys with the Che t shirts on for instance.
i do not disagree that the antifa is a problem. i think they are a bigger active threat than white supremacist currently. i dont disagree with you one bit on that.
however with regards to communism there are many differences in those instances. some of my ancestors were executed by the communists. ive heard many tales about it. however we have to acknowledge that there was a civil war going on. before communism in china or russia there were emperors and tzars. if you were a threat they killed your entire family and punished anyone even remotely related to you. that was to prevent future generations from plotting revenge against royalty. the nationalist party executed communists as well. the difference in that case was that the communists won the war or it would have been the other way around. the same with regards to russia.

now most killings during communism's rise was to attain or maintain control/power. the nazis killed jews after they were in control. you think the communists in china or russia or anywhere else in the world would be let off so easily if they lost their respective wars? if communism lost, today we would be talking about how capitalism and democracy killed tens of millions. now put that in the context of the nazis killing jews. i just dont see how its an apples to apples comparison
I'm not aware the killings in communist countries stopped when the government takeover was complete.
""or maintain control/power."""
