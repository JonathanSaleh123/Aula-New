class curving?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5icgmi/class_curving/,2016-12-14 11:04:31,Got a 94% in Public Health 142 Biostats with Steve Selvin and my grade got curved down to an A-. Is this common or rare for most classes here at Cal? ,"Curving down (on the absolute scale) is pretty uncommon.

Wow, that's harsh.  
It's more common for a 70% to get curved up to a B+ than for anything to get curved down
It depends on the major, perhaps. Haas, as someone mentioned, has to have a class mean of 3.2-3.4. So if it's an easy class and everyone does really well, grades can be curved down. Some teachers at Haas make it harder than necessary just to get a better grade distribution so people are curved up, not down.
My experience is that 90-100 no longer means A, etc. things are all pretty much graded on a relative scale. This is the case for all lower div math classes I'm positive 
That is interesting.Maybe it is because Steve Selvin is known to be the easy professor for 142? He is no longer going to be able to teach this course anymore because he is known to be ""easy"" and the PH department wants to standardize the teaching of all required classes every year now. "
