ESPM50AC Difficulty,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cz9soo/espm50ac_difficulty/,2019-09-03 12:45:53,I'm taking ESPM50AC with Ken Worthy this semester and I want to know if I actually have to do the readings because it's a lot of reading. I heard about other professors being easy but there isn't much about him specifically on this subreddit.,"Shouldnâ€™t be too bad but other classes are prob easier.
ez money, just like read the slides and maybe skim the readings cuz they hella long
I took it with Worthy and got an easy A from skimming the readings. Pay attention to what you're reading, but no need for heavy annotation/memorization/multiple reads."
