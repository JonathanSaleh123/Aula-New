Has anyone taken Econ100A with Scott Carson during the Summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hihm3a/has_anyone_taken_econ100a_with_scott_carson/,2020-06-29 23:10:35,"Hello, just wanted to ask if anyone has taken this class. I am curious about the exams. I heard it is purely based off of the lectures and that it is half memorization and half analytical. Does this mean that I dont need to study through the psets? A lot of Ratemyprofessor reviews are just saying study the notes. I would like some input and thank you in advance!","I took his class 2 summers ago. I would agree with the people on Ratemyprofessor, if you read through the notes a couple of times you’ll be absolutely set for the test. Looking at problem sets doesn’t hurt, but the test is essentially just recalling the notes. He goes over everything he tests on in lecture almost exactly. If you were to spend your time on anything it should be reading through the notes, memorizing key words he told you to write down, and understanding equations and graphs

He's been teaching the same way every summer for over 10-20 years. There's not much to worry about.
So discussion materials and psets are not really tested?
When is your exam ?
I would read over discussion materials, but from what I remember psets just reinforced what was taught in lecture

Scott tends to always run a bit behind. In curious to see how the test is going to be considering everything has moved online. Has he talked about how he's going to deal with the curves?
[deleted]
This is consistent with his classes in the past. He only curves up if significant amount of people do poorly on the exam. I doubt proctoring is possible given the fact that many students don't even live in the same timezone.

Yes he meant short answers, no multiple choice.

Hi I was in his labor econ class, but I had friends who took his 100A. All of his classes are pretty similar. Do expect time crunch especially now that everything has moved online."
Has anyone taken Econ 100A in the summer with Scott Carson?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cawbwo/has_anyone_taken_econ_100a_in_the_summer_with/,2019-07-08 22:07:30,"I’m currently in his class and I have no clue what his midterms are like. If anyone has taken 100A with him before and has some insight, that’d be great!","For the most part they're very formulaic, mechanical, and straightforward. Regurgitate problem set problems and whiteboard demonstrations and you're fine. IIRC there are a few short responses? I forget, it's been a few years.
pretty much this to get a free A: go to his lecture, listen, and take notes. most of what he says/what is on homework is regurgitated. took him for 140 as well and all of his classes are pretty much the same exam format."
Econ majors – how is Scott Carson as a professor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/b7yjgp/econ_majors_how_is_scott_carson_as_a_professor/,2019-03-31 23:39:18,"Still deciding whether or not I should take his Econ 100A class in the summer. Also, if anyone took an Econ course in the summer, how was it (in terms of pace, grading, etc.)?",bump
Econ 151,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g9ukn6/econ_151/,2020-04-28 13:11:04,Can anybody provide insight on the workload and difficulty of Econ 151 over the summer with Scott Carson?,"Also taking 151 would like to know!
hey, just saw this and wanted to ask how the class was??"
Summer 61B vs Econ 136 With Internship,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gkwvws/summer_61b_vs_econ_136_with_internship/,2020-05-16 08:52:56,"I'm uncertain about what class I should take over summer. I will be doing a breadth course for session A; however, I'm not sure whether I should take 61B or 136 for session C. I will also be doing a (virtual) internship over summer given the corona virus situation. I want to do 61B because it's the last class I need to declare the DS double major. However, I'm uncertain about the workload for 61B over the summer given that I am going to be doing an internship at the same time. I am also really intrigued about 136 during the summer because I've heard good things about the professor (Scott Carson) and the grade distribution for 136 during summer is pretty high compared to a regular semester. I also feel like generally speaking 136 would probably be less intense than 61B. Whichever class I don't end up doing during summer i would highly likely be taking it this fall. Any advise or input / personal experiences ?

Edit: the internship is not software engineering","What kind of internship are you doing? 61bl is lab-base, meaning you code all day ~4 day a week working on labs and projects. You might feel burned out if your internship in programming intensive as well.
You'd be better off taking Econ 136 since 61B with Hug is a great experience.
It's not a software engineering internship. It's more business oriented. Its an advisory internship
What are Hug projects like in comparison to Hilfinger's because I know his are brutal
I'd think you can do 61bl if you're familiar with java and some data structures, or you can learn them ahead. I'd estimate the workload to be ~4 hr a day on average for labs and reading, if there's no project that week. Add another 2-3 hr if you have a project that week.
Hug's projects are smaller and easier but exams are harsher. You will probably get a better grade with Hilfinger but have a better overall experience with Hug + Hug is one of the best and most wholesome professors at Cal
Do you know how 61bl compares to Hilfinger's 61b ?
They only have lecture once a week. You learn most of the material from doing lab everyday instead of lecture. Projects are some combination of Hug's and Hilfinger's projects."
