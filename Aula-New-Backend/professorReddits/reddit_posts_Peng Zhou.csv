Has anyone taken a class with Peng Zhou for math 104? How was his class and teaching like?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/krz8ct/has_anyone_taken_a_class_with_peng_zhou_for_math/,2021-01-06 14:46:56,,"I had a different class with Peng (Math 214).  His homeworks took a while but were very good for learning, our final was a take-home but it was brutally difficult (might just be because it was a grad class).

I really liked his teaching style, he was very organized and had a good setup for online learning (writing notes on an ipad).  He was always very open to questions and spent a lot of time available to help us understand the material.

Overall I think he's a great professor and I found him to be quite kind, but also on the tougher side when it comes to work.  He was gracious with accomodating when things got too tough and a deadline or two had to be pushed back, but he would get just a little frustrated with it too.  Even so I think it was manageable and I learned a ton.
Glad to hear that! What about his grading?
Homeworks were graded by a GSI so I don't know, that might not be representative.  But the homeworks were graded very harshly for most of the class (less so later).

Peng graded my final exam was graded quite leniently, and gave good feedback.  But that may have just been because it was so difficult haha."
"Which Professor would you guys pick for math 54, Vera Serganova, or Lin Lin?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vhyqh4/which_professor_would_you_guys_pick_for_math_54/,2022-06-21 23:47:02,"I'm trying to pick the better professor for this upcoming Fall, I was wondering about your guys' experience with these two professors. 

Worst comes to worst, if they are both awful, do you guys recommend just taking Honors Linear Algebra with Peng Zhou? Thanks in advance","Math 91 David Nadler, the newest linear algebra class, this is the classes just added this semester and it is an acceptable alternative to Data Science Major Requirement for Math 54, Nadler is by far the goat of mathdepartment (second to Paulin).
I'm wondering the same as well. Currently enrolled in Serganova but having second thoughts...
This class will not fulfill the CS requirement."
Math 104 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n04b51/math_104_professors/,2021-04-27 18:59:39,"Hii

I was wondering which professor I should take Math 104 with. Has anyone taken this class with either Professor Ryan Hass or Professor Peng Zhou? Are their exams hard?

&#x200B;

Thank You!!","Hass is considered phenomenal for 104 by everyone I've spoken about him with. Peng Zhou can be a bit rushed/disorganized. All of this is anecdotal however, as I have only heard from friends.
Don’t take it with a prof that teaches out of Ross, that book is ass
I'm currently in a class that uses Ross and I'm finding it perfectly satisfactory. It's definitely more accessible than say, Rudin, but it still covers everything important to a reasonable degree. Most professors use Ross for that reason.
Ross hardly covers any topology. It might seem satisfactory in the moment but in hindsight it really isn’t good enough for a class like 202a"
Math 104 instructors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jf2zvn/math_104_instructors/,2020-10-20 18:05:24,"Sup everyone, Im looking for a good professor for real analysis next semester, but there are a lot of choices:

Mariusz Wodzicki

Yu-Wei Fan
	
Koji Shimizu 

Peng Zhou

Dmitry Vaintrob

Ian Charlesworth

Which one should I go with?","Definitely not Wodzicki. Heard good things about Yu-Wei Fan. One of my friends who took it with Shimizu said it was the worst thing he’d ever done
I’m taking it with Vaintrob rn. He’s a good guy but his lectures are not great, they’re all over the place and he is constantly making errors and correcting himself. It seems like he doesn’t prep for the lessons at all and his notation is totally inconsistent. He has also taken over a month to grade our midterms in a class of 25
Really?  Everyone I know absolutely loves Shimizu.
Ahh maybe you’re right. Math 104 is just ass no matter who you’re taking it with, I’m in it rn"
