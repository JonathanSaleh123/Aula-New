Does Nathan Lowhorn teach PHY8B during the spring?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/o21nus/does_nathan_lowhorn_teach_phy8b_during_the_spring/,2021-06-17 09:44:43,"Looking to plan out my schedule. If he doesn't, does anyone know what semesters he teaches this course?","The physics department does not schedule that far in advance. They often don't decide course staff until after phase 1.
I took 8B with Lowhorn in Spring 2020 so it's definitely possible that he'll teach it in the spring again. But like the other commenter said, I don't think they officially assign course staff that far in advance"
physics 8b professor advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dqxo48/physics_8b_professor_advice/,2019-11-03 01:25:48,hello! i was hoping for some advice for which professor to choose for physics 8b since physics makes me Scared ™ - the options are Nathan Lowhorn and Achilles Speliotopoulos! thanks :),"lowhorn is really good so I would go with him!
I loved Lowhorn. He genuinely cares about his students and you can tell he loves his job. His exams were fair and reflected what we did in lectures!

Haha of course! And oh man when I was in his class it was course captured and nobody came to lecture so you might be good skipping a few 8ams 8)
I mean I enrolled and dont see it so

Does lowhorn take attendance? Jw lol
i’m not quite sure why you can’t see them then - even when you go on classes.berkeley.edu the professors are listed there
No but he’d get really sad or make jokes about people not coming ):"
