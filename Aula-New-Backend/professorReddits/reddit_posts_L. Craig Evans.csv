Colleges at Berkeley: Battle Royale,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gyr4g7/colleges_at_berkeley_battle_royale/,2020-06-07 20:32:50,"Listen up incoming freshman: when everyone picks their college at Berkeley, nobody cares about the international ranking of the programs in the college, the average pee-pee size, or how many dollars the average student steals from their parents to create a stupid startup. When it comes to ranking the colleges at Berkeley, the only thing anyone with over 40iq (which excludes all EECS students) cares about is which college’s representatives would win in a battle royale if they were all dropped in bumfuck nowhere (examples: Palo Alto or Los Angeles). 

**#6: Haas**

Let’s be honest with ourselves for a second: has anyone in Haas actually been outside before? True, many of them go glamping using the internship money they get for being water girls and boys at washed up Fortune 500’s, but other than snakes they’re terrified of all living things. Haas kids wouldn’t survive in the wild for two minutes without leeching off the others, but since they provide nothing of tangible value the other colleges would simply allow for the invisible hand to actually do it’s job (for once).  

**#5: College of Engineering**

The College of Engineering is filled with big-brained individuals who played with too many legos and not enough lincoln logs as children. Instead of building bows and arrows and searching for food, they would instead build a trebuchet in an attempt to yeet the other colleges without getting their hands dirty. However, the trebuchet would miss and destroy their shelter, since their calculator would be an abacus made of nuts and sticks. Eventually the CoE students would die of anime tiddy deprivation. 

**#4: College of Environmental Design**

College of Environmental Design students spend their day wondering how to build a house that looks like an upside down turnip, before walking back across camping while pondering the many architectural marvels of Evans. In the battle royale, they would focus on re-arranging different flower patches to make them perfectly symmetrical with the landscape, neglecting the many dangers that inhabit the natural world. They would eventually be run over by Pumbaa and his many piggy friends scattered throughout the battle arena. 

**#3: College of Chemistry**

Have you ever wondered how chemistry kids relax after grinding mechanisms for eight hours? They sneak up into their chem labs, whip out some Erlenmeyer flasks, mix meth and percocet to create a whole new ‘experience,’ and then brag about how they have an entire atom named after them. In the battle royale, the CoC peeps would hide in the corner and attempt to create (air)Berkelium2, but all of their water would be consumed in the process, resulting in their imminent and not-high deaths. 

**#2: (rAuSsEr) College of Natural Resources**

The hippies that constitute most of CNR spend most of their time worshiping trees and herb. Throughout the battle, the CNR flower children would dance naked around an ancient *Carnegiea gigantea* while stuffing vegetables in their ears to ward away evil capitalist conversations, allowing the liberating smell of burning weed to dramatically enhance their ritual. Nature would protect the free spirits of CNR, allowing them to outlive the previously mentioned colleges before they would eventually overdose on shrooms. 

**#1. L&S**

L&S obviously emerges victorious in our little game of Fortnite. There are enough majors in L&S to fill every role in society: linguistic majors to talk to the animals, history majors to count tree rings, economic majors to steal money from banks and later hang, pre-med majors to grow eggplants and treat boo-boos, art majors to complain about the lack of jobs, media studies majors to vigorously tweet about the whole experience, and CS majors to play pokemon on their gameboy using their chin while rubbing their areola with one hand and using the other to stick several fingers up their bum. L&S would survive and thrive in the wilderness, before the social sciences would rise up and overthrow their society in true Berkeley style. 

So there you have it freshman. If you’re cool, you’ll go to L&S. And whatever you do, avoid Haas like you avoid the BO of students who frequent Soda hall.","Brutalitly. Take my updoot, you son of a bitch.
Oh my god the CoE one cracked me UP.
As a CNR major, you can't overdose on shrooms
I’m so proud of my old roommate for making an account on this cancerous site.
A+ post, Mr. Dino would be proud 😢

Also, eecs has tiny pee pee
As an l&s cs major.... do you have a camera in my house or something? How did you know???
I feel both honored and attacked #CNR

Just accepted my offer to CoE last week, glad to see I’ll be surrounded by my people
Damn bro, I didn't know you could major in College of Natural Resources.
happy cake day
OP has it right, the Battle Royale contestants are all undergrads.
O shit you right, I must be an idiot
Thanx m9
I think public health is like haas since we get degrees from the graduate school. had to apply to the major with few essays and resume.

Why doesn't Berkeley have its own college of computing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dhuxoc/why_doesnt_berkeley_have_its_own_college_of/,2019-10-14 11:40:33,"CS is easily the largest department at Berkeley. It is easily one of our strongest departments. MIT has it. CMU has it. UW has it. We have our own buildings, Cory, Soda, parts of Etcheverry and Evans. The admissions process is unnecessarily complicated with EECS, LSCS, GPA caps and whatnot. Why can't we simplify to a single college that will cover CS, Data Science, and whatever other majors we establish in this area in the future? We will have a direct admit for anyone who wants it, and a major admission process similar to a transfer of college process much like if you are transferring from L&S to Eng etc.","Because that's where CoE and L&S get their $. Neither willing to give it up.
It is worth noting that MIT and CMU both also have more CS faculty than we do (CMU by a staggering margin). Could be a factor
 But then we'd need to change our abbreviation for College of Chem
I wish
Why does Berkeley have L&S CS? I think it's unnecessarily complicated.

Just make the only way to do anything related to CS through EECS and cut any ties to L&S. Reinstate the transfer of college process. This effectively solves your problem.

Cut data science while you're at it too, DS majors are better off as statistics majors anyways, considering that you're gonna be a trash data scientist if you don't have an undergrad statistics level of statistical preparation (Stat 134/135 at the very least). Make DS a concentration offered through Statistics, much like how Applied Math has multiple concentrations. 

The current DS major is just watered down statistics with a CS61AB as requirements; there should be a formalized concentration instead.
They have more faculty because they have more money. If CS was in its own school it would probably also have more money
Could be something like college of computing and information
If you were going to cut either EECS or CS, why wouldn't you keep CS, cut EECS and create a separate EE major?
Exactly! None of the CS kiddos care about EE, and so we currently have a few EE enthusiasts drowning in brogrammers
Yes but move CS and DS into CoE like nearly every other university does. Then you can have CS, CE, EE, and DS either as engineering disciplines or in a college of computing.
[deleted]
I’ve been saying that for years. It’s actually a shame that the university hands out degrees that say “electrical engineering” on them to kids that only took EE16A/B. Because quite frankly, you don’t know shit about EE if you haven’t taken anything beyond those two classes.
Yeah but that’s unfair to kids who didn’t know about CS at all until they got to college.
[deleted]
It's also unfair to kids who didn't do mechanical engineering until college.

> I said in my original post that they should reinstate change of college.

This would help. But I'm not sure what's wrong with the current system other than overcrowding, which reinstating change of college wouldn't fix."
Where do students go to get their college transcript/dean’s report?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eltao0/where_do_students_go_to_get_their_college/,2020-01-08 06:20:20,Where do L&S undergraduate students go to get an official college transcript and a dean’s/college report? Do we have to meet with the academic advisor first? Do we just make an appointment for Evans Hall at the main office?,"You can actually get it printed for free in Sproul. You can show up for an appointment at Cal Student Central, which is usually <1 hr wait (unless it’s the start of the semester, in which case I’ve waited ~8 hours lmao rip)
Not sure about the Dean's/ college report, but I think you can get an official transcript sent wherever you need on calcentral.
You can buy one and have it electronically sent to you for like 2 dollars through calcentral
Is this also for the college/dean's report? Not just for the transcript?
Yes"

The Candy to Buy to Woo Your GSI,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jjdl23/the_candy_to_buy_to_woo_your_gsi/,2020-10-27 17:25:29,"What’s up depressed zoomers! Have you ever had a GSI that you were hot and spicy for, but couldn’t find a good way to get their attention? In this guide, I’ll let you know what candy to buy your GSI this holiday season to make sure they know how you feel about them. I’ve organized the GSI’s by their college to make sure your candy is appropriate and thoughtful enough to gain their interest.

&#x200B;

**L&S**

L&S has a wide variety of majors and GSI’s. Therefore, you need a “jack of all trades” type of candy that most people enjoy and come in different sub-varieties. I recommend M&Ms since they come in different shapes, colors, and flavors that reflect on the diversity of L&S. Besides, if your GSI doesn’t like peanut M&M’s, they aren’t worth acknowledging as human beings anyway!

&#x200B;

**College of Chemistry**

Chemistry GSI’s are definitely looking for interesting sensations in their mouths, since they consume weird chemicals on a daily basis. To ""get in"" with your chemistry GSI, offer to synthesize some pop rocks with them! That way, you can make candy together and have a good time afterwards. It's the perfect date: make food, talk a lot, and then eat each other's rocks at the end! If you're really into them you can also offer to make meth together (bonus points if you actually know the reactions and mechanisms already!).

&#x200B;

**College of Environmental Design**

Looking for a cute and romantic 1 on 1 activity you can do with your CED GSI? Buy a gingerbread house kit and make a house with them! You can design a house together and customize it to look either amazing or like Evans. And when you inevitably touch hands, you can giggle like an anime character, make deep eye contact, and lick some frosting off your finger before walking home alone and crying yourself to sleep before your physics midterm the next day.

&#x200B;

**College of Engineering**

If you’re looking to get in with your engineering GSI’s, go ahead and buy them some marshmallows and toothpicks. Together, you can build tons of weird shit like catapults, trebuchets, and ballista’s to fire marshmallows at each other, which is literally the most romantic thing you can do as engineering nerds. Bonus points if you manage to shoot your white cylinders into each other's mouth. NOTE: this doesn’t apply to EECS or CS; if you’re trying to woo your EECS GSI, just buy them some deodorant to try and bring the AQI in Soda Hall to below 400. 

&#x200B;

**School of Public Health**

Last time I made one of these lists, someone got mad I didn’t include the School of Public Health. Here, are you happy now? Just buy your public health GSI a fucking carrot (don’t do an eggplant, it’s too obvious and definitely exaggerates your cojones).

&#x200B;

**Haas**

While I definitely don’t recommend marrying someone for their money, if you’re into your Haas GSI then moolah is probably the only reason. Warn your GSI of your intentions by buying them some gummy snakes; preferably the ones with lots of different colors to warn them of your poisonous personality! Don’t worry; if they’re a real business woman/man, they’ll be into it as long as they can see your wallet in your pants.

&#x200B;

**College of Natural Resources**

Last, but certainly not least, we have CNR GSI’s. The GSI’s in CNR are literally the most chill individuals you’ll ever meet, which is why you should buy them some edibles if you really want to get on their good books. Most show up intoxicated to class anyway to deal with all of the stupid questions pre-med students ask (“what day is the midterm” literally on the day of the midterm smh), so free edibles will make them the happiest individuals on the planet. Offer to eat some brownies or gummies with them and then spend the day talking about their favorite plants before consoling them about how they’re underpaid for all the work they do and you appreciate how they teach their section.

&#x200B;

That’s it folks. And remember, kermit\_le\_hermit is not responsible for any adverse reactions to any candy giving, so always give away treats in a responsible fashion.","""What’s up depressed zoomers!""

Way to sum up college in one sentence.
""if you’re trying to woo your EECS GSI, just buy them some deodorant to try and bring the AQI in Soda Hall to below 400""

\-this man speaks the truth
Please rename this to:

""How to sleep with your GSI for exam questions"",

Thanks.
When your GSI has a peanut allergy: 👀
but the only gift I actually want is to see my students succeed.





(also sourpatch kids never hurt)
How do I get my GSI's address to ship it to them if I'm not on campus?
This is the kind of content we need on r/berkeley. OP, you're a hero.
M&Ms are gross, I’d like Baby Ruths or skittles instead
I bought my GSIs a pinata.

I told them to try hitting the pinata.

I was subsequently sent to the ER's ICU.
ikr! how relatable :)
ah yes deodorant, my favorite candy
Then you shouldn’t be trying to reproduce with them anyway. Weak genes.

Email from Academic Difficulty Committee,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/30f2xe/email_from_academic_difficulty_committee/,2015-03-26 14:15:13,"I got an email from L&S advising saying:

""Dear Letters and Science Student:
 
You might be an excellent student but experiencing academic difficulty this semester. Perhaps you are on academic probation, or maybe just struggling in one class.

Is this just a generic email they send everyone, or am I in some kind of trouble? My cumulative GPA is fine but I haven't been doing my best this semster... But I don't know how they could know that.","I'm a senior L&S student. I've gotten an email like that about a week before the P/NP deadline every single semester I've been here.
Fairly sure they sent this email to everyone
Did you fail one of your midterms this semester? Some professors submit midterm grades (see your Bearfacts) when they see a student is off to a rough start. 
It said right at the bottom of the email, ""this communication is meant for /u/gr191919 only. "
Want to rate this freshman's schedule pls? Going to be 20 units on Adjustment day with an upperdiv.,https://i.redd.it/v5ap8bnqwdgb1.jpg,2023-08-05 17:27:53,"So I applied for Political Science, but want to switch to the Rausser college for Environmental Economics and Policy. I took a couple community college classes already, so I'm deluding myself I can do an upper div class (GPP 115). That class is for my minor. Does anyone know if it's super hard and any options on it? 

In total I would have 20 units (just need to officially enroll in my fellow), but am thinking of dropping my bio class, the Plagues and Pandemics class at 9 a.m. I can drop my 2 unit class, it's a seminar, but it sounds interesting as Ai will be talked about. So I would want that as my fun and destress class. (Does anyone have thoughts about that class?) 
I don't want to drop out of Tagalog just in case I change my mind and want to switch to Political Economy instead.

Also, the fellowship is the NAVCAL fellowship. It sounds interesting, but does anyone have any thoughts on it please?","This doesn’t seem bad tbh. 20 units of pure technical is very different than 20 units of various humanities classes
I've taken 16 units of techs plus 4 more from a breadth classes before. It's doable, but just keep in mind that you will be grinding all the time even on weekends (studying, doing hw, reading etc). Just try to make room for eating and making friends as well since this will be your first semester. Don't be afraid to drop a class before the drop deadline if it seems like your first semester will be miserable. I've done that before sophomore year during COVID where I took 20 units of techs and I can already tell it's not going to work. 

My tip is changing it up by switching back and forth from doing work at libraries and your dorm. Maybe invite a friend to study together. 

Tldr; it's gonna be very tough but very doable. Feel free to drop a class if it doesn't seem sustainable.
I have done 20 units in my semester semester in Berkeley with 4 tech classes it was tough but doable. Make sure you only have to give 3 finals out of 5 classes.
I can't seem to find the edit button, but

*opinions   -not 'options'
The sched doesn’t look bad.  Don’t see a lot of white space in between the classes which is good. You’ll have to hustle from Dwinelle to Soda and then back to VLSB on Wednesdays. Where is your fellowship class located?

How good is your Tagalog now?  I’ll assume the class teaches pure Tagalog, which is a fair bit different than everyday conversational Taglish and modern slang.  But I’ve heard that it’s a fairly easy class.
Hmm, yeah you're right. I'm just thinking of all the writing I have to do lol. Thanks for your input!
I'll do that! Thank you 😊. I won't be in dorms as I got in the co ops, but I've seen some of the houses have like a study or quiet area so I'm hoping my co ops house has them too. 

Still not 100 percent sure I'll do 20 units, but I do want to give it a try.
For clarification, 3 finals out of 5 classes would be like my seminar and fellowship not having a final then? Like making sure not all my classes would have an exam at the end during finals week?

 In total I have 6 classes, and four of them definitely for sure have a final. Idk if my seminar would have one, and for my fellow, I know we're having a 5/6 to 10 essay page at the end. Not sure if we have to do it in one sitting during the final week or like it's an assignment I have to turn in before the final week. 

Thanks for your advice!
Haha yeah, I was looking at the buildings for my Wednesday schedule and I knew I would have to wear my running shoes on those days.

The guy who sent us the fellowship email just gave us the time, but for the location, it's ""To be decided."" So I'm hoping it's close to my Tagalog building. I used to be fluent in Bisaya (another Philippine language), but now not anymore. So my Tagalog is very minimal as well. 

Okay cool! Thanks for your feedback. I tried to make my classes not too spaced out and not after 4 p.m as I get tired in the afternoons easily even with a full night of rest.
OP you almost got it right what I mean. The 5 classes I took I only need to give 3 final exams. The rest two classes had final presentation or design project which I did on RRR week. There's no lecture on week before final only review. You should be fine with seminar and fellowship. Your language class final should not be bad. Only two finals you need to worry are MATH 16A and upper div classes. No clue about Plaque class.
It’s probably just as well that your Tagalog and is minimal.  There are quite a few words which have different meaning in Visaya (Cebuano) which can be confusing to the uninitiated. Plus there are no honorifics in Cebuano which will confuse you if you knew more."
Econ's Useless P/NP Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jraobg/econs_useless_pnp_policy/,2020-11-09 16:54:30,"Dear students intending Economics,  


Last week, you received an [email from the College of Letters and Science](https://mailchi.mp/66af932e6abd/pnp-policy-modification?e=2cda4df8dc) notifying you that students may elect the Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) grading option for major courses, including prerequisites, taken in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 (see full policy [here](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/fall-2020-and-spring-2021-policy-modifications-and-faq)). This email is to provide you with additional clarification on what this means for the **Economics major admission requirements**. Please read in its entirety. 

To confirm, students intending to major in Economics **may** elect the P/NP grading option for any [Economics prerequisite course](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective#TAKE%20THE%20COURSES) that is taken in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. That said, there has been no change in the GPA requirement for admission to the Economics major.

Below is the **Economics major admission policy modification for the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters**. Please read through carefully.

* Students **may** elect the P/NP grading option for any of the [prerequisite courses](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective#TAKE%20THE%20COURSES) **taken in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021,** to fulfill the Economics major [admission requirements](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective).
* At the end of the term, an instructor determines a letter grade for each student, including those taking the course under the P/NP grading option. **The letter grade you would have received is called the “letter-grade equivalent.”** Students who elect the P/NP option receive a P if they earned a letter-grade equivalent of a C- or higher.
* The **letter-grade equivalent** (as reported by the instructor) for any P grade earned in Economics prerequisite courses completed Fall 2020 or Spring 2021 will be used in the [GPA calculation](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective#MEET%20THE%20GPA) for admission to the major
   * Example: A student chooses the P/NP grading option for ECON 100A in Fall 2020. This student earns a letter-grade equivalent to a B+, which converts to a P under the P/NP grading option.This B+ grade will be used when confirming that the student meets the [GPA requirement for admission](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective#MEET%20THE%20GPA). (NOTE: students who completed prerequisite courses in Spring 2020 should refer to the [adjusted GPA policy](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/sp20policyupdates) to determine their GPA requirements).
* The [time frames to apply to the major](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective#APPLY%20ON%20TIME) remain unchanged.
   * Students who entered Berkeley as a [freshman](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective/freshmen) must apply for the Economics major by the end of their 5th semester or prior to the accumulation of 80 units, whichever comes second.
   * Students who entered Berkeley as a [transfer](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective/transfer-students) must apply for the Economics major by the end of their first semester.
* Further instructions on how the letter-grade equivalent information will be obtained by advisors during the admission review process will be shared at a future date. As a reminder, the **Fall 2020 application for admission is due December 11, 2020**. Deadlines found [here](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective#APPLY%20ON%20TIME).
* In the event that an NP is received in a prerequisite course in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021, it will have **no negative impact** on a student’s application for the major. The course may be taken again and the first attempt will not be factored into the admission review. Only the second attempt will be used in calculating the prerequisite GPA for admission to the major.

***“What happens if I do not meet the GPA requirement, even with this P/NP grading?”***

Students who do not successfully meet the criteria for admission to the major may still be admitted after **further review** by the Economics department. See our [admissions policies](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/economics-undergraduate-admissions-policies#overlay-context=) for additional details.

**Some final considerations...**

As you consider whether or not to elect the P/NP option for some of your prerequisite courses, we would like to highlight a few important considerations:

* As mentioned in the [L&S email](https://mailchi.mp/66af932e6abd/pnp-policy-modification?e=2cda4df8dc): *“...switching a course or courses to P/NP may not be the best action in all circumstances. Other strategies such as dropping a course to focus on the remaining courses or taking an incomplete grade to spread out some work are highly encouraged, and may be better ways of coping with difficulties while still making progress.”*
* There may be unforeseen consequences of electing the P/NP grading option. 
   * P/NP grading may impact instructors’ ability to provide substantive letters of recommendation, or how graduate schools evaluate students’ qualifications. 
   * If too many courses are elected for P/NP, students may exceed the [⅓ unit limit on P/NP courses](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/grading-options-letter-graded-and-passno-pass), which could require the completion of additional letter graded courses (NOTE: the ⅓ limit excludes [P grades earned in Spring 2020](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/spring-2020-policy-modifications-and-faqs)).
   * There are other departments that require Economics prerequisite courses in their major requirements. The revisions to their major policies in light of the [L&S P/NP policy](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/fall-2020-and-spring-2021-policy-modifications-and-faq) will likely differ from ours. Be sure to check with the advisors in your other intended major(s) before deciding whether to elect the P/NP grading option.
* Keep in mind that grades are final once they are posted. Students may not change a P back to a letter grade after grades are final.  
* The Fall 2020 deadline to change your grading option to P/NP is December 4, 2020. You may do so using the online L&S petition found [here](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/late-change-class-schedule). **L&S will not consider any requests for late enrollment changes, including grading option, after December 4.**

The year of 2020, and likely beyond, continues to present many difficult challenges and obstacles, some of which you have never faced. For those of you who are struggling, having the option to take your upper division major courses P/NP might be helpful. We hope you view this option as one of *several* ways in which to move forward through this academic year. We encourage you to continue to think broadly about what resources and supports you may need during this time, including the [Basic Needs Center](https://basicneeds.berkeley.edu/), the [Student Learning Center](https://slc.berkeley.edu/), [Counseling and Psychological Services](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/caps), and [many more](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/bewell).

What this policy does is allow people who would've gotten in anyway to protect their GPA. That is, instead of having a lower GPA due to B's they would have gotten, they get P's instead, which improves their GPA.
This doesn’t sound useless at all. It sounds like you were thinking you got a free pass into the economics major, and now you’re mad that you didn’t.
lol suck it up. all declared econ majors had to start that 3.0 requirement or submit an appeal. a pandemic is no excuse to 100% excuse you from this 3.0 cutoff.
I was expecting them to just ignore ""P"" grades altogether and just not use them for declaration. Instead, they are just taking your grade at the end of the semester which really isn't much different from the traditional approach.
Not True. I just don't get what the point is to having P/NP if they are just gonna take the grades at the end of the semester anyway. I thought the whole point of P/NP is to limit student stress...which this policy does not really address.
I get the point of what your gripe is about.  The way I would look at is that if you’re an intended Econ major, you shouldn’t PNP your required declaration classes.  The department probably should have just stated it this way, so that there wouldn’t be any confusion.  But since the L&S school is allowing for PNP to be applied to all classes, the departments probably had to have this sort of weird PNP allowance.
That would also cause an inflation of people being admitted to the major. Being able to optionally not count it basically takes it from average(previous-classes, current-classes) to max(previous-classes, current-classes), which at worst is the same, at best is higher. 

So yes, with the current policy there's functionally no benefit for people declaring the major, nothing can be done about it."
An extensive overview of Foothill Student Housing,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12e2x8n/an_extensive_overview_of_foothill_student_housing/,2023-04-06 17:06:05,"Hi! Although a little late, I noticed that there wasn't anyone sharing their experiences for the incoming freshmen/transfers who need to choose their housing, so I wanted to share my own experience in foothill(The La Loma part). For context, I'm currently a freshman intending to major in applied math and CS. I'm international, and aside from my major, I enjoy chess, smash, and lifting. Without further ado, I'll be describing my experience here in the following sections:

1. The bedroom and general living space
2. The dining hall
3. The people
4. Utilities
5. The location
6. Miscellaneous

&#x200B;

# A Quick TLDR

If you're too lazy to read the whole thing, firstly, fair enough, and secondly, hears a quick short summary of what I'll discuss:

Foothill's a great dorm for those who enjoy their inside them. It's got a very nature-esque theme, is really close many relevant STEM buildings, as well as a soccer field and a gym. The people here, both students and staff, are generally nice. The students here are mostly nerds, so unless you like talking about Ricci Curvature Tensors, the ton of money you'll make after graduating in CS, or chess, you'll probably find most of the students here unappealing. Nonetheless, many are still social and fun(this is Berkeley after all), so they'd still be interested in lifting, frat parties, etc. The dining hall food is relatively good compared to the other options, and is somewhat flexible for those with vegan or vegetarian diets. It does have its bad days though. The dorm gym has enough for you to get a decent workout. There's a game room with ping pong tables, a piano, and a pool table, as well as housing the only kitchen in foothill. If you enjoy gaming, the esports center is right next to the dining hall, which has reasonably good equipment. There have been several clubs that have hosted events there, ranging from club socials to smash tourneys. 

&#x200B;

Foothill is a very ""you love it or you hate it"" kind of dorm. Unless you are majoring in STEM, would consider yourself nerdy, or love staying in, I wouldn't suggest foothill. Not by a hard no, but you'd probably be better suited for the units. If you tick any of those boxes off, foothill would be a reasonably strong pick for you. In regards to pricing though, I do believe foothill has some of the most expensive housing compared to the other dorms.

# The Bedroom and General Living Space

&#x200B;

As far as I'm aware, foothill was built in the 1990s, and you can really tell from the rooms. The bedrooms are all carpeted, and almost all the furniture, including shelfs, tables, bedstands, etc, are made of wood. It will more or less feel like a dorm your parents would have lived in back then. The bed is somewhat small, and although I don't know my mattress measurements,  I sometimes find my feet hanging(I'm 1.72m or 5' 8). As for comfort of the mattress, it's not hard or soft. Each bedroom comes with a wadrobe, a study table with drawers, a microwave, fridge, and shelves. In my room, my side didn't have a window, but as far as I know I'm an exception. The only window in my room though had broken curtains, so we couldn't use the window even if we wanted to. 

&#x200B;

The common area, which is a shared area to hang out among peers living near you(called a suite), will usually have some sort of couch or two, a working and a lounging table, and a shelf. What caught me by surprise was the surprisingly good view my dorm had from the common area. For reference, this is what a usual afternoon will look like from my dorm:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q6cadsxo9csa1.png?width=1936&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a12ac2f1dbc8f98b1da715600039f674ccdf2f

I do admit, I believe it's pretty specific to my building, as most of the other buildings face some sort of road instead. 

&#x200B;

The temperature in foothill is unfortunately inconsistent, most due to their broken heating/cooling systems. Firstly, for some reason all bedrooms come equipped with some sort of heater/fan, but you don't really know which one you're going to get. That means that sometimes you'll be stuck freezing during the winter or melting in the summer. What's worse is that you can't really control these systems for the most part, and some of them outright just don't work. If it's on, it'll stay on. Otherwise, it's probably broken. 

&#x200B;

The restrooms are pretty standard, with tiled floors, closed stalls, shower curtains, the usual. Soap dispensers are automatic, and there are no hand dryers, just paper towels. Also, I don't know if it was specific to my suite, but the flushing power was extremely weak for us. We'd frequently clog the restroom. The heating system for the water also had incidences of breaking, so I occasionally did have to shower using ice cold water.

&#x200B;

In case you couldn't tell from the photo, foothill is very much surrounded by nature. It almost feels like a theme of the dorm, as there's green all over the place. A few of the buildings are supported by wooden pillars, and you can frequently see liana wrapped around lots of the green. There are squirrels and bees, and funny enough, there have been two occasions in foothill where my dorm mate left his window open, an a creature flew in. One time it was a bat, the other time it was a hummingbird. 

The are around foothill is in my opinion the safest among all the dorms. It's much more North than the rest, and there's way crazy people sitting on the sidewalks. In fact, I've never seen a hobo near foothill. 

One of my main problems with the actual living experience of foothill is the janitor. I admit, this is extremely specific, and there's only about a 20% chance that this janitor will be assigned to you. Nonetheless, more info is always better. My suite's janitor was this Chinese dude, who barely spoke English. Essentially the only phrase he knew was ""Hi, how are you?"", to which if you respond, he usually ignores you. Out of cluelessness or lack of care I don't know. But I didn't really care about that. What upset me was that almost every time he cleaned(usually every Tuesday and Thursday), he would blast this Chinese radio station at what felt like full volume. He usually came late morning(10-11am), so realistically unless you slept late or something, it's just a noisy nuisance. But since I love working in the dorm, it does annoy me quite a bit.  


# The Dining Hall

You'll hear quite a few people say that Foothill has the second best food among the dining halls, only runner up to Clark Kerr. Although I haven't had the chance to try all the other dining halls, I will say that Foothill's food is mediocre. That sounds bad, it's relatively good compared to my other dining hall experiences. It serves food buffet style, which I'm certain is the general consensus among all the dining halls. This year, foothill dining had several distinct food choices: 

  
a) A daily changing station- This section of the dining hall changes food every day. Although they might mix it up, I've generally noticed that there's a pattern of Fried Rice on Mondays and Indian food on Thursdays. Aside from that, they've had tacos, beef rendang, tri tip, as well as some other random things. The quality of this station varies. The fried rice is usually dry and bland, the tri tip is either near-restaurant quality or made out of rubber, and on the occasion that they serve chicken wings or babyback ribs, it's arguably better than some restaurants. There's always a vegan alternative to the meat option they have here, though it's pretty uncreative. Essentially whatever meat option they have, say beef rendang, they just swap it out for tofu or some sort of bean, resulting in tofu rendang. You can imagine the quality is abysmal. 

b) Burger/hotdog station- As the name implies, Foothill usually has some sort of burger patty or hotdog, as well as they're vegan counterpart(beyond burger, etc). The patties are usually what you'd expect, being kind of dry and plain tasting, but it's a great protein option with some cheese or sauce if the main food sucks. They occasionally serve fries, chips, pulled pork, or corndogs too.

c) Salad station- It's probably closer to a bar, as the salads aren't pre made. With the exception of two salad options, they just give you all the raw ingredients, including a rotating set of greens, bell peppers, diced eggs, cheese, chicken breast, tofu, corn, edamame, corn, croutons, etc. Note that not all the mentioned options might be available, as they rotate most of them. There are the usual dressing options, such as vinaigrette, ceasar, ranch, blue cheese, and olive oil. 

d) Sandwich Station- Next the salad station is the sandwich station. Here the usually have four types of bread, usually some form of white, whole wheat, and grain, with a toaster if you your bread, well, toasty. For actual fillings, they have butter, jam/jelly, peanut butter, lettuce, tomato, onion, olives, hummus, tuna, tuna salad, egg salad, cheese slices, and cold cuts. I usually make myself a tuna melt if I don't like what the main line is serving.

e) Pasta and Soup Station- As the name implies, you can usually get some form of pasta or soup. For the pasta, it's most commonly spaghetti with sauce on the side(pesto, marinara, cream). They'll sometimes mix up the sauces by making chicken alfredo or putting italian sausage into the marinara, but that's really it. They might also serve mac & cheese or lasagna instead. Personally, I really don't like the usual sauce options they serve, but when they make a different sauce it's usually alright. The soup is generally a rotation of chowder, tortilla soup, broccoli cheddar, chicken noodle, chili, as well as some other things. I'm pretty sure most are just from cans, so they're about what you'd expect. 

e) ""Fit"" Bar- This one is quite weird. For the rest of the stations, you pick the meal yourself. At this station, you have to ask somewhat to scoop it for you. The station usually has some sort of grain(rice, couscous, quinoa), beans, ground meat, and some boiled veggies. You can tell they tried to make a generically healthy looking assortment. However, as you can imagine, it usually tastes horrible, being really bland, or really salty. Also, for some reason, the ground meat is really oily. I would not recommend eating at this station. 

&#x200B;

As for the actual environment, the dining hall continues the theme of nature, with more wooden pillar and walls. There's also a TV room to eat it in, and I've found myself in there watching things like the NFL or spongebob squarepants. Most of the staff in the dining hall are really friendly. They like talking with the students, talking with each other, and some aren't afraid to show their attitude towards selfish students, and I respect that. You can tell that most of them are happy to be here. Sometimes, their interactions among each other feel like the job is a side thing, and that they're here to hang out. Of course, they actually do their job, but what I'm saying is that the interactions are pretty wholesome. 

There's a shelf filled with condiments such as sriracha, ketchup, tapatio sauce, salt & pepper. There's also a microwave.

One of my main problems with the dining hall is the cleanliness. I'll frequently have to check my plate, utensils, and glass to make sure there aren't stained. I'd say on average one in every three spoons are clean. Ew. 

&#x200B;

# The People

One of the biggest things about college in general is meeting new people, and as such you might be interested in the people that usually live here. You might have heard that foothill is usual for nerds, as it's close to most of the STEM buildings. You'd be right. Many of the people living here are majoring in some sort of STEM. In fact, at least a fourth of all the people I met here were EECS majors. I believe I've only met two non-STEM majors, one being in legal studies, and another in business. If you wanna count psychology as a soft science or whatever, then sure, three people. 

However, because these are Berkeley nerds we're talking about, most are still social and normal people that like doing the occasional dumb things. Most people like chess, gaming, or going to the gym. I've had nights where I talked about who the greatest physicist is for hours, and then have cursed NSFW discussions the next night. One time, me and two other dorm mates engineered a contraption out of clothing hangers and shoe laces that could break into each other's bedrooms. And yes, we do still scream during dead week. Foothill students are generally quirky, and are a refreshing shift from the usual party/420 vibes that you might get from most other students. If you do want to meet normal people though, of course they exist here, just in less numbers.

# Utilities

Foothill has two laundry rooms, one for the La Loma side, and one for hillside(don't worry too much about what these mean, they're just divisions among the buildings here). I've seen videos about where people complain that their clothes still smell after a good wash, but either they've fixed the machines or the video makers just suck at chores, because my laundry comes out just fine. There are a severe lack of machines however, with about 7 washing machines to cater to the laundry needs of about 500 kids on La Loma alone. It's pretty common for impatient people to take out your laundry and put it on top of the machine if you're not there to pick it up.

Foothill has a really small gym, which until recently was just cardio machines and one sad cable machine with one extension. It now has a debatable ""upgrade"", as they've removed some of the cardio machine options(stationary bikes), for stair masters, a chest press & leg press machine, and for some reason a dysfunctional lat pulldown. They removed the cable machine too.

The last utility worth mentioning is the game room. This was my main hang out place at the start of the semester, as the games gave a good way to vibe with those around me. The game room comes with a couple tables, a ping pong setup(most people steal the paddles though), a pool table, a piano, as well as access to foothill's only kitchen. The kitchen itself is small, and I doubt you'd be able to cook simultaneously with two people in there. There's a stove, a fridge, and not much else. 

Other small little things include water fountains, which are bare for the most part. You'll have to drink tap water more often that not. Foothill is also right next to the Esports center, which comes equipped with reasonable quality PC setups. I wouldn't really know though, as I'm not a PC gamer. You can use it almost whenever, and sometimes things such as game club meetings and tourneys happen here. As a smash player, it's really convenient that the SAB club hosts almost all their tourneys here.

# Location

Foothill is located extremely close to many STEM buildings. The main ones being Cory hall, where most EECS majors will hang, and Soda Hall, where most CS discussions take place. These two are about 2-3 minute walks from foothill. Other really close buildings(4-7 minutes away) include Evans(main math building for OHs), the Physics Building, and Pimentel Hall(common for Chem lectures and exam locations). Some other locations worth noting, not because of closeness, but because of relevance, including Dwinelle & Wheeler, common for all sort of L&S lectures and exams, which is about a 12 minute walk, and Moffit lIbrary, the main on-campus study place for students, which is about a 15 minute walk.

Some relevant, non-academic locations near foothill include Stadium Fitness center(8 minute walk), which is the smaller, not as furnished but way less populated gym in Cal, as well as a soccer field right next to foothill on the top of a parking lot. If you enjoy soccer, they frequently play pick up soccer there. There's also the Greek Theater next to foothill, where lots of concerts take place. 

Aside from that, Foothill is far from the bustling atmosphere of Berkeley. Most restaurants are on the complete opposite side of Berkeley, so you won't be able to get Chipotle any time soon. It's strangely close to the frat area though(8-12 minute walk), so parties aren't too difficult to get to.

&#x200B;

# Miscellaneous

Some important info that doesn't really fit into anything I've said so far includes:

Price- I believe foothill's dorm pricing is the most expensive, at least from what I compared with my non-foothill friends.","I have good memories from my time there. 1999-2000. Hillside 614. Right next to the laundry room!
Current foothill resident here: OP was pretty thorough in their review of foothill, I’ll just add my stuff from my own experience living in foothill. The soccer field is above the parking lot and is ok, as there are two goals and it’s usually almost occupied by people playing a pick up game. However, it’s a popular hang out spot and if you want to play you can just introduce yourself and say hi. The majority of the time they would be happy and willing to let you join the game. It’s also a turf field, and because people wear cleats on it, the field quality isn’t the best. Another thing that OP didn’t specify was the price. Currently I live in a foothill double, which costs around 2300 a month. It’s actually really pricy for a double, even in Berkeley, although it includes a meal plan. Lastly, I can’t believe OP didn’t mention the turkeys. I think it’s the rain, but this year, especially in the spring, there has almost always been turkeys present in and around foothill. It’s really cool. Even when it’s not raining, you can find turkeys really close by to foothill. The big C has plenty of turkeys and they are quite common there. Foothill is really close to nature, and in my opinion, it’s a big plus.
Thank you!!! I needed this
Hey I liked Bing! (the Chinese janitor)
omg i just signed my housing agreement and i'm very happy that i got foothill! i'm not STEM but this is great thank you so much
Was the nice and and issue resolved? I read it was a big problem. I was not aware of the mice and ant issue. There is no way that I will be able to live let alone study under those conditions. I need to know the truth to see if I still have a chance to switch housing or figure out something else. I cannot imagine returning from break to find mice droppings all over my room or to try to fall asleep and wake up to mice or ants on my bed. The thought of this is taking my anxiety to the roof. I just can’t.
gym rat here haha what’s the dorm gym like? and how far away is RSF from foothill walking?
I don't know if I should be jealous or not. On one hand carrying the laundry basket back must be child's play. On the other hand oh gosh the noise.
Thanks for mentioning the price. Idk how I forgot about that. Also, lowkey, about the turkeys, I think I straight up forgot about them since I spend most of my days watching lectures in my room lol. But yeah there are turkeys, and I've noticed lots of deer near midnights as well.
No problem! Feel free to ask for any clarifications!
I like him for the most part too, as I can tell he’s trying, but damn that radio pisses me off.
As far as my time there was concerned, I didn't notice a single mouse. Ants can be a problem, as my suite mates frequently had ants in their place. It was more so recklessness on their end though, as they just let open packs of food lying around and whatnot. You can tell they never bothered to proper seal or lock away their food. I never had an ant problem to be honest. Just make sure to that your roommate isn't out of line with their food hygiene and it should be fine.

&#x200B;

In regards to wildlife though, there have been three notable incidents in my time here. I've found several mantises on my wardrobe and trashcan. My suitemates have also let in a hummingbird and a bat before during the night, and I've seen wasps come in during the day.
The dorm gym is alright. It actually got upgraded a couple months ago. Idk if they'll change anything when you come in, but when I was there it last had a chest press, pulldown, cable leg press, cable machine(with pull up bar), and 2 cardio marchines of each of the following: Treadmills, stairmasters, elipticals.

Unfortunately RSF is pretty far from foothill. It's like 20 minutes away for the average walker. If you can catch a bus on time, it'll only take you 6 minutes, though do be warned that the right buses only come maybe once every 20 minutes. An alternative is the stadium fitness center, which is in the memorial stadium. It's only an 8 minute walk. Though it's much smaller and less equipped, though it still has free weights and is less packed anyway. It's also only open on weekdays though and their hours are much more restrictive than RSF. Honestly getting a good workout living in foothill is kind of problematic, but manageable.
Surprisingly wasnt noisy in the suite at all. I never used the laundry room though. I grew up down the street so went home to do laundry.
Bro at that point why'd you pay for the dorm then?
Lmao, I asked my parents if I could live at home and they said “fuck no”. Same with my homie in 8C42. He grew up in Berkeley.
Damn your parents must’ve really wanted the space."
