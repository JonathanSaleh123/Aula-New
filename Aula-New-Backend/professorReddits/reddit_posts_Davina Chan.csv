COGSCI 1B midterm w Davina Chan,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1b2k8ae/cogsci_1b_midterm_w_davina_chan/,2024-02-28 14:55:01,"Hey there 

Anyone who took the class w Davina Chan? what does the midterm look like and what resources should I use while studying - kinda lost here;)

appreciate the help!!
",Literally everything from the slides. Know it inside and out. I made flashcards and practiced active recall which worked well for me. During the actual exam make sure to read the questions carefully as sometimes they are worded really weird. But overall her midterms are easier than she says they are.

Psych C120/COGSCI C100,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/163cksm/psych_c120cogsci_c100/,2023-08-27 21:52:09,"Has anyone taken this class with Davina Chan? I‚Äôm a psych major and have a background in this type of material, so I‚Äôm wondering if doing the readings in the textbook is actually necessary to do well on the weekly quizzes/in the class. Thanks!","I only read her slides when I was taking it. Should usually be fine.
Did you get an A? ü•π
Follow up question: do you have to go to lecture or can you just study the slides?
I would say the slides + short videos have pretty much everything you need. Lectures are just she actively presenting them. Not sure if anything changes this year though.
Short videos?? Like are those included in the slides or? You just mean looking things up on the slides that need more explanation?"
Questions about COGSCI 115 - Neuropsychology of Happiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15t65yz/questions_about_cogsci_115_neuropsychology_of/,2023-08-16 16:42:09,"Hello I had a couple questions about this course for anyone that has already taken it, I will keep them concise:

1. Difficulty (is it brute memorization?)
2. Time Commitment (how much time would you say is needed per week?)
3. Attendance (how much attendance is necessary to pass the course from the standpoint of the amount you learn in class vs textbook/independently?)

If anyone has their lecture notes / a syllabus that they are willing to share, I would appreciate it very much as there isn't a whole lot of information available online currently. I am trying to front load some self-study before the semester starts.

For anyone who is taking it Fall '23 w/ Davina Chan feel free to reach out either now or during the semester, I'd be happy to chat / start study or review groups. 

Thank you!","[deleted]
Thank you for the detailed response! I guess taking MCB W61 this summer was a plus right before this course, all that memorization is actually going to come in handy..."
could anyone help with some psych upper div questions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12mnhj2/could_anyone_help_with_some_psych_upper_div/,2023-04-14 19:55:34,"hey! i'm a junior planning to take a bunch of my upper divs next semester and i'm wondering about how some of the classes operate. if you have recently taken any of the classes below could you tell me if they upload lecture material online (like ppts, study guides, etc)? i have some pretty big sleep issues and don't know if i'll be able to make all lectures since these classes are relatively early. it would be so so helpful if anyone here could shed some light on any of these classes for me, thanks so much!!

Basic Issues in Cognition (PSYCH C120, Davina Chan)

Psychology of Personality (PSYCH 150, Oliver P John)

Developmental Psychology (PSYCH 140,  Jan Engelmann)

Developmental Psychopathology (PSYCH 131, Qing Zhou)

Social Psychology (SOCIOL 150, John W Kaiser)

Leading People (UGBA 105, Brandi Pearce)","I took Personality with Oliver, it‚Äôs still my favorite class I‚Äôve taken. I had an 8am, but he records lectures and posts the slides so I‚Äôd skip and watch the recordings in the afternoon
i took 131 w zhou! she recorded all lectures, posted all readings and slides ahead of time, and tests were based purely on lecture, so it was fairly easy!
I agree with the two comments about 150 & 131! I also took 140 with Jan and he does upload slides but they are very plain. He does not record lectures but even though I did not attend lecture I passed the class with an A by downloading the textbook and going to sections.
thats super great to hear! thanks for the info!!
love! tysm!

Any advice about the psych department at Cal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j3lsyv/any_advice_about_the_psych_department_at_cal/,2020-10-01 18:44:47,"I am an intended cog sci major but I have to say...it's the pysch that keeps drawing me in. Davina Chan is such an amazing professor, hands down my favorite this year, and I literally want to be like her.

I know there's some stigma against psych majors in the general world...but Berkeley's psych department does seem very Bio based and there pre-reqs that require technical skills.

I can envision myself doing grad school in clinical psych but is that foreseeable for the future we have now? I guess I kind of planned to get a tech job after graduation like everyone else despite my total lack of confidence in my programming skills (bc I have none)

Anyways, to psych or not to psych?","i LOVE professor chan too!!! she‚Äôs such an awesome lecturer!! also ur username is amazing
If you really want to do it then go for it. From what I hear from my friends, psych isn‚Äôt a super demanding majors since a lot of them graduated a year early. So you can even go for a double major if you‚Äôre really unsure about landing a job or the stigma.
I‚Äôm a second year declared psych major and love it. I want to go into developmental neuro. I‚Äôve only had good interactions with people and staff in the department. You can always double in psych and cog sci. Or major in one and minor in the other. And for the whole psych majors aren‚Äôt respected. Yeah fuck that, who cares? Psych majors are one of the most applicable/employable majors in the workforce. The one downside I do need to tell you is that you can‚Äôt really advance in career without getting a grad degree. You say you want to go into clinical, you can get a masters, psyD, or PhD to go into clinical. Check out r/academicpsychology and feel free to dm me if you have any questions
The psych dept at Berkeley is absolutely amazing. David Presti, Dacher Keltner, Jack Gallant, Alison Gopnik to name just a few of the profs who are either really good profs or doing cool research.

I'm biased being a Cogsci major but you can do a lot of psych stuff while still being cogsci and reap some of the benefits of having datasci/CS skills. I did a stint in a clinical psych lab (golden bear sleep and mood research clinic) and the PI Allison Harvey kept emphasizing how she looks for grad students with a strong stats/datasci background. A lot of psych research has become heavily dependent on using datasci tools (for good reason given the replicability crisis) so if you're thinking of grad school, CogSci could be a plus in that sense.

Besides, the only programming stuff CogSci requires is 61A, Data 8 and CogSci133/188. 61A will be challenging(take it with Garcia if you can), Data 8 is super chill and I've heard good things about CogSci133 (I'm currently working in Steven Piantadosi's lab who teaches the class in the spring and he's super chill).

One last fun thing, Berkeley recently announced the opening of a psychedelic research center under the psych dept which is insanely cool. The future of clinical psych is psychedelics imo and there's a lot of money rolling in already, so that's something you might want to keep in mind.

Feel free to hmu if you have more questions, I love everything about the CogSci dept :)

ur energy makes me happy and gosh yeah I love her :)
How are they faring post undergrad graduation?
Good advice but 'minor' correction, you can't minor in either psych or cogsci
Oh okay...uhm who is that guy!
ones doing a internship for the city and the others at a t10 for a masters in psychology
Oops about cogsci but there is a psych minor! It‚Äôs an over the summer program
[deleted]
oh oof this hurt bc sleep research (what davina talked about in her lectures) is what got me thinking into taking the cogpsych route
I‚Äôm a psych alum :) I‚Äôm not a grad student but I ended up working in two sleep research labs. One with Dr. Roth who is pretty much the father  of sleep in Detroit Michigan and now I‚Äôm at UW Madison as a research coordinator. I think UW Madison has a pretty solid group of researchers that emphasize cog sci.

I knew a few people who did grad school in psych and ended up working at a tech job where they were able to utilize their research skills.

I think you should double major! It‚Äôll be helpful to have both cog sci and psych.

Also, take Matt walkers class despite the shady things he‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs a great lecturer. And you will learn a lot about sleep."

Is it weird to send a thank you email to a professor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18mpuac/is_it_weird_to_send_a_thank_you_email_to_a/,2023-12-20 00:32:15,"She has already uploaded our final grade on canvas so I‚Äôm not doing it to be a kiss ass for a grade, her class genuinely changed my life/perspective for good and I just wanted to express my gratitude so would it be weird to send an email? Should I just keep it to myself?","Nothing wrong with showing gratitude
There is nothing wrong with this. Also you said that grades have been uploaded, so everything should be over for this class. I think professors will also appreciate it when students thank them for a class, so this should definitely make her day :)
Absolutely not weird! Professors are human too, they are passionate about the subjects they teach and they‚Äôd probably appreciate hearing that their class had such an impact on you.
What class? I‚Äôm curious and looking for some perspective widening classes too. ( I saw you plan to thank her - have my vote )
Do it! I‚Äôm sure your professor will appreciate it!
Was it taken by Adam croom?
Sir Adam croom?
I‚Äôll send it then thank you!(:
Cog sci 115 - it really teaches you life and what true happiness is
