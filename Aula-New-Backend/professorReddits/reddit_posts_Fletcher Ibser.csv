Transfer Schedule Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cft1av/transfer_schedule_help/,2019-07-20 17:33:51,"Hi! I was wondering if this is a good schedule to start out for first semester for an Econ major. I need to declare Econ this semester so the Stats and Econ class will really mean alot in terms of my first semester. I really want to try Data 8 and CS61A if that doesnt sound like a stupid idea since I have the room! Also having trouble deciding which stats teacher to take but I haven't taken any stats classes yet. Only took 1 CS course at CC so wondering how Data 8 is.

Econ 100B (Richard Hawkins)

Stat 20 (Fletcher Ibser or Stoyanov) or Stat 134 (Adam Lucas) 

CS C8 (ramesh sridharan ) \*Class is webcasted

DeCal Course","Don’t take Stat 134. It’s one of the harder stat classes, especially for those without a statistical or math background.
Ibser"
