Psych 110,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ftvgjv/psych_110/,2020-04-02 14:56:16,"Hello, I'm a cogsci major who wants to take Psych 110 with Joni Wallis, but I can't find much about the class or the professor online. Has anyone taken the course and/or knows how the professor is? I know it's only three units, but I'm curious about the actual workload and the assignments. 

Thanks!","I took the class with her in the Fall 2018 semester. I really enjoyed the class. It is full of extremely interesting information and cool activities (handling an actual human brain in section, using electric signals to control the Professor’s arm, etc.) 

She was a pretty good Professor. She is very knowledgeable and she speaks clearly, but she tends to go through information quickly. That being said, all of the necessary information for the tests is either on the slides (which she posts to Bcourses), or explained in lecture (which is recorded). I never went to office hours, but when I asked her questions after class, she was receptive and provided good information. 

Grading is based off of research participation, 2 midterms and a final (I can’t remember if the final is weighted more highly than the midterms, if it is it isn’t by much). The tests themselves consist of a manageable number of short answer questions that test knowledge of significant concepts (if I remember right, somewhere between 12 and 16 for the midterms, more for the final). She only grades around 3/4 of the questions on each test, so you can choose about a quarter of the questions on each test to not answer and exclude from your grade. The final is cumulative but contains significantly more questions from the last third of the class. She provides all of this info (and more) before each test. The class is not curved, but many people get A’s anyway.

Overall, the class was definitely a positive experience for me. It is heavily memorization based, but the information is fascinating. I spent a large amount of time studying prior to each exam, but I did very well on each of them. I highly recommend this class. Let me know if you have any additional questions!"
