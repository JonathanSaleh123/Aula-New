Class Help: ENGIN 7 or COMPSCI 61A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i5sidl/class_help_engin_7_or_compsci_61a/,2020-08-07 20:53:56,"I am an engineering major coming in as a transfer with a choice of Engineering 7 or COMPSCI 61A. I want to take the easier course to maximize my GPA, any recommendation  on which one I should take? I have taken an introduction to c++ and MATLAB course at my previous CC. I don’t plan to take any more computer science after this choice. I’m open to hear insight and perspectives on the courses and how they compare. Thanks!","I've taken both as a MechE to EECS transfer and I would do anything to not have to take a class like E7.
If the E7 class is with Raja Sengupta, dont take it.
Havent taken E7 but I hear its a poorly ran course. By contrast, 61A is an amazingly run course, though the workload is probably higher than E7's. Also, avg grade in 61a seems to be higher according to BerkeleyTime.
E7 was a terrible experience
I've taken E7 as a MechE and 61A when I moved to EECS. Literally E7 is so badly run I can understand why any engineer doesnt wanna take CS class ever again. It's like 300 kids per 7-8 GSIs who never respond to piazza. I'm not sure about other professors but my professor, Raja, literally is the worst of the worst teachers I've ever had or ever seen. He literally came to class on Day 1 saying he hasn't coded in Matlab for over 3 years. Proceeds to fail to demonstrate how to create a function that does x+y in the next lecture as a kid had to correct him live. 

You learn the same thing as 61A minus the math computational part of E7, which isn't that great either. People only take E7 for the Matlab aspect. If you want to learn how to actually code, take 61A. I recommend 61A > E7 anytime.
What specific major? I didn't think that cs61a was an alternative for E7 in most non-eecs engineering majors. If you're doing meche-e or civ-e, E7 is probably a lot more important for you but I've only taken 61a.
Dang why do you say that? Do you think it would be different if it’s held remotely?
Yeah I saw that, but is that it because more COMPSCI majors are interested in getting a higher grade for their major? Or is it just easier relative to ENGIN 7

Lmaoooooo no way! How is this acceptable for a berkeley class
BioE and I’m taking 15+ units next semester so I’m only considering which one is easier to get an A in
The class is just so badly run. Please take 61A since you already know Matlab.
Ask anyone who took E7 Spring 19. What he said went on overheard instantly.
Ah ok. Given your background (Matlab), E7 will probably be more manageable.
I thought so as well, thanks for the response, but now I’m seeing people say COMPSCI 61A is more manageable, is E7 that bad? I for some reason want to take 20 units next semester to knock out as many BioE courses as possible as their class averages are A-‘s. Do you think it’s manageable if I invested all my time into my courses? I’m staying home so hoping that buys me a lot more extra time.
20 units is incredibly hard regardless of what you take, so keep that in mind. Idk much about E7, but from people who I know took it, it sounds like it's probably not harder than 61a, just less well organized. 61a is super well structured and everyone loves the professor (it's usually denero who teaches it I think)"
