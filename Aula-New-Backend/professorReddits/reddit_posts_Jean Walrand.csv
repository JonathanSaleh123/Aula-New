Question about CS70 in the Fall,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4s5ccx/question_about_cs70_in_the_fall/,2016-07-10 05:46:27,So I see that for cs70 this fall it has two instructors Jean Walrand and Sanjit Seshia. Does this mean that the professors alternate lecturing or how does this work? Also would anyone recommend delaying cs70 to take it with Sahai in the spring? I've heard good things about him. Thank you! ,"They will alternate topics. It won't be a perfectly neat alternation, but it'll roughly be equal splitting.
I wouldn't recommend holding off on CS 70 to take it with Sahai. Sahai's CS 70 course is an excellent one and you will learn a lot, but Walrand is also good, too. You will find it rewarding either way. Seshia is new, so I'm not sure what he/she is like.

Go here http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/education/courses.shtml and then click the upcoming cs classes. And, yeah, only Sahai is teaching it.
