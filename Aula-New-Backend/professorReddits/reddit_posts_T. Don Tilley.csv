i don’t like telling peers i go to berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14pvzib/i_dont_like_telling_peers_i_go_to_berkeley/,2023-07-03 14:48:36,"does anyone else feel slightly awkward when telling people near your age (ex coworkers) that you go to berkeley when they ask? it always elicits some sort of impressed reaction that i would rather avoid. oftentimes they then will feel embarrassed to say where they go to school, like “oh i just go to x state/community college.” LIKE NO PLS IM NOT ELITIST LIKE THAT YOUR COLLEGE DOESNT DEFINE YOU!! i love berkeley and i’m proud to go here but i try to avoid telling people unless they directly ask because of this. obviously this is such a first world problem to have, jw if anyone else shares similar sentiments","I work regularly with college grads from all over.

Ask Harvard grad where they went to school and they’ll say Boston.

Ask a Princeton grad where they went to school and they’ll say New Jersey. 

Ask a Stanford grad and every goddamn time they’ll say Stanford.
I’ve been called many positive things in life, but I swear, no one called me smart until I got into Berkeley. It’s such a noticeable change when people listen and think your ideas are important all of a sudden… and I’m saying the same weird shit I’ve always said but now it’s credible? Lollll

I don’t feel any different about myself, but it has slightly changed my perspective of others
I got in here as a grad student I wear that shit on my sleeve 😭🤣
these responses are wild. its just a true fact about yourself. You're allowed to say true things about yourself, and you're also allowed to be proud that you go to a good school. you're allowed to have worked hard to accomplish something you're proud of. imposter syndrome is very real and anyone struggling with it should definitely talk about it
I'm a re-entry transfer. It took a lot of work for me to get here.  Yes, I tell them I go to Cal then, I show then that I am a regular guy/person like they are. If greatness is what Berkeley is, then I want them to know that I'm here because I worked my behind off, not because I am somehow superior. Once they see that, I make a new friend. That's been my experience thus far.
I teach math at a community college and I was at a dinner party recently where someone was asking me about my job. The person said, “so then that means that you’ve got a masters degree in math, isn’t that right?” I said, “no a PhD.” Then they said “oh, not in math?” I said, “yes in math. A PhD in math.” Silence. Then “Oh, so where did you do that?” “Berkeley.” “Berkeley? UC Berkeley?” “Uh huh.” “Wow, you must be super smart.” 

That person I were both in our 50s, and we’re both women. She went to Cal for undergrad and has a Harvard law degree. It’s imposter syndrome on steroids.
I always will say Berkeley because I’m proud of myself that I got in. Nobody in my life pushed me to apply to this school (actually my college counselor told me to look at safety schools right when I told her Cal was my dream school) yet I did anyway and got in. The people who judge you and think you’re pretentious or something are not worth giving a single fuck about because they frankly are not really normal (look at the *real* world beyond your circle, if you go outside a certain distance people won’t even know what Berkeley is!). Stay proud and stay blessed with this opportunity life has given you and let the judgemental people and haters stay pressed ❤️
If asked I say Berkeley. I don’t say “Cal” because lots of people I talk to don’t get the reference and I end up having to clarify and say Berkeley anyways and then it looks like false modesty. And seriously, the only people who care are people I don’t know well. Family and longtime friends? By the time you reach middle age like me, no one cares where you went to college. Plenty of my high school friends are doing just fine having attended schools that didn’t have the “cachet” of the Berkeley name. Just say it.
i just got in for grad school and i felt this. it’s even weirder when you were kinda just a nobody in undergrad but now that my grad school is higher ranked it’s like i’m a superstar. people on linkedin are now reaching out so eager to connect. it’s annoying. like this is all it takes for people to treat u just a little nicer, an acceptance letter?
I went to community college for 3 years and had to go through “Ohhhh that’s cool” with the connotation of feeling bad for me. Telling people I am going to Cal now, I deserve to feel proud. You should too
I feel similarly about telling people where I went to college. I’ve gotten really good at answering that question in a way that doesn’t identify the school and at the same time pivots the conversation to something else.
SAMEE I TRULY AVOID SAYING I GO TO CAL AT ALL COSTS. Especially when they go ohh you must be smart like idek how to respond to that… cuz I still don’t know how I got here myself and I’ll just say oh no no haha…..
I tell people that I’m going to my state flagship lol
I worked my butt off to get in. I don't run around telling everybody I meet but if they ask I'm happy to brag.

I'm a returning student and an orphan. I went to community college while working full time and still got in. 

You get to be proud of your achievements. Just don't rub them in people's faces when they haven't asked.
""yeah i came up to the bae area for uni""
No? Why is it elitist if they ask? It’s not like you’re going around rubbing it in peoples’ faces or anything.
1. I don't think that reaction to telling people you go to Berkeley is that common
2. It's not elitist to state a fact about where you go to school.
I feel this a lot. I'm Indian so whenever I am at Indian dinner parties and whatnot, people always ask what college I am going to and for what degree. It's getting to the point where I start to dread answering that question because people start to treat me differently. I am a normal person, like anyone else. I just happen to be a nerd as well. My school doesn't define my worth.
Nah I personally go all the way and flex that I’m eecs. It’s fine and u deserve the bragging rights for working hard. If you don’t sell yourself then no one else will sell for u.
I say I went to *The* University of California.
Be proud, but it’s not your identity and doesn’t guarantee success. I have had amazing employees from CSUs, Harvard and also no college at all.
Stop caring what others things. I went to Berkeley for MBA. I used to hate that reaction too, but you know what; who cares. Just own it. If they’re impressed, good for you, enjoy it. Just take it in and say thank you. No need to be a jerk but you earned the reputation. Tell whoever you want too; you’re not bragging, it’s a fact of your life
I just say I go to college in the east bay
it’s even worse when my asian parents introduce me to other people and they flex that and i’m left cringing as the recipient oohs in approval.
My dad works for an oil company. He once told someone who went to Texas Tech where I went, and the guy responded with “why?” 

*The stars at night are big and bright…*
no i feel this sm i typically answer with ""cal"" and some either assume i go to a school in california or a cal state... LOL and the few answer back with ""cal berkeley?""
Nope. I’m proud of my achievements.
Damn. I don’t feel this way at all.
i had the exact same feeling lmao. it feels like i'm bragging even when they are the ones to ask lmao
this!!! my mom always tells people i go to berkeley unprompted and she just doesn’t seem to understand why i don’t like it
When people ask, I tell them “Berkeley” and then move on or ask them questions about themselves. Change the subject, don’t make a big deal of it. Yes, people will still raise their eyebrows and say stuff like “wow” but treat them like u treat everybody else and quickly they forget all abt it. Don’t act haughty, be a good person, and eventually no one gives a shit where u went to school.
Literally the reason you hate it is the reason I love it
This post came right as I just did a presentation yesterday for the company I used to work for in Marketing.

It was an introductory celebration party intended for the new recruits, and a ton of them were younger. Many of them haven't started college. I talked with one of the new members, and they told me college was a luxury they just couldn't afford through time when money was a major precedence just to survive.

It stung like a sharp chord. I had below a 2.3 at one point in HS, dropped out, grew up with a family making under $10k a year income, and worked in blue-collar manufacturing before I was graciously offered this opportunity, reconfigured my entire life and I began self-teaching myself science. That's to say, my company didn't teach me math or CS, but they taught me how to work. They showed me how to reap one's interpretation of happiness and command for successfully pursuing dreams.

My goal was always to be a Mathematican. I remember screaming that goal from the rooftops as a kid. From various voices, they would tell me, ""You're disabled and won't even make it to college."" ""Female ladies don't survive pure Mathematics."" ""Tell me if you've ever seen someone from the ghetto make it as a top PhD student in Math."" The list goes on and on for days. 

Now, I am a Math student. My journey took years, from the day I was 17 and decided to live my greatest life to today at 21 years, having become everything I ever wanted.

I fought distractions, focused on self-discipline, and committed to grooming the roots of my own journey to help others. 

So when I went up on stage yesterday, my speech went on for quite a couple minutes pertaining to Marketing techniques, but my introduction went along the lines of, ""Hi everyone! My name is --- and I'm an ex-doubter. I lived under the thumbs of fear in manufacturing, 12 gruesome hours a day making minimum wage, fearing my life was going to amount to nothing. I was introduced to Marketing and my life transformed. Now, I am pursuing my dreams of Math research as a Mathematics student at UC Berkeley, interning for software at Apple, and no longer fear the future, but now embrace living for the moment and commited to the life of educating and assisting others.""

Everyone says perception is reality; I personally believe reality is reality.

You can earmark a self-righteous stance, a tool of exclusivity. OR, you can begin using Berkeley as a foundation for sharing your story and uplifting the blinded. I used Berkeley yesterday as a clever, inspiring motif to get the general idea that if I worked at achieving my goals and the reward was having the privilege to learn from a top Math university, you can become everything you've ever dreamed of.
I do this same thing. I'm studying abroad in Japan rn but even here, people give that response. I didn't think that would happen. So, I usually just say I go to school in California. Or I say I go to a UC school. That's about it. 😅
I’ve never understood the awkwardness, you don’t have to carry on about your undergrad University. If someone says “wow that’s a good school” isn’t the appropriate response just saying “thanks” and moving on? Being evasive and not answering the question seems really weird and awkward. Is there a big social cue I’m missing here?
I say I go to a community college ( my prior school before transfer ); it helps me because often times I feel like they look at me differently and sometimes I like to play dumb so this is a secret disguise lol
It's why I sometimes quickly say ""I go to Cal."" Brief and to the point
I just say that I go to university in NorCal and then specify that it’s Berkeley only if pressed so that I don’t come off as pretentious.
Say you went to Cal
Ask Barnard students where they go to school and almost always you get Columbia
This is me EXACTLY OMG i’ve been having this problem so bad recently
definition of how my summer’s been really. it’s always either a “wow you’re smart” or “oh you’re in that scene.” i’m still unsure of how to react to either so i just say i go to school in the bay area.
I've got my undergrad from the University of Houston and going to Berkeley for my masters. I always say both so that I don't sound like a pompous asshole, unless they're from Stanford then I don't care.
Totally!! Idk man its weird af esp when a ton of my friends are street kids or like travellers/dirty kids
Don't make yourself small, be a proud Cal bear -, if they hate on you it's about them not you.
I love when I get asked. I struggled for years from some very precarious, dark, and scary circumstances. Getting here is a great accomplishment, not just for me, for my loved ones and community.

Be proud of this extraordinary experience, it is rare, and can give you the ability to make a good life for yourself and to be a great service to others.

It is a privilege, acknowledge it, show gratitude for it, give grace to those who don’t have it, and share it.
I totally feel the same way. I’m glad it’s not just me. 

Every time the topic is brought up I try my best to avoid mentioning Berkeley. What makes it worse for me (a transfer going into film) is that you always get the same two responses. Either people instantly disregard your achievement since your a transfer (so naturally it was “easy” to get in apparently). Which I’m not exactly denying since I know it is easier, but still why does it have to be brought up? Or you get the response that praises you which I hate so much. I came from a state school, then community college. So hearing all this praise JUST because I’m going to a brand name school really sucks. Makes me wonder if I would’ve receive the same response had I chosen a different school.
As a mom I totally feel this way telling people where son was going/went
to school! I would say things like, “he’s at school in NorCal,” or “he attends a UC.” I felt like people would think I was bragging and I would not want to be perceived that way, so usually only said Berkeley when pressed.
I mean it’s just Berkeley 🏌️‍♂️
The number of times I had to say, ""No not the one in Boston"" and ""No, not the college of music""....sigh...🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ Lmao.
I just casually say I went to “Cal”, never Berkeley or UC Berkeley. I’m proud I went to Cal not just because of academics, but because we’re a melting pot of a public school
Seriously. I'm only an incoming freshman and I have already started doing this because of how weird it's been the previous times I answered.
generally i hate ppl when they thk they are someone just because they got in
Whenever I tell someone that I'm a Berkeley alumni, they correctly assume that I've been stoned since my freshman year.
no one gives a shit guy.
Its wild bc I grew up in the bay and I always thought super highly of Cal but when I moved to the East Coast, it seemed like nobody's even heard of berkeley. They all know UCLA though for some reason.
Imagine majoring in comparative literature… it just sounds so pretentious for no reason.
Tell them you go to Stanford
I attended UCB for a bit. The quality of instruction and the students were low. It sucked. 🤷🏻‍♂️
[deleted]
Good thing you didn't get into Stanford - then you would really be embarrassed!
I used to hire a bunch of fresh college grads and with out fail the worst hires and least equipped to function in the corporate world were Berkeley graduates. So depends on who you’re talking to or might be someone trying to be nice because most people are pretty proud they went to Berkeley.
I’d feel awkward and embarrassed as well if I had to tell peers I went to Berkeley! That’s why I turned the Bears down. Go Bruins!
I’d be embarrassed to say I go there. All you guys do is protest and cry.
I don’t go to Berkeley, I go to Cal.
I’m on the same boat and I avoid saying that I go to Berkeley unless if they’re persistent about it. I just say I went to college in the bay, but if they keep asking I’ll just tell them. They usually respond with oh you must be pretty smart. Then I’ll say something like “nah, I’m just really good at BSing personal insight questions”, they laugh, and that usually breaks the awkwardness of things.
I feel like people have weirdly high expectations of me when I say I go to Berkley
You should be embarrassed.   Berkeley is nothing more than an indoctrination center for the communist party.  
Be ashamed, very ashamed and hang your head low while outside of the bay area proper.
Cornell people will freely volunteer where they went to college, almost regardless of what you’re talking to them about. They’ll work it in there somehow. Sometimes multiple times in the same conversation.
>Ask a Stanford grad and every goddamn time they’ll say Stanford.

lmao

>i’m proud to go here but i try to avoid telling people unless they directly ask because of this.

u/Alternative_Gap_2517 If you wanted to be sly you could say ""Cal"". 

But I still think you can say Berkeley with a nonchalance that shows you don't wish to brag nor belittle other's achievements.
I know tons of Stanford grads and some say Bay Area or California if they’re not from here.
Stanford grad here, I say Bay Area.. 
what’s funny is they always know it’s Stanford when I say that. Never Berkeley
My LinkedIn connect request rate has increased so much since adding Berkeley in my bio lmao
For the tuition we pay? why not lol.
Real
Hey man some grad programs are equally difficult to get into than the undergraduate program
for me it’s not so much imposter syndrome, just more so that i would like to make a separate impression about who i am without mentioning my school. like sometimes it gives people set preconceptions before they know anything about you. i would rather impress employers than my peers
I like this take, thanks for sharing. if people form preconceptions without getting to know you, that’s their fault
re- entry here too! yay us!
Another transfer re-entry here and I just was relieved to be reminded I’m not the only one in this situation. My return has been uh…. a difficult one. Out of curiosity have there been any Re-Entry services that have made your transition back easier?
I don’t mean to be rude, but why in the world do you teach community college if you have a PhD in math from Berkeley? There are so many things you can do with that degree anywhere, but especially in the bay area
my counselor at city college of SF laughed when i said i wanted to try to go to cal
Please share howwww. I hate the awkwardness in the air after they ask what school do you go to and I’m forced to say Berkeley. Their face changes color and they start feeling inferior in the conversation and I never want that to happen so I always include “I have no idea how I got in” to sorta ease the situation
That actually further proves your intelligence. The smarter you are, the more you realize that you know nothing. Most people who claim to be intelligent simply have very limited perspectives. There is a Japanese proverb: ""The frog in the well knows nothing of the great ocean.""
I feel you and understand even though I am new. I haven't set foot on campus yet and, people are acting different. In my major (Sociology) it's seen as Symbolic Interactionism. They are interacting with you because of what you symbolize that is: What is best in people, hard work and hope. For some we are the example that keeps them sanguine and optimistic. I know you didn't ask for it. However, look at their faces. You might be doing others good.
And EECS no less.
i get what you’re saying but i’m not always trying to sell myself in casual convo lol
Least annoying eecs kid
I wish more people realized this
This reads like a copy pasta
“Where did you got to school?” “A school in California” “…Yeah but which one” is how I imagine this conversation going every time.
this is the equivalent of I go to school in Boston/Cambridge
Nothing wrong with saying Berkeley either
humble brag to who? this is the berkeley sub
yeah good thing i didn’t apply
Interesting. I had the opposite experience. The Cal students I hired were whip smart, quick learners, self-motivated hard workers who needed little supervision of their work. All in all, a real pleasure to work with. But when it came to UC Santa Cruz grads, my experience was more like yours - they had a different work ethic. My sample size was too small to draw conclusions about everyone graduating from those two schools, but my experience does bias me towards hiring Cal grads. To the original poster, I appreciate your humility but you should be proud of your accomplishment at being a Cal student. You won its admissions lottery and seem very grateful for that. But you likely put in the hard work to get the grades for admission. I hope you take advantage of all of the opportunities the school provides. They are amazing.
more embarrassing that you’re lurking in this sub🫣
Andy Bernard!
It is a shitty place tho, nothing's in Ithaca apart from having pride that you aren't ithaca college
I just said “UC”
I’m a Berkeley native, so just talking trash…
I completely agree with this^ some people don’t want accomplishments to represent their identity
At least you can look forward to nobody ever caring about where you went to school again after you graduate.
It's absolutely important to impress your peers as well. This is how you can get opportunities. People will reach out to you for help. For example, I tell everyone that I am eecs all the time and sometimes people would pay me handsomely to code some stuff for them. This is why you have to let people know you are capable and intelligent or else opportunities will never reach you.
Exactly, WE are Berkeley and its reputation not some preconceived notion. Each interaction is a chance to tangibly define what a golden bear really is. I NEVER thought anyone would look up to me or revere me. However (when I was younger), people were examples to me, so maybe it's my turn. My acceptance letter meant that others were rejected. I will honor my acceptance by being as cool and upstanding as I can be. Remember, people know what acceptance to Berkeley means. Being too humble can have the opposite effect intended.
Hell yeah, yay us!!!!
Yes absolutely!!! Being disabled, DSP (Disabled Students Program) has been my hub for information. However, it is not my only resource. MAKE THE TRANSFER STUDENT CENTER YOUR HUB! They are legit and will make your transition easier. They are very welcoming and extremely helpful. ASK THEM FOR EVERYTHING!!! I am already learning that Berkeley has LOTTS OF RESOURCES!! But, you have to ask for them. Don't know specifically?, then ask for everything. Make an appointment today. Look into the eop program, ce3, sss, reentry and, owls programs also. Best of luck and Fiat Lux fellow transfer re-entry!!!
Probably they got a PhD because they really love to teach and learn math, not to make boatloads of money. And getting a good university tenure track job is not a walk in the park no matter what degree you have
teaching at a community college is great. i know people who have been able to work from home with online classes and still make 6 figures. and you’re not required to do research
Wow. Okay.  I attended a CA cc, transferred to Cal, graduated with honors, wanted to learn more and find out what research was about. I got into the PhD program and enjoyed every minute of it, but especially the teaching. I did go on to work at an ""elite"" liberal arts college on the east coast, and then a big flagship university in the midwest, but decided to ""give back"" by returning to CA to mentor other STEM students from underrepresented groups. I was never interested in a career in industry.
Person finding out in real time that making a bag is not the only pursuit of life.
I don't know if it would work for most people here haha. I went to a different school, so when people ask, I say 

""I went to college out of state, that's why I'm so glad to be back in California for grad school, because I like it here, isn't this a great place, etc...""
It’s almost like he can’t be any more on-brand LMAO
I've heard sermons less preachy
people don’t usually pry like that and saying bay area is more specific. plus you can just sorta move onto the next topic. but if they directly asked ofc i would say
Fax
I literally said this, this morning. Lmao.
I’d be more embarrassed that your sub-conscious mind believes going to Cal is some sort of accomplishment…
And thank you Reddit gods for tossing me this softball today! God is good!
Used to think it was just a joke, but everyone I know who went to Cornell (for whatever reason a lot of people I know went there) does this all the time.

“I’m going to hang out with my Cornell friends this weekend.”

“You mean your friends?”

“Yeah, that’s what I said. My Cornell friends.”
Shitty place as in the university itself or the locale? If the latter, I agree with you. It’s hella boring up there. But the university is actually great. It’s just not as great as Cornell people make it out to be — which is almost to the exclusion of every school that’s “not Ivy.”

Calm down. It’s just Cornell.
I like the part about maybe it’s your turn. That’s a beautiful concept and an important reminder
Cornell is the asscrack of the ivies, highest acceptance rate and all of their students got rejected from the rest. You’d think that they make up 90% of total Ivy grads based on people volunteering their school though."
"Berkeley Law professor writes piece in WSJ titled ""Don’t Hire My Anti-Semitic Law Students"" regarding pro-Palestinian students at Berkeley",https://archive.ph/7Ruos,2023-10-16 19:36:23,,"I feel like equating criticism of Israel with antisemitism also means that you think 'being a real Jew' requires active participation in erasing Palestine from the map.
First of all, as someone supportive of Palestine, I just want to state unequivically that I am against any type of antisemitism. Further than that, I think it's important for people in this movement, especially in the West, to actively campaign against any anti-semitic tendencies they see, both within this movement and beyond. The pro-Palestine movement is really about human rights, anti-discrimination and (this week) being against an active genocide committed by the current far-right Israeli government, not the Jewish people.

That being said, I think this piece written by Prof. Solomon is incredibly tone deaf. He is using age-old accusations to drown out any criticism of Israel, and further blaming the students at our university for speaking out against rightful human rights abuses of a long-oppressed people. Not once in his article (published on Oct 15th) does he mention the active bombing and the thousands of Palestinian civilians (including over 800 children) killed by the IDF this past week. As a matter of fact, he doesn't even mention the existence of Palestinian civilians at all! He talks about the Jewish people deserving of a homeland (which I don't deny, hence the near universal support for the two state solution), but does not mention the millions of Palestinians they have displaced and are now bombing to achieve a greater expansion to that homeland beyond the UN approved international boundaries. 

UC Berkeley, once the birthplace of the free speech movement, has always been a place of student activism for a variety of important causes. Students here should be proud to keep speaking on behalf of the causes that matter to them, that's what free speech is! To have this one professor at Berkeley Law tell law firms to not hire students supporting this cause, and that being pro-Palestine equates antisemitism, is downright offensive and in my opinion anti free speech. I just wanted to post this here so more people can see this disgraceful article by Prof. Solomon.
Anti zionism is not anti semitism
Stanford and Harvard faculty are writting pro-Palestine op-eds and Berkeley faculty are writting pro-Israel op-eds... classic.  UC always does the opposite of elite private schools on virtually every issue.  It's truly shocking.
I wonder if Professor Solomon’s own ethnic identity plays into his hardline opinion. He believes in his position so much that his is willing to sideline his students’ future for their beliefs. 

Also, any teacher who wishes ill for his students is morally bankrupt and resign.
Ok so multiple things can be true at once. A few thoughts: 

The leftists really fucked it over for themselves when they refused to condemn Hamas. Strategically, politically, everything they say and argue for now falls on deaf ears. It was really stupid to frame a terrorist attack as ‘liberation’ and I believe for most people this stems from ignorance, not directly their hatred of Israeli Jews (although that is the unintended effect, sadly, and it is antisemitic to willfully ignore Jewish trauma). 

That being said….EVERY statement from University SJPs (which, yes, I believe are antisemitic but that’s a discussion for another time) that have come out after their initial stupidity has explicitly condemned Hamas for killing innocent Israeli civilians. YES Israel, the state, bears most of the blame for this tragedy (Haaretz argued this, many Israelis feel this way, it’s not a hot take). And YES, now the focus does have to be on Gaza and the Palestinians because innocent families are being slaughtered by the thousands. The devastation and destruction this war will cause to Palestinian civilians verges on being ethnic cleansing. 

Does Israel have the right to protect themselves and attack Hamas? Yes, without any doubt. Do they have the right to cut off gas, water, effectively pursue a military strategy that makes it impossible for thousands of civilians to receive basic medical care, food, or to leave before their houses are bombed? No. Remember that Israel is being supported by most of the major powers of the world. Gaza and the Palestinians have basically no one (Arab states talk the talk, they don’t do shit). It is an asymmetrical war and innocent Palestinians will face the largest burden. 

So yes, as things look now, we must be for Palestine. And unfortunately, the people most vocal for Palestinian support are these idiots.
Huge stretch from a reasonable criticism of an anti-free-speech bylaw that banned supporters of Israel from speaking at events, written and passed while a hot Israel-Palestine war is currently ongoing and there are very reasonable concerns about pro-israeli speakers propagandizing the public into thinking that all Palestinians are Hamas and that collective punishment of Palestinians (illegal under international law...mr. lawyer) a.k.a. a genocide against Palestinians is a legitimate response to Hamas terrorism. This professor's remarks are pretty run of the mill: ignore the details of the political context of the war, denounce anything that isn't abjectly pro-israel and label it as antisemitic. 

A siege of Gaza will be the most atrocious humanitarian situation of our lifetime. To help instantiate the political conditions for Israel to get away with a siege by shouting ""ANTISEMITISM"" at anyone who wants make sure we are talking about how Israel shouldn't murder innocent gazans is disgusting. 

Sincerely, a proud Jew, professional political scientist and opposer of genocide against Palestinians.
>Last year, Berkeley’s Law Students for Justice in Palestine asked other student groups to adopt a bylaw that banned supporters of Israel from speaking at events. It excluded any speaker who “expressed and continued to hold views or host/sponsor/promote events in support of Zionism, the apartheid state of Israel, and the occupation of Palestine.” Nine student groups adopted the bylaw. Signers included the Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association, the Queer Caucus and the Women of Berkeley Law.

I would oppose such a measure on the basis of support for free speech; I don't think it does supporters of Palestinian liberation any good by trying to simply isolate themselves from other viewpoints. 

That being said I would strongly reject the idea the idea that disassociating from supporting Israeli apartheid or the occupation of Palestine is somehow anti semitic. *It is not*. There are plenty of Americans of all faiths (25% of [American Jews](https://www.jta.org/2021/07/15/united-states/more-american-jews-are-calling-israel-an-apartheid-state-and-big-organizations-are-struggling-to-fight-the-trend), for example, regard Israel to be an Apartheid state) who agree with such a position and it is endorsed by major [human](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution) [rights](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/) organizations. As for occupation, well the annexation of East Jerusalem and construction of settlements is considered illegal under international law. Attempting to portray such views as anti-semitic is a deflection, no different than classifying opposition to Putinism and the Russian invasion of Ukraine as ""Russophobic"".

>The bylaw caused an uproar. It was rightly criticized for creating “Jew-free” zones. Our dean—a diehard liberal—admirably condemned it but said free-speech principles tied his hands. The campus groups had the legal right to pick or exclude speakers based on their views. The bylaw remains, and 11 other groups subsequently adopted it.

I would dispute the idea that it creates ""Jew-free"" zones; there are plenty of Jewish Americans who are critical of the Israeli government and its policies. Certain groups of Americans (like Evangelicals) are also very likely to support the present Israeli government and policies and would be excluded. But I oppose the bylaw anyways so I won't labor the point.

>You don’t need an advanced degree to see why this bylaw is wrong. For millennia, Jews have prayed, “next year in Jerusalem,” capturing how central the idea of a homeland is to Jewish identity. By excluding Jews from their homeland—after Jews have already endured thousands of years of persecution—these organizations are engaging in anti-Semitism and dehumanizing Jews. They didn’t include Jewish law students in the conversation when circulating the bylaw. They also singled out Jews for wanting what we all should have—a homeland and haven from persecution.

No, the organizations are not justifying or legitimizing the treatment of Jews by anti-semitic governments throughout history - that is a baseless condescension. They are criticizing how the construction of Israel [historically played out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba) and its present effects, as well as present discriminatory policies by the Israeli government. Acknowledging the role which religion played in the Zionist ideology which pushed for a Jewish homeland, does not mean that Israel or the goals and outcomes of Zionism are somehow immune from criticism.

The rest of the article is not relevant to Berkeley and I don't know the context to it, so I will ignore it for now. I will say as a general note, that it is very true that anti-semitism is a problem in groups which are critical of Israel, both on the Berkeley campus and elsewhere. Such individuals should be held to account. And orgs need to do a better job of rooting out anti semitic individuals. But this article clearly attempts to use this to delegitimize views which are *not anti-semitic*. The author is being dishonest.
Zionist cancel culture
Regardless of political beliefs, this is just unprofessional coming from a faculty member here.
If you're paying this much money for your degree, and a professor is actively encouraging employers not to hire you, why the fuck would you want this professor to still work there? 

Students, faculty, etc should demand that he be fired immediately.
All educated people support Palestine and denounce the atrocities committed by the white settler colonial government of Israel
if you really support Palestinians you would firstly and mostly protest against Hamas, pure and simple. They are a death cult. they torture and harm Palestinians on a daily basis, they steal money donated by the EU and others to build their mansions, or their tunnels and their missiles.

They probably committed this atrocity to stop the peace talks with Saudi Arabia, which would have granted big benefits to Palestinians according to reports.

Some demand citizens of Israel to fight against the occupation, yet they ignore one of the biggest hurdles for peace, which is Hamas and the like.

Most of these student would be abused in Gaza by Hamas for who they are. women would be enslaved, gays killed, and their free speech rewarded with torture. and the very human rights they fight for, spitted on and vilified by the people they are trying to save.

and above all, most of these students will never see the real world harm and pain caused by their ignorant and self sabotaging actions in Palestine because they will be somewhere else.
Lmao
This law professor seems very ignorant and not qualified to be a professor #freepalestine. Imagine supporting apartheid and genocide in Palestine? Couldn’t be me
Free Palestine 🇵🇸, they deserve to have their own state
This professor should be rallied against
These dumb bitches are incapable of not bitching. They want to support disgusting and degenerate criminal states *and* want to be applauded for it. Using their positions of immense power and influence *and* bitch like a victim for doing so.


Zionshits in the USA finally feeling what it means to have skin in the game. Browbeating sophist scum.
[deleted]
If you ask me, I would say finally someone had the balls to tell the truth about these people. Most of them still refuse to condemn the recent attacks by Hamas. Sure Israel did its part in terror attacks before, but at least they didn’t publicly announce them and were not proud of it. But what Hamas did? They intentionally did their best to maximize civilian casualties, they filmed every bit of their actions, they published those films, they celebrated that attack, and they are proud of it. So, if someone refuses to condemn such actions and instead tries to justify them by making excuses, they are no different than their beloved terrorists!
The article itself is referencing an event from last year but SJP groups at Berkeley (and other college campuses) have been pushing the envelope for years flirting with antisemitism. Aspiring lawyers should know that freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences.

People get fired or lose job offers because of their social media stances all the time. Especially in the law profession. It is client facing and in stuffy professional/corporate environments. Clients do not want extra controversies from their lawyers all of places. It is not a career you should be in if you need to be expressing your personal controversial or offensive opinions loudly. 

More importantly than the bylaw drama mentioned, in a BearsForPalestine (cosigned by Law Students for JP) post they said quote, ""glory to the resistance and glory to our martyrs"" the day after the Hamas attack. It reads directly like Hamas propaganda and there ***should*** be consequences.
Good, anti semites have no place in our society and should be held to account for their harmful views

Going after students for responding emotionally is bad and I disagree with it, but you can file this along with the thousands of other examples where anything you put your name to publicly will be picked apart if anyone determines you to be the ""enemy"". My advice is to discuss controversial thoughts with your friends and to be very careful when putting stuff out in public.  It sucks that things are that way but that is how it is.
It would be a lot more convenient if you guys had discovered your interest at literally any point in time over the last decade besides the exact moment in which a speech issue affected your own interests.
Yikes…
Most jewish folks can't be unbiased about this conflict, which is understandable given the history.  That said, this prof is a dickhead and if I was on that list I would sue him till the cows come home.  And shame on WSJ for printing that garbage.  Jewish folks need to grow a thicker skin and learn to take criticism (about Israel) like everybody else, stop hiding behind WWII to shut down  discussions you don't like.  The list of zionists, who have stood by silently while the Palestinians have been treated brutally for decades, is way longer - let's publish that list.
Lol bitch made professor. He ain't about that shit in person
[deleted]
This is awful
I will never ever hire Israeli or proJewish Berkeley students who are bigots like you Solomon and are disgustingly disrespectful to innocent Palestinians' lives and wellness.
Hamas wants Jews exterminated.  If Palestinian want actual peace they would turn on Hamas and get Hamas out.  I have yet heard news from Palestinians calling for extermination of Hamas.  My reasoning behind this is they probably have relatives part of Hamas.
Weird that someone can be pro-fictional place like Palestine… that’s like be pro-clitoris.
lol oh so NOW SJWs are a problem eh?
its very easy - condemn Hamas . They are responsible. They have been using Palestinians as human shields for years.
If you think that the racists in this country hate Jewish people more than they hate Muslims you gotta be outta your mind.
Israel should never negotiate with the Palestinians again, no matter who leads them.

Israel already offered Palestinians independent state in Gaza and West Bank with no blockade and no restrictions and included right of return for 90% of Palestinian refugees.

Palestinians rejected this in 1981, 1990, 1998, and 2003.

Palestinians arent interested in any kind of compromise.  Just listen to their chants.  ""From the river to the sea Palestine will be free""
We also need to be clear on another thing.

USA is a direct sponsor of Hamas terrorism.

Every hospital you build, every food bank you sponsor, Hamas jumps for joy because the taxes they collect from the Palestinians can go 100% to rockets and AK-47s instead of medical aid or food.
Very good for the professor
Tortious interference with employment
People whom Jews kill need a cool word like “antisemitism” .. not taking sides, just stating a fact
If you call out only the Israeli government and not other governments, it’s possibly antisemitic.

If 10 white kids and 1 white kid in a classroom and obviously breaking dress code and one the 1 black kid is punished or called out, is that racist?
If Israel wanted to erase Palestine from the map they would have by now.
Correction, wiping HAMAS off the map. Get it right buddy.

Banning people from speaking who support Israel, which disproportionately effects Jewish people, is I think a step beyond criticism. 

I expected the smaller orgs to sign on, but Women of Berkeley signing is crazy.
Ripping posters of missing children and celebrating Hamas is not “criticism of Israel”
There’s another group in this country that uses this tact successfully everyday, and applauded for it, so why not try it for themselves.
I'm Jewish and I think what Israel is doing to Palestinians is appalling.  I've been called anti-Semitic, a self-hating Jew, an endorser of genocide, and many other fun things.

We've had the discussion at countless family events over the years.   I can say from my own experience: there is no reasoning with the vast majority of Zionists.  There are two main camps: 1) the crazy-religious-ones who think they have a god-given right to Israel and 2) the \~slightly more sane Zionists who support Israel and whatever the IDF does because ""Jews need/deserve a homeland.""  ""There are plenty of Arab countries."" ""But these people aren't from those  countries, and they want to return to their homes.""  Doesn't matter.  In Zionists' eyes, Jews have a right to Palestine and Palestinian Arabs simply don't.

Prof. Solomon seems to fall into the quasi-secular second camp from above.  ""Jews deserve a homeland.""  That's my cousin's favorite go-to statement.  She'll then mention the Holocaust, I'll point out that two wrongs don't make a right, and that Palestinians lived there, and ""you can't just ethnically cleanse a region because you want it,"" and it's just brushed away.  No one and nothing else matters because ""Jews deserve a homeland.""

If you care, I'd say 'vote accordingly,' but, for reasons I do not understand, both major political parties in the US seem to support Israel, no matter what it does.  It's not even a platform issue that's discussed; support for Israel is simply assumed.

I think the only thing you can do is write your congresspeople - tell them that you want to cut US support for Israel.  Make your reps know that it's not a popular position with their voters, or the younger generation.  That's really it, I think.

My grandparents were buried with concentration camp ID # tattoos on their wrists.  I got a nice form letter back from Obama when I detailed my family history and my take on the conflict.  

I'll be sending Biden a similar letter soon.  And my reps.
Was called an anti semite recently because I denounce the doctrine of Zionism.. I’ll start off by saving as one with Jewish decent, if you saw me, you’d know I wouldn’t last 3 minutes in the middle of a Berlin street at the peak of 1942. I’m more Jewish looking than Moses and Jesus themselves. But I denounce Zionism because most of us Sephardics and mizrahims know that there was regional stability and peace for thousands of years before the Europeans got to the area. More specifically, the European Jews (Ashkenazim) who drafted the white paper for Zionism. Most of us middle eastern Jews were actually alienated by them during the creation of Israel lol so it’s no surprise they scream antisemite, and all this garbage when they get just an ounce of criticism.. pulling the holocaust as a means to justify your stance is not honorable when the topic at hand is something completely irrelevant or even damaging. We don’t know what else happened up there in Europe but these brothers came down here with some real trauma they started taking out on the Palestinians and that’s a fact. They white washed the footage clean off the internet but my dad used to show me videos of how they would bulldoze Palestinians alive underground the same way the nazis did to them. If those videos are to resurface today I think the White House would have a hard time justifying it’s oddly unconditional support for Israel. I say oddly, but after you find out about Mossad honeypot strategies like Epstein it becomes no surprise why there’s that level of “support”.
How is it anti-free speech to tell future employers not to hire what some deem to be problematic students? Everyone is free to espouse their beliefs, whether it’s pro-Israel or pro-Palestine. But you can’t run away from the consequences of your words if other private individuals and companies decide your speech doesn’t align with their core values.
you have no idea of what free speech means.  free speech doesnt mean freedom of consequences. Also I hope you keep the same energy for people who dont talk about israel citizens .
What exactly is tone deaf about it?

>Not once in his article (published on Oct 15th) does he mention the active bombing and the thousands of Palestinian civilians (including over 800 children) killed by the IDF this past week.

To be fair, that's not really the topic of the article, he's specifically writing about what he sees as anti-Semitic bylaws being adopted by student groups on campus, not the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in general.

>Students here should be proud to keep speaking on behalf of the causes that matter to them, that's what free speech is!

So then what do you think of these student group bylaws that ban supporters of Israel from speaking at events?

>and that being pro-Palestine equates antisemitism

Where in the article does he say this?
> the near universal support for the two state solution

Near zero pro-Palestinians believe it, they want to ethnically cleanse Jews from the entire former Mandate. Maybe Zionists (who would come out way ahead) or people in the middle.

There were literally hundreds of people chanting outside the gate today “No Jewish state / back to ‘48” or something to that affect.
You’re being incredibly tone-deaf. You can’t condemn anti-semitism and then argue that the palistinian movement is about human rights, days after Hamas beheaded children, tied children together tortured them by cutting out body parts and then shot them and raped women and children. You are quite literally actively calling for this to continue. Any sane person would realize that peace is impossible while Hamas exists (elected by Gazans) and to act like this massacre is the Jews fault is absolutely 100% antisemetic. No two ways about it.
So you want to stifle his right to free speech because you don’t agree with what he’s saying, this after stating Berkeley is where the free speech movement started, so much logic.
👍
As an employer and alum who is not Jewish and has never been to Israel, I concur with the professor.

I wouldn’t hire any student associated with controversial views  (unless I specifically worked for a controversial political activist group). And given I work for a for-profit, inherently capitalist business, any far left views are decidedly controversial and thus particularly disqualifying in my book. Speaking with many of my colleagues and friends, my perspective reflects the broad consensus at not only at elite law firms, but at investment banks, private equity firms, management consultancies, and F500 corporates

For clarity any of the following views if parroted in letters/social media/other public forums would be disqualifying:
- Strong views for or against abortion
- Strong views for or against the 2nd amendment
- Support for politicians who rail against my industry (Sanders, AOC, etc)
- Support for Castro/Putin regimes
- racism, sexism, etc
- Support for any organization deemed to be a terrorist Group by the federal government 
- Support for efforts to evade federal laws, including immigration/drug laws

UC Berkeley is anti free speech. Ya’ll only like a certain type of speech.

You see for the last 5 years we were told any conservative is a trump supporter and trump supporters are Nazis/fascists so ergo all conservatives are fascists. All those sayings about if there’s a rally with a 1000 people and 1 is a Nazi that’s a 1000 Nazis… well now that applies to pro-Palestine people and the handful of full on  hamas sympathizers or anti-semites that are amount the crowd.
Your omission of the Oct. 7 massacre and implication that Israel’s current actions are due to a desire to take more land is ill informed at best and at worst, exactly what the professor is warning about.
Why do Jewish people deserve a homeland at the expense of others though? This is a 100 year old problem. The Bible is not a 2,000 year old property deed. It wasn't even a deed back then. When Arabs say they want to  ""erase Israel"" does it mean they want to gas people or does it mean that the Jewish state was ill gotten re-appropriation of their land? 9/11 was a terrorist event. No one going to work that day or on those planes should have died. Just like no innocent Israelis should have died. But after 9/11 we all examined what would drive people to such evil. It's not wrong to do that. And it's not anti semitic.
What do you mean that the left has refused to condemn Hamas? Almost every major liberal group is still very pro Israel (Biden and the mainstream dem party). Most (if not all) of those in Congress that are more left than the Dem party have condemned Hamas ( AOC, Omar, Sanders). 

There are some groups to the left that are pro Hamas but largely they do not have power within the left community. But the left is not one organization. For example the Communist Party of Israel stands with Palestinians but condemns Hamas. The Communist Party of America, has said it is aligning itself with the CPI but I don't know if they have specifically condemned Hamas. I've heard that other left groups have been pro hamas (not really sure if that is true). Leftism is based on economic principles not necessarily geopolitical ones. That being said, leftism is inherently at odds with Fascism so naturally is going to go against Zionist.
Sorry, but there will be no sense to be made of the response from the West, *especially* the United States, because Americans have zero ground to stand on. 

The US ethnically cleansed an entire gigantic landmass with brutal efficiency, and anyone arguing to the extent they’re getting worked up over it is just such a gigantic amount of cognitive dissonance on display. 

The SJW crowd yells for land back, yet probably don’t have half a clue as to the continued oppression of indigenous people in the West, in their own backyard. Being infuriated over Zionist colonialism while reaping the benefits of stolen land is comically incredible. 

As for the pro-Zionist crowd, well, I guess they at least have no qualms about being a prick in full 4K.
>The left really fucked it over for themselves when they refused to condemn *the IDF*. Strategically, politically, everything they say and argue for now falls on deaf ears. It was really stupid to frame a terrorist attack as *‘retribution’* and I believe for most people this stems from ignorance, not directly their hatred of *Palestinian Arabs* (although that is the unintended effect, sadly, and it is antisemitic to willfully ignore *Palestinian trauma).*

You're relying on a bit of a double standard there.  

Your comment relies on the same weird pro-Israel slants that Western media has pushed for decades.  And I think they are the real issue, not Democrats' failure to condemn Hamas...which they have done extensively.
Nobody needs to condemn Hamas. The funding media already does that. Or are you one of those dumbasses who want every Palestinian to condemn Hamas before they’re allowed to speak about the horrors they are subjected to?
It's interesting how the professor in the article calls out his students who did not condemn the Hamas attack yet has no mention of condemning Israel's attack on Gaza....
[deleted]
As an American, what *exactly* is my protest against Hamas going to do? Does the US government fund their crimes? Are they one of our strongest allies? Do they hold ultimate power in Israel and the power to end the apartheid?

And then what? The answer is to look the other way when Israel is bombing and **indiscriminately** killing Palestinians? Your statement just seeks to shift a debate to something other than the active murder campaign being waged.

It should go without saying that Hamas *is* awful, but people protest Israel because Israel should be held to the standard of being ""the only Democracy in the middle east"" yet they operate as an apartheid state and are currently doling out collective punishment to the *people of Gaza* for the *crimes of Hamas* because they do not see Palestinian lives as worthwhile.

That's not ok, regardless of how deplorable *Hamas* is.
Every time someone brings up the Israeli war crimes there’s sure to be someone to redirect attention to Hamas.

Yes of course I condemn Hamas. They’re Islamic fundamentalists who have no place in the modern world. However, both Hamas and the IDF can be bad, and as more and more Palestinian civilians die from IDF bombing as retaliation I think it’s very fair to condemn that and call for a ceasefire right now, and a ceasefire won’t happen unless the IDF backs down.

That’s not even mentioning that part of Netanyahu and Likud’s whole strategy to divide Palestine is to prop up Hamas as an institution. To quote Netanyahu directly:

> “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,” he told a meeting of his Likud party’s Knesset members in March 2019. “This is part of our strategy – to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.”

[This is a direct quote from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.](https://archive.ph/H8LSL) Of course his strategy failed dramatically and turned into this horrible attack of civilians which was unanticipated by Israel, but supporting Hamas was definitely a method used by Netanyahu to divide Palestine.

You’re such a piece of shit it’s almost beyond satire
> if you really support Palestinians you would firstly and mostly protest against Hamas, pure and simple. 

“If you really support BLM you would firstly and mostly protest against black on black violence, pure and simple.”

If Israel/cops are actively murdering your population, I get why you’d focus on them rather than others who may have wronged you also.
They don’t protest Hamas because they support the extermination of the Jews.  Simple as that.  

Westerners simply don’t understand this. They are useful idiots to defend the holocaust.
Israel has been begging them to accept their own state for nearly a century. The Palestinians have denied every time.

Perhaps you mean Palestinians deserve to take over the Israeli state and send all Israelis back to Europe?  That’s the official platform of both Hamas and Fatah, so if you want them to have “their own state” that’d be what you’re referring to.
> If a student endorses hate, dehumanization or anti-Semitism, don’t hire him.

True, but this is someone who is equating any pro-Palestine support as ""hate, dehumanization or anti-Semitism"". If anything, his article is pretty dehumanizing for Palestinians. As I said above he doesn't even recognize that this land is also their homeland.
Most pro Palestinian freedom students at Berkeley refuse to condemn the attack? According to what?
[removed]
?
I agree that it's possible to criticize Israel without being antisemitic, but people need to stop making this point that Arabs are Semitic people and relating it to antisemitism. Everyone knows that the word ""antisemitism"" refers specifically to Jews, and trying to change the meaning to muddy the waters of the debate is not productive to anyone trying to make legitimate criticisms of Israel.
> Palestinian people are by definition Semitic Arabs.

Antisemitism has NEVER been used to refer to anti-arab racism. Saying that is just used to dismiss acts of violence against jews. It's very obvious acts labeled anti-semitism are against jews and not arabs.
""Projewish""? So ... Jewish? FYI not hiring someone based on their social media posts is acceptable, not hiring someone based on their religion... Not okay.
What other governments are you thinking of? Israel definitely isn't the sole player since they are being backed by the West but they have the most direct power in this situation. If you mean Hamas as a political entity then ofc they are also in the bad, but there is a clear asymmetry in power so treating them as equally capable of ending this conflict is just wrong.

Also, you can't tell me with a straight face that the Israeli government represents Judaism. That would be like saying criticizing the BJP in India is anti-Hindu.
That’s a ridiculous statement. Ofc Israel wants Palestine off the map but ofc the rest of the world wouldn’t allow it so they can’t.
Right so you’re just going to ignore the Israeli settler colonialism happening in the West Bank (where there isn’t Hamas) and not see that as wanting to kick Palestinians off their land. There is no dispute that it is illegal. The UNSC has stated that its a massive violation of international law.
What trick? Would be pretty antisemitic to assume all Jewish people support Israel and if they don't then they are 'fake' and 'self-hating'.
Lmao your entire account is just making up antisemetism
Most Jewish people, even inside Israel, do not support the actions of the Israeli government. In fact I've seen more criticism of them from their own citizens then people in the West.

This is like saying ""banning people who support Trump, which disproportionately effects White people, is a step beyond criticism""
You know most Jewish people don't live in Isreael, right?
I don’t think so. This you also equating a single religion to a group of people, which isn’t the case. People are already having a hard time and want to equate anti-semitism to pro-Palestine when Palestinians are literally Semetic people. Not to say the interaction present with all 3 religions both in Israel and Palestine. Having people chanting they support Israel while they happen to be Jewish is what makes people think that being against Israel is being anti-Semite, no different then thinking that being pro-Palestine is viewed as pro-Hamas. The difference is that both narratives only really affects those supporting Palestine and Palestinians.
Don't group those people as the same as those who agree with me. Notice how I've only been criticizing Israel's government, not the people, who are equally as valuable as Palestinians. Also I never said that Hamas is a good force. There's a difference between retaliatory violence for the sake of violence versus violence as a response to systematic oppression. Why are people instantly assuming that all opinions are black and white when the truth is much more nuianced? Are people really having that difficult of a time accepting that when push comes to shove, violence comes out?
US needs an ally in the Middle East, and Israel is the US foothold in the region
> for reasons I do not understand, both major political parties in the US seem to support Israel,

Thank you for the depth of your response
Im Jewish and grew up going to Hebrew school. I am not orthodox but I can confidentially say that Judaism is a non-negligible part of who I am. At my synagogue, we were taught that Jews deserved to have a country that they could call their home, safe from antisemitism. After all, there is no other country whose national religion is Judaism and Israel is supposedly where the Jews originated anyway. But never, in any way whatsoever, did anyone claim that this would need to come at the cost of other groups of people. The quarter splits of Jerusalem was taught as a fair compromise and the Palestinian territories were always presented as temporary solutions towards peace in the future. 

Having been to several synagogues in the US, I have yet to find one that doesn't champion coexistence.

At this point I don't know what to think anymore. It doesn't seem like the leaders on either side of this conflict have any interest in long term peace. The whole situation seems fueled by little more than vengeance and despair. I've held this opinion for a while now, but religion brings out the worst in people and I wish I could just be proud to be Jewish. Instead I'm stuck with the stereotypes and having to avoid the topic altogether to dodge the accusations of being a warmonger.
As another Jew - good faith question. I agree on the premise that the whole situation is a mess. But what do you think is a real practical solution to this problem now? Because I've heard Palestinians say they won't accept a compromise and want ""all the land back"" which just seems unrealistic after many wars getting us to this point, multiple generations, etc. And we can't deny that most of their neighboring countries would happily eliminate the Jews from the region entirely if given the chance.
The United States supports Israel, yes, but with conditions. If Israel really committed the crime of genocide, the US will stop supporting Israel for sure. 

Both Israel and Palestine deserve land and human rights. However, if you look backwards, Arab countries initiated 4 of 5 wars against Israel. I am asking you a question: which side tends to live with the other side? which side has been wanting to kick the other side out of the region?

I have no answer for you. However, I have observed many Arab countries ultimately give up on the idea of kicking Israel out of the region, Egypt first, then Jordan, UAE, etc. A few insist on harassing Israel day and night. 

I am not saying Israel did nothing wrong. I wish the best for both Palestinians and jews.
Why did Jews leave the middle east in the first place?  They should have stayed there for thousands of years to claim land legitimately now.  

But anyway, I'm not a fan of the 'eye for an eye' philosophy in the Torah.  I think the Jews should have listened to Jesus, if everyone takes an eye for an eye everyone will become blind.  And that is exactly what we're seeing today with conflit vetween Arabs and Jews.  The rejecting of the New Testament is the primary problem with the Jews -- they're kind of assholes.  It isn't surprising to be hated all throughout history based on the values described in the Old Testament IMO.
[deleted]
Wait so as a Jew whats your solution for the millions of Jews that currently live in Israel? The Arabs and Palestinians obviously will ethnically cleanse the area without the IDF. 

Honestly it seems that even thought you had many conversations with family members you have a very naive understanding of the history of the area.  

BTW, if your solution is getting all of us an American citizenship like yours I’m all up for it, where do I sign up? 

If not can you please say what you would do differently as an Israeli Jew that isn’t into being raped, decapitated or kidnapped? 
Meaning, not as a super privileged American Jew?
>Prof. Solomon seems to fall into the quasi-secular second camp from above. ""Jews deserve a homeland."" That's my cousin's favorite go-to statement. She'll then mention the Holocaust, I'll point out that two wrongs don't make a right, and that Palestinians lived there, and ""you can't just ethnically cleanse a region because you want it,"" and it's just brushed away. No one and nothing else matters because ""Jews deserve a homeland.""

The historical arguments are irrelevant though. Largely anyone pushed out in the Nakba is dead now.  

Likewise, people born in a country should have a right to determine the path for their own country and must be democratic.

So Jews only deserve a homeland by principles of self determination. The same rules apply to Palestinians given the much stronger preference for a two state solution (assuming only options are democratic).
You wrote a very informative post, thanks. It is a shame that we can't see a feasible solution while we have to watch the humanity disasters taking place everyday in the area. Maybe Israel and Palestine have gone too far, beyond the line where compromising remains possible. Let's pray for the peace.
If the shoe fits... yeah you are an antisemite.
>because I denounce the doctrine of Zionism..

I'm not understanding your position. The historical context makes sense to say ""I would have opposed Zionism in 1920"", but is irrelevant for Zionism (whatever you define that as) today.

e.g. I would have opposed European colonization of America, but that doesn't mean I oppose self-determination for modern day Americans. 

>But I denounce Zionism because most of us Sephardics and mizrahims know that there was regional stability and peace for thousands of years before the Europeans got to the area.

A descendant of a Mizrahi Jew today is far better off being in Israel than the counterfactual of being in other Middle Eastern countries even if Israel were never created.

And the Ottoman Empire was an extremely violent place, especially near the end.
By definition, sure, free speech as codified in law only means free speech from the government. 

However, the principles behind free speech have always been *""I don't agree with what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.""* For a professor at Berkeley to activately advocate for more and more consequences for students exercising that right to speech then is not illegal, but it's definitely morally reprehensible. 

Furthermore, we're not talking about free speech for anything here, this is free speech to stop active war crimes. If we're not even allowed to speak out about that what can we speak out about?
It's anti-free speech (colloquially) because this message coming from a professor (i.e. someone with power over students whose opinion is respected by those in his field) is basically threatening students into silence and not participating in student organizations because if they do, their future livelihoods can/will be impacted. 

Sure, there are consequences for saying -anything- but you can't ignore the fact that this is reprehensible behavior from someone with power whose argument is that students aren't respecting people's freedom of speech.  It's inconsistent with the value he claims to want to uphold and quite frankly an abuse of power.
braindead take tbh

free speech as an ideal has always been more than just the legal definition. a professor should not be ""cancelling"" students over their political opinions.
seriously?
Seriously. This commenter's agenda is transparent when they say that Israel is currently bombing Gaza just 'to expand their borders."" Completely ignoring an unprecedented, bloody terrorist attack that killed over a thousand people. Sure, it's just because Israel is greedy, definitely not self-defense at all. /s
No speaker is entitled to an invitation to speak at any event by any institution. It's weird that people get in their feelings about students wanting to make sure the speakers they invite are ideologically aligned with what their organization represents. Furthermore, no organization is FORCED to incorporate the bylaws - so what is the problem?  

Also, there are [37 states in which it's illegal for public institutions, public servants, and businesses to call for or engage in the boycott of Israel](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation). Hell, teachers have to sign contracts saying they won't boycott Israel. The Supreme Court has pretty much upheld these laws as constitutional and not a violation of freedom of speech. I'd wager that this professor has no problem with this clear violation of freedom of speech... 

It's clear that this professor conflates Israel (the state, government, and its policies) with Jewish individuals. He argues that by banning people with pro-Israel/zionist ***ideologies***, student organizations are being anti-semitic as if Zionism was a core part of Judaism or of being ethnically Jewish. It isn't. In fact, many Jewish people are NOT zionists. And there exist zionists who are Christian (for a variety of fucked up reasons). This is because Zionism is a political ideology, a movement. Not an identity.
How does one act of terror justify an even greater act of terror against civilians? You make a lot of claims that were not independently verified, like the beheaded babies. Also keep in mind that for years Netanyahu has been the one to prop up Hamas in desperate attempts to prevent the formation of an independent Palestinian state. Israel definitely had something to do with it. That's not even to mention the illegal occupation, subjugation and regular murder committed by Israel against the Palestinians that they have a right to take an armed resistance against.
Does it not bother you that most rights for marginalized groups were once controversial? That Nelson Mandela was considered a terrorist in US for the longest time, that support for lgbt+ and civil rights were once extremely controversial? Do you not favor the morality of the views at all - just how socially acceptable they are? 

Because I guess I know which side of history you’d be in in all those cases. And now you’re on the side of history that condones war crimes.
the propaganda talking points get more ridiculous the more they’re frantically repeated. Do some research please
Lol, I ain’t reading all that bro.

I still support Palestine tho.
A significant number of leftist groups on college campus, that I know from Berkeley and I’ve seen from other schools, as well as DSA chapters throughout the country, released statements in the initial aftermath of the music festival tragedy did not condemn Hamas rather stated they supported Palestinian liberation. Most organizations have since added nuance to their initial statement and have condemned Hamas’s attack; but the initial inability to do so initially has deligitmized the lefts pro Palestine stance significantly, to the average person and in politics.
they're not talking about actual establishment politicians that have actual constituents they have to answer to or future political aspirations to worry about. 

They're talking about basically the large majority of other groups on the left that have all the significant social capital and cultural influence over much of the discourse taking place amongst everyone under the age of 45 in the political activism sphere; such as BLM, DSA, Occupy, etc. and referring also what the overwhelmingly popular groupthink is on most college campuses across the US at the moment.

- Dozens of Harvard student unions [put their name on this objectively *wild* statement](https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1711153384953348169)


- Chicago BLM tweeted out a photo of a flyer that says ""I stand with palestine"" underneath a large sillhouette of a *hamas militant on a paraglider on their way to kill concertgoers*.... [you cant make this shit up.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000352743147_16969726248890_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBxQQ6WuIQQgwO_lxG6Qi9hzTGCWC9PvaVmCC6nXpnsE.jpeg)

- There's video of this incredibly snide, disgusting DSA bro talking into a megaphone at a rally in NYC making jokes and saying stuff like this:

>At a pro-Hamas rally on Sunday in the heart of New York City, speaker after speaker praised the slaughter of civilians that had taken place in Israel the day before, after the militant group overwhelmed Israeli defenses in an audacious, unexpected raid.

>“And as you might have seen, there was some sort of rave or desert party where they were having a great time, until the resistance came in on electrified hang gliders and took at least several dozen hipsters,” one speaker joked about the Hamas assault on a desert rave, where horrific scenes of murder and rape took place.

>""But I'm sure they're doing very fine, despite what the new york post says"" he added

[video](https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1711145162657673347)

look at the dozens of people gleefully cheering in that video... it's not a crowd of radicalized foreigners in hijabs... its a bunch of gleeful nyc millenial/genZ hipsters wearing $200 designer denim jackets and sipping starbucks. That's what people are referring to when they say ""the left""

another speaker (young college-aged american woman) got on the megaphone afterwards and called the events of oct 7th ""a glorious victory"" to more uproarious cheers from the crowd.
Its not a ‘Pro Israel’ slant it’s a pro people stance. Murdering a bunch of civilians at a music festival and praising that as ‘liberation’ or ‘retribution’ is bad. That’s not digestible to most people. And the fact people still don’t acknowledge that is quite telling. Literally the Palestinian President came out and condemned Hamas as a terrorist group.  

Jews are a minority in the world at .2% of the world population having been already decimated through multiple pogroms. Palestinians are an oppressed minority in the region on the verge of genocide. Let’s acknowledge the generational trauma violence faced by each population. You’re not winning anyone over by refusing to do so.
But I do agree, since the initial statements the left has unambiguously condemned Hamas, and the fact the media focus is still on this is indicative of how little Palestinian lives matter. But it also points to their stupidity of not clearly condemning this as a terrorist group in the first place cause all it does is delegitimize their arguments centering Palestine to the average person.
But to clarify, yah, I think everyone who came out after the initial terrorist attack in support of it (calling it liberation or decolonization or whatnot) does need to clarify their position otherwise they have lost their legitimacy. 

I generally don’t believe the Palestinian liberation encompasses or endorses Hamas. Just a political and strategic miscalculation by a vocal minority of communists, socialists, and on campus leftist organizations who have ruined it for those who are speaking up for war crimes against Palestinians happening now.
You must be really stupid if that’s what you got from what I wrote
No I think hate speech is pretty easy to define. Being pro Palestine doesn’t mean they’re antisemites. Obviously there’s going to be a few idiots here and there at every school that could be antisemites. But a professor placing such a wide negative label on their students is ridiculous 

It shows a complete lack of respect of his workplace and his job in general. 

It’s also just generally insane that someone could be paying 100k+ for a degree and their professor is preventing the students from getting hired. The students should have some amount of respect for themselves in this situation and demand to the university that he be fired
Exactly. Not to mention Hamas’ genesis and existence wouldn’t have come into being without the explicit support of the right wing Israel government for strategic purposes. Which is safe to say, Hamas is and has been in a symbiotic relationship with Netanyahu’s cabinet, or effectively an instrument of his governance. It’s only when shit hits the fan, that Hamas now becomes some terrorist group more grotesque than ISIS to Netanyahu. So if Hamas is to be held accountable, which undoubtedly should be, then so should Netanyahu
Israel DOES NOT indiscriminately kill civilians, they actually TARGET the military sites.  Meanwhile, Hamas puts their rockets in schools and hospitals.  When Hamas attacks, they pick soft civilian targets.  

Hamas is terrorist murderers and you say “oh well but Israel.”  Israel is defending themselves from butchers and trying to do so in a way to lower the casualties of Palestinian civilians, while Hamas is trying to increase civilian casualties on both sides as much as possible.  How on earth can you call it a fucking equivalence?  

Israel has offered peace for decades.  They’ve been treated to constant war, constant terrorism, constant intolerance.  

The ONLY solution Palestine would accept is extermination of the Jews in Israel.  Israel would accept two state and peaceful solutions.  They stop occupying Gaza for years and years and even tolerate Gaza continually firing fucking rockets at them on a constant basis.  But that isn’t enough.
you are clearly brainwashed. the very statement you choose to make bold is a lie.  you say "" Israel is bombing and indiscriminately killing Palestinians"". A total and complete lie.   


Israel has killed many innocent civilians, yes, but much less then any other nation that is at constant war and at constant conflict with a side that tries to get it won citizens killed as a political strategy. in fact, the Israeli army has worked more then any other army in history to try and avoid that. **Ask any military expert**. I say military expert, and not news pundit talking head, because what you need to compare to, is to other militaries (and specifically western militaries) operations.   


On the other hand, the military strategy of Hamas *is to indiscriminately kill civilians of both sides*. Exactly what you blamed israel for! So for you to lie about Israel, and that lie itself being a truth about Hamas, shows the duplicity and distorted moral gymnastics that some students in Berkeley are practicing casually.    


Now because of the lie you just said, i am sure you didn't want an answer to your frankly obtuse opening question, but i will try and give one. its peace. yea, i know, a dirty word.  more specifcally, denouncing and working against Hamas would:  
1.  put pressure on Western donations to make sure the money they send to Gaza is not misused.   
2. empower moderate Israeli (and Palestinian forces) that work for peace. its as simple as that.   
3. grant the pro Palestinian group legitimacy within more liberal and centrist circles to drive a unified American policy about Israel-Palestine that is sorely missing.
>It should go without saying that Hamas is awful

It should, but it doesn't. I've been looking for years to find a pro-Palestinian activist, demonstration, or organization that's openly opposed to terrorism but haven't found one yet.

Anyone who doesn't want to give off, ""I don't want to tell you my opinion on Hamas because we both know saying it out loud would undermine my lip service about being opposed to unspeakable hate and violence"" vibes really owes it to themselves to speak up. If not, you'll be sending out an uncomfortable subtext, whether you mean it or not
Black on black crime *is* the way bigger problem killing way, way, way more black people than cops. Yeah cops are abusing their power, which is more morally revolting, but less black people would be dead or deadended (in prison) if the community to curb black on black violence.

Pretty much every group everywhere needs to curb the damn violence.
what an ignorant take. Hamas is a totalitarian regime fueled by an extremist religious ideology, how on earth can you compare that to individual criminals within a community? Are trying to show that you know nothing about how the world works? you just proved my point that the lens thru which some students see the world is extremely myopic.
That is the dumbest thing ever, Israel is occupying the West Bank right now. No one is forcing them to be there. If they want, they could just withdraw anytime. In 2018 Fatah/PLO suspended their recognition of Israel until they recognize a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 border.

Their actions

They are not protesting Hamas.
Read the article and you will find the answer to your question.
Their excitement around the recent massacres in Israel and open celebration of “liberators”. Like, what?
And fucked your girlfriend too.
Lol I love how so many people just parrot that ridiculous argument (“Arabs can’t be anti-Semitic!”) — it’s literally straight out of the Kanye West/Kyrie Irving Jew-hating playbook for idiots.

(Guarantee half the people claiming that will move on to the ol’ “they aren’t even real Jews. They are Jew-ish! It’s right in the name!”)

True smooth brain logic.
Turkey in North Cyprus is literally the exact same story as Israel. Illegal occupation of half an EU state for decades. Massive settler colonialism. Greek Cypriots are second class citizens with few rights if they stay in the north. Turkey is a critical NATO ally for the US. I’m shocked that nobody mentioned it in this thread, which is a testament to the double standard. 

It’s a huge double standard that Israel is talked about ad nauseam and Turkey is never mentioned despite Cyprus being right next to Israel and Cyprus being in the EU, and Turkey doing far less to pursue peace than Israel has. I feel like antisemitism is a huge factor in that double standard.
- Uighurs in China (over 200k forced to birth control implants against will to reduce population among other atrocities).
- Rohingya in Myanmar (~50k dead)
- Tigray Conflict in Ethiopia (~20k dead)
- Yemen civil war (125k+ dead)

These are just off the top of my head. The offenders in these cases are traditionally marginalized populations, which some feel shields them from widespread condemnation. 

Many in the Jewish community who support palestine feel that the disproportionate outrage represents antisemitism.
That's more the right wing in Israel than Israel as a whole.
So reform Jews aren’t real Jews to you
If it were true that most Jewish people in Israel don't support their governments actions vis-a-vis Palestinians they could vote along side the Palestinian citizens of Israel and have a dominating majority control of the Knesset. 

As this has not happened, and Israel has a more representative voting system than the US, I seriously doubt that most Israelis are against their government's actions.
Yes but they also don’t want to get killed. Proportional to total population last Saturday’s attack would have been like 40,000 Americans dying. Again proportional to total population. No country is going to sit there and let that happen.
This bylaw included anyone who believes Israel has a right to exist at all. Which is most Jews. Not just those who ""support Israel"".
Terrible analogy with Trump n

The bylaws in question would ban Jews that believe Israel has a right to exist, which covers nearly all Jews. The result creates Jewish free spaces on the campus, and given modern history of Jewish free spaces (in America and Nazi Germany) the bylaws get awfully close to what we’d all consider antisemitism.
oil marry repeat close fearless crowd merciful expansion normal memorize ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `
yeah, what is your point exactly? a large majority of jewish identifying people believe in Israeli statehood.
We only need an ally in the Middle East because we went and blew it all to hell over fake nukes and created our own problems.
Why
Why did people downvote you? It's not anti-semitic to point out the fact that Jewish people have a disproportionate influence on American politics and media compared to their actual size. 

It doesn't mean Jews are some hive-mind who only support their own interests, but it could explain why both parties have such a steadfast support for Israel.
Been saying that for years.  AIPAC has gotta go.
I don't think the situation is fueled by vengeance and despair.  For the Palestinians, maybe.  But also a justified sense of being robbed and wronged. 

For Israelis?  [Not at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/17gavxl/she_has_a_good_point/)
A lot of Palestinians also want a compromise. But you have to understand a compromise isn’t accepting just how it has been, there is a need for repair. But I do think the best option would be a one state solution, now the problem is, how realistic really is that? Because how would it be fair to all parties? to the damage that has been done for years but also to the people that live in Israel and have nothing to do with the colonization but benefit from it. Just like living in America. It’s tough.
No living Palestinian currently believes that ""all of Palestine"" is an attainable goal.  You might as well compare that camp with the hard-line Israelis who want 100% of Palestine.  I don't think you're being honest when you say ""I've heard Palestinians say _"" because you're using that to justify quoting ~the most extreme Palestinian views there are.  

There's no good ""fair"" solution.  Palestinians have a right to their homes; a 50-50 split would mean that Israel is taking half of a country they have no ethical claim to.  Any negotiations should  *acknowledge* that in some way.  

And it's a weird situation.  [Israel has taken control of roughly 80-90% of Palestine](https://www.anera.org/what-are-area-a-area-b-and-area-c-in-the-west-bank/) and their current policy is to take more, as quickly as Zionists can settle it.  Israel is actively building settlements on Palestinian territory, and defending illegal settlements with the IDF.  

That's not how you start negotiations in goodwill / I honestly don't see how Israel could expect Palestinians to even come to the table given that kind of conduct, and it illustrates just how asymmetric every aspect of this conflict is.  

""We've taken almost everything from you, and we're currently taking more, but let's talk about a 'compromise' that leaves you with even less than you currently have.""  

It's screwy.
“Practical solution to this problem now” is too vague. Do you mean a solution that would be politically viable in Israel today?

Bibi is very proud of slow-playing or ignoring every UN mandate. I do believe that doing what the UN required would have solved this problem. They could start today. Israeli politics just didn’t allow that.

If BDS weren’t effectively illegal in the United States, Israel could have been pressured economically.
lol this has to be rage bait right?
You're insane
Ethically speaking, Israelis should leave.  They have no right to the land they are occupying, and most have the means to leave, and travel to other developed countries, unlike most Palestinians.  

If you walk into a family's house, kick them out, and have kids, arguing that you should be allowed to stay because ""it's what's best for my kids"" doesn't really make sense.   

You say I'm naïve.  I'd call you morally bankrupt.  

Your last comment seems pretty ironic given that the IDF has killed 8-10 times as many Palestinians as Hamas has managed to kill over the past ~2 decades, and six times as many children, per B'Tselem data.  In the recent conflict, Israel has now killed roughly 3-4 times as many innocent civilians as Hamas managed to kill with their attack, and three times as many children.  

Israel is *a lot* better at murdering children than Hamas.  

Here's a question. Do you think [this](https://manhattanda.org/d-a-bragg-seven-pieces-of-nazi-looted-art-returned-to-relatives-of-holocaust-victim/) is reasonable?  Returning property stolen ~75 years ago to the rightful owner's descendants?
>The historical arguments are irrelevant though. Largely anyone pushed out in the Nakba is dead now.  


The current average lifespan in Palestine is 74.4 years.  The Nakba was 75 years ago.    


So, no.  
  
>Likewise, people born in a country should have a right to determine the path for their own country and must be democratic.  


I didn't realize apartheid was democratic.    


>So Jews only deserve a homeland by principles of self determination.   


No one deserves a homeland at the expense of someone else.  

  
>The same rules apply to Palestinians given the much stronger preference for a two state solution (assuming only options are democratic).  


[No reasonable two state solutions have been proposed by any outside party, or Israel](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ee2f78f834c6612de4e6260/1623689754238-SA4IQE3G6O51ABF2WWDR/fd8b0f77d767f1f6640afba6916ff67c\_XL.jpg).  Saying that one group prefers *an impossible solution* does not make sense.
😂😂 yea hitler and I definitely have a lot in common especially our brown eyes, curly black hair, and hook noses 😂😂

The other point people are missing here, which should be obvious to anyone with a couple of braincells capable of critical thinking, is the power dynamics in play. This is a full time law professor with *actual* cultural and institutional power! What he’s saying in his article - which is full of straightforward misinformation and outright lying about what has actually happening on campus for the past year -  is effectively “if students do not agree with my politics I will try to use my disproportionate power over them to fuck up their future careers” (which is what this article blatantly is - it is in effect a coded message to any law firm looking to hire Berkeley students to look into whether those students may have had anything to do with LSJP).  

If you really don’t think this is deeply problematic I can’t help you. This isn’t an engagement in dialogue. This is actual, institutionally supported cancel-culture in that he’s actively encouraging law firms to not hire specific individuals (because by association, he is effectively naming individual students in this article). To leverage one’s power in such a vindictive way is absolutely shameful
The article talks about student group bylaws banning speech by supporters of Israel. Here we have organizations *banning* *speech* of a *certain viewpoint* and your comment is that the professor is the one who doesn't respect free speech? I think you are the tone deaf one. It sounds like the main voices being silenced are those of Jewish students and supporters of Israel. 

And you definitely don't understand free speech. I will defend your right to denounce Israel if the government tried to take away your ability to do so, but I don't have to hire you. Freedom goes both ways.
he established a line in the sand.

""Ask if they support discriminatory bylaws or other acts and resolutions blaming Jews and Israelis for the Hamas massacre. ""

does that sound unreasonable in your view?
Soooo…the ones literally supporting Hamas are in your mind trying to…stop…war crimes? Ok.
What a joke.  Berkeley and Berkeley Law have CONSTANTLY punished people for their points of view.  Berkeley has been chasing any right of center speaker away from campus for at least two decades at this point.  Berkeley law student groups have tried to punish and silence ANY pro Israel points of view.

Hamas supporters do not care a single fucking whit about free speech.  They care about silencing dissent and exterminating Jews.  Crocodile tears, using the value your enemy places on free speech against them to spread propaganda calling for their extermination.

Any fellow Berkeley alum knows that Berkeley simply does not value intellectual diversity they value conformity and they crush dissent.  And now that someone calls out how absurdly extreme the Berkeley bubble has become such that it pushes terrorist apologia, you cry victim.
Free speech should always be allowed and supported as long as it doesn’t cross over to the territory of ‘hate speech.’ While I agree that this article does mischaracterize the nature of the change of the bylaws issue from last year, I HAVE seen some pretty anti-Semitic behavior from some of the Pro-Palestine students in this recent conflict. Some people outright say that the innocent civilians somehow deserved to be attacked by Hamas simply for existing in Israel. You can be Pro-Palestine and support Palestinians without supporting the murder of innocents.
To call these “political opinions” is a stretch, these people are literally rallying for terrorists snd terrorism. They’re protected under the law as long as they don’t go any farther (literally trying to incite specific terrorist acts), but get real.
What’s going on in Gaza is not “self-defense”. It’s collective punishment, a war crime, towards millions of civilians who had nothing to do with Hamas. It’s the obliteration of entire civilian communities and neighborhoods with repeated bombings. This is not self-defense. Don’t delude yourself. Israel is a settler colonialist state which has historically demonstrated an interest in acquiring Palestinian land, and has already taken most of historical Palestine. It doesn’t take a genius to see what’s happening.
Okay a few points in response then I think I may have to quit going down the rabbit hole of antisemitism. 

1.  This isn’t one act of terrorism. 1,300 civilians were murdered in cold blood, many were raped tortured beheaded and babies were kidnapped and brought to Gaza. There  are multiple sources for this. This was carried out by over 1,000 Hamas terrorists. The fact that over 1,000 terrorists willing to carry out such depravities shows that the rot runs so deep that the only way for Israel to adequately defend itself is to completely dismantle Hamas. 

2.  You come at me for quoting the fact that Hamas beheaded babies but you claim that Netanyahu supported Hamas to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state without any proof. And even if it were true, so what? A bad policy decision in the 80’s justifies rape, murder and torture? 

3. You call this an armed resistance. In your mind, is burning civilians alive considered an armed resistance? Have there a ever been a group of people that have committed such heinous crimes and history has looked kindly back on? Have there ever been a group of so-called subjugated people that have specifically and consistently targeted civilians? 

4. You claim that Israel occupies Palestinians. Are you aware that the only reason Hamas exists is because Israel completely doesn’t occupy Gaza since they returned it in 2005? Are you aware that just as soon as Israel returned Gaza Hamas was elected and immediately launched an intifada, blowing you civilians etc. Are you aware, that despite all this, Israel still supplies Gaza with fuel, electricity and water, when Hamas dismantled their own water pipes to use them as rockets against Israel? what the. do you refer to as the occupation? 

5. I’ll just drop the question here, if you were the prime minister of a country and this had happened to your civilians, what would your response have been? What do you think is proportional? How do you expect to respond when terorists use civilians as human shields?
[deleted]
I mean the BearsForPalestine post literally looked like Hamas propaganda. ""Glory to the resistance, glory to our martyrs"". And I haven't seen them backing down at all.
Not to quibble but Palestinian president’s condemnation lasted about 2 hours and was removed from his website.
30,000 Palestinians are dead - roughly 16,000 children.  1,400 died in Hamas' attack.  The IDF has now murdered 20 times more people than Hamas.  That's honestly low given past conflicts, but that makes sense.  The IDF shows no signs of stopping the bombardment.  

Are you still calling yourself ""pro-people?""  Doesn't really work at this point.  

Being a minority doesn't justify genocide.
Absolute hyperbole in regards to your first claim of lack of media coverage. To hit you with my own hyperbole ive seen TONS of coverage abt Palestinians and interviews with them and covering the potential deaths because of the hospitals running out of supplies, etc. that “lack” of coverage you think is there might be a bias from you
Because the condemnation is a lie. You can't take back posting flyers with images of gliders on it and pretend that it's not directly supporting that act. They've unbiguously supported a violent terrorist attack against civilians, and the backtrack we're suppose to believe is that the pro-palestine protests are actually about innocent civilians? Not a chance.   
  
Palestinians aren't witless victims of their own authoritarian dystopia. Neighboring countries beef up border security against their borders with Palestine, less Israel. They're not taking Palestinian refugees for a reason. The Palestinian people collectively (read: not the ""average Palestinian"") are a violent security risk everywhere they have been.   
  
Hamas and Palestine aren't two distinct groups.  Hamas is a circle completely within the circle representing Palestinians.  
  
Every criticism of Israels behavior, however valid, needs to reconcile with those facts. The behavior that risks fewer Palestinian civilians, risks more Israeli civilians
This is nonsense. Hamas's takeover of Gaza predates Netanyahu's term by 2 years. Hamas was founded in 1987 and, before Hamas existed, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) also did tons of fucked up things like hijacking planes, shooting up school buses, and murdering Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich.

Netanyahu will, in all likelihood be held to account. Most Israelis already want him to resign:

[https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-767880](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-767880)

Edit: after Hamas came to power in 2006-2007, Ehud Olmert was Israeli prime minister, and he proposed a VERY generous peace offer to Palestinians that Mahmoud Abbas then rejected. So don't even act like Hamas was a reaction to right wing Israeli governments.
“This freedom fighter is resisting the soviets” vibes from this whole ordeal. And in 10 years when people look back on Israel’s actions are as obviously disastrous as the US’ we’re in Iraq, plenty of bloodthirsty morons on here are gonna claim “they never supported it” and whatever the next dumbass petty vengeance war will be “is different” lmao
Seems like people forgot what the US response to Pearl Harbor was.
You’re saying they shouldn’t protest about certain atrocities without protesting about something else first, which is a ridiculous assertion. If you want to have a respectful discussion, I’m open to it, but you’ve already resorted to attacking me personally so I doubt it.
No Israeli government is going to unilaterally withdraw from the West Bank after the Hamas election debacle in Gaza. Israeli prime ministers offered very generous peace deals to Palestinians in 2000 and 2008 that would've given them 95% of the 1967 borders and Arafat and Abbas rejected them.
He says the word Palestine multiple times in the article along with mentioning Zionism which is inextricably linked with Palestine.  If he was only talking about condemning Hamas, this would be a universally agreeable opinion.  But that’s not what it’s about at all, he’s against anti-Zionism.
He mentions Palestine multiple times in the article.

> Stop equating support for Israel as hate for Palestine.

Saying that about people who write that they ""support Israel"" in the last few days is like supporting Serbia during the Bosnian genocide and saying ""stop equating support for Serbia as hate for Bosnians"". Don't be disingenuous, even Western political leaders normally supportive of Israel (Biden, Trudeau, Ursula, etc.) has toned down how much they say ""I support Israel"" in public over the last few days. 

> A peaceful two-state solution is possible. Both Palestinians and Israelis have a right to self-determination.

I agree here, I hope it is possible.
I read it, and the only thing about not condemning the attack was this professors claim about *one* student from NYU. 

Hardly a majority.

It's possible to support Palestinian self determination and, importantly, to be anti Zionism, while still not being antisemitic and speaking out against the kind of violence of Hamas.
Whose excitement around the massacre? I'd like to see some evidence of that.

 I think what Hamas did/does is horrible, but I still support Palestinian rights, and I hope that there are a lot of others like me who just want peace and freedom for all.
I'm sorry, does turkey regularly bomb hospitals and starve children and shoot protesters in the head in Cyprus?

Israel us done nothing to seek out peace. Bulldozing houses and practicing apartheid isn't a pathway to peace lol. You don't need to run interference for Zionists.
I recognize that there exists several other cases of ethnic displacement and cleansing around the world. I also understand how there is a historical prescedent behind singling out the actions of the Jewish community from the others and using that to discriminate against them, but there is a flaw in pointing out why 'others are doing it' should mean one should have fewer fingers pointed at them. It's just that Israel being a key Middle Eastern ally to the West is what is responsible for most of the finger pointed and suspected anti-Semitis.
Plenty of folks call those out. Down the street from me there are folks protesting CCCP and their suppression of Falun Gong literally every night.

I swear half the people on Reddit forget there’s a whole world out there, not just their recommender algorithm bubble.
I question the degree to which Israel's government represents the people that live under it, considering that this government has been speeding up the settler colonialism going on in the West Bank. There are more Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank who have zero political power in the Knesset than those who are full citizens. Even discounting that, the right-wing shift that has been going on in Israel for the past years has done a lot to take power away from those who don't support the current people in office, including Israeli Jews and Palestinians with Israeli citizenship.
Yes but the power dynamics of the whole situation is entirely skewed towards Israel. For the most part Israel is backed by the West, has advanced military equipment, and has historically used this backing to occupy the West Bank and Gaza with little retribution except from the Palestinians themselves. The people who live in these illegally occupied spaces receive little media attention and are treated as second-class citizens on their own land. When your entire life is violence and getting bombed, this will naturally push people towards any group who can show that they can put out even an ounce of resistance. Unfortunately, these groups tend to be the violent fundamentalist Islamists since they are the only ones who have some power of 'bombing back'  the occupiers. Israel holds all the cards in this war and Hamas is merely a response to 75-years of occupation and mistreatment.

The main issue is that the current Israeli government doesn't want a peaceful solution where Palestinians and Israelis live peacefully together. They essentially want to solve the issue by getting rid of Palestine altogether, so an attack like the recent one is just going to be met with 100x retribution.
I believe Israel has a right to exist but it should not be at the expense of Palestinians getting removed or treated like second-class citizens. For most of their existence together, Palestinian Arabs lived alongside Jewish people peacefully during the Ottoman period for centuries. The issue is that the modern state of Israel was founded upon hundreds of thousands of people being displaced from their land (Nakba), which ultimately set off much of the violence that continues to this day in the region. This should not be ignored in the same way that the history of antisemitism throughout the West and MENA shouldn't be ignored as well.
Yeah before US did that, the entire region was a peaceful Utopia
The US projects global power and needs a staunch supporter in a region with geopolitical rivals
Even when faced with statistics \*from Jewish sites\* showing the great overrepresentation of Jewish people in American politics and the media, people's first instinct is denial and downvoting.
>But I do think the best option would be a one state solution, now the problem is, how realistic really is that?

That violates the self determination of both peoples. It's a poor solution. This forces Israel to accept a bunch of people most don't want and Palestinians to be a minority in a Jewish majority state, which most also don't want.
Ok,if they go the one state solution route then they quickly lose control of their own country via birthrates and the ballot box. Can you see why they might not be too enthusiastic about what to them looks like conquest via democracy? You may see this as morally right,but their reticence is human.
Israel already offered right of return to 90% of palestinian refugees and independent states in West Bank and Gaza with no blockade/restrictions.

Palestinians rejected it.... not once, but 4 separate times in 4 separate decades.

Palestinians are more interested in rockets/bombs than in any kind of compromise or Palestinian state.

Israel should invade Gaza again -- they made a mistake leaving in 05.
No I am totally serious.  This is not an uncommon view among private school students. The Jews left.  Then, in 1950, they come back saying 'oh btw, God promsed us your land.'  It's not really a legitimate move.

Imagine Kim Jong Un sails to Berkeley in a war ship and fires rockets that hit UC Bekerley dorms and kill some students.  He then pulls out an ancient Korean scribe stating that he is in fact promised Berkeley by the Gods and sends soilders in to evict all Berkeley residents and detains or executes dissenters on the spot.  That is exactly what Israel did to the land between the Red Sea and the Medeterrianian Sea.  And in fact, they're supposed to also get to the euphrates river -- that's many arab countries today.  They're just going about life as usual, as they have for thousands of years, then boom a military attack out of nowhere and sudden and persistent oppression daily for the past 70 years ever since.

By analogy, there'd be North Korean soldier welding your front door shut.  So you need to exit out your window.  You're not allowed on the street your door faces.  And more. It's total insanity.

Keep going. I think you're missing one really big commonality!
Bet you didn’t know Palestinians and every Arab nation are also semites lmao
Most law firms have an over representation of Jewish partners. The consequence of putting out cheers for the Hamas ""martyrs"" is alienating those partners from ever wanting to work with you.
It is also antisemitic to force Jews to denounce Israel every time they would enter your space. Many Jews have complex feelings about Israel but most Jews I know denounce the current govt but still feel like Israel still has a right to exist. By their bylaws, they would not be welcomed.
> Here we have organizations banning speech of a certain viewpoint and your comment is that the professor is the one who doesn't respect free speech?  

Except we don’t have organizations banning speech though and this shows a complete lack of understanding of what has gone on on campus recently. Those groups effectively just asked if the university would not host Zionist speakers. There was never any real mechanism of enforcement for the LSFP bylaw. They were just 9 groups who said they personally won't invite Zionist speakers. They weren't representing anyone other than themselves, it wasn’t enshrined in University policy, they weren’t creating jewish free zones, they weren’t engaging in hate speech, and Israeli speakers were still invited to campus just as they always have been. Moreover, those groups were effectively ignored and derided by anyone with real power at UCB (which gets us into the continued debate of the unquestionably disproportionate silencing of Palestinian voices, but that’s a separate conversation). 

Then we have a professor with *actual* tangible real world power saying he will effectively fuck over students’ futures if their political philosophy is different to his own. Someone who can *actually* inform policy, actually have influence with law firms, actually have a concrete say in the lives of these students (students whom he has effectively just doxxed btw).  

If people can’t see the difference between the two cases that is outrageous
Free speech is hardly just state government persecution of speech rights, Right-Libertarianism (that only aims critique at public and not private institutions, like corporations) is nonsensical. If you can’t find a job or you’re fired from a job for a view you want to express, you have what’s called lack of “substantive access to right” to free speech. In other words, if you were rich, have connections, or have privileges (like say tenured Professors or a politician), you have the resources to afford to sacrifice the prospects of employment to say whatever you want compared to someone who is more vulnerable (students who become hesitant to express atypical critical views because it might affect their living standards)
Because he's stretching the fuck out of the point people are making and twisting it to frame it as antisemitic.

No one with common sense blames Jewish individuals for the attack (99% of people). People are saying that the decades of oppressive acts against Palestinians [(and the intentional propping up of Hamas to isolate Palestinians in Gaza from Palestinians West Bank](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/#:~:text=According%20to%20various%20reports%2C%20Netanyahu,West%20Bank%20and%20Hamas%20in)) carried out by the Israeli government fostered an environment in which an extremist group like Hamas was created in retaliation. In fact, per international law, States have a right to protect themselves in response to an armed attack (i.e. Zionism). And it's important to note here that even when [Hamas (along with unaffiliated Palestinian people) was engaged in non-violent](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2018-03-30/ty-article/.premium/gaza-border-protests-will-force-army-to-maneuver-between-two-contradic/0000017f-e112-d9aa-afff-f95a95950000) protesting in 2018, [the IDF still killed over 200 people](https://www.unrwa.org/campaign/gaza-great-march-return), with [only two deaths being deemed ""justified"" after investigations](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session40/Documents/A_HRC_40_74_CRP2.pdf) and zero casualties on its end. Never mind the fact that Israel controls pretty much everything in Gaza that would give its people sovereignty. 

This professor, like most zionists, conflates criticism of Israel (the state, government, and its military and policies) with prejudice against Jewish individuals for their ethnicity and religious beliefs. 

How is it that we can criticize every single nation on Earth EXCEPT for Israel? Or is criticizing the UK inherently anti-white? How about Nigeria? Is that anti-Black? Or Saudi Arabia? Is that Islamophobic? 

And quite frankly, it's really fucked up to see people ignore the harm being caused to real-life Palestinian people to achieve this zionist goal. The rabbis who oppose Zionism have explicitly said that violence is against the beliefs of Judaism.

The radical left suddenly rediscovered their interest in “protecting free speech” at this totally random moment.
I think refusing to condemn Hamas's attacks is a fair litmus test. Being an anti-zionist (i.e, opposing the existence of a jewish ethnostate) is not. I admit that there is overlap, but this article deliberately conflates the two, imo.

His hiring comment suggests to use the former as the test but is in response to the latter.
Let's be abundantly clear Hamas has and is committing war crimes and have done so consistently their entire existence. It's a bit rich for them to say ""you have to play by the rules we aren't following.""
Sounds good to me.  Israel has defeated the Arab nations before, they will do so again.  Let the Palestinians rot in their filth.
Your only good point is your last point so I'll address that. I sure as hell would not follow one act of terror with another even greater act of terror and pretend like I'm the victim. In your third point you're referring to Israhell of course, right? No wait their crimes are even more atrocious. Please stop acting like Israel is an innocent moral actor that's just defending itself since early October. They have been illegally seizing land and continue to do so. And don't act like they're so generous. They have had the entire region under blockade and made it a living hell hole for millions of inhabitants. And forcing them to live under a horrendously racist, murderous, apartheid regime. Look at all the ex soldiers describing their guilt and the disgusting acts of terror they were brainwashed to participate in. Please. We see straight through all the BS. Hamas is an armed resistance group against the tyrannical terrorist state of Israel. I'm not endorsing them, but that is a million times more defensible than the Israeli terrorist state.
the linking of antisemitism and Zionism really is the dirtiest, cleverest trick I’ve seen in the 21st century - it basically makes the state immune to any kind of criticism from anyone, a fact which should set off warning bells alone (I think I’ve seen this film before).

It also ignores the huge contingent of Jewish individuals (a quarter of Jewish Americans!) who think differently and denies their connection to their heritage/labels them as self hating, and puts my Jewish friends in the unfair position of having to constantly assert their political stances so people know they don’t stand with war crimes or the current regime. It’s exhausting - and I would highly recommend you look up the Jewish creators speaking up on Tiktok and Instagram to articulate their frustrations with the subject and educate us on the conflict. 

I was first introduced to this conflict by Ilan Pappe (I highly recommend his work), an Israeli American, and it was through him I learned to separate Zionism and Judaism. I recommend you do as well.
Frontal lobes can't develop fast enough it seems.
Yes, I’m still pro people. Yes, what Israel is doing is disproportionate violence and ought to be condemned to the greatest extent, they should be facing the wrath of the international community. That being said, the answer is a two state solution, Jews are a minority and I’m empathetic to their desire for self preservation, but really don’t get your point because those arguments are still valid and in no way support the current genocide. 

And yes, Hamas still sucks and October 7th was not a “mass anti colonial resistance”
Hmm yeah I can see that
He’s basically referring to this:

[But did you also know that Hamas — which is an Arabic acronym for “Islamic Resistance Movement” — would probably not exist today were it not for the Jewish state? That the Israelis helped turn a bunch of fringe Palestinian Islamists in the late 1970s into one of the world’s most notorious militant groups? That Hamas is blowback?

This isn’t a conspiracy theory. Listen to former Israeli officials such as Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev, who was the Israeli military governor in Gaza in the early 1980s. Segev later told a New York Times reporter that he had helped finance the Palestinian Islamist movement as a “counterweight” to the secularists and leftists of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Fatah party, led by Yasser Arafat (who himself referred to Hamas as “a creature of Israel.”)

“The Israeli government gave me a budget,” the retired brigadier general confessed, “and the military government gives to the mosques.”

“Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel’s creation,” Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades, told the Wall Street Journal in 2009. Back in the mid-1980s, Cohen even wrote an official report to his superiors warning them not to play divide-and-rule in the Occupied Territories, by backing Palestinian Islamists against Palestinian secularists. “I … suggest focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before this reality jumps in our face,” he wrote.]

https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/

You can look past the paywall for those New York Times & Wall Street Journal reports cited using wayback archive.
Sure, your response is more factually accurate. But I suppose you get my point, Netanyahu played a decisive role in Hamas’ ‘upkeeping’ once he came to power. In deep seated conflicts, all regimes in the Middle East did ‘fucked up things’, which mostly alternated between aggression and attempts to negotiate for peace, sort of like sadomasochist back and forth… Though in a more straightforward sense, and specific to the recent attack by Hamas, Netanyahu is the one who’s much more adjacent to be held accountable
Could you tell me, which peace offering from 2006/2007 you’re referring to?
Also, most people in the US may not be adequately aware of how pervasive the influence of the Israel lobby is. It’s sure facilitated the mysteriously close diplomatic relations we have with Israel and other middle eastern countries. In that sense, it’s definitely not an ordeal for Americans, especially not for American Palestinians and Jews
Touché.
In general, people seek for catharsis one way or another, sometimes for more thoughtful legitimate purposes and sometimes downright diabolical. That and humans express themselves, it’s nature; like we may as well be called honk loquax lol
I'm sorry it felt like a personal attack, but using white-Black tensions as an equivalent example to this conflict if the definition of trying to fit a reality you don't personally know, to one you do in your own life. The attempt to do so is one of the main reasons for this bias and distortion that is prevalent in many students, so i called it out.   


i'm sure you are a thoughtful individual. I assume you are trying to help in a way you see fit, which is commendable.  i hope you will be able to face the complexity of this situation with more humility, as anyone who has had to do so for a long period of time has.    


btw, starting with ""you are saying"" and painting a misleading image of what i said is a bad faith way to debate an idea. i would not do that in the future if you want people to engage honestly.
That 5% is very significant. Most of fhe land there is empty desert anyway. Israel is the occupier, they can literally just pull out of the West Bank any time without needing to negotiate. I mean PLO haf already recognized Israel.
He is conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.  My relatives do the same thing, because they consider Israel to be ""the Jewish homeland,"" and will not hear otherwise.  Attacking Zionism is attacking ""the Jewish right to a homeland,"" in Israel.

All you can do is point out here and everywhere else that he is wrong.  Maybe other, more rational people will see it.  He will die with that belief, same as most of my family.
ok then dont say support Palestine after what happened with Hamas
Thank you! This simple point should’ve been abundantly clear to any commenter online and in public. The argument that ‘Zionism is the cause of the Jewish homeland, therefore anti-Zionism axiomatically equates antisemitism’, my god, is simply indolent. Not only does it conveniently, if not straight up willfully, ignore the fact that causally speaking, there were so many other major factors involved prior to the founding of the Israeli state; diplomatic quid pro quo, former British colonial concession for whatever reason, and naturally stepping into a dispute with the group of people who were already residing in the same location then and had been for centuries before, and thus consequently the displacement (to say the least) of the said group. Further, to gratuitously umbrella Jews both in Israel and the Diaspora, who simply don’t subscribe to the political philosophy behind Zionism, and insidiously substitute the concept of the ‘Israeli state’ for the concept of ‘Judaism’ is itself downright erroneous if not deceptive. Admittedly, I personally had been reluctant to take a side because there’s simply no winner between Palestinians and Israelis (maybe except Bibi’s cabinet), but after witnessing the unapologetically aggressive, rude, threatening behaviors of several Pro-Israeli protesters towards the other side, disgust was the only word came to mind.
So do you agree that Hamas and Hezbollah are not much different than ISIS in their methods? That they should have the same fate as ISIS (annihilation)? Or do you just “condemn violence” and leave it to that?
[deleted]
To think this conflict started in 1947 is incredibly ignorant of the history of this region dating back thousands of years. Both ethnic groups have strong ties to the land and were displaced time and time again, conquered by many empires, until ultimately the partition was approved by the UN and one side rejected it and rejected all subsequent offers for their own country.  Those facts should not be ignored. They have no desire for peace with Jews…they want to rid the region of Jews.
Lol that's a funny statement. Want me to send you some sources on what the yankees did over there bud?
Agreed! Realistically though, what is the alternative? Because if Israel were to give the land back to the Palestinians they would not have a land.
You sure? Jewish birth rate is higher than Arab birth rate in Israel now.
It’s something to consider. There shouldn’t be one governing power in that case. There needs to be a road paved that leads to justice for both sides.
Straight up misinformation.

Largely what?  Many are alive, and many of them grew up looking over fences and walls at their family homes.

What's your argument here, anyway?  You seem to be suggesting that theft and ethnic cleansing is fine...if you can keep the victims and their families out of their homes until the individuals you've displaced are dead?    


It doesn't really make sense to me, given that Israel has put them in concentration camps.  If that's your perspective, then Gaza is just, what?  A place to hold Palestinians until enough have died so that you can claim  they don't have the right to their homes anymore?

That's pretty screwed up.    


And it sounds like you're probably against [stories like this](https://time.com/5553894/nazi-looted-painting-returned), right?  It's been long enough, *finders keepers* should apply.

[I'd disagree](http://www.passia.org/maps/view/37).  But. even if you think that, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.  Barak lost the 2001 election largely in response to his policies and the Camp David Summit. Israelis spoke, and they said no.
Which is wanting a Jewish state? Denouncing Zionism does not mean you redact the concept of a Jewish state it means you do not support the implementation and execution of said state, as it is today. This isn’t a new stance 😂 over half of Israelis share this today and want Bibi gone, but I’ll bet anything you don’t know much about the politics over there. If you did you’d consider half a nation of Jews to be anti semitic 😂😂😂

The groups passed bylaws banning Zionist speech. Zionism is the cause of a Jewish homeland, the existence of a sovereign state of Israel. You can be critical of the Israeli government without being anti-zionist. This is why Jews think y'all are actually antisemitic - because you aren't careful with your language and make it sound like you don't believe Israel even had a right to exist (that's what anti-zionist means). The top comment ignores the massive terrorist attack against the country where it accuses Israel of simply wanting to expand. 

Yes, there is a power imbalance between the professor and the students. That isn't a free speech issue. Free speech is a legal concept. It's an asshole issue (from your perspective). From my perspective, that's just the natural consequence of taking big stances on complex issues without realizing how personal it is to your audience. Having just graduated from Berkeley law, I think the supposed ""influence"" this professor has is overblown here. The law firms will follow his advice if they agree with him. That's it.
Okay, sure. That's one definition. But I'm a lawyer, this is my law school, these are future lawyers, and in this context, the legal definition of free speech is what's most relevant to the discussion. OP sounds like every other ignorant American who thinks the right to free speech grants freedom from consequences. It does not. Here students took a stand against Zionism, the cause of a Jewish homeland, a country of deep significance to a substantial portion of the student body and the professors. Anti-zionism is not merely critical of the Israeli government, it's a stance against it's existence. That's aggressive. Big stances bring big consequences. 

Students aren't being oppressed here. It was one article, not ingrained institutional oppression. That's extremely dramatic.
I think you missed a huge piece of news within the legal field recently so you might be lacking some context.

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyu-law-student-israel-hamas-ryna-workman-harvard/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyu-law-student-israel-hamas-ryna-workman-harvard/)

Just because you do not blame Israelis for attacks performed by hamas doesnt naturally mean that everyone falls in line with your ethical standards.

The professor is pointing out an issue. We're talking about if that issue is valid. Yet you're bringing in the professor's zionist views as a counter argument rather than staying within the boundaries of the discussion. 

We're not debating IDF's standards here. You can criticize whoever you want. The question im specifically asking here is if the line he has drawn is unreasonable, nothing more.
So you don't see the power imbalance at play here? 

It's particularly hypocritical of this professor to want to basically punish students for exercising their freedom of speech while simultaneously criticizing them for not wanting speakers that are ideologically incompatible with their organizations. 

And never mind the fact that NO ONE is entitled to an invitation to ANY student event. 

And never mind the fact that [most Jewish people do not believe God gave Israel to Jewish people.](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-connections-with-and-attitudes-toward-israel/) 

How is it that we can criticize every single nation on Earth EXCEPT for Israel? Or is criticizing the UK inherently anti-white? How about Nigeria? Is that anti-Black? Or Saudi Arabia? Is that Islamophobic? 

How come there are [37 states in which it's illegal for public institutions, public servants, and businesses to call for or engage in the boycott of Israel](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation)? The Supreme Court has pretty much upheld these laws as constitutional and not a violation of freedom of speech. I'd wager that this professor has no problem with these laws... again... the hypocrisy.
how did he fabricate views? he didnt say that those bylaws equated to blaming jews and israelis for the hamas massacre. he was providing context to establish his point about cancelling speakers that were supportive of zionism.

this is a case of a square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not a square. this is an article written by a law professor. hes not that careless with his words as you are with your reasoning.

since the topic is about hiring, did you miss the last paragraph?

""If you are a legal employer, when you interview students from Berkeley, Harvard, NYU or any other law school this year, ask them what organizations they belong to. Ask if they support discriminatory bylaws or other acts and resolutions blaming Jews and Israelis for the Hamas massacre. If a student endorses hatred, it isn’t only your right but your duty not to hire him. Do you want your clients represented by someone who condones these monstrous crimes?""

it didnt ask to law firms to judge based purely on the the clubs or bylaws. in law its about intent, thus the paragraph specified to ask if the candidate supported the bylaws. if a law firm was hiring this isnt about anti-semitism but a red flag in a lapse in ability to determine fault due to biases.
Nevermind the fact that Israel is committing crimes at a scale much, much greater than Hamas is even capable of — the question is whether or not those war crimes even count as “self-defense”. I’m simply pointing out that Israel bombing and cutting supplies off to millions of trapped civilians is not “defense” of any sort, and the UN agrees with me on that point.

For some further insights on why Israel did this, this is pretty good:

\[...If Israel eliminated Hamas, nothing fundamental would change.  


It would not change because as long as Israel denies Palestinians’ basic rights, Palestinians will keep fighting Israel. That fight began long before Hamas was created. If Hamas were somehow destroyed, it would continue long after Hamas was gone.  


Today, it’s common to associate Hamas’s militancy with its Islamist ideology. The implication is that if only Islamists were eliminated from the Palestinian political scene, Palestinian politics would grow more moderate and quiescent. But Israeli leaders didn’t always see it that way. Just as US officials once saw Islamists like the Afghan Mujahedeen as less threatening than communists backed by the USSR, Israeli officials once saw Hamas as more pliable than Yasser Arafat’s more secular Fatah.  


In a recent letter to the editor of The New York Times, former Times’ Jerusalem correspondent David K. Shipler noted that in 1981, Israel’s military governor of Gaza told him that, in Shipler’s words, “he was giving money to the Muslim Brotherhood, the precursor of Hamas, on the instruction of the Israeli authorities. The funding was intended to tilt power away from both Communist and Palestinian nationalist movements in Gaza, which Israel considered more threatening than the fundamentalists.” Oops.Back then, many Jewish leaders wrongly thought Islamists were inherently more accommodating toward Israel.   


Today, they wrongly think Islamists are inherently more hardline toward Israel. In reality, political parties, secular or religious, respond to political incentives. Among “Arab Israeli” politicians, Mansour Abbas, an Islamist, has proved more open to joining a coalition with Benjamin Netanyahu than his leftist and nationalist rivals. Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood for decades denounced that country’s government for its peace deal with Israel. But when a Muslim Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Morsi, became Egypt’s president in the summer of 2012, he maintained diplomatic ties to Israel even during the war that Israel fought in Gaza later that year. Why? Because political movements evolve in response to circumstances. In 1988, Hamas published a despicable and blatantly anti-Semitic Charter that cited the Protocols of the Elders of the Zion. In 2017, it published a new Charter that claimed “its conflict is with the Zionist project not with the Jews because of their religion…Hamas rejects the persecution of any human being or the undermining of his or her rights on nationalist, religious or sectarian grounds.” Asking which one represents Hamas’ “real” views misses the point.   


Like other movements, Hamas evolves in response to events.  
As the Israeli political scientist Shaul Mishal has written, “Hamas operates in a context of opportunities and constraints, being attentive to the fluctuating needs and desires of the Palestinian population.”Those opportunities and constraints explain why Hamas shifted from appearing more moderate than Fatah to being more hardline. In 1988, Fatah made a fateful decision to recognize Israel. But the 1993 Oslo Accords, which reaffirmed that concession, promised Palestinians neither a state nor even an end to settlement growth, which led Edward Said to denounce them as a “Palestinian Versailles.” Although Hamas’s social vision could not have been further from Said’s cosmopolitan liberalism, Hamas leaders saw in Said’s critique their political opportunity. They cast their nationalist rivals as dupes who had given away too much and gotten too little in return. And Israel made their case easier by doubling down on settlement growth, which made many Palestinians feel that they were moving not toward statehood, but away from it.  


Three decades later, with Mahmoud Abbas overseeing the security cooperation that helps Israel control the West Bank, Hamas is still making the same basic argument. In the words of Rabbi Michael Melchior, who has spent more time with Hamas leaders than almost any other Israeli, “There are many people in Hamas who want their organisation, together with Fatah and the other parties, to be part of peace here…But they also want something to come out of it so that down the road they won’t look like Palestinian President Abbas, who doesn’t get any response from the Israeli side.”It’s not Hamas’s Islamism that keeps it from recognizing Israel. It’s simply good politics. In the eyes of most Palestinians, Fatah’s strategy of recognizing Israel has failed. It has led not to Palestinian statehood but to deepened occupation. That creates a market for a more hardline alternative. Eliminate Islamism from Palestinian politics and some leftist or nationalist faction would fill that same hardline niche and become America’s new bogeyman.\]

[https://peterbeinart.substack.com/p/if-israel-eliminated-hamas-nothing](https://peterbeinart.substack.com/p/if-israel-eliminated-hamas-nothing)
This is a fringe view, and many also attribute the rise of Hamas to foreign governments like Iran that sponsored Islamist terrorism movements. Also, the PLO - the secularists you're referring to - did most of the terrorism before Hamas existed (the school bus shootings, Munich Olympics massacre, etc.). It was not clear at all which faction was more dangerous back in the 80s. If anything, this divisive strategy you claim was such a big factor was super successful for Israel because the PLO representing over half of Palestinians is no longer (as) committed to terrorism and governs in the West Bank (Fatah is its biggest faction).
Actually your first comment was more factually accurate and you shouldn't take it back. Look at my responses underneath his comment for the information on this.

What was misleading about it? Why do you think it’s inappropriate to protest what is happening to the civilians in Gaza? 

And what’s wrong with using a situation people on this forum are more familiar with to draw parallels and bridge understanding?
Of course Hamas and Hezbollah are terrible, and I agree we would be better off with them gone from the world, but too many people equate Hamas = Palestinians, and call for the eradication of innocent people.

It's a very complicated situation in truth.

For example, do you agree that the IDF is also bad? They just killed 500 civilians in the bombing of a hospital in Gaza. I kinda doubt you would though. But just like in Palestine, a violent military force does not represent the individual Israelis. So I would condemn violence targeted at civilians everywhere.
Maybe because the US is actively giving the Israelis money and military aid and the fact every western country is trying their hardest to be the one to show the most support to Israel all while this is happening. Do you honestly not see the difference between this situation and the ones you listed????
I reckon it's because of the geopolitical 'relevance' Israel is to establishing a Western-aligned portion of the Middle East, along with how there are 'spurs' every couple years. This biased attention is similar to how the Ukraine conflict had the entire world's eyes focused on it because Russia, as opposed to Saudi Arabia and Yemen (less 'important' country to America, and to satisfy the Saudi government), Uguyhrs in China (which is only brought up when people talk about the CCP), and Rohingyas in Myanmar (America barely cares about Myanmar aside from the house arrest of their past State Counselor).
Saying that this conflict spans thousands of years suggests that Arabs and Jews have constantly been at war with each other. As I said before, Palestinian Arabs and Jews have been peacefully coexisting for most of their existence, and the region was even a safe haven for Jews during times where they were under threat in Europe.

To suggest that the Arab world never wanted Jews to exist in the region is just wrong, Islamophobic, and paints the conflict as fundamentally about religion when it is about political power. I believe that Israel has a right to exist, but not at the expense of Palestinians (which is definitely possible if there wasn't a massive power imbalance between the two). Much of the land that makes up Israel involved violent expulsions of Palestinians with the aid of British forces, so it was not a surprise that Arab countries interpreted this precedent as Israel being a Western-backed conquering force. Over the decades this warped some people into thinking that the ethnic group of the other side is fundamentally evil, since if your enemy consists of a different group of people, it is easy to tie that into the conflict (which is where most of the antisemitism from the Arab world comes from today). Had the migration gone more peacefully, as it had been for the very early stages where a lot of land was legally purchased from Palestinians, the conflict today would be massively reduced.

Jumping back to today, the current Israeli government attempts to make the entire historical region predominantly Jewish by removing Palestinians altogether, mostly through illegal occupation, displacement, and settlement of the West Bank. There have been past PMs who genuinely tried to propose solutions to resolve the conflict, such as Yitzhak Rabin (who btw was assassinated by a Zionist extremist who thought his compromises to Palestine were too far), but there can be no peace as long as government-backed settler colonialism remains in place.
Two state solution
That's not true.  Gaza has one of the top 10 highest birth rates in the world.

Quite strange for a region under blockade with no food available.
But not Palestinian birth rate. That is above both.
It just seems unrealistic at this point. There is hundreds of years of mistrust on both sides (for good reason).
Okay fine 'conquered and expelled.'  I guess the UK had the right to give land to whoever it wanted.
Oh, so you're just using a different interpretation of ""Zionism"" than everyone else's that I've heard recently. Even the self-proclaimed Zionists I've heard would agree that the implementation and execution of it today isn't good.
Do you even know the magnitude of what the holocaust was? Do you even know the motives behind the holocaust and the motives behind Hamas? It goes without saying that both actions against my people were disgusting acts of terror, but they were addressing completely different issues. The issue of Palestine and Israel has nothing to do with the conspiracy of Jewish supremacy in Europe, it’s tied to a geographic dispute first and foremost. Those who compare the Hamas attack to the Holocaust are truly belittling the systemic nature of said Holocaust and probably have no idea what went into executing that, which is something much scarier compared to these barbaric para gliders and shitty missiles launched from next to a family of 10’s house in Gaza.
I was referencing the BearsForPalestine (cosigned by Law Students for JP) post where they said quote, ""glory to the resistance and glory to our martyrs"" the day after the Hamas attack. Do you disagree that that is celebrating Hamas?
Zionism is an ethnic nationalist ideology, not a race or ethnicity. Mixing the two is outrageous. There were certain left wing versions of Zionism that were against a Jewish state and advocated for a bi-nationalist state for both Jews and Arabs, but these were very old and long dead, and made up only a minority anyhow. With regards to the ideology of Ben Gurion (the first leader of Israel) even a pretty conservative Israeli historian like Benny Morris admitted in his work that it was built into Zionism of this form to inevitably lead to the expulsion of Palestinians (in other words, ethnic cleansing)
At this point, anti-zionist can also mean ""please stop killing and displacing people for their land. You already have enough and are making sure the cycle of violence never ends"" 

Most people are supportive of a true two-state solution, which is [not what the Israeli government seems to be interested in.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/01/middleeast/netanyahu-palestinian-sovereignty-mime-intl/index.html)

I’m concerned about rights as a principle, which is what I think the OP is concerned about and what’s of moral concern.
The discussion is about the professor's OpEd. Not this law student's case in its entirety. Nonetheless, my point stands. 

The student said, ""**Israel** bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life."" Israel = the government, not Israelis, the people. I don't understand why people have such a hard time understanding this concept. When we say ""[the United States committed war crimes in Iraq](https://www.salon.com/2006/03/14/chapter_5/),"" we don't mean each individual citizen in the United States did. 

How is it that we can criticize every single nation on Earth EXCEPT for Israel? Or is criticizing the UK inherently anti-white? How about Nigeria? Is that anti-Black? Or Saudi Arabia? Is that Islamophobic? It makes no sense. 

And he is CORRECT, given that [under international law,](https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/self-defence#:~:text=Self%2Ddefense%20in%20international%20law,Charter%20and%20customary%20international%20law) States have the right to defend themselves in response to armed attacks by other States. Israel IS the occupying nation and has been for over 75 years, not the other way around. 

With that said, **it is unreasonable** for this professor to wield his power and influence within his field to negatively impact the material conditions of students who are choosing to establish bylaws that align with the values of their organizations. Not only that**, it is hypocritical** for him to consider their actions anti-freedom of speech while simultaneously essentially threatening them (through the use of his power & influence) into silence and not participating in student organizations because if they do, their future livelihoods can/will be impacted. With great power comes great responsibility. 

**It is unreasonable** for ANYONE to feel entitled to an invitation to speak at events hosted by any organization. 

**It is unreasonable** to equate the desire for speaker<>organization ideological alignment with a freedom of speech violation or anti-semitism when Jewish people are not banned from speaking. Zionists, who come from all religious backgrounds, are. [Note that most U.S. Jewish ppl do not believe that ""God literally gave Israel to Jewish people.](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-connections-with-and-attitudes-toward-israel/)""
So what should Israel do instead?
Upon looking at your post history it’s quite evident you’re a sponsored state account lol, I guess I got baited into trying to genuinely engage
.
Thanks for the info. I didn’t really feel the need to open his link tbh… I’ll look into your insights!
>But they also want something to come out of it so that down the road they won’t look like Palestinian President Abbas, who doesn’t get any response from the Israeli side.

You've perfectly articulated Hamas's argument here. Why doesn't Abbas (or the PLO/Fatah) get any response from the Israeli side today? Because Arafat and then Abbas rejected peace offers in 2000 and 2007 that would've given Palestinians 95%! of what most people calling for a two state solution today are looking for. The sticking point was ""right of return"" for all Palestinian refugees and their descendants from 1948, even though Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert offered significant monetary compensation for this (also ""right of return"" for all descendants of refugees is a ludicrous proposal).

The Israeli side ignores Abbas for refusing to accept any reasonable compromise. There's zero real partner for peace from the Palestinians.
It's far from a fringe view, as this isn't just isolated to Israel/Palestine. US and its allies supported Islamism as a counterweight to secular nationalism and communism throughout the Cold War, against Nasser in Egypt and in Soviet-Afghan war are other well known examples.
Thanks lol. I kinda knew but just wasn’t too enthusiastic to fact check and respond to him point to point. I thought my argument still stands.
Though to be fair, I’ve seen several times where various authoritative scholars of history assign different weights to different events in their narratives. Not to say that’s not legitimate, just thought for arguments sake in the Reddit context, might as well act with a bit more equanimity.
I think that’s a better idea but less realistic though? Because how can you guarantee land an resources will be fairly divided?
if they don’t even have food why do you assume they have access to birth control?
Well when the chances of your kid living long enough to be an adult are low because someone loves randomly bombing, shooting, or disappearing them then you’d have a lot of kids too…
It’s doable. Just takes effort.
They did.
My definition is the definition widely used back in the Middle East, I don’t know why people here tie Zionism to Judaism directly. Zionism is the politicization of a very complex socio geographic issue that dates back thousands of years, it’s not black and white. I’ve made many arguments against the concept of forced Zionism, because there are many arguments to be made for regional stability.
Practically every Jew I know associates the term ""Zionist"" with someone who supports the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. Being a Zionist doesn't preclude you from supporting a two state solution or Palestinian rights. A few polls have shown that at least 80% of Jews are Zionist under this definition. Even the dean of Berkeley law, Erwin Chemerinsky, who's super liberal and has fought for Palestinian rights, considers himself to be a Zionist. There is no world in which banning 80% of Jews who support Israel's right to exist will somehow be construed by most Jews as NOT being antisemitic and/or exclusionary. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/us/uc-berkeley-free-speech.html
Okay, forgive me for using the colloquial definition of Zionism used by nearly all Jews and Israelis without acknowledging the 1000 pages of history of Zionist factions and scholars. I was writing a reddit comment, not a dissertation. Israel is an ethnic state because for thousands of years and still today, people love rounding up Jews, blaming them for all society's problems, and murdering them. It's a safe haven. A much needed one. It's status as an ethnic state is a welcome mat to an endangered minority group, not a keep out sign, as evidenced by it's diverse population. They are far more diverse than their neighboring countries, the ones Jews fled from. The states who actually committed ethnic cleansing ( where are their Jews?). I am strongly in favor of peace with Palestine and hope for the future prosperity of it's people, but like everyone in favor of peace should be, I am deeply against Hamas and acknowledge Israels's right to existence and to defend itself. That view has a lot of overlap with the ""Zionist speakers"" those students were trying to silence. Which is bullshit. I'm sorry, but taking that view online right now is just going to alienate every Jew who reads it.
Most people, most Israelis, and I all believe in a two-state solution. Bibi is not a widely popular figure in Israel anymore, but even still, that article shows that even a far-right Israeli leader doesn't disavow a two state solution. It simply says that, for the foreseeable future, any such deal would need Israeli security oversight. That would be a massive improvement in Palestine independence! Do you really blame Israel for wanting such oversight when the PA is still paying its citizens to carry out suicide bombs against Israelis? Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund ( on mobile, not bothering with formatting). Any basic sense of self-preservation would require such oversight be maintained. 

Also, Hamas has zero interest in a two-state solution (obviously).
>And these bylaws were enforced were they? (They weren’t,btw)

You have any proof that these 20 student groups aren’t knowingly excluding speakers who *“expressed and continued to hold views … in support of Zionism”*? Because that sounds like bullshit
Nope, diehard fucking liberal here. That is the most common usage of Zionism. And way to spout off about Israeli aggression while not acknowledging decades of terrorism, a national charter calling for the slaughter of all Jews, institutional propaganda taught in Gaza schools teaching literal children to kill Jews, the martyr fund, firing rockets from hospitals and schools and hotels housing international journalists, destroying water treatment plants to turn water pipes into rockets, filming the slaughter of thousands to brag, etc. Etc. Etc.  Of course Israel has committed horrible actions back. It's been a powder keg for decades (millennia?), but killing Arabs is not their goal. 

If anything is simple about the conflict at all - it's this. Israel can't make peace with Hamas. They can't make peace with a group of innocent civilians either. They have to make peace with a legitimate government body in Gaza. That does not exist right now. Painting the issue so simplistically and one-sided, as the students did, is offensive. The professor was right to be pissed. People with power over others exercise it. Employers can also fire and badmouth their employees. Pretending otherwise just sounds naive.
I dont disagree with many of your points and I understand where you're coming from. I dont understand where ""How is it that we can criticize every single nation on Earth EXCEPT for Israel? "" is coming from tbh.

heres where i disagree. In a democracy you vote out people that do not represent your views. would a candidate that still sees nothing wrong with the iraq war get voted into office today? no. however politicians in israel with extreme views have the support of the people, so their methods are a better representation of its people than the US.

secondly, no one said anything about sense of entitlement to speak at events. it simply establishes their stance on free speech.

third. im not a fan of what this professor did either. im not defending what his beliefs or ideology. thats why i simply asked a question that you have failed to give a straight forward answer.

Im simply asking. For a law firm that is hiring. From a HR point of view. In terms of assessing hiring risk. Keeping the well being of the firm in mind, is """"Ask if they support discriminatory bylaws or other acts and resolutions blaming Jews and Israelis for the Hamas massacre. "" unreasonable?  why is a simple yes/no answer so difficult for you? look at how many paragraphs you wrote on things i dont disagree or dont care about. Law firms hire with their interest in mind, not based on what a professor says. unless, what he says serves in their interest.
I like the implication that trapping 2 million civilians in unlivable conditions, while dropping bombs and white phosphorus on innocent communities is like…Israel’s only option or something lmao.
And ""right of return"" for Jews is not ludicrous?
Effort from both sides. Efforts which have previously all failed. And time to build up trust. Which just got reverted back a few decades this week.

:/
What are you like getting a PHD in Jihad?
I’m generally not fond of any kind of ethnic nationalism, most state formations throughout history tend to be imposed by violence including post-colonial states that were the product of anti-colonial movements that I tend to be highly sympathetic to erupted in civil wars, ethnic cleansing, and other types of political violence. Former colonized nations like South Africa, Indonesia, and India immediately became colonizers right after their growing independence (Namibia, East Timor & West Papua, Kashmir) Israel follows a similar pattern.

I’m against oppression and advocate for universal human rights, I don’t have sympathy for ethnic nationalism. I think we should help build state formation out of purely practical arrangements, and not emerging from such ideologies. I’m personally Korean and I agree with most people in my country against apologetics for Japanese colonialism, but I have so many stories about how Korean nationalism annoys me.
Israeli oversight over Palestine does not give it sovereignty as a nation. That is still a way to control it. 

As a nation, Israel can protect its borders and set its own travel/migration laws to assess who gets to enter it -- as do all other countries. 

Hamas does not represent all Palestinian people, over 50% of whom are children. All Palestinian people are not part of Hamas. It is possible to stop conflating the two and recognize the humanity of innocent people who are powerless and suffering.
And what a way to misconstrue the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund. 

[It pays FAMILIES of th](https://militarypay.defense.gov/benefits/death-gratuity/#:~:text=The%20death%20gratuity%20program%20provides,serving%20in%20certain%20reserve%20statuses)ose killed, injured, and imprisoned while carrying out political acts of RESISTANCE to Israeli displacement and violence.

It is no different than the [death gratuity program](https://militarypay.defense.gov/benefits/death-gratuity/#:~:text=The%20death%20gratuity%20program%20provides,serving%20in%20certain%20reserve%20statuses) which pays the surviving family of members of the US armed forces. 

Don't like it? Ask Israel to stop forcefully displacing and killing Palestinians to occupy their land.
[deleted]
Your ""diehard liberal"" beliefs seem to only extend to American politics. It's interesting how American Jews support liberal policies at home, but don't hesitate to back Israel, a right-wing ethno-state. I've noticed many Jews here are extremely pro-refugee, but have no problem with Israel's zero-tolerance strategy for African refugees or its requirement for any immigrant to be Jewish. If America decided to only let White Christians immigrate here, they would go crazy with outrage.
Every time we criticize Israel, the government, we get labeled as antisemites. This doesn’t happen with any other nation where a specific ethnic group is the majority. 

When Trump was in office, i did not feel personally attacked when he was rightfully critiqued. And he “won” the election. Right? People can separate the state and its policies from the people it represents in EVERY other instance except for Israel. Why?

I didn’t realize that my saying  “IT IS UNREASONABLE” wasn’t enough of an AFFIRMATION. You need a yes? Here it is: YES. 

And again, the main topic is the professor’s letter — his wielding of power against students and clear hypocrisy, not the law firm’s choice as a private employer. Employers do this ALL the time. Political ideologies and beliefs are not a protected category. Hell people get fired for ALL sorts of silly reasons all the time.

Again, this professor conflates Israel with Israeli people. The student criticized ISRAEL. Not the people.

Look at you reading all my paragraphs and still not staying on topic.
You want to take another shot at answering the question instead of deflecting?
Under the premise of a **two state solution** right of return for another state's population into one state is really really stupid. You're demographically erasing the other state, so it's a nonstarter for talks.
So what’s a better, realistic option?
I wasn't equating Hamas with all Palestinians. Your last comment noted that the Israeli government didn't support a two-state solution. I was mirroring that, saying that Hamas ( the gazan government) doesn't support it. 

And come on, really? I feel like your first point was just made out of pure stubbornness or complete indifference to Israeli lives.
This is just lazy.No, the US doesn't pay stipends to the families of American suicide bombers. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund
I didn't say it was all self-defense. The whole purpose of my comment was to provide some other side, the Israeli side of the argument, which I barely scratched the surface of. How could I? There are thousands of years of history here. The students in question ignored the complexity entirely (boiling it down to Israel = bad), just as they ignored the effect their efforts to ban anti-zionist speakers have on other people. 

I obviously get that you are complaining. By calling you/ the students naive, I'm complaining, too.
No, I am strongly in favor of liberal policies around the world, such as free healthcare, addressing climate change around the world, etc. My liberal views are in no way limited to the United States. As for Israel, [I share the views of many left-wing Israeli leaders and liberals in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/10/15/israel-palestine-hamas-terrorism-sympathy/) that the best outcome is a two-state solution, and that Hamas is hellbent on ensuring that does not happen. Terrorism is not conducive to peace. As for why Israel is an ethno-state, I have answered that elsewhere. You create a false equivalency when you equate Israel with a fictional body who allows only white Christians in - there is no need for a safe harbor in the world for white Christians. White Christians have not faced thousands of years of genocide. Israel is the one safe place in the world for Jewish refugees to flee (note that [holocaust refugees were turned away by Americans](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-government-turned-away-thousands-jewish-refugees-fearing-they-were-nazi-spies-180957324/) in WWII, sent back to Germany to die). Believe it or not, this is still necessary today. That said, Israel isn't entirely Jewish, as it is home to Muslims and Christians as well.  The Jewish population is extremely diverse, hailing from all over the world (largely including neighboring countries, which made life for Jews unsafe). 

I certainly do not agree with all of Israel's policies. Their recent constitutional crisis makes me heartsick, for example. I do not agree with all of the U.S.'s policies either, yet I naturally support the United States overall.
you changed the topic. im sticking to mine. how is sticking to my topic not staying on topic. im simply entertaining other points you've made.

lets be real here, nomatter who or what you criticize someone will call you names for it. the question if the name fits the bill. if you're simply being objective and impartial, its says more about those doing the labeling than you.

Im surprised at the reactions to the professor. If you've been labeled as an antisemite you know those who share his views are plenty. and its precisely those who are reluctant to criticize hamas for the attack that serve as a valuable resource for zionist hardliners to continue pushing their rhetoric. Dont forget Netanyahu strengthened hamas. [https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/)  [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-11/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-needed-a-strong-hamas/0000018b-1e9f-d47b-a7fb-bfdfd8f30000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-11/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-needed-a-strong-hamas/0000018b-1e9f-d47b-a7fb-bfdfd8f30000) why? cuz they benefitted from it.  from a superficial level its counter-intuitive, but in actuality israel's propaganda and excuses for its actions hold no weight if their opposition is weak.

I think this is where we disagree. I dont agree with the student criticizing israel. disregard for civilian life, whether its hamas or IDF is wrong. and is it inaccurate to conflate israel with its people? look at the polling. ive mentioned before most israeli people support their hardline government.
I came here to answer the question of whether or not the attacks on Gazan’s are self-defense. I never came here to answer your question and you don’t seem to get that. My honest opinion is that I don’t feel I’m in the position to decide how to engage with a conflict of this scale. I would look to people who study this conflict for more information on how to resolve it.
I feel like I'm missing something here. Even with a two state solution, how is it stupid to allow people whose homes ended up being drawn into another religion's state and who were forced to move out to come back to the place where they used to live? And how is this any more demographically erasing than giving a right to anyone in the world of a particular demography the right to live there? Do you think a Catholic who moved from Northern Ireland to Ireland shouldn't be able to come back to Northern Ireland because allowing that would cause a ""demographic erasure"" of Protestants?
You continue to mischaracterize the PAMF when the link you shared explicitly says that it ""pays monthly cash stipends to the families of Palestinians **killed**, **injured**, or **imprisoned** while carrying out politically motivated violence against **Israel**""

So it is NOT just suicide bombers.

YOU are being lazy and intentionally misleading by saying that  the PA pays ""its citizens to carry out suicide bombs against Israelis.""

And you are choosing to ignore the fact that Palestine [has no army and](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/#:~:text=According%20to%20various%20reports%2C%20Netanyahu,West%20Bank%20and%20Hamas%20in)Israel's violent and inhumane grip on Palestinian society [led to the development of extremist groups like Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/#:~:text=According%20to%20various%20reports%2C%20Netanyahu,West%20Bank%20and%20Hamas%20in) which operate in retaliation to Israeli violence.

So in essence, Hamas and ANY person who engages in politically motivated violence against Israel's invasion IS in essence operating in defense of Palestine, the state. Which again, is LEGAL under international law. 

With that said, it is disheartening that innocent Israelis are victimized by retaliatory attacks.

Adrian wins by 1 point, nice try Pebbles.
I'm not arguing against the right to aliyah for Jews to Israel. And I think it's commendable that you support peace for both sides and a 2-state solution. What I'm asking, is do you support Israel's zero tolerance toward any non-Jewish migrants? The way Israel is currently set up is not simply a safe haven for Jews, but a right-wing ethnostate for Jews.

[https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/02/22/587858424/israel-gives-some-asylum-seekers-a-choice-deportation-or-jail](https://www.timesofisrael.com/a-real-threat-pm-backs-widespread-arrests-eyes-deportations-in-migrant-crackdown/#:~:text=Some%2030%2C000%20migrants%2C%20mostly%20from,barrier%20along%20the%20desert%20border)

[https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-half-of-jewish-high-schoolers-think-arabs-shouldnt-vote-in-israel/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-half-of-jewish-high-schoolers-think-arabs-shouldnt-vote-in-israel/)
You have just perfectly described why Hamas is doing this. They believe they can act with impunity because they can commit atrocious terrorist acts, use civilians as shields, and demand global outrage if anyone does anything in response *ignoring that responding is the only realistic option they have*. Israel cannot simply be victim of a terrorist attack, see Hamas hiding behind its children, and say, yeah you got us there good play, see you next time you decide to murder us. 

Those terrorists have learned to *weaponize your sympathy*. They are *using you*.
It's not practical. The original homes don't exist anymore and/or are populated by different people. There are approximately 6 million descendants of 1948 Palestinian refugees. If they were allowed to return to their original towns/homes in Israel, a country of 9 million people, they would cause a massive demographic, housing, and political crisis -- remember these are ethnic populations that have been vehemently fighting each other for 80+ years. Moreover, neither Israelis nor Palestinians have any desire to share governance.
So it is not JUST suicide bombers (fixed the emphasis for you). It was the millions in payments to suicide bombers I was upset about. The Wikipedia page I provided has significant language on the ""pay-to-slay"" aspect of the program that encourages slaughter of civilians and condemnation of the program from multiple international governments. Your above argument paints all Palestinian violence towards Israeli citizens as justified (intense stance) and legal (incorrect stance). You are justifying terrorism, instead of taking the rational view that Palestinians could focus on military targets (IDF/ outposts) or productively work towards actual peace with Israel.
Yep, it's fair to say we definitely don't agree. I also find it fucking insane that people defending a country the size of New Jersey, who have repeatedly returned land in exchange for peace, who were all over the world but returned to Israel, who have repeatedly consented to peace proposals from neutral third parties over land divisions, who have fled genocide from countries on all sides, are called colonizers like they're the fucking British empire. Yes, settlements in Palestinian land are bad. Those are antagonist to the cause of peace. But this conflict is not defined by the odd settlement. Israel has demolished Israeli settlements in the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza strip, and elsewhere for peace before, and there is no reason they wouldn't do so for peace again. Israelis, the people, do give a shit about Palestinians and overwhelmingly want peace.  Okay, I'm tired too and going to bed.
The middle east region is overwhelmingly arab/ Muslim - if Israel was not an ethno-state by policy, it would quickly become overwhelmingly non-Jewish, and its status as a safe-haven for Jews seeking aliyah would be endangered. That view is not exclusive to the right-wing. 

 It should and does take in some asylum seekers (as your source provides, it currently hosts 30,000 migrants from Sudan and Eritrea alone). Taking refugees from these areas is not a black and white issue -[Egypt also doesn't take them in easily.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/01/27/egypt-forced-returns-eritrean-asylum-seekers) Likely because Eritrea is a nightmare -[It is consistently the poster child of human rights violations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Eritrea) There will necessarily be issues in taking in people from that country. I would never agree that all should be deported, and your article doesn't suggest that is the view of most Israelis either (while Netanyahu would like that, even he couches the argument as being only towards those who participated in riots). Your second article is from a poll of high schoolers. I definitely don't agree with those high schoolers that Israeli arab citizens should be denied voting rights. I am American. I believe in democracy. I certainly understand their fears, though, given that they have lived lives surrounded by Arab states that have fought for their destruction.
If you can't recognize the vast difference between Israel's current agenda of carpetbombing Gaza's entire civilian population out of revenge (most of whom are <20 years old) and *doing absolutely nothing* you're lying

Idk how about try investigating and prosecuting Hamas specifically instead of violently punishing ALL palestinians? What new logical perversion will you invent to gloss over these war crimes?
I don’t go to berkeley or anything. It seems Reddit just wants to show me posts that will drive me insane lol. 

Just wanted to say you did an incredible job in this thread.
Thanks for giving your thoughts. I may disagree on some points here, but you give a fairly reasonable answer
To address a few of your points though, Israelis youth are fundamentally more right-wing than older generations. Given they will be the new voters, this is cause for serious concern

Anti-African views do represent at least half of Israelis: https://www.timesofisrael.com/most-israeli-jews-agree-africans-are-a-cancer/amp/

Netanyahu and many Israelis would absolutely like to deport all of them, but they simply can’t. Instead they treat them poorly in hopes that they all leave: https://www.timesofisrael.com/offered-little-hope-african-migrants-despair-of-israel-as-a-refuge/
I can recognize that difference. It is Israel's entire history of living next to people who want to genocide them. This happened in 2008, it happened in 2014, and war crime rocket attacks are a daily occurence. Israel has nuclear weapons a the capability to exterminate every single person living there. They *don't*. They are showing restraint that hasn't existed for the vast majority of human history. 

What I don't understand is the glossing over of the war crimes Hamas is *currently* committing. Right now. Not just murdering raping beheading kidnapping civilians in an unprovoked attack. But to their own people. Hamas *intentionally entrenches themselves with their own civilians to maximize their own casualties.* That, too, is a war crime. They have used red crescent emblems and civiilian clothing to disguise attacks, war crimes for the obvious reason that doctors and civilians are potential threats. You cannot simply go to their capitol building and arrest everyone there and that is *intentional on the part of hamas*.
Thank you, I tried. I wish the topic could be less toxic.
Yawn.

I asked for a *new* logical perversion. You're just parroting the same exact nonsense I've heard zionists argue for decades. Get some new talking points, or maybe even try developing your own independent thought someday.
Then you should have a counterargument ready to go. By all means, share it. 

""Yawn I know these people are acting like terrorists tell me something I don't know"" is completely intellectually dishonest and lazy."
Don’t Lease From Them!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d7ngnn/dont_lease_from_them/,2024-06-03 20:23:25,"After moving into one of The Berkeley Group's properties last fall, I encountered several issues that impacted my living situation, including flooding on the first floor.

1. Internet. 
The wifi is always down for some reason.
It's been an issue all year long and it was down for a month last September. In addition, cellular data barely works indoors.

2. Flooding. First floor flooded early this year, forcing two tenants to move out for the rest of their terms.
The Berkeley Group failed to notify tenants on other floors, creating safety risks and potentially exacerbating damage.

3. Expensive. Single rooms (99 sqft) that were previously flooded is priced at $2400 with shared bathroom and kitchen with 7 other residents!

Many people are moving out, as The Berkeley Group has not been transparent of the issues. In summary, my experience at The Berkeley Group's property has been far from satisfactory. Good luck finding apartments y'all.","Just moved out from a Berkeley Group apartment. Our community manager never once responded to my messages. It was so difficult just getting the lock on our door fixed (it’s an automatic lock that kept dying and we had pets that kept getting out because the lock is what holds the door closed). 

The washing machine and dryer tore all of our clothes, and they kept shutting the water off for extended periods of time and not telling us until the day before. The dryer would also do this weird thing where it would fog up the entire apartment, stripping some of the paint off of the walls. I haven’t gotten my security deposit back but best believe I’m contesting if they try to charge us for that. 

All in all, it wasn’t horrible, though I’d def recommend trying to find other apartments first before settling for them. There are def better options. The new apartment I’m at, for example, our new community manager is so much more accessible (thanks Alice!)
Do not lease with PCM (property care management) rentals either! Can go on for hours about the nightmares they’ve done with random super expensive charges and refusal to fix issues present on move in day to the house we rented
Oh boy I have so much to say about them. 

There was literal mold in my unit and they told me it was normal lol. All my housemates and I developed respiratory issues for probably half a year. They wanted to remodel our parking garage into units and gave short notices for us to remove our cars. They told us ""remove your car or we will tow it,"" causing dozens of people scrambling to find a new parking situation on short notice. Idk how this was allowed since some people had parking spots as part of their lease. Numerous tenants tried to come together to stop TBG from the removal of the cars. Did not work. Eventually, residents who lived in the building for decades (before TBG bought the building) were fed up with them and eventually moved out of their long term homes. TBG would always give a short notice to shut off our water for half a day because of construction. Most of the time they would give no heads up about maintenance coming into our unit and we would get woken up early in the morning. This happened multiple times even after requesting that they give a heads up. When they did notify us about maintenance coming to our unit, it would be after they had already arrived.. The washer/dryer would cause so much humidity it felt gross and the windows would fog up a lot. Also they ignore a lot of messages it's crazy. I could go on and on.
Had a house tour with them last week for 2430 Prospect. I showed up several minutes early with a scheduled appointment but there is no tour guide to greet me. I called their website, and some guy said “Oh yeah I saw you on our schedule.” So why isn’t anyone here? I waited around for about 10 minutes until some young guy (likely a student, he couldn’t have been a day over 20) shows up and escorts me to the closest room. He’s rushing me throughout the entire thing, dodging my questions about rent and utilities, and overall being very nonchalant and unprofessional. When I ask him for a specific price on the room that he showed me, he gets defensive and says “Well you should know that prices in the area are going to go from about $2k to $1,800 a month for a single.” Sir, that’s not what i asked you. I simply wanted to know the cost of the unit he had showed me. It was giving condescending and mansplainy (I’m a woman of color, if it matters).

On my way out (literally less than 5 minutes after showing me the room, because he was rushing me throughout the entire thing) one of his coworkers showed up and made a joke about his phone being “r-worded” for having a case that didn’t fit. Super weird and actually baffling how they could speak like that next to a potential customer, literally feet away. overall, the experience was highly unprofessional, and ofc I decided to find a different house to rent.
Class action lawsuit? Anyone report them for slum lord conditions? Anyone report them to the health board for mold and non venting dryers? Don't Berkeley rentals have to follow housing regulations like the rest of the state?
what’s Berkeley group? Is it like sterling berkeley or smth?
They are the WORST!! So expensive too!!! A double for 1400+ and a single for 2000 with shared bathroom and communal area
I can concur they are terrible!
Are there any good property managers to rent from in Berkeley? I had a bad experience this year with Common Living, who later handed the property over to Kasa Properties.
Can’t yall sue? They sound terrible.
I've heard similar things from my friends renting with them. They market themselves as ""fun"" (especially for the group living environments) but everyone I know has had an opposite experience. FYI -- the dryer venting into the house and causing all of that humidity is REALLY bad. It's unsafe, can lead to mold due to all of the condensation, but the property manager never fixed it. Additionally, when my friend moved in, the construction was supposed to be done but it ended up taking over a month past what was promised and even for a year afterwards, the unit still smelled really strongly of new paint and was kind of nausea-inducing. My friend developed all sorts of respiratory issues. I also lived in a newly renovated building with a different company, but they likely used low-VOC paint (usually more expensive), so I didn't have the same issue with a strong paint smell.
You’re either my roommate or we at least live in the same place. The water shut offs were so terrible, it took hours for them to turn on after the shut down. Our dryer did the exact same thing.
we must’ve lived in the same apartment because my housemate and i also developed respiratory issues that was likely due to the mold in our unit. we were told that it was normal as well lmao it’s ridiculous
You dodged a massive bullet there. The management is a joke and honestly I don’t think anyone could tell me who actually runs it. Like there’s no name for the CEO or anything like that. At least premium lists their people on their site.
Same experience ngl. They were not transparent at all. I hope you end up finding a better property.
lol. I called them about a year ago. The girl who answered asked the same question 4 times in a row (may have had people from the Philippines answer the phone)
The Berkeley Group. https://tbgpm.com
2000+199 utilities
I rented from Kasa for 2 years and AP management for my last year, no major issues with both.
it takes time and effort, especially for students like us, and that’s why others and I are posting this on reddit to alert our fellow peers to be careful when leasing from them https://tbgpm.com.
I’m sorry y’all experienced this. Definitely explore other options other than Berkeley Group. For my instance, the internet was down the entire month during October.
i went on a handful of tours that day, and since have found a much cheaper and larger property! I hope people in the future are not tricked by the beauty of their website when researching this place. in-person tours will always reveal the truth!
Looks like they're leveraging the UC Berkeley name to get people to think it's really good, using similar university font. But is it really affiliated? In reality it's just another lousy apartment complex.
Mine is only 2000 after utilities but it’s not in an apartment, it’s in a house 

I think ur house looks smaller than mine tho, probably that’s why it’s more expensive. I have to share communal area with ~40 people"

I literally did everything right and i see everyone else having sex parties. maybe i’m just not cut out for berkeley.,"you had me in the first half ngl
there is Steamworks in Berkeley. Its a gay sauna, they throw sex parties and every male 18+ is welcome. Don't thank me
Folsom Street Fair tomorrow
If you haven’t been to a sex party by now at Berkeley, you’re absolutely a loser. Even the most common folks are invited. Sorry not sorry to see you go.
it freaks me out how many of these posts I see on this sub as someone whose always wanted to go to berkeley
folsom street fair is tmr and just a bart ride away :D
Have you considered jerking off in peoples park and trying to entice the party to you?

If that’s doesn’t work, my go to is to wait for parents weekend and then take your mom into the bandos on Clark Kerr.
You need to go to SF for that.
![gif](giphy|eIN3Ko5tcQps22pbSo|downsized)

Try asking for sex during the naked run, that’s where you’ll get your first invite
I was about to say “same” until I saw the sex party thing haha p
Have you tried thugging it out tho

Steamworks.
Couldn’t look you in the eye
I went to Berkeley not too long ago. The sex parties are at the Co-ops. I even lived in one that was clothing optional. Let's just say it was a ""Hip"" house.
We should throw our own (no girls allowed)
aw i'm sorry
You did everything right and they indicted you

Don’t let them get to you. Take a look at the usernames, it’s really unfortunate but it’s usually the same couple of people making those posts (Note: I wish those people well and hope thatsome changes happen and they can either enjoy Berkeley more or find a better-suited path for them).

i've been there, but only a couple of times...
you mean they're lying about the sex parties
Well, they do. It’s college after all. But they aren’t “make a Facebook event and invite all your friends” like other kinds of parties talked about on the sub.
Co-ops disagree

Oh I know it’s a silly post but also I’m not gonna get in so it’s all good all around

Please don’t go or protest the Matt Walsh speech,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0dey/please_dont_go_or_protest_the_matt_walsh_speech/,2022-11-16 09:41:35,"Trust me, I for one am not happy we are platforming Matt Walsh on campus (I think his takes on things—LGBTQIA+ rights, women, etc— are disgusting and he doesn’t deserve to have the platform he does because he only instills hatred to marginalized groups, whether or not you agree does not matter at and i will not debate you in replies because that is not what this post is about), that being said, I please urge people to just ignore he is here.

I keep hearing about how protests are happening about him being here tomorrow, and while I totally understand why, I personally don’t think it would be the best idea. From what I have seen from people like him speaking, he is only here to make a rise out of people, hoping to gather media on how he’s a victim or some other hogwash (Im basing this on speeches similar to his happening at other schools and how the speaker and students reacted). With the strikes happening already, there is already general activity happening around campus that isn’t the usually here (on a regular weekly basis I mean), and protesting would take away from the strike while simultaneously giving him reason to cut pieces of what is going on on campus and make it about him.

I realize a lot of people are already planning to ignore he is here, I just thought I would try to make a post here to urge people to just not show up to his speech, because if no one shows up or interacts with him he has no media or people to make a platform off of.","The energy people would use to go to M@tt Wal$h should instead be going to the strike. They’ll actually be protesting something that should be protested. M@tt Wal$h deserves no energy
Deplatforming is, indeed, the best method with these fools  


Ignore them until they wither up
having milo yiannopoulos 2.0 situation would be wild
If you have the urge to protest him, remember that he came here to incite people, so you'll actually be fanning the flames.

You'll end up on some documentary or Youtube clip where he highlights his tactful response to you.

I would mention free speech, not deplatforming and such, but the realities and ideals of life are often on opposite ends.
I have very little expectations for berkeley students when it comes to this. It was just sad witnessing the reaction to Ann Coulter coming to campus. I’d love to be surprised with a tame response to this.
Y’all ever go to class?
Just like the antivaxxers I see on the road whenever I drive by--I ignore them.

Honestly seeing people having different opinions don't offend me. What offends me is when people use physical violence to silence others like it's communist china.

Your ideas are never going to be the morally correct one forever.
Do not speak to this man! There is no point you could make, no figure you could provide, no counterargument that will convince him or his supporters. Focus on the strike, the upcoming break, and your finals my friends! It is not worth it.
Yeah, the Proud Boys are probably going to show up just like they did in Davis to start fights and get the event cancelled so they can play the victims.
To be fair - when's the last time you heard of Milo Yiannopolous? That said, attracting too much attention to the guy is counterproductive - he's a leech and that's what he's looking for. I recommend reaching out to administration with your concerns in writing so that they're less receptive of him in the future. It's not making a huge impact, but it's also not giving him rage-bait for clicks.
Matt who?
100%. All they want is footage of him getting a rise out of people. Don't give it to them.
Lol, isn't it an open forum? I don't understand why the people protesting don't go and debate/prove him wrong if they feel so strongly for their views and against his.
Some one should at least pie him.
Is this guy a Milo wannabe?
https://youtu.be/wCl33v5969M

Not protesting in these situations and passively hoping he doesn't get any coverage isn't a great idea here. He already has an audience. This only guarantees their beliefs and actions will go unchecked.
Yes guys, dont go. He has first amendment rights and you have no logically sound rebuttal for anything he says/asks. Lets just stay at home.
Nah
Dumb commies
Provide a counter narrative instead of crying foul. If the counter to this is shunning and cancelling, how are you different from the others that you label ""fanatics""?

LGBT+ views aren't globally accepted and same is the case of any other organization. No one should be forced to accept anything.
Yeah, shut everyone up who views doesn’t align with yours. With this thinking, things will only get worse.
>LGBTQIA+ 

How could you leave out 2S? Bigot!
Believes in biological facts = hate? Okay 🤣
Im curious what he will say. When is this event?
And if you’re going to be on campus, BLAST SOME COPYRIGHTED DISNEY MUSIC
Deplatforming refers to censoring and banning them from platforms for speech.  I think you just mean “ignoring.”
[deleted]
when I hear 'deplatforming' my mind goes to censorship, not allowing someone to voice their opinions. am I conflating these two ideas?
What happened with Milo?
i know the event is over already but this. emphasis on ""convince him."" the science is already firmly in support of lgbt rights especially trans rights. it's just him and his supporters never cared about science in the first place. it's like trying to convince a scientologist or a flat earther. they're not here to have a good faith debate, just to stir the pot and advocate for bombing childrens hopsitals. these aren't good rational people, they are nazi demagogues.
It definitely helped that Milo Yiannopolous got fired from Breitbart shortly after [the February 2017 protests propelled him to the peak of his fame](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0crgcgb), but that had nothing to do with the protests and everything to do with his spectacularly tone-deaf love letter to the supposedly lost art of man/boy pederasty.
Because he's not there to debate. He has no interest in actually learning anything. He's a fascist and he doesn't need to be given any respect
Why do that when you can scream/yell incoherently instead?
""no logically sound rebuttal"" for pedophilia?
Not going and not listening is not ""cancelling"" . That isn't a fanatic approach at all, no one owes you their time. You're just salty that your fanboy won't have viewers.
If you read my whole post and you gathered from it that I am saying we should be “shutting everyone up who views doesn’t align with [mine]”, I feel bad for you. I never once said we, as a community, should shut him up, I said ignore. A fly can be buzzing in my ear and I can decide to ignore it, or I can “shut it up” by k!lling it. No, I am not directly equating shutting up a real person by k!lling them, I only give a metaphor of the difference between ignoring and shutting up. In this case, I can choose to ignore what Walsh says because I know he is not here to share his views, he is here to boost his ego by seeing people disagree with him. If he wanted to share his views with a supporting audience, he would not have gone to a school like this which is generally labeled as being ‘liberal’.

I'll take whatever's on offer at this point
Yup. They are outrage launderers. They turn righteous anger into money in their pockets.
No, I think that’s exactly what they mean. I don’t like Walsh either and I’m so happy people seem to be taking the ignoring him route instead of a repeat of Milo. He does, however, have the right to speak freely about his views, however terrible they may be.
Lot of people in here are somehow making this about hate speech, which was not the question.
Deplatforming just means you don't give the person a stage. Everybody has the right to free speech, but being invited to speak on stage at a prestigious university is a privilege (one which Matt Walsh does not deserve)
I think you're correct.  Deplatforming would be preventing him from speaking.  ignoring him would be, well, ignoring him.  The later is the best option. The former gives him what he wants.
You are conflating the right to free speech with a right to hate speech, which does not exist. This is a common mistake lately since the disinformation campaigns of the alt-right depend on this misunderstanding in order to proceed.
they downvoted you for asking a genuine legitimate question. merely questioning censorship gets you censored.. lol
People shot fireworks into MLK, students were shot with rubber bullets, and people lit a huge fire in front of mlk. Lots of property damage. You can find old news stories and pictures about it if you google it
Males are not and cannot become females. You are absolutely right, the science is very clear about that.
hmm i wonder if walsh will also get deplatformed cuz he's also a pedophile
Then go prove him wrong for the world to see. Yelling fascist from the back row is frankly pathetic and attempting to silence anyone because you don't like their point of view is ironically fascist itself.
he's a pedo? thats news to me lol
Lol @ another label, ""fanboy"". I am nobody's fanboy. There is no harm in a conversation, at least not with someone on Reddit unless you have a hardline approach on things.
I was addressing everyone and I don’t agree with all his views. But how is asking a simple question like, “what is a woman?” disgusting?
I'll take it.
Cut it down to L+
Explain using ""LGBTQIA+"" over ""LGBTQ+"" then. Or the continued changing of the pride flag. Explicit inclusion is clearly valued more than implicit inclusion.
Wym science isn’t something you believe in? Sure it is. Science is constantly changing. Don’t assume that the science of anything at any given time is the absolute truth, it’s just our best understanding of something. We once believed in a flat earth.
Well, male and female just is a biological fact, not just something you believe that you are🤷 idk how that has been construed as hate but you keep in doing your mental gymnastics to make sense of it
Sure, but no one group of activists controls who gets invited to speak at Berkeley.  And there are groups inviting Matt Walsh to speak.
I am with you: regardless  of whether it is proclaimed as hate speech I believe we should encourage all sides/perspectives to speak and actively give all a platform/stage.

If not hate speech, how do you justify discouraging discourse? 

Our biases blind us, and only by being exposed to varying voices can we learn to think critically. 

It is arrogant to  believe your worldview is oh-so-pure, while those that differ should not be afforded the ""privileges"" to speak to those who are inclined to listen.
No, this reading is incorrect. Deplatforming would not be *preventing* him from speaking, but simply not giving him the *opportunity* to make hate speech.   


The right to free speech is enshrined in our Constitution. The right to hate speech - and freedom from the consequences of that speech - is not.
[deleted]
Hate speech is free speech. You are mentally deficient.
[deleted]
Problem is, the definition of what constitutes “hate speech” or “violence” has widened significantly over the past 5 years. Often it appears that hate speech and “opinions we simply don’t agree with” have been conflated as one and the same.
yup. trans men are already men and trans women are already women. glad you recognize the facts.
>except he's not there to give anyone the opportunity to actually debate. he's there to give a speech about how trans people should be legally exterminated yada yada. it's not a public forum, these conservative speaking events are never real debates because they know the facts aren't on their side. plus i don't think a known pedophile deserves the platform for a good faith debate anyway.

Then go prove it. Show us all the facts are on YOUR side. You'd rather scream and cry outside the building with a sign instead. I'm not even a supporter of his. I'm just calling out the lunacy and cowardice of the individuals here. All tears, no backbone, every single time.
I just blocked this idiot who doesn't understand what fascism is lol

he literally publicly supports the impregnation of 16 year old girls, i'm not sure how much more of a pedophile someone can be.
There's no inherent harm in conversation but no one is obligated to give it to you. Not giving it to someone doesn't mean you're ""cancelling"" them. Someone isn't a ""fanatic"" for non-participation.
Ah yes, ""the woman question"", quite similar to ""the Jewish question"". Perfectly harmless. It's not like people are already actively creating anti-trans legislation in this country based on such a harmless, non-loaded question.
What is the difference between a psychic and an economist?

At least the psychic can lie convincingly!
bruh you're wasting your life and intellect to study a social ""science"" rather than devoting yourself to the purity of physics, biology, chemistry, engineering or mathematics. You are among the bottom of the barrel at Berkeley.
Intersex people exist with the same frequency as people with green eyes. *Intersex is profligate across species worldwide.* Go back to Bio 101
By the definition gender is separate from male and female. I don’t think anyone is denying the biology behind sex. It’s not hard to understand lol
[deleted]
Uh, you're not with me. You're on the side that wants to give fascists a megaphone.
> The right to hate speech - and freedom from the consequences of that speech - is not.

This is flatly untrue. See the flag-burning and gay funeral protest cases as an example of hate speech that is fully protected.
The first amendment doesn’t make a distinction for hate speech.  Hate speech is a constitutionally protected right.
I can’t get hired to speak either. Am I being deplatformed??
ty. there's also the part where nothing he says is objectively hateful..
Why are you getting legal advice from Wikipedia
Lol, coward.
Fuck, I take my comment back. After reading your bio and past comments I feel really sad for you.
source?
What is a women then? What is it or are we still trying to come up with a new definition? I bet you don’t have an answer.
Social sciences are great! They're important, ""how do people and society work"" turns out to be a pretty useful field. Economics likes to raise itself on a pedestal above other social sciences though, claiming itself to be more ""rigorous"".

(I object to this, because if it were actually more rigorous, it wouldn't keep getting things it claims to understand really well *wrong*.)
Oh, Matt Walsh is talking about intersex people?

I think we both know that isn’t what he is talking about or what people are mad about…
Science much - Green Eyes - 2%, Intersex - .018%.  Magnitudes of difference.
[deleted]
>What makes someone a female for example?

ironically, this question is the entire point of Walsh's film

I'm not supporting it, just pointing that out.
A female would be someone who is born with xx chromosomes, biologically produces an ova the female gamete, has a womb and female reproductive sex organs and is capable of the reproduction of offspring.
""Freedom of speech for me but not for thee""

I want to give everyone a megaphone, the right to free speech. 

You want authoritarian control-- ""fascist"" is a subjective term. If you want antifascist laws they will be defined by the powers that be and enforced by the cops. How's that worked out in the past?
I specifically said freedom from *consequences* of hate speech (i.e. deplatforming) is not a protected class. Not sure what you hope to prove here.

i feel sad that you support someone who wants to impregnate 16 year olds.

""Walsh defended girls as young as 16 getting pregnant as long as they’re marrying men, saying, 'The problem is not, per se, teenage pregnancy — it’s unwed pregnancy.'""
Serious question: What the fuck does it matter?

Like at this moment in time the only reason people are asking this question is to harm trans people. 

So that puts you into one of two camps: 

You're either trying to be harmful -- or -- You're trying to have an ontological debate, but lack the self awareness and empathy to see that your ""muh debate tho"" stance is just helping to ratchet up hate against already marginalized people.
A woman is someone who identifies with and performs womanhood
This is a funny comment, because you clearly returned with a first-page Google result and haven't been in the field for years as I have - so I'll tell you: many intersex conditions are only considered intersex *by the people who have them.* PCOS is one; hyperandrogenism and androgen sensitivity is another.

There are *loads* of intersex conditions and variants among human people and many of these folks don't even know they're intersex because it's either been hidden from them from birth (it is not uncommon for doctors to 'correct' these conditions by excising peoples' gonads as infants or young children, and then falsify records to say their patient had cancer; then the patient only discovers the truth in their 40s after a ton of research) -- or for them to simply not find out until they have issues having kids, or other things occur. Some people never find out.

This is not a situation where the first page of Google results will give you functional knowledge. But good luck with this gotcha approach anyway - that won't serve you either.
Tru there really wasn’t however definitions evolve and to say that someone must play into certain gender expectations based on something as arbitrary as sex seems pretty stupid. I honestly think the idea of gender as a whole is pretty stupid but since it exists, I think giving people a choice in it, rather than forcing it onto people based on their biology, is the better option.
Damn, TIL my mom who had a hysterectomy isn't female.

You specifically said the right to hate speech is not in the constitution.  It is.
You made a more general statement that hate speech as a whole is unprotected. 

Of course there is less protection from the “consequences of speech”. You’re protected from being shot or imprisoned for it, not economic or social consequences.
I am not responsible for your misreading of Supreme Court cases 🤣 Have a good night bruh
Well, a few points (disclaimers: I am politically moderate, right leaning. I hate pedophiles and dont condone pedophilia in any way shape form):

1. To call him a pedo based on the above-linked article is intellectually dishonest. The quote you are referencing - ""at about 16, you're an adult who is mature and can make decisions..."" - is contextualized within a conversation where he's making a claim that 16-19yo's are biologically adult beings who 1. are capable of breeding, and 2. have historically had children and started families at younger ages (and done so more often) than the current generation. I have friends and family members who had children in their teens; that does not make them pedophiles. Matt Walsh implying that (for example) my 17yo mother getting pregnant with my 20yo father shouldn't be abhorred does not, imo, make him a pedo either.
2. The podcast referenced here is from 12 years ago. A lot has changed in the political correctness and societal landscape over the last decade or two. Is it possible that Matt Walsh, like many young adults, was at one point distasteful with some of his rhetoric or behavior? Sure. Does that render him a pedophile (or objectively bad person) or suggest that he can not or has not grown as a human being as he approaches the age of 40? Nope.
3. The linked article is authored by a far-left LGBTQ program director, who rather than making any attempt at civil discourse with Matt Walsh, takes a hybrid strawman/ad hominem approach in publishing what is nothing more than a hit piece.

I believe in objectivity. And though I appreciate and respect you and your opinions, I disagree with the claim you're making. I think Matt Walsh is a good dude trying to navigate a simultaneously progressive yet degenerative global landscape. You are of course not obliged to agree, and so I will not carry the conversation further than needed. Thanks for reading.
So the activists have expanded the definition of intersex to encompass more conditions than the scientists have.  I stay with the traditional definition rather than the one based on standpoint epistemology.
Infertile women still have the capability of having kids but not necessarily the ability, they still retain xx chromosomes, female sex orgsns etc the same goes for postmenopausal women and as for prepubescent children they will once they reach puberty have the capacity to have children and even prior again they still have the chromosomes which make them female and all the biological characteristics of a female.
Yes, that's what I'm saying
\*throws out blanket statement and runs away\*
the fact that you actually think someone as openly disgusting as matt walsh is a ""good dude"" completely destroys the facade of you being ""politically moderate"" lmao. have fun defending pedo fascists!
Again, *if you'd done even the bare minimum of research (which you clearly did not do)* you'd know that the 'scientists' you mention are in fact doctor members of for-profit urology associations which make an obscene sum of money on non-medically-necessary 'cosmetic' surgeries on intersex children. A number of them have even been sued for child abuse for using vibrators on toddlers to 'test the results' of their surgeries. There is not an independent governing body, it's just those dudes.   


Anyway, once again, read more. Have a good week.

Slander and lies - enjoy your bubble.  Have noted that you're in favor of experimental surgery on children with unclear long term outcomes.
Oh my god dude, STOP. You’re the exact kind of person OP wrote this post for. It’s not worth your time, let it go.
What is a woman?
The mental gymnastics you go through to cope with the silly notion that there is no objective basis in gender. Just look at the person. Even AI can predict whether somebody is male or female just from pictures of their faces.

You’re an idiot.

The phrase 'don't feed the trolls' exists for a reason
You learned 2+2=4 in 1st grade. Does that make it untrue or irrelevant? 

You’re argument is weak. And as an LGBT person I don’t like it when other people just assume all LGBT people are victims or agree with your perspective.
That’s the whole documentary’s point. No one can (or will) answer his question. You’re quick to demand a science based explanation, and then you poke holes at it. Which is fine. But what’s silly is that I’ve seen no one who ‘stands with science’ ever give their own scientific explanation. I never understood how one could speak with 100% absolute confidence about this topic without anything to back it up.
I mean, his point is that gender ideology activists (particularly trans activists) are refusing to answer the question.  Just like you are refusing to answer the question, instead poking holes in a simple “XX chromosomes” answer with “what about chromosomal abnormalities?”

The concern is less about whether experienced adults decide to identify as a different gender but rather more about whether educators push trans ideology on children and act as though the concept of biological sex is conservative propaganda, and push impressionable children into constantly questioning their own sex and thinking that they should consider puberty blockers and surgery (as children) if they ever feel uncomfortable in their bodies.

Undoubtedly he is not talking to moderates for the purpose of the documentary, he is talking to trans extremists that even most liberals wouldn’t align with, but the fact that these people exist, are sometimes in positions of power, and are pushing this kind of ideology on children should be cause for concern.

Given that we're in the midst of our first disinformation war, you may wish to update your definition of a troll
Really…you’re trying to use ring theory to debate that 2+2 isn’t 4? 

Does a grade school understanding of something equal understanding all of it’s complexities? No. Does having a factually based general understand of reality make your knowledge incorrect? No. 

Mammals only have 2 genders/sex’s. Those genders can be expressed in many ways, and there are very rare medical variances in characteristic but even in those cases mammals still fall into one of two gendered categories.
It is obviously a tool to push Walsh’s political agenda.

It is also a sincere topic for debate.

It is also meant to influence the conversation.

Why doesn’t it deserve an earnest response?  

The whole point is that “what is a woman?” has become a political question for trans activists and he thinks that it should not be.

Lol. So fragile.
My understand is quite complete, you just don’t like what I’m saying for personal or political reasons. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is incredibly rare. People who have androgen insensitivity syndrome are biologically male. While difficult and confusing and deserving of kindness and compassion, it does not change their sex. People who are born with varying degrees of genitalia or body variances that aren’t typical of their sex does not make them the opposite sex or a new sex (again, these cases are extremely rare). As for expression on the individual level, that was something until recently we decided didn’t have to have a label and obey certain norms (boys can be like pink and be interested in “girl” things, girls can be interested in “boy things”). I find your view of sex and gender as well as this new gender ideology very backwards and of a different era, as well as sexist and homophobic. 

Gender and sex until very recently have been interchangeably used as the same meaning. As for Walsh, his idiocy or agenda has nothing to do with me. He’s allowed to be an idiot with an opinion. We still have free speech in this country and I would argue he’s trying to reestablish a culture war that was decided long ago. The best thing you can do is ignore him and let him dwell in his small fringe of the world.
You’re ignoring the fact that the activists he confronts aren’t quietly living their lives as “women” but rather pushing this propaganda on children and suggesting that feeling discomfort in your body as a child should lead you to take puberty blockers (as a child).  

Is it really that unreasonable to engage them with questions?  If someone pushes propaganda you dislike don’t you push back and critique their arguments?

If someone identifies as a woman, fine, but if they use the government to compel me to call them a woman, I will resist.  If they tell my child to feel gender confusion and try to have them take puberty blockers or hide their conversations with them behind my back, I will resist.

Well you must be an outlier in your field, as there are copious amounts of research and biologists who disagree with your statements.  I don’t “want thing to work a certain way,” I am completely indifferent to the facts. They just are what they are. But I won’t be gaslit by activists oriented people who move the goal post in order push their postmodern critique of the world. Clearly neither of us is going to see the others view point.
Children do receive puberty blockers and sexual reassignment surgery.  Parental consent is really a moot point - if a minor under the age of consent was having sex with an adult, the state wouldn’t say “oh but did you have parental consent?  That makes it ok.”  These are experimental procedures with permanent consequences and no scientifically established benefits.  

The idea that impressionable children can’t possibly be impacted or influenced by trans propaganda is silly.  We have seen an absolute explosion in rates of children experiencing gender confusion and/or identifying as trans or “non-binary” (something that didn’t even exist until the last decade or so).  It is more popular than ever to identify as trans and you get parents pretending that their children don’t have a gender because they don’t want to “impose” a gender on them.  The consequences of this on mental health for this generation are serious.

In any case, I think you realize now that there WAS a point to the documentary because it raised issues requiring discussion, even if you disagree with him on every one of them.  Bringing light to gender ideology extremists is a worthy cause.  Obviously no one here wants to watch it or even consider that there might be another side to the debate… mostly because the extremists don’t want the moderates to realize how extreme their views are and recoil in horror.

Great, we agree medicine shouldn’t be politicized.  Too bad trans activists are politicizing it.  There is NO “well-established” science for transgender ideology.  Precocious puberty is completely unrelated. Which you know.  But of course, you wouldn’t bring up something unrelated in an argument like this, right?  That would be bad faith.

If there was a moderate willing to expose trans extremists that would be great.  Hm, imagine if there was even a well known liberal activist beloved around the world willing to call out trans extremists?  Like… JK Rowling?  

Oh wait, the left cancelled her the moment she didn’t parrot the exact viewpoints of trans extremists.  Now she’s a “transphobe.” 

Or how about Dave Chapelle another liberal who dared to talk about trans people in the context of telling a sympathetic positive story about a trans comedian he had worked with?  Oh wait, he’s cancelled too now.  

Sorry, but there is no “good faith” whatsoever on the left when it comes to trans issues.  Trans activists act like no one is allowed to have a viewpoint on the topic that doesn’t exactly mimic what they want and they are using the coercion of “hate speech” and deplatforming to force silence and compel obedience.
[deleted]
And there it is - “your viewpoints make us unsafe!”  No, sorry, not buying it.  Chapelle, Rowling and Walsh regularly receive death threats for expressing their views.  Hell, Walsh coming to Berkeley might result in a destructive riot.  And their most controversial viewpoint on the topic is that a man calling themselves a woman is distinct and different from a woman that is born a woman.  

You don’t get to claim the moral high ground on safety here.  You don’t get to censor people by making vague claims like that.  For one thing, no actual connection is established between the words and any harm.  For another thing, that can’t be the end of free speech.  We would laugh if a slaveowner told an abolitionist they can’t be allowed to speak because they are fomenting violence.  Controversial topics have to be discussed.   Yet if I question trans activist dogma in public I’m likely to get fired.  Yet you dismiss the idea that they have a powerful hold over MSM?  Chapelle and Rowling only retain their bully pulpits because they were literally the BIGGEST author in the world and the BIGGEST comedian in the world, and even now, the mainstream media treats them as disgraced.  When a normal person even lightly challenges it they risk their livelihood and yea, their safety for that matter.

Anyway can’t do this all day.  Eventually you will find that you aren’t far-left enough and the mob will come for you too.  Maybe you’ll blame yourself or maybe you’ll blame people like me, who knows."

That's rough! 21F here, and I'm having the same problem. I'm down to hang out anytime if that helps at all OP
Not sure why I see this even I’m not Berkeley. Prob Reddit knows that I’m in that state since my late middle school years to my high school and college years. 😂 I’m graduating too. I never regret, you shouldn’t too.  We always want what we don’t have, everything has both pro and con. Tbh, regrets is not useful, u either learned the lesson and change your way of living later, or u endure it and continue. Well, just me, most of the time I just don’t want to waste my energy to talk nonsense. I tried to approach my a few classmates to study together, but was been interpreted as I was interested in THEM… well… what can I say 😂. I remember, my middle school profs told me I was too mature to make friends with my classmates but I would find someone in high school. Then, in high school, my physics teachers said i was their favorite so I would definitely make friends in college. Now in college, my coworkers in a lab are very sweet to me, and they said I would make friends in grad school as a researcher 😂. Hope my funny story making you feel better?
I did the same thing I went to Berkeley too Graduated and had no friends. Feel free to message me
Even after school join the cal sail club. Plenty of cool people to meet there and you learn how to sail!
Real hard to make friends in todays society. People get so pissed off over everything. Talking to someone is not that hard to do, but when you call someone sir or maam out of respect you get corrected because that person does not identify as a sir or maam and sorry but its one or the other. Theres no third, fifth. Whetever genders, BUT these days there are. Okay lamp post go get coffee and just say hello to someone, maybe they will say hello back maybe they wont, but at least you tried
and whose fault is that…

^ this comment. I also didn’t make any friends, but truly it was because I was not mentally ok. I did get the courage to start taking medication during undergrad, and to me that was enough of a win.

And they live in the desert.



You really mean to tell me that that sounds more credible than a unicorn, which is basically just a horse with a horn???

I think the fuck not.","Let's be real here, folks. We've been ignoring the leathery elephant in the room for far too long. I'm talking about armadillos and their insidious plot to infiltrate our society.

Think about it. These little mammals with their armor-plated shells and quirky habits have been slowly but surely worming their way into our lives. First, it was those irresistibly cute armadillo plushies your kids begged you to buy. Then, suddenly, you're seeing armadillo emojis everywhere 🦔. Before you know it, they're starring in major Hollywood films and gracing the covers of haute couture magazines.

But it doesn't stop there, oh no. These cunning creatures have even infiltrated our lexicon with phrases like ""armadillo-ing"" to describe curling up into a tight ball (sounds suspiciously like their defensive posture to me). And let's not forget about the ""Texas Armadillo Races"" that are somehow considered a legitimate sporting event now.

Am I the only one who finds this deeply concerning? We're basically laying out the welcome mat for our new armored overlords. Mark my words, pretty soon they'll be demanding armadillo-only parking spaces.

So I implore you, my fellow humans, let's stop turning a blind eye to the armadillo agenda. We must nip this insidious plot in the bud before it's too late. After all, the armadillos are just getting started - who knows what other unsuspecting species will be next to join their ranks? Raccoons? Opossums? The mind boggles.

Wake up, sheeple! The armadillo supremacy is no laughing matter.

A better question is why should scorpions accept US?

Scorpions don't set out to harm humans, they simply hope for the opportunity to live their lives in peace. Humans, on the other hand, are always taking over and walking through scorpion territory without scorpion permission, screaming when we see them (do the scorpions scream when they see us?), and stepping on them, destroying their carefully built homes, and generally disrupting their lives and the lives of thousands of other species in the animal kingdom. 

For instance, humans scatter shoes all over. Shoes appear to scorpions to be nice, ready made, apartments. After they sign a lease and move in, feeling fortunate for their good luck, then more often than not a giant human foot comes in and tries to CRUSH the scorpion! 

Would humans, I ask you, not object to having a giant scorpion, the size of Godzilla, appear outside their apartment building or dorm and try to crush it and kill the scorpion people living there?

Scorpions have also been around MUCH longer than humans. Their fossils date back to the Silurian, which was more than 400 MILLION YEARS ago. Finally, less than one percent of scorpion species carry venom capable of killing humans. Can we say the same that less than one percent of humans are dangerous to both other humans and scorpions alike, and their arachnid allies?
Scorpions also live in the forest, I have them up on my farm in Humboldt.

Why don’t Berkeley students walk out?,https://i.redd.it/uz0d04pnopm91.jpg,2022-09-08 15:31:07,,"I just dont go to class😎
Cuz it's hot outside.
I mean it’s going to cool down in like a week or two. If you want it though it’s up to you. Organize that shit.
Berkeley students care too much about grades lmao
Cause Berkeley is cooler than Long Beach lol
Global warming doesn’t care if you walk out.
Be the change you wanna see. Organize a walkout
Because walking out would require us to go into the sun, where it’s hotter
Literally just wait it out… what is a walk out going to do but make you miss a lecture
Yes, the heat wave sucks big time and yes it's a health issue. But it's temporary, right? Walking out of class for an issue that's gonna be resolved in about a week doesn't really help. 

This is just a symptom of the larger problem of climate change. Maybe we can ask what the university as a whole can do against this?
Sept-Oct always heats up, get a fan, go to an ac library or other ac building on campus, it's hot but not that hot you will survive I promise. It would be nice but it's not necessary.  By Nov it'll be in the 60s again.
Cal has some of the best weather in the country. Minor inconvenience with the heat. My summer has been far worse than your summer and my winter will be much, much harsher than your winter.
If a Berkeley walkout happens for this I will join. It’s a huge health issue IMO
It’s like 86 degrees outside chill 😂😂😂
Damn what are we gonna do without CSULB art students?
Who goes to class?!?
It's even hotter outside tho.
Honestly because I really like my professors and would rather hear them lecture even in this heat.
a protest against... the sun? i can't imagine something more useless
A liberal's dilemma: 

Its fucking hot and we want AC! But if we all use AC we put strain on grid and need more energy, thus resulting in more global warming.
T
Classrooms are always either to hot or to cold I swear lol.
The closer you get to SF the cooler the area is... Berkeley is not that hot. For example, today it is around 76 F (around 2pm PST)....whereas Walnut Creek (not too far from Berkeley) is 102 F
Cause Berkeley students are stupid as fuck
It’s not UC Berkeley’s fault that our climate is warming. Plan a walk out on big polluters, not those trying to advance climate research.
They’re protesting… the air?
time to cancel climate change
Literally just didn’t go lol

It was this way last year, too. Even if it is only for a few days/weeks, the school should be prepared for this.
robloxkid74 here with the EPIC takes
For classes with recordings I've been doing this on ridiculously hot days. Of course, my apartment isn't much better... But it saves me buckets of sweat while walking to class.
October is typically the hottest month in the Bay. I guess they didn’t tell you that when you signed up.
Heatwaves like this week will only continue to become more common, so it would make sense to install AC in case of more heatwaves in the future.
can confirm
But it does care about large scale general strikes…
From what I gather the walkout was more geared toward the fact that the Fine Arts buildings have no A/C systems installed. As a result, the walkout was mostly sponsored by professors who hold classes in the area.   


Its less a statement against climate change (although those aspects do still apply) and more a statement against how the university has gone about with renovations and spending money.
Isn’t going to get hotter in October? So it’s going to last longer than a week.
Yeah, a lot of sensitives here and there. Overall tho it’s not too obnoxious
maybe if you're 300 lbs.
stfu lol
def nice outside,  currently in a library that is easily still 90 degrees, outside currently feels nice (obviously the sun has gone down now and the Bay breeze has kicked in)
what kind of brain rot thinking is this?  
damn those liberals avoiding power outages.
With the billions the regents are sitting on the entire campus should already be solar and solar thermal powered.
Fuck that. We have this many people on the planet now, we need to support them with air conditioning

According to average weather stats you’re worng. September is the hottest month. Also heatwaves like this our a once a year thing, so even if the monthly average is warm, we won’t have heat like this again this semester
I mean it’s consistently in the high 90s and 100s where I’m from, so it doesn’t really bother me. It’s just the humidity that bothers me.
I know they could have chosen ASU.
It actually doesn’t.
I really thought this was a temporary - if longer than usual - heat wave, and we'll be cooling off after at most 10 days. And this is what I've seen online as well. Any sources for this claim that we're gonna go through worse temperatures in the coming weeks?
the average high in october is lower than in september. and even if it wasn't, this is a record-breaking heat wave; it's not typical weather for the month.
yes idk what ppl r saying - September is the hottest month on average in berkeley
October will be hotter on average, but the average won't be hotter than this heatwave.
actually i have a chronic motor tic disorder triggered by fatigue, and heat saps all my energy. But thanks for your concern!
And you're going to be walking out this late when classes are basically all over? Lol.
Not quite. Its more like: ""damn those libs who push for power sources that arent reliable nor powerful enough to support the electric grid loads people want and need.""
Or even better yet, nuclear power plants!

But wait! Oh no......nuclear is bad for the environment, according to libs.
yes but sustainably. otherwise these same people will be complaining that their children are living in a dying world or whatever 

(tbh i have no sympathy for them bc they knew the state of the world when they decided to have kids BUT we still need sustainable energy sources)
October is definitely not the hottest month in the Bay Area  but if we want to be more precise it depends where you live.  Geography does impact the answer 

Hottest months per city 

July : San Jose, Santa Clara , Pleasanton 
August: Palo Alto , San Mateo , Hayward 
September: San Francisco, Berkeley, Sausalito
“according to stats” — wait til October. See how it goes. if you haven’t lived here 30+ years you wouldn’t know. A few years ago we were having heat waves in April. The climate here is capricious and tied to oscillations in the pacific.
I think it’s the marine layer that drives the humidity in Berkeley. It gives our mild winters a bone chill that you gotta prepare for with layers.
South Scottsdale reporting here, the days and nights have been beautiful this week. Hot but comparatively wonderful and nothing but cooling down in the forecast.

110° in Phoenix is way better than 90° in norcal.
Indeed. It’s not like the “best education on Earth” is something you shouldn’t have to, forgive the pun, sweat for..
Thanks for your input! I’d rather suggest helpful ways to achieve a healthy world than subscribe to nihilistic cynicism. 

A large scale general strike would have an incredible impact. Saying otherwise is incredibly foolish and dangerous.
I've lived in the Bay Area my whole life and this heat wave is certainly the longest i've experienced. 5 straight days of 100s around the Bay
that is still brain rot thinking, the power grid being under load won’t have to do with the energy source 🤯🤯🤯
I don’t think nuclear is a good idea for downtown Berkeley. But there’s fusion research up in the hills.
There used to be a reactor under Etcheverry, the building next to Soda

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Research_Reactor
Bring on the bone chill and the layers. I miss winter so much right now.
Good luck
Ive been here almost a decade and i felt like this first or second week of September heat just became normal in the last 5 years
Oh yes, it absolutely does. Some power sources have more kick than others. With solar, for example, youd need a ridiculous amount of panels and (more importantly) batteries. Whereas nuclear or geothermal requires relatively less land area and provides constant and potent power--no matter the grid's load.
We would they have to build it downtown?
Yeah it can come quick end of October (if we’re lucky)
restate question please?
You implied nuclear would be impractical if built downtown. But it doesnt have to be built downtown. It can be built/used a hundred miles away....just like any other power generation set up typically is
California is difficult for nuclear. Cooling and stability are major operational issues particularly in California. And long terms storage of waste has turned out to be far more expensive than promised. I’m not for any kind of reactor other than thorium which solves these issues but is still 10-15 yrs off. Meltdowns are still a major risk with current (antiquated) nuclear stack.
By the numbers, historically, nuclear has been the most ""green"" and environmentally friendly way of generating power (by far)....more than solar or wind or hydro. 

Waste management isnt an issue in modern  nuclear plants. But any attenpt to build these has been poopooed by so-called environmentalists.
I know that this case can be made from a few angles but it can be countered from just as many or more. The fact is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe is in the middle of a war zone . They said Fukushima had a 1 in 5 million chance of tsunami 🌊. Chernobyl could of made Europe completely unlivable had it not been for people willing to die to fix it.. Nuclear power is not safe in current form.
There are a lot more than 3-4 nuclear power plants, you just don't hear about the ones where there are no disasters. It doesn't make sense to totally dismiss a technology because there were issues with an earlier version.
Yep. I already mentioned that. Next gen nuclear has been available for quite a few years now. But nothing is getting built because of the few freak incidents in plants built many decades ago (old tech). New next gen reactors have inbuilt fail switches that automatically take care of waste should something malfunction.
Yes, I know. But you also can’t dismiss those who’ve lived through nuclear disasters, and dismiss their experience. Erase them with “it’s tho thafe” bcs it isn’t safe and for many many reasons. I’m ready for the next generation of better safer nuclear power and I know it’s possible. But I don’t believe in forcing new instance of old stacks on societies. The entire current stack is completely unacceptable. Pakistan has a brand new plant and already questioning how it will hold up to climate changes/sea level rise.. would of been great questions to answer 10 years ago no? They knew and the questions were asked, but they did it anyways. Because these problem sets are bigger than poor countries can handle. The Soviet Union would still be with us had Chernobyl not happened. Do you think Pakistan could handle a nuclear disaster??? They’re fucking underwater literally and figuratively and can’t even help their own people. This is a nuclear disaster waiting to happen. Not a matter of if; just when. Whose gonna give Pakistani 6000 heavy lift helicopters to throw at their meltdown? I’m ready for something better.
Gonna be real with you, I haven't heard anyone mock a position using a sardonic gay lisp in probably... 10 years? More? Can't really take you seriously when you sound like a fossilized tween from 2008.
yeah I was ready to give a legitimate reply pointing out how absurd their argument is but they're being too ridiculous to be taken seriously. As we all know, nuclear plants are the only energy-related disasters out there.
The accent is taken from South Park ass wipe. It mocks upper class apologies for major environmental disasters. You sound like a Nazi apologist or at least a self-righteous fink who can’t postulate an argument so pivots to faux outrage. Fuck off!"

Why don’t Berkeley students support their football team?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17qd228/why_dont_berkeley_students_support_their_football/,2023-11-07 19:45:37,"The Cal bears always have low attendance at football games. Sad. 

For a Division 1 team, the large swathes of empty seats is jarring. 

Berkeley students only show up for the Stanford Berkeley game. 

Other than that, you guys couldn’t be bothered. The school even gives away free tickets but people still don’t show up. 

Have you ever thought of how disheartening it must be for the players to look in the stands and see all of those empty seats? Embarrassing as well since the opposing team must be like “wow Berkeley students don’t give af about their team bruh”","I think it’s the lack of recent success/excitement tbh (for both football and basketball).

I was a freshman in ‘09/‘10, and the students showed up big time for both Cal football and basketball (and Cal football had a disappointing season, finishing unranked after being ranked in the top 5 after non-con play). 

Memorial and Haas were consistently packed and raucous.

I feel extremely bad for recent grads especially. Football being down AND our bball program being historically bad over two horrific coaching tenures.

At least now Cal bball has Mark Madsen at HC and the program looks like it has life again. 

I know it might be hard for recent grads/current students to believe — but before Wyking Jones/Mark Fox, Cal was a consistently a top 3-4 team in the conference (with very solid attendance).
If we are honest it’s just the modern day student body. Most people I met here do not really care about sports and if they do it’s very surface level nba or nfl. The student body in general truly could not care any less
Since when has the school given away free tickets? IIRC, they haven’t done that in years. 

And maybe, just maybe, the students would show up if the team performed better.

I’m a lifelong Cal Bears fan. There’s pictures of me rocking Cal gear as a 3 year old. But I would have a hard time justifying paying to go to games this season based on this current team’s performance. I might show up to the Big Game, but that’s it. 


Also - compared to some PAC12 rivals (RIP) like UCLA and Stanford, our attendance is actually quite decent.
It's because the team has sucked hard for the better part of a decade. When I attended back in the Marshawn Lynch years, the student section would be packed and overflow into the other sections. It was decent even during the Dykes/Goff years, but Wilcox teams have been both bad *and* boring. Not a good combination.
Old grad says:

TBH, being ranked 11/12 (just above AZ State) in the Pac 12 has a lot to do with student non-interest.  It's an objective reason to ***avoid*** the games.  

Fire Wilcox: 33/42 win/loss record.  Academically speaking, he's a flunky.
Football isn’t as big in California as it is in other states where football is way more popular.
If I had less homework then maybe I’d consider going…. (If any of my profs see this pls give less work LOL)
It’s sad to see your team take Ls. I ain’t wasting my time watching a game only to walk away more disappointed than I was coming into the game.
Cal Football has found new and improved ways to let me down. Going for 2 against USC when they could have gone to OT was the dumbest decision I’ve ever seen
[deleted]
When they start winning students will show up. Unfortunately it's a fact of life. Other than lived ones and die hards, people want to be associated with winning and success.
No offense but do you see how bad we play?
The Bay Area also has a lot more other teams than somewhere like State College, PA or Iowa City, IA. I suspect that this leads to fewer folks having Cal as their top sports fandom and the apathy trickles down from there.
I don’t like football. Only football.
Gotta study
You have a strange feeling of football’s entitlement to my time and attention.

I have very important things that I came here to accomplish, why do you feel football deserves hours of my precious time and energy?

Please OP, seriously, tell me why I am so remiss for studying and working on grad school applications instead of watching football?
I go. I try to convince others to come with me. I wish they would. It's been hard making friends.
I’ll go to a game once they
- fire that moron Justin Wilcox
- get a true X receiver for Mendoza
- improve the D-line

We not paying 30 bucks to watch a blowout 😂
Berkeley is a nerd school no one really cares about football (myself included)
1. This school is full of nerds who passively do not care about sports, and ""activists"" who are actively against sports because they'd rather pay GSIs a full-time salary or something. Every school has these people but the acadamic prowess of this university means we have more of them.

2. The teams have been pretty bad recently. The 5 years I was at Berkeley comprised the worst 5-year period for basketball in school history, and was the worst of any Power 5+Big East school over that time. Only for the year after I left (last year) to be even worse than the year I started, breaking the record we just set. Many people (students, alums, and local fans alike) aren't going to spend $$$ and time to watch shitty teams.

3. A mix of (1) and (2), but I feel like some of the recent hires haven't embraced the school as much as some others. Have read stories about how Sonny Dykes would have us run out the tunnel with a flag showing the California outline, that doesn't happen anymore. Jones and Fox couldn't have given less of a fuck about trying to get students to come to games, but now we have Madsen buying out Mezzo for an afternoon and pulling up to SAE to give a talk.
Why does a research university put anything at all into football?
Maybe its because Berkeley is majority Asian. Asians aren't really into sport. So they don't attend matches.
Dry stadium.
It's not just the current (and past) losing seasons. It's the almost inevitable FUTURE losing seasons. Football is a business. Cal Athletics thinks it is a sport to be balanced with gymnastics, water polo and golf.
We don’t have dope players that are must see.
It is really fun to go! The bears play hard. I think many don’t know the game (rules). I don’t really either but I try to follow it- I learn a little each time. It would be nice if they won more- so many games are so close. I’ve heard Cal has so many other sports that they support the money is spread thin.
With the exception of a few, I feel the same is true for most California colleges
I get those email notifications all the time. Just got one today saying they’re giving free tickets to the first like 4000 people or something. They give them away for football and women’s basketball as well.
*college football. Bay Area has HUGE pro fan bases in all major sports. In the south and midwest, college football is the main attraction.
Somebody help Rahul do all the homework
FWIW the football team makes significantly more revenue than it spends in costs
It’s an American tradition and Cal has a pretty storied team. Plus this school has one of the few D1 football teams in the state; you may as well watch a few games while you’re here.
Because you’re missing out on the full college experience. And you should have some pride in your school. Support the team.
Sorry, but college isn’t only about doing research. Fun should be a part of it, and going to football on game day can be really fun!
I’m Asian. I like sports but i’m not into college sports
They sell beer inside Memorial Stadium.
Berkeley gymnastics, water polo, golf, and not to forget rugby are nationally top ranked year after year, unlike the football program.  Football will continue to lose out in terms of backing until it starts winning, because without winning, it can't bring in big revenue.  Objectively its record says: bad investment.  That's why.
Attach a screenshot. 4000 is not a lot of tickets either way, considering the stadium seats ~60,000*
I don't think it's just college football. I think even NFL isn't as big here as elsewhere.
If you don't count the debt on the stadium ;-)
Nah - they say this all the time but there is no proof. They have expenditures and revenues but dont publish them.
Therefore they deserve attention over my other priorities, got it.
Next time you make a decision about what  my “full college experience” should be, it may help to have my input.
Also the brand advertisement, I would have no idea what the fuck ""Berkeley"" was if it wasn't for them being a 4 seed in 2016 (and losing to Hawaii).
You are not helping fam
Well sign me up for some sportball
Berkeley gymnastics, water polo and golf (rugby is a club sport) will never generate enough revenue to be break even no matter how many national championships they win. This is why they, together with every other sport except BB & FB are called, ""non-revenue"" sports. Football in contrast is profitable 7 out of 7 years even when the team has six non-bowl seasons out of seven. Schools like Oregon, Washington, UCLA and yes, even the brain dead admins at USC, have figured this out and that is why they invest money in football. Objectively: the ONLY good investment in college sports is football. This is also why they got B1G invites. Now Cal Athletics is faced with the following conundrum starting in 2024 - none of its sports, even football, will be profitable. So Cal Athletics in order to balance its budget looks set to charge students \~3k/yr in fees. Yes, that's right, a typical new admit to Berkeley will have an extra $12k in student debt by the time he/she graduates in order to maintain the money losing Cal Athletics dept. What possible justification do you have for that?
The stadium seats way more than 40K, but 4000 is still a fuckton of tickets (assuming it is true, which I doubt)
I lived it. All of us in elementary - high school would come in with NFL/NBA jerseys on. Going to a REGULAR SEASON game for the Giants, Niners, Warriors is sooo damn expensive due to demand. Niners/Raiders flags randomly on front porches.
Certainly it's a thing that can change year over year as debt service costs change and Cal football revenue change, but in the last reported fiscal year, including stadium debt costs, Cal football still made 10 million in profit.
No, they publish them. This is a public university, after all: https://calbears.com/documents/2023/1/25/FY22\_UCB\_Athletics\_SRE\_Online\_Copy\_.pdf
Yeah if I it want to tap into this network in the future and not just be a neck beard on Reddit you’d better stop being a smart ass and start doing some of these things
jaylen brown disappointing in the big moments once again
Helping what?
One small problem with your argument is neither football nor baseball would be generating any net revenue if the un-paid players and staff were paid as they should be for generating the revenue in the first place.  And we can drop the farce of calling professional athletes ""students"".

I do agree that charging real students for the purpose of employing professional athletes is wrong, and the best argument for either dropping high cost sports like football and baseball, or charging students who want to play football and baseball added fees to fully offset the high costs.  If their entertainment business is successful, and they make a profit, then their fees are refunded from the proceeds.

That's a lesson in how this business should be conducted.
You’re right, I was way off, it seats 60k.

I think your assessment is correct, the free ticket thing is definitely a falsehood.
I will be okay, but that sounds like a very vivid fear of yours. I’d be happy to introduce you to some people and give you a shaving lesson if that will help you feel more secure.
Exactly
One small problem with your argument is that football does generate net revenue despite competing for player and staff talent in the open market, a market where yes, they can get paid a market rate. And I am not referring to a hypothetical football team. I am referring to Cal Football - profitable for each of the last 7 years despite 3rd quartile (in the conference) performance. Football is profitable. Football even after assignment of costs associated with an equivalent number of women's scholarships (and related staff positions) is profitable. Even for Cal.

The reality is that for the type of HS football players Cal recruits, the open market wage is in the $40-60k per annum range - which is what those players receive in non-cash benefits. For a consensus 5 star HS recruit (non-QB), the open market wage is approaching $1 million cash (lump sum). Schools that invest in their football programs can pay those levels and still be profitable. Schools like Cal that do not invest in football can not. And that is why Cal Football is perennially a 3rd quartile team.

That is a lesson in how this business IS conducted.
They are in fact not paid.  Your statement is actually how exploitation is conducted, a few of the players get at most full ride scholarships, let's be plain spoken.  Yet they all are in fact acting as fully professional athletes, who do get cash in hand contracts worth far more than anything you have mentioned.  But enough playing with your scarecrow.  The facts are that there are objectively a lot better ways to spend full ride scholarship funds than on sports; students and majors that will have far greater and longer lasting benefit for the state and society in general.  Read the UC charter and see what the university was established to accomplish.
They are in fact paid. And it is not a few getting scholarships. Well over 50% receive full tuition, housing and food. And how is this exploitation? Both those who walk-on and those who receive paid rides have the ability to seek employment elsewhere, including with other collegiate football teams. Meanwhile the ""few"" to use your choice of words, actually get straight up cash.

\> there are objectively a lot better ways to spend full ride scholarship funds than on sports

Of this we are in full agreement. The difference is that you are on record as saying football is a bad investment relative to the implied ""good"" (or at least better) investment in gymnastic, water polo, golf. I fully state that all non-revenue sports are bad investments for UC Berkeley. If Cal Athletics can identify a sport that makes a profit and wants to engage in that sport because it feels that enhances and supports a diverse, multi-faceted student body, then I am OK with that. And Cal Athletics has identified such a sport. It is football. The problem is that rather than using football profits to fund non-revenue sports (already a bad idea because you need to reinvest in football to be competitive), Cal Athletics uses football profits PLUS an additional $30 million per year (soon to be $60 million/yr starting in 2024) to fund non-revenue sports. And it forces the student body to pay for those losses in higher fees. Those are the facts.
I do not have any problem with scholarships and/or tuition assistance if it is spread logically across all academic departments.  I do have a major issue forcing students (or taxpayers or donors such as myself) to support a disproportionate percentage of sports scholarships.  Support should scale by percent of graduates who find full time employment in their field of study within (say) one year of graduation.  That is a first order attempt to adjust the amount of support for a given department or major with market demand for its graduates.  That's how the business of a publicly funded university should be done.
Once they are graduates, you can not force them to support the university, much less sports scholarships. This is why UC Berkeley simply forces current students to pay higher fees, almost all of which go to underwrite the annual losses of Cal Athletics. The solution is simple - stop funding Cal Athletics' losses. Cal Athletics has enough profits from football to fund an equivalent number of women's scholarships plus MBB/WBB. Pretty much everything else must go though. If Cal Athletics had the foresight to invest in football decades ago, it might have been able to save a few other non-revenue sports, but it can't now. Yet no one is willing to force Cal Athletics to end its drunken spending spree. Everyone agrees it is unacceptable to force tens of thousands of dollars of additional student debt on new Cal admits. But no one is willing to cut the dozens of sports that cause that red ink. In fact this is why Carol Christ resigned. She was unwilling to kill off water polo, crew, gymnastics, etc. and yet also unwilling to take the heat from what will be in 2024 a $60 million deficit from Cal Athletics. Annually.
The two core sources of funds for UC are CA's general fund and tuition fees.  The first source is CA taxes, and that is forced support, trust me.  Tuition is a ""service"" fee, and if not paid, you do not get a diploma (=forced).  The full pie chart looks like this: [https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4684](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4684)  See Fig 1.  The spend per student is about $34k/yr, tuition is running about $18.2k (with health fee), so to first order tuition covers about half.  You're welcome.

If UC decides to discount tuition through scholarships, and lacking more funding from the legislature, that's giving some students discounts at the expense of others.  I think most burdened parents and students would not have a major problem with 5-10% of the student body getting discounts (scholarships) at their expense.  That assumes discounts would go only to qualified but low income students from CA (not out of state).  Obviously not all discounts need to be 100%, so maybe 20% could get some assistance.  The point being that the discount policy is based on socio-economic need within the state, not to benefit any particular program or major.

Personally, I would adjust the percentages by major also, to favor majors that were in high demand as evidenced by the in-state uptake rate of graduates.  The customer base of UC as a CA-funded/chartered educational institution is not just CA students, it's CA public (mainly through UC Med schools and hospitals) and CA industry as well.

Note that nothing I said allows for scholarships for athletes or athletics per-se.  If they happen to be a CSEE major (say), and need some help, then fine.  To be starkly contrasted with football or baseball schools giving full scholarships to basketweaving majors who never graduate just to have entertainment.

Let commercial sport franchises run farm/minor teams to get their future athletes.  Baseball still does this, and as far as I know they break even.  Baseball and football minor teams should get together and build dual purpose fields / markets.  I personally like going to a smaller field like we have here in San Jose for the Giants, but it sits vacant most of the time.
CA taxes go for many different purposes. And it is not forced. All CA taxpayers have the ability to leave the state if they feel that the state taxes paid are not worth the benefit of living in CA.

But the main point of this discussion remains - football is profitable and can pay for itself plus an equal number of women's scholarships and if put to a vote amongst Berkeley students (Do you want football to continue at no cost to yourself?), it would pass with well over 80%. Conversely, if put to a vote (Do you want to pay $12k in additional fees during your stay at UC Berkeley to allow Cal Athletics to keep the remaining non-revenue sports?), that would NOT pass.
Holy shit kid, you might as well argue that slaves could escape.  What are you smoking, mushrooms grown on rotting red herrings?

The first rule of business is knowing what you are good at and (as a direct result) what people want to buy from you.  People want to buy top notch brains from Berkeley, not top notch athletes, let alone tickets to the next game.

Football / baseball (not to forget basketball) are not in the UC charter, they have no business in our university except as an amateur sport: neither is an academic subject.  Hey, we make can more money running a casino, let's open one.  Revenue is waved around, but the game is net return for the school and the people of the state.  There is little net return after deducting for the costs (like a stadium and practice fields): USC claims it nets about $29 million, if you believe their accounting (which I do not believe include depreciation of land and facilities maintenance).  Just the seismic retrofit of Memstad cost $215m (for example).  Newly built:  I'd guess close to a billion.

UC's annual budget is $49 billion, of which Berkeley is $3 billion.  One federal research contract from from one federal agency (NASA) for one physics professor was worth $10m, even back in my day.

Bottom line: not our charter, not our business, no competitive edge, no sale.
Ah, the HS student that accepts a full football scholarship at a P5 school has the same agency as a slave. What are YOU smoking?

Your argument that Berkeley is not good at administering athletics is true for 90% of the business units it runs. Which directly supports what I have repeatedly stated- it needs to get rid of them. Berkeley does run profitably its football program despite it's administrative incompetence, which demonstrates just how easy it is to make money as a P5 football school. However that profitability does tend to cause college sports administrators to believe, despite evidence to the contrary, that they are superlative business leaders and that they should expand their empire into numerous non-revenue sports. Which is why most universities lose money overall in sports. Like UC Berkeley. Berkeley just loses more than usual.

Ultimately this is why the final glory/fault/blame/etc. rests with the university president. Generally chosen because they are deft at navigating departmental politics, these people (Carol Christ being a prime example) are generally horrible at actually running a business. She just had no concept that a side show like Cal Athletics could destroy student's budgets. And she had no solution - unwilling to make the hard decision to cut sports programs, she just kicked the can down the road. Well the road ends in 2024 and so she resigns.
Exactly, now you get the message: he (emphasis on the sex disparity) gets three hots and a cot, maybe a diploma, hopefully one that's worth something, and you make him work preparing for and participating in football events for nothing.  Other scholarship winners only need to go to school and do well.  If they choose to, they can help the university in its chartered business, like any other student, by teaching or doing research for pay on top of their scholarship, but it's not required.

Berkeley football is not profitable in the least.  If they had been netting $20 million a year (which they never have) 2030 might be the year they paid off the cost of the football stadium seismic retrofit, with interest on the loan.  What a total waste of UC money that was...how much affordable student housing would that money have built?

The chartered businesses UC runs very well are all sorts of government and industrial sponsored research and of course hospitals.  Those businesses pay the bills, not your goofy sports.  UC needs to get smart like CalTech and cut out competitive athletics.  Focus on what they are good at, what they make good money doing, what their customers pay them to do: top notch research, education and medicine.
Lulz, you believe that because payment is in non-cash form that it is forced? Why don't you ask a HS football player who has committed to Cal for the next season whether when he was choosing between his five offers, he felt he was forced into slavery? Odd that so many when faced with slavery (by your terms), willingly choose that path. But ah, you know better what is good for them, don't you?

UC Berkeley chose to capitalize its expenditures on Memorial Stadium. That is a balance sheet item, not an income statement item. So yes, football has been profitable. Now you can argue that other capital expenditures would have been more worthwhile. But it is nevertheless true that football generated more than enough revenues to finance the retrofit of Memorial. It's just that the wise administrators of Cal Athletics took that money and instead of paying down debt for the retrofit, used the money to fund non-revenue sports. So logically any capital expenditures that you view as more worthwhile (such as housing), could have been done anyway - in ADDITION to the Memorial retrofit as long as the money hadn't been wasted on non-revenue sports.

And so now you say Berkeley should cut out all competitive athletics. You started by touting gymnastic, water polo and golf. What was that all about? You say that Cal should focus on what they are good at - the implication is that Cal is bad at athletics. The reality is Cal is good at athletics (tons of national championships), but it is really bad at paying for them. Flat out, it can't afford them going forward. Overall, the concept of using economic viability to determine what leisure activities Cal should engage in seems anathema to you. Probably because you just don't like football. Well, too bad. Football remains. Will remain. At some point in the future, they may or may not kill off all those non-revenue sports. But football will remain.
Oh, now you sling ""But we taught our slaves a trade!"" as your excuse?  You just don't know when to shaddup.  Lol!

As far as business accounting is concerned, you've got one hell of a lot to learn, but then so does UC Admin.  Cal Athletics never saw the bill (as overhead) even though the stadium is used for nothing but college football (which is not in the charter) for the benefit of maybe five student athletes (for which there is no major or diploma) per year who become professional athletes (only if you count the minors).  They might have amortized and paid the bill for Wilcox, $28.5 million...but I am skeptical of that as well.

So yes Dorthy, you can easily cook the books to fool greater fools into believing you can make money in football, but I am not one.  You can steal it, but you can't make it.  Not at Cal, that's for damn sure.

The tout about water polo, gymnastics and rugby is they do extremely well without any revenue events and coaches that are perfectly happy with normal academic wages.  They do not exploit their athletes.  The fact you must be totally shamed by those facts fully explains why you want to destroy them.

Lastly, I played college football, as a walk-on starter, on a winning team while in JC.  No scholarship, no revenue, not a slave.  What I got out of it was fun, good exercise, a lot of cuts and bruises and a torn ACL.  That's what amateur athletic sports are for, which is exactly what you do not have in Cal football.  What you have is malpractice and greed.
Where did I say anything about teaching a trade? You are just making up sh\*t. Free will does having something to do with this situation. You label as slaves those who use their free will to do something that you think they should not. Despite your having done the exact same thing. Your denigration of their decision making betrays your desire to have dictatorial control over others. 

As far as business accounting is concerned your knowledge is nil. The rest of your paragraph is littered with incorrect statements. (1) Cal Athletics saw the bill, paid a few years of financing on it and then was losing so much money, Carol Christ made the decision to transfer the asset and the loan to the UC Berkeley general account. This was inline with her unwillingness to force Cal Athletics to live with the consequences of its decisions. (2) the stadium was used for non-football activities, primarily graduations and other large assembly events. Here's the thing bud, your anger at Cal Athletics is something I share, but you are too ignorant to know the correct story, you make up facts which are untrue and flop back and forth when confronted on it.

For example: I want to destroy water polo, gymnastics and rugby? As I mentioned before rugby is a club sport which has different characteristics. However regarding the other two - you are on record as saying they should all be canceled. I in contrast merely place a high (probably unattainable) economic bar for their continued existence. So you are accusing me of something for which you are even more retrograde. LOL. This is your pretzel logic.
You don't even realize what you are saying kiddo.  Try this factoid: did you know that most freed slaves ""willingly"" returned to their former owners and plantations after the Civil War?  Why?  Because their former owners simply refused to pay them, and the Feds never came through with enforcement  That's exactly how much free will is in college football.

College football players should be paid at least the minimum they are paid in the XFL, about $50k/year. That's regardless of whether they have an academic (not sports) scholarship or not.  After fed and state tax deductions it's a bit more than a full ride scholarship.  They would be paid by Cal Athletics LLC (say), which would also pay the debt and other expenses for the stadium and the salaries of all their staff and head coaches contract. They could charge whatever the market would bear for tickets to the game, and fees for televising it, and a cut on logo-wear, all that shit.  One caveat: Cal Athletics LLC would get zero UC scholarship money, because it's not an academic department.  If they chose to grant scholarships to be competitive, they would come out of their LLC revenues, and that does not reduce the minimum salary requirement.

I think we both know the business would never get off the ground, because as we both know, it's far from a money maker, it's a bottomless money pit.  Without your ""rob Peter to pay Paul"" scheme and accounting tricks like having the university carry the cost of the stadium, there is simply no profit until (maybe transiently) the team were to become a top ten national football school.

Most professional FB teams can't make a profit without welfare.  No team going forward will build their own stadium, certainly not when money is no longer free.  The five present teams that do (own) will be out of business when their stadiums are damaged or worn out.  That is unless the they corrupt a city council like the 49r's did in Santa Clara...or the city lives on entertainment / convention revenue like Las Vegas, and can get rental revenue outside of FB.
You realize what you are saying and realize it is so ridiculous to call college football players slaves that you attempt to use examples of actual slaves to try and save your sorry #ss. Ask any Cal football players whether they have contemplated quitting. Many have and some do. Now ask them whether they felt they did not have the power to make that decision. They will look at you like you had a third eye growing out of your forehead. The fact that college football players feel they are underpaid does not make them a slave. Anymore than a person working at Walmart is a slave. Underpaid? Certainly according to the worker? Exploited? Possibly. But that's still not slavery. And your feeble attempts to label football players as such just makes you look like an idiot.

And since we're on that subject, another illustration of how little you know about collegiate sports administration - Cal Athletics already gets zero UC scholarship money. All scholarships granted (and their addition payments in kind for housing and food) are listed expenses in their annual income statement. Which is as it should be. Cal Athletics loses a f\*ck ton of money. They are incompetent. We agree on this. You just don't have any of the other facts correct. But at least your emotionally driven conclusions have pointed you in the correct direction.
My comments are based on decades of running small and mega-corps at the D- and C-level.  You clearly have facts I and the general public don't, meaning you're at least a passionate fan if not an insider.  Emphasis on passionate.

In 50 years, I've seen/heard all the games, all the hype going in and all the excuses for shit coming out.  Hell, I've used most of them in my younger days; I was a confident passionate optimist.  I can smell bullshit sprayed with cologne and painted Gold, I sprayed a lot of both in my day.  Eventually I learned it was better for everyone involved to be an objective hard ass: just pick the obvious winners and cut the obvious losses, by the (real = activity based accounting) numbers.

Your proposition that your ideas can turn Cal  into a nationally competitive, and therefore profitable sport machine, is nothing but passionate insanity.  It's objectively not possible academically, politically, financially, and as if all of that was not enough, the campus itself is virtually inaccessible.  Not within your lifetime anyway.

Smart thing to do is stick to what we both know sells (R&D, health care), and cut losses (expensive revenue-attempting sports like FB, BkB, BaB) with a sharp knife.  Even the macro-environment is blowing against you: the demise of the Pac-X is a huge hint dude...take it.  Wake up, smell the coffee.

Not only no sale, but pack your shit and pick up your final check.
I have facts that you and the general public do not? No, I just looked at Cal Athletics's publically available financials. Something you should be more than capable of doing with your claimed experience. And claimed here is the key phrase. Because your supposed business sense is garbage. Take your childish proposal that college football players get paid $50k in cash rather than in kind tuition, housing and food. All that does is expose the athlete to FICA, federal and state income taxes which in CA would bring his(her) net down to about $40k. Which is the value they get in kind. So all your supposed business mind has done is introduce a 20% inefficiency to the collegiate athletics department for wages paid, with no benefit whatsoever to the student athlete.

Your reading skills are also lacking. You just make up sh\*t and claim I said it. Reread my very first post - I do not claim Cal football can become nationally competitive, in fact I said it is virtually inevitable that it will be a losing team in the future. You engage in this misdirection because your argumentative position is untenable. You claim 19yr olds getting a free college ride are slaves, you tout the success of non-revenue sports as worthy of imposing huge financial burdens on others, and then your pathetic little business plan for Cal Athletics is just what Cal Athletics does today with additional inefficiency.

There is no final check for you. Just an embarrassing legacy of poorly written, intellectually bereft posts.
Facts and data, transparency overall are sadly lacking, for all of UC's activities.  The one good thing is Cal Athletics is required to support non-revenue sports. The bad thing, the main issue is the stadium and the cost of their head coach.  In spite of your waddaboutapouta, both are only in the ""business"" of football, and the stadium is a dead Albatross because it's inaccessible, old and uncovered.  Transferring the service of the debt (which is over $400 m) to UC to cook the books for Cal Athletics still leaves Cal Athletics a losing load on UC.  And your juvenile stupid greedy slaver solution is to slave the football athletes and on top of that double down and deny non-football athletes their rights to pursue their sports?  The obvious solution is to cut out the whole farce and fund football like all other sports: fire the over-stuffed coach and his staff.  The stadium should be nicknamed ""The Money Pit"", and the whole sad story should be a lesson for HAAS grads.  That's not going to happen, we both know that, so why do you go there except, as stated, waddaboutapouta. Tell Mommy and Daddy your tuition and fees are going up.  The one bit of good news is some people are learning and fewer cities are picking up the bills for sports stadiums.  The bad news is corruption and bad accounting remains.
\> Tell Mommy and Daddy your tuition and fees are going up

For the about half of Cal entrants, the increased fees will translate directly to about $12k in extra student loan debt they'll be carrying when they graduate. Your concern, or rather lack thereof, for this mass of people without unlimited funding is noted, as if it were not already obvious by your being completely out of touch with reality by calling college athletes slaves.

\> That's not going to happen, we both know that, so why do you go there except, as stated, waddaboutapouta

You are b\*tching about me pointing at the obvious but not selected solution?! You just 'effing did the exact same thing in the very sentence before the one I quoted. You don't even have the ability to rant cut/paste coherently. Lulz.

Your lack of business acumen has led you to fail to recognize one inevitable trend. And that is - on Cal Athletics' present course it's losses will continue to grow. While a $3k subsidy per year per student via higher fees is inexcusable, Berkeley admins will not alter it. But what happens when that loss grows to $5k per year per student? Very rapidly, within the next 5 years, student fees to cover Cal Athletics losses will approach 1/3rd of tuition. It can not continue indefinitely, and when the pot finally boils the axe will fall on non-revenue sports. No amount of incoherent ranting from you, and no amount of ""you could have saved some non-revenue sports if you had managed the business correctly"" from me will change this. It is inevitable. Your tears can be collected at the exit.
Only 1 in 6 Cal students take out student loans, and out of those the average loan is $5900/yr.  Aside: that's about half the percentage of CSU students, which is the place to go if you can't afford UC tuition. SJSU is rated the #1 STEM college in the nation for value.  But I digress... The point you miss regarding for-revenue sports is that unlike any other for-revenue activity the university engages in, you expect the players, and only the players, to donate their services to a for-profit (in theory) business.  And on top of that you want all the real amateur athletes who only want to do their thing, to go fuck themselves.  What you fail to realize is the federal courts will order college pro athletes to be paid.  It is inevitable, especially in our conservative SCOTUS.  Either that or revert to being real amateur athletes.

There is an actual upside if they go pro: 100% of the FB, BaB, and BkB players get a job that covers all their college expenses (even after taxes).  That's full rides for 100% of for-revenue sports players.  That fact then presumably frees-up a few academic scholarships spots for academics.

NNN, the first big problem is the stadium, like it is for all professional teams.  On non-game days, and off-season, it needs to be rented out for big events, just like a city stadium.  The second big problem is the three head coaches (and their staffs) contracts.  There is no way they are worth more than tenured professors.   Without fixes for both those problems, someone is getting used and abused.  The doom for the future is Memstad.  It is inaccessible and un-covered and therefore not wanted (commercially).
Do you ever tire of just making up sh\*t and calling them facts?

[opa.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UndergraduateProfile.pdf](https://opa.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UndergraduateProfile.pdf)

Again, publically available information. 40% of UC Berkeley students carry student loan balances. And that is with the current cost structure. Increase the cost structure by adding $3k of student fees and that number will increase. 

\>federal courts will order college pro athletes to be paid

No. Federal courts will allow college athletes to be paid. Indeed they already have. There are no, zero, court cases forcing colleges to convert from pay in kind compensation to cash compensation. As I already pointed out - your plan to do that just adds inefficiency (losses) to collegiate sport programs because of taxation.

\>That's full rides for 100% of for-revenue sports players. That fact then presumably frees-up a few academic scholarships spots for academics.

This is your business sense again? This actually increases the costs for collegiate sports. Increased due to the inefficiency of cash wages and increased due to the elimination of walk-ons. If overall university costs are held stable, that means LESS academic scholarships. UC Berkeley administration has been horrible in managing Cal Athletics. It's a tough hurdle, but your suggestions are even worse. Just shockingly bad.
You should have listened to the hour-long discussion on KQED FM HD1 this morning.  Earnings for college athletes in for-revenue sports are here, criminal ""charities"" are paying them now.  Ah, the lovely wholesome sweaty jockstrap-scent of athletes, fan-nuts, the sports betting mob and broadcasting.  What could go wrong?

Anyway, listen and be totally frustrated because it's clear the only solution is for the school to give athletes real wages if they generate revenue for the school.  Not just a bullshit $6k per year per over the table per the NCAA who tries on the one hand to say they are amateur, but allows them to be paid under the table as a ""charity"" donation.  That's a total violation of  the FLSA and Title IX, to say nothing of opening college sports up to criminals...pure ""mob-style"".

Anyway, get a beer, do a joint, relax, and calm yourself before you listen to how stupid (per you) the guest David Fahrenthold (NY. Times reporter) is:  [https://www.kqed.org/forum/2010101895036/how-collectives-are-changing-college-sports](https://www.kqed.org/forum/2010101895036/how-collectives-are-changing-college-sports)

Donor collectives are not new. Did you know that Cal Athletics has one? But donor collectives are not designed to extend cash payments to all athletes. They are designed to allow large signing bonuses for key highly sought after HS prospects. Now for a university like Alabama, 50% of their recruiting class might fall into that category. But for someone like Cal, they would be targeting maybe a single 4 star prospect per year and no 5 stars. So that's (if successful) a single recruit out of the 20-25 per year brought in for football. The vast majority of football players on scholarship in the NCAA will remain paid in kind.
What could go wrong with mystery people buying student athletes?  David Fahrenthold of the NYT investigates charities, in this in his own words, so-called charities.  And you and the NCAA support this scummy bullshit.
Again, you are just making sh\*t up. Personally I was against allowing NIL payouts. And so was the NCAA. They lost in court. And yet you call these NIL payment mechanisms scummy bullshit and at the same time demand that college athletes get paid. The NIL payouts are the full unadultered manifestation of your demands. It was natural that once players could get paid, that pay would be differentiated between players. Your complete lack of business sense prevented you from realizing that given the relative distribution of (perceived) skill levels of recruits, the cash payouts would be distributed with 100% of the payouts to about 8% of the FBS scholarship athletes in football.

You don't know how accounting works, you don't know how NIL works, you advocate for increased fees on people who already have to use student loans to go to Berkeley, and then to cover your incompetence you just make up sh\*t and rant with your made up crap. You would make for the perfectly consistent Cal Athletics AD.
What you refuse to see is the root problem is making amateur athletes into abused slaves of for-profit enterprises.  You think you can patch the leak in the Titanic.

The root issue is college and professional sports have no business doing business together, simple as that.  All the court attempted to redress is rampant player exploitation, but without having the balls to address the root problem, all they (and you) do is make the problem far far worse.  The problem is by then, the Camels whole ass was already in the tent.

It's time to bring the big knife down, at least within UC, and cut out for-revenue sports.  If a CSEE major wants to play football, he can.  If a ChemE major wants to do floor exercises, she can.  There are facilities, and coaches can be hired that will be happy being paid like professors.  What there will not be are broadcast deals, nor any priority for scholarships based on athletics.  All proceeds from any ticket sales go to help partially offset the cost of the facilities and staff, period.  No profits allowed from athletic activities.

If some guy who played football really well in HS, wants to play and be paid, let them do a tryout for the XFL.  I am certain the NFL will have zero problem forming a farm system literally overnight.  The best will go to the NFL, the rest to the XFL.  NBA has G-league.  Baseball is the model of farm teams, going all the way down to Little League.

Or...the HS athlete can go to JC or college, and if they got top grades, do so on an academic scholarship.  Either way, they play sports on the side, as amateurs, purely students, male or female.

We simply don't want the corruption and misogyny of NCAA sanctioned pro-college sports around UC.  Add for-profit college sports betting.  Stinks like a sweaty soiled jock strap.  Kill and eat the Camel.  

That's it kiddo, my tutorial on problem solving is over.  Remember the root."
Don’t let them run this into the ground. We NEED housing so bad,https://i.redd.it/5y1oul9yeo191.jpg,2022-05-25 12:48:07,,"How tf will housing be affordable if u don’t build enough housing?
Those renderings are disgusting lies - take a close look and you will see that instead of showing the three dimensional cityscape surrounding the sites, its flat.  This distorts the height of the rendered buildings, making them seem much larger.

You can't ask for a better location to build dense housing than directly on top of a BART station.
12 stories isn't even that tall in reality. When I hear ""high rise"" I think of the 40+ -story buildings of NYC. Classic NIMBY wordplay.
What’s wrong with big High rises? Doesn’t the same problem exist if you build 7 stories and give the land away to for profit developers as well? Also the climate change thing is just BS, a few high rises is nothing comparing to the coal and oil burned in the US.
Fucking NIMBYS. They wait for the students to leave for the summer and then block housing.
This is one reason I hate the Bay (born and raised here). Every time they vote they want to see more affordable housing, then whenever more affordable housing gets brought up it's a game of ""well yes, we want affordable housing to be built, but not near us.""
Isn’t this the same organization that tried to cut Berk admissions in half and refuse new development???
Ah yes, the classic [fake-progressive NIMBY.](https://i.imgur.com/ULACYBI.jpg) Berkeley seems to have an extremely high concentration of these.

If you dig through all the disingenuous virtue-signaling about affordable housing and [completely backwards assertions](https://ottawacitizen.com/life/homes/modern-housing-why-highrises-are-good-for-the-environment) about the environment/sustainability, you can start to see the *real* reasons poking through — ""intense construction noise"", ""increasing cars circulating through residential neighborhoods"", ""shadows extending over homes"", etc. 

They think we're stupid enough to fall for this sort of fake-progressive rhetoric. But after seeing dozens of these ""campaigns"" waged by wealthy entrenched homeowners (for whom the ""housing crisis"" doesn't exist), we can start to understand the patterns and the games they're playing.

EDIT: The Atlantic just put out this fascinating piece about the darkness at the core of NIMBYism: [The People Who Hate People](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/population-growth-housing-climate-change/629952/)
Postings like these are why most of California has become a widespread suburban nightmare and why homelessness is such a big problem.
People only care about keeping real estate prices high.
I saw a NY Times report on this:

There's a reason why Berkeley looks like a decrepit, overcrowded wasteland that looks like it is stuck in 1930 - and it's because of these liberal psuedo-progressive NIMBYs who insist on keeping their untenable bohemian dream ""wonderland"" just like it is.  Berkeley needs to be modernized and housing needs to be built.  These people don't like an idea, shut it down, and offer no tangible plans in substitution.  It's why shit here is so old, crusty, and way overpriced.
Let’s go attend this meeting! If you don’t speak up, you don’t exist. Typical very very % of minority votes can block something good for majority. The law needs to change.
The only thing reasonable here is car use.  If you're at a Bart station, in Berkeley, there is no reason to build 1 parking space per unit (if that is what's proposed).  Instead, have a small garage with a fleet of share cars.
Mfs be complaining about shadows ☠️
More NIMBY bullshit. They are masters of letting perfect be the enemy of great to suit their own goals.
Haha, the shadows are a ridiculous ploy. NIMBYS gtfo
Towers bring more neighbors but almost certainly not enough to lower the price of housing so their fake reason and their real reason for blocking new construction are both bullshit.

'We have a surplus of market rate apartments'. 

Not only is the surplus part wrong, but unless you define Market rate as whatever they're currently charging(so always Market rate), it's waay to expensive
Those renders are the most hilariously over the top thing I've seen in a while.

This shit right here is why California is so expensive to live in
There is lack of land left so high density should be norm going forward.Unless, you don't want any growth at all for population. Density housing is very normal in Asia as population is much higher. If no density housing allowed then housing costs will continue going up. No one should complain about high costs for housing if density housing is not the new norm.
I can’t tell if you’re for or against it.
I didn’t know the school is building Mega City I these tenders are hilariously large lol
“We need affordable housing”

Yes a tall building will make affordable housing possible for less land.
This is about as NIMBY as you can get right? Seems so intentionally annoying I'm guessing it's fake.
Almost everyone here seems really eager to tear apart NIMBYs but also doesn’t seem to question the fact that a private company using tax payer money would almost certainly not have affordable housing at the forefront of their minds. I don’t get the disconnect. 

“Mikiten and others noted developers can exceed local zoning caps by up to 50% if they include enough affordable apartments in their buildings under California’s ‘density bonus’ law. So, for example, if the city zones the stations for 12-story buildings, a developer who agrees to set aside at least 24% of their project’s units for renters who are considered low-income would be allowed to build a structure that stands up to 18 stories — as tall as the new hotel that opened in downtown Berkeley earlier this year.” (https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/04/07/from-7-stories-to-12-commission-backs-taller-height-limit-for-bart-housing) 

So pretty clearly they are adding on stories to maximize profit. A piddling 24% of the units would be for low-income renters, and I betcha they won’t be too keen on renting to 5 students trying to live in a 2 bedroom apartment. 

Slow down with the NIMBY stuff and think, man.
So blocking out the sun downtown is YIMBY?
Presume the fix is in with these developers.  I remember seeing this in an unrelated meeting long ago where they come asking for public input, but the main thing is guiding us all towards their plan.  Nobody in the room bought it, but whatever. Money is power, how it goes.
I'm not sure these high-rises will be affordable housing. I heard developers can build whatever they want, so these will likely be expensive apartments.
What type of housing above 2 stories can be built with only wood? That doesn’t seem like a feasible change at all, aren’t we next to the San Andreas fault 😂
Where in the fuck are all of those cars going to go? 

When will those surrounding houses see the sun again once those monstrosities are built? 

People who commute to that station, WILL NOT return once those parking spaces are gone. 

Urban planning in Berkeley is a joke.
hope you tore the flyer down :)
The libs are so down bad. They complain about anything and everything, and they even hate themselves. 😹😹🔥🔥🔥
Well I did learn about the pluralist theory of government in AP US GoPo so now I can see it in action...
They already own homes, they don't want prices going down, that'd be bad for their home equity.
> How tf will housing be affordable if u don’t build enough housing?

I mean, maybe Cal could build the bare fucking minimum of student housing instead of increasing the student population by 10k+ and not building a single net new unit of housing.
Tax investment properties into the ground
also the new construction is the only thing that casts a shadow
> Those renderings are disgusting lies - take a close look and you will see that instead of showing the three dimensional cityscape surrounding the sites, its flat. 

Because it's from Google Maps. There isn't another option.

>This distorts the height of the rendered buildings, making them seem much larger.

The surrounding houses are 1 story tall. They're basically flat in comparison.
Exactly, most of the dorms are 8 stories anyways and 12 truly is not that much higher
I mean, look at the shadows lmao
It's 18 stories with the density bonus.
18 however would stick out like a sore thumb.
More like **NIMBA - not in my business area**.  Oppositon is coming from apartment owners and room renters.  Home/house owners could give a crap as long as it is not dropped in the middle of their neighbood...which would be stupid for a bunch of perfectly valid urban planning reasons.
> Doesn’t the same problem exist if you build 7 stories and give the land away to for profit developers as well?

Absolutely. This is a classic NIMBY tactic to virtue-signal that they're ""totally pro-housing"", when in reality they want absolutely nothing developed anywhere in ""their"" neighborhood. If the zoning were revised to 7 stories, they'd just come back with opposition to any building proposed there for a different laundry list of reasons.

> Also the climate change thing is just BS, a few high rises is nothing comparing to the coal and oil burned in the US.

Correct. I remember another thread dug into the source that they cite for this claim, and it turned out to contain almost nothing to support what they're saying. Again more fake-progressive NIMBY virtue signaling because ""I don't want shadows on my house or more cars on my street"" doesn't pass public scrutiny anymore (although these ""real"" reasons are briefly hinted at in the flyer). High-density housing right at a commuter rail station is THE MOST SUSTAINABLE TYPE OF HOUSING POSSIBLE.
Yeah building high rises is so much better for the environment than single family homes and the general suburban sprawl.
Actually density reduces claimant change because it uses much less land and resources, especially by reducing daily driving and super commuters!
That building isn't even close to high rise. Must be written by men with 2-in dicks and lots of cash thinking that they're average.
Yeah lol like how does this project ""Increase Housing Inequality""? Reminds me of people accusing the Civil Rights Movement of being racist. 

It not like Berkeley would have any legacy of activism from the 60s' that should motivate them to fight inequality? Oh well....
Or, you know, they just want buildings that are more in scale with the neighborhood.

If anybody in city government were actually serious about the housing crisis they'd just upzone the whole city to 6 stories instead of fixating on just 2-3 sites for development.
Lol our very own Robert Reich is the embodiment of one

He even wrote and signed a letter to stop affordable housing units being built in his *historic* neighborhood.
Wow, great Atlantic article - thanks for sharing!
Thanks for sharing, very informative. I've been reading NINBY posts on Next Door and trying to keep an open mind and hear their arguments in good faith, but this explains why their faux arguments have never sat well with me.
Yes yes yes yes

This should be taught in schools
No, I saw one in the wild near NB BART before I saw it here
""a piddling 24%"" lmao fuck off NIMBY
Nice try, NIMBY.
> piddling 24% of the units would be for low-income renters

Do you even listen to yourself?  
Thats 100s of low income units.   
We'd need what half a dozen of these buildings before we could house all of the homeless in the city?  


(also market rate housing is good)
Bingo. At least there’s one real comment here.
Ashby and North Berkeley BARTs aren't ""downtown"" anywhere.
""Nobody in the room of rich white retirees who knew to attend a meeting at 2pm on a weekend thought it was a good idea but they decided to ignore us!""
Who is the developer?
If they don't include affordable units, they can't build that tall.  The proposed limit is 12 stories, and by including affordable limits to take advantage of the density bonus law they can build taller, up to 18 stories with the maximum bonus.
Even that, when enough units are built, supply will bring price down gradually.
Expecting that most people who use a subway are going to drive to a station is the real joke. That's not how subways work, bro. You're supposed to build densley next to them so people can just walk there.
Apartments do not compete with houses, they are completely different markets. The people threatened by new apartments are existing apartment owners.
Cal would be really happy to tear down Clark Kerr and build a giant dorm on it but the NIMBYs in Berkeley city would go ape over it.
All property is investment property if the owner purchased them with the expectation that they would go up in value (which they all did).
And the angle of the sun is also exagerated (low) to produce a longer shadow. Funny trickery
As a level 5 vegan, I oppose anything that casts a shadow.
50% taller is ""not that much higher""?
It will be 18 stories, I’m sure. Posted this in another comment:

“Mikiten and others noted developers can exceed local zoning caps by up to 50% if they include enough affordable apartments in their buildings under California’s ‘density bonus’ law. So, for example, if the city zones the stations for 12-story buildings, a developer who agrees to set aside at least 24% of their project’s units for renters who are considered low-income would be allowed to build a structure that stands up to 18 stories — as tall as the new hotel that opened in downtown Berkeley earlier this year.” (https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/04/07/from-7-stories-to-12-commission-backs-taller-height-limit-for-bart-housing)
So? Who cares?
The opposition is almost always coming from wealthy homeowners who are afraid that any increase in density will reduce the cost of their home. 

Ever wonder why the Clark Kerr housing hasn't been leveled and built into a real modern dorm complex? It's because they're next to the heart of NIMBY Berkeley full of retirees with nothing but time, money, and a $4M house valuation to ferociously defend.

Not to mention it’s right by a Bart station so these residents are way more likely to use public transportation
Man that was such a bummer to find out. I loved Reich's labor and economic policy videos and it seemed like he had a great head on his shoulders, especially when it comes to economic inequality. Just goes to show that even the most outspoken 'progressives' can transform into complete reactionaries when the status quo of ""their"" neighborhood is threatened.
He's a living, walking ""In this house we believe"" sign
I think I’d have to own property to make me a NIMBY, by everyone’s definition ITT. Even as a renter, I’d be pissed if an eighteen-story monolith went up next to my two-story mid century apt. building. There goes any sort of view of the sky or morning/afternoon sun. Aesthetics go entirely out the window when this shit gets discussed and I never understand it. That kind of thing does impact quality of life, remarkably so. It’s like it’s verboten to say you don’t want to live in a place that looks like ass.

I do recommend taking a look at the Berkeleyside op ed from today that includes an architectural drawing of a different proposal for the site that is about one million times less ugly than these towers. It actually blends into its surroundings and includes several higher density buildings. We don’t have to sacrifice looks in affordable housing. And the bottom line is that if a private company is handling this, they’re gonna fuck us either way—not build as many affordable units as needed, make the application process difficult for anyone who doesn’t have a six-figure, single income—so we might as well get housing that doesn’t look like a fucking space shuttle.

Edit to add: You think 24% is a lot? Not even a third? Bar is too low when tax-payer dollars are being used.

Another edit to add: Where’s the Ashby flea market gonna go now? That sucks. Big part of the community.
See my comment in this chain.
I get the vibe that most comments are from students who will only live in Berkeley 4-5 years and move out of Berkeley after they graduate. So their own interest is for their short stay in Berkeley while others seem to be residents for the long haul. Of course everyone has their own interest in mind, but realistically a minority of graduates remain in Berkeley after school. They won’t need to deal with the development in the long term or worry about how it could change the city. For them it’s as long as their needs are met for a few years, it doesn’t matter what happens long term. 

That’s my observation, I’m indifferent on the whole thing.
Soon to be. You haven't seen the Adeline Development plan yet. From
downtown to Alcatraz.
> supply will bring price down gradually.

Have you seen Bay Area rents? Even with more market rate housing, rent is still super-high.
My landlord collecting >1k/mo for each room that he converted from a house to a rental. So glad I'll be graduating early and flee from this rent hell soon.
That's not true, there is a strong correlation between housing prices and apartment prices in Berkeley over the last 20 years, many people own houses and rent them to students. There is absolutely direct evidence of rental prices influencing sale prices of houses *used as apartments*. Of course, these purchase-for-rental-use houses drive up purchase-for-occupation housing prices. 

Owner-occupants are not the norm in all neighborhoods in Berkeley, especially those close to campus.
Bullshit, hermano. Cal can legally do just about whatever the fuck it wants in terms of development. That's part of the UC system charter. The only reason NIMBYs are able to shut down their projects is that they keep tying enrollment increases to any new development which puts them in a position where they run afoul of CEQA. If they just proposed new development as standalone projects townies couldn't do shit about it.
I bought my house to have a place to live. I don't really give a fuck if it goes up in value or not because I can't afford to sell.
Not to mention they've made the new construction look as colorless and monolithic as possible to further the contrast between them and the surrounding homes.
4 stories isn't that much, why did you say ""50% taller"" to try to make it seem like a bigger difference?

I could just say ""30% shorter is a lot?""
1+1=2
50+50=100

Percentage is a silly way to look at the height.
No, in their single family home aka family neighborhood.  You know, families, front yard, back yards, kids running around playing with other kids...that life style. Real old school boomer shit.  The place you likely aspire to live someday, or maybe not...?
I have to admit he has an excellent PR team. The incident got completely shoved under the rug and he’s back to being the champion of the progressives.
You could say we are a Parliament of Whores
We could upzone a block around the bart to be 7 stories to match the new vibe?
Not really clear to me that avoiding ""change"" in the city is good or desirable even if you do live in Berkeley long term. Refusing to build new housing to keep up with natural population growth has fully gentrified the city. ""Preservation"" and gentrification \*is\* in the interests of retired white homeowners who have time to show up to city zoning meetings at 2pm on a tuesday. But they don't represent the diversity of Berkeley (or the diversity that Berkeley \*used\* to have).
I agree. It’s pretty shortsighted even though they believe they’re thinking in the long term.
Nice! Can't wait.
And go where? Magical rent free land?
The apartments being proposed will be rented to students, not sold.  The base of opposition to building more low cost student ""housing"" does not come from house owners, it comes from owners of notoriously crappy older unsafe poorly maintained apartment buildings.  It's not just a more supply versus demand issue, it's also a ""desirability"" issue.  When new safe clean apartments are built, they take over the top tiers of the ""student housing"" market, pushing crappy older units down the ladder = they lose money as their rents drop.  There are perfectly legit urban planning reasons to build near BART and the campus, not in the single family housing areas further from transportation and the campus.  Sheesh folks, this is simple ""follow the money"" logic.

[https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/02/11/berkeley-housing-proposals-university-san-pablo-shattuck](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/02/11/berkeley-housing-proposals-university-san-pablo-shattuck)
Wrong. CEQA would apply to Clark Kerr changes same as any other development.
It's not bullshit, its literally true.  When the university took over Clark Kerr, it entered into a covenant with the neighbors to not develop the site apart from replacing structures until I think 2030.  Now the university is fighting a court battle with the neighbors to build some much needed (for title ix compliance) volleyball courts that appear to fit within the agreed covenant.  And Cal has actually released plans to build dorms on Clark Kerr in the latest LRDP, and the NIMBYs have also asked a court to extend the duration of the covenant.

So yes, its very much true and not bullshit at all that the university wants to build a bunch of dorms at Clark Kerr and that the neighbors are going to scream bloody murder about it.
Then you were foolish not to account for the investment aspects of purchasing a home when making the decision.
I'm not trying to make it seem like a bigger difference, *that's literally what the difference is.*

And remember, developers can and always do seek density bonuses that allow them to build taller than the height limit. A building that's permitted at 12 stories and includes ""community amenities"" like street art or a mural can go up to 18 stories, so we're actually looking at a building that's more than twice as high as the average dorm building plopped down literally across the street from 1,000 square foot single story homes.
>*Comparing the numbers rationally is silly.*

Are you sure you don't go to Stanford?
The thing is it’s not natural population growth.  California has great laws that don’t stop growth, but they do require analysis of impacts - environmental, community, economic… They require mitigation and minimization of impacts.  Cal Berkeley doesn’t want to comply with these laws.  They don’t want to mitigate the impacts of their growth.  The city will need to add resources if this growth occurs.  All this development for the university is now skirting required planning laws because the University cried to the Governor.  It’s not surprising to me, but clearly most of the people referring to NIMBYs on this thread have no idea how planning works.
Building owners are refusing offers to sell though so it'll be along time.
Rent is cheap outside of the Bay Area because of no NIMBY tax. I saved 10k on rent during COVID, do you know why? By not fucking live here.
If a significant portion of houses in Berkeley are not owner occupied, and instead owned for the purpose of rental income, it is obvious that rents being lowered by an increased supply of rental apartments would lower the value of houses as rental income, and therefore lower the value of all houses, as any house could benefit in the sale process from its potential desirability as a rental property.

There are perfectly legitimate urban planning reasons to build anywhere in Berkeley and improve the affordability of residential housing even away from the university, including in the soon-to-be-no-longer-single-family-zoned areas further from transportation and the campus. Do you think only students have problems with housing affordability in Berkeley? 

Sheesh folks, this is simple ""follow the money"" logic.

Also, can you provide evidence of major private rental ownership groups (Raj, Greystar, Everest) actively campaigning against the abolishment of single-family zoning or the construction of new apartments? I can provide [ample evidence of neighborhood home owner organizations campaigning against new construction, multi family zoning, etc](http://saveberkeleysneighborhoods.org/accomplishments/)

**TL;DR: Okay, Boomer.**
Maybe I wasn't being clear enough. Cal did the studies for the development, which sailed through and would have been fine. Then after the fact they tied it to an enrollment increase which wasn't accounted for in the study. All Cal would have to do is propose development and get it pushed through and start the project during a year or two when they weren't increasing enrollment and they wouldn't have these problems.

Their staff aren't idiots and are clearly aware of this so the only thing I can conclude is that they don't actually WANT to do the development and are intentionally creating proposals they know will be shot down for some kind of political gain.
If a homeowner wants to make a return on their purchase you lambast them for only caring about their property values. 

If a homeowner says they don't care about property values and bought a home primarily for purposes of financial stability you call them a fool.

Sounds like you're just bigoted against all homeowners no matter what their motives are.
oh no not the single story homes!
Sure you didn't go to Trump U?
The city ought to allow building enough to keep up with the enrollment increases too but it's not even allowing enough building to keep up with natural population growth.

The city of Berkeley has its own planning department and is perfectly capable of coming up with plans to build the infrastructure needed. The city can easily pay for it with the new tax revenue the new housing would bring. But instead, a bunch of NIMBYs who \*choose\* to live next to the flagship university prefer to usurp the power to set university enrollment policy from the rest of California's citizens. Then they act surprised when everyone call them out on it.

Fortunately, the NIMBYs have lost power in the city government and in the statehouse.
It’s because mindset like this that creates this current environment where Berkeley has the shittiest road I’ve driven on (and I thought LA have crappy roads), burnt trash house with spray paints, and aggressive homeless people everywhere (suspiciously not around the nicer part of the neighborhood up around the hill). It’s literally bringing shame to our world class school, which the only thing that Berkeley is known for.
The percentage of owner occupied homes in Berkeley is 45%.

[https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/berkeleycitycalifornia](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/berkeleycitycalifornia)

Housing value has all sorts of factors, but you have a point that if a neighborhood is largely occupied by transient student renters, the value will drop.  Nobody wants to live in a neighborhood like that unless they have to.  So any home owner worth his/her salt would strongly favor constructing student apartments near campus and Bart so they could attract families looking for homes with yards, not rooms, or preferably sell to owner occupants.
Where did I lambast anyone for investing in property?

And for the record, I \*am\* a homeowner. Bought my house by Ashby bart over ten years ago.
Fuck off back to UCLA until you learn some empathy skills, kid.
LMAO what a facile comeback. Do better, Stanford.
That’s not how it works
okay, so you claim above that the opposition to new construction and multi family zoning isn't from single family house-owners, and now you agree with me that they do oppose multi family zoning and new construction, it's just bigotry and not economic self interest?

You also agree that 55% of homes are not owner occupied, supporting my above hypothesis and causal explanation for why ""homes and apartments are completely separate markets"" is a myth?

You also didn't provide evidence of major rental owners opposing these measures, so I guess you concede that point too.

I mean, it seems like we agree on a way to make housing prices go down in Berkeley, so let's do that. Boomers having yards isn't more important than everyone being housed, so you simply must be in favor of taking action in the direction of fewer yards and more housing units, since you explained that would make housing prices go down.
Just bringing it down to your level of prose so that you could understand
Nah, just too r-slur to come up with anything better. It's OK. There's no shame in having to go to your backup school. Maybe you can transfer for your Junior year.
Sure. Maybe we can carpool."

I think you’re right. Faculty is aware of it and from whatever discussions I’ve had, I think they’re making an effort to revitalize some courses.

Aren't there 194 and 294 courses on these topics being offered? I swear I saw them on calcentral a semester ago. If you want random algos and distributed systems, look into 270, 271, and 273.

Third roommate has that bootyhole stank and we don’t know how to tell them,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/179ogm2/third_roommate_has_that_bootyhole_stank_and_we/,2023-10-16 20:00:23,"
It all started on August 16.

They seemed normal. They seemed chill.

Then, they hung up their underwear.
Their “face washing bucket” started to grow mold.
They wore the same outfit for 5 weeks - and they washed their clothes with detergent in the bathroom sink.

The tarp they sleep under protects us from the odor occasionally - but everywhere they go there is a trail of destruction.

When we attempted to talk to them - they claimed the stench was nachos and the detergent was “skin safe.”

Our WHOLE FUCKING FLOOR avoids the bathroom stall that they use, afraid of coming across the hair-ball monkeys they leave behind. 

They spend all day gaming as well - and their portable sun of LED lights ensures we can’t sleep. Eating in their presence is a no-go - even though THEY DONT THROW AWAY THEIR FOOD TRASH. I’d swear to any god that trash can smells like a rotting corpse.

What do we do? How do we tell them that our noses can’t take the abuse? How do we tell them to shower their whole body and avoid smelling like a mud soaked dog instead of just “washing [their] hair because the rest of [them] is already clean?” Not to mention deodorant’s a “bad omen.”

I pray the rest of the units do not smell the stench of destruction through their walls.

(This is not a shitpost. I am serious.)

TLDR
Our roommate stinks, is very inconsiderate and defensive, and we don’t know what to do anymore. HELPPPPPPPPP HELPPPPPPP SOS ANYONE PLEASE!!!!


Also STANK ASS BITCH if you read this, FUCK YOU AND YOUR SPICY ASS","holy shit
Me: sometimes I really miss Cal 

Me after this post: nevermind
Being “mean” now is actually being kind towards this roommates future quality of life in many ways.
I lived in a house where we politely but very directly told him he needed to manage his stink. His shoes would stink up the house, so we’d make him leave them outside. Things like that, set rules and constantly enforce them. Don’t worry too much about  his feelings right now. If it’s entire house of people, and you all make sure to let him know it’s unacceptable, then he’ll cave or move.
I know it's hard, but you and your other roommate (I assume it's a triple?) need to talk to them together and say:
We're sorry if this hurts to hear but it's not fair for us to have to live in a space that is not hygienic, unwelcoming, and uncomfortable. 
Tell him need needs to keep the room clean as it is a communal space, and that includes keeping himself clean, emptying the trash, etc.
AND you need to enforce consistent lights out rules. If he's gaming at times you're trying to sleep, bright enough that it's difficult for you, then you need to shut that shit down. Don't let your roommate hurt your sleep and jeopardize your year. 

That doesn't work? Tell your RA. Tell your RSA. Email Housing. This is a borderline health violation and you can definitely argue it's affecting your mental health/academics, etc. Idgaf if it's ""tattle-taling/snitching"" this is nasty and I personally wouldn't tolerate it. You're paying how much for housing? 

I'm saying this as someone who grew up in basically a hoarder house. No one deserves to live in filth. Honestly, you're helping your roommate by intervening asap. Hope that helps.
Wrong tag bro, should use CS/EECS tag instead of university.
Which unit is this? Health and safety inspections are taking place at Units 1 and CKC. Unit 2 starts this Wednesday and idk about Unit 3 and FH. If it’s truly that bad, staff doing the inspections will likely notice and they specifically check for things like excess trash, mold, etc. Your room will get cited and you have a week to address the issue(s).
Squirrel dude is cooking up a devious paragraph rn
Honestly, this is probably a really good exercise in terms of confronting people who are clearly not all too put together. They may be struggling with mental health issues, they may have had a really bad childhood and this is the best that they can do. Be kind in your confrontation, but regardless ACTUALLY confront them about this shit. You can't do anything about it if you don't DO anything about it.   


I'd recommend roping in your RA to inspect your living conditions and verify that it is actually awful. And I'm sorry that you're going through this lmao, i'd have put my foot down so long ago. Take this as a precursor to making sure that you pick your next set of roommates extra carefully 

pls update us
I think you’ll should have a serious conversation and set rules. If that doesn't work, get off-campus housing with people who you can trust and people who are actually clean.
You need to out stank your third roommate - give ‘em’ a taste of their own medicine.
Do you want me to tell him for you? All you can do is confront him and say his shit smells
Dude idek
Easy—contact RA and have the RA speak to them. If things go south and the roomie hates you after, transfer to different housing. Your roommate is Deeply in violation of housing policy and there is more than enough cause for you to complain or switch rooms.
Take all their shit and literally throw it out in the hallway outside. Then talk to an RA and say you've officially kicked them out. It's a unanimous decision
just transfer at that point
Id say if try to just educate him on the matter. But if he says he knows and doesnt want to anyways. Say fuck you and report him to a RA
This is the kind of writing that got into Berkeley huh 😭😭😭💀💀💀
I once had a roommate with a fascination for, let's say, unconventional art. Picture someone turning the entire bathroom and even the light switch into a canvas, but with their own poo-poo.

Let him cook
Hm.. I wonder what their cultural background is. I have a couple of guesses that are pretty close
Do they identify as a they? I know it shouldn't matter, but I really want to know if that's why you didn't indicate his funk or her funk.
I’ll pray for you
All you have to say is ""We have been noticing an odor. How do you suggest we fix it?""

This sounds more like a mental health issue. Probably best to engage your RA but before you do, document everything in writing. Document a clear action plan for the fixes (no XYZ smell by this date, etc.) and if they are not remedied make it clear that there will be a formal action complaint to UC Housing Board and UC Regents and all other roommates will be moving out in under 30 days. The penalties are severe for health code violations for the dorm itself so they will be forced to act. DM if you need an inexpensive attorney in Berkeley for this, or just review my comments.

..your post history says you're a sophomore in high school lmao
No way you’re serious
Lmaoo. Y’all act like UCLA isn’t a great academic institution
Yeah. Grad school we are pretty much equals with Stanford. They come here and we go there.
As a more research focused undergrad I think mostly about MIT because  of specific subfield rivalry and the patent fight 😜
It's like our Black community, Asian community, LGBTQ+ community, so on and so forth: a group of people within our campus who share an identity and/or similar life experiences. There are a lot of autistic people at Cal but it's not a """"visible"""" disability, since many of us mask (i.e. suppress our true selves) to get by. You can always stop by the Disability Cultural Community Center if you want to get to know like-minded people, it's in Hearst Annex and it's really nice and cozy!!! Everyone is super supportive. The staff/students there made me feel welcome when I was lonely. Also there are snacks sometimes
That doesn't obscure the truth :) It is even better actually, as it shows that I am providing an outsider's perspective on the situation.
Prove me wrong.
I know a lot of people who go to UCLA, and they are definitely very smart. But I just get the feeling that they aren't super devoted to their field. It's more of an occupation than something to dedicate their entire life to. Which is fine, get that bag. I think Berkeley people are slightly insane and obsessive, which gives an edge in research and academia but is horrible for mental health and ""college experience"".
Berkeley is simply superior as an academic institution in every aspect.
This has been such an odd back and forth between the subs lol. Majority of people do not think about either school at all unless they’re choosing between them. Both are good schools in many different ways and they are competing for first place in public institutions. I personally think it’s pretty funny to make an angry post about how you don’t think about something when you obviously are thinking about it too much. Also you’re only downvoted for being ucla i will be downvoted for being ucla and that’s so silly too. Let’s just get along eh
That was a child saying that. 

UCLA is still impressive as shit. I applied to all UCSD, UCLA, UCSC, ans UCB (with a heavy preference for UCB) and UCLA is the only one I didn’t get into. On my application to UCLA, I applied to the wrong major which is why I didn’t get in, I assume. I’m glad I got into Berkeley because that’s what I was really aiming for but would have been proud to have gotten into UCLA as well if I hadn’t.
We at UCSD do not think about anyone tho
True story
lmao
Oh god I just realized I am speaking to a highschooler who doesn’t even attend either school lmao. Have a good day bro lol stay in school
most of the time we’re studying from the same books/materials. Don’t think berks academic superiority takes much affect until grad school

Maybe they’re warranted - clearly they’ve failed to teach you how to think critically and not be a troll.
[deleted]
I don't think it's obvious that those would be mutually exclusive, in fact I feel that there's a point to be made that, especially depending on your field of study, undergrads' ability to make decent wages in the future is contingent on their grades. This is certainly the case for my major
Why would this surprise you? It's a controversial opinion that will obviously (and in fact did) get flamed.  This person did what tons of users do in such a situation--create a burner for fear of retribution.

I don't agree with the opinion, but this topic, like most topics, is eligible for debate. Most subs on reddit (or online communities in general) are not ready, capable, or willing to debate controversial issues. Thus we see burner account making the controversial comments.
Okay I guess u r right and I take back my comment. But it’s p dumb to blame it on the GSI
The alternate take on that is that if you're not going to stand behind your opinions on an anonymous forum then you're kind of a coward when your entire point is that you want to punish TA's who are very publicly standing for their beliefs.

>This person did what tons of users do in such a situation--create a burner for fear of retribution.

Or it's just an astroturfing account.
Don't take it back, you were right! Saying you don't care IS putting your concern for your grades over thousands of people trying to advocate just to be able to afford rent and food where they work and maybe have even a little to save for a rainy day after. 

This quasi-economic argument that grades are a source of economic concern in this context because ""grades actually matter for how much undergrads might make later"" depends on the premise that ""the strike, that is, the loss of my GSI's instruction and guidance, is going to hurt my grades (and therefore my potential future earnings)."" 

This argument is literally prioritizing the hypothetical future wages of one person over the current, actual wages of the class of tens of thousands of workers that person admittedly DEPENDS ON to achieve that potential future wage. 

If you want good instruction and learning conditions, support the strike!
yeah I would agree
fare point, but it might depend on whether your primary account can be linked back to your real identity. Online harassment is real, and in some cases turns into real life harassment. I suppose we could still say it's cowardly to shy away for fear of online harassment, but I suppose it just depends on the person making the judgement and their life experiences.

does anyone know how many transfers don’t get housing,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dkr0ce/does_anyone_know_how_many_transfers_dont_get/,2024-06-20 17:31:24,round 2 of transfer housing and I haven’t received an offer.

I don't know how many transfers get housing, but I highly recommend that you get on the [coops](https://bsc.coop/) waiting list stat. 

IMHO the coops are a vastly superior alternative to the dorms in every way, AND much more affordable. If you spend two years in one coop, you'll make friends (and shared memories) for the rest of your life.

You're welcome!
check out the co-ops!
A lot will but Cal Housing is a mess. You might get an offer late July..
Is round 2 out?
I’m actually so worried because I will not be able to go
I got one. But in a triple room in 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment plan that has only 1 bathroom. And it still cost around $1500 per month. Although they say we could accept the offer and try to transfer but I’m looking for off campus now. I filled 3 out of 5 housing preferences with the new transfer student apartment but ended up getting this one. So, expect it. 
i heard a majority transfers don't get housing (sorry i dont have a specific percentage) but i'm assuming this year will be better than others because of anchor house opening up space for 700+ more transfers
Most don’t.
i'm guessing probably like 70%.
yeah the forced meal plan cost is always odd
where did you get an offer? im just curious if you dont mind me asking

The prof teaching 1A over summer had [25% of his class fail/not pass](https://berkeleytime.com/grades/0-4458-fall-2023-_-1-bamler,-r) in Fall 2023's version of Math 1A.","Online summer classes attract 2 kinds of students: A and F.
This is strange lol, I had Bamler online for a fall term and I really enjoyed his lectures. I’m absolutely god awful at math too, but I felt like he taught it well? I got a good grade in his class and this is coming from someone who’s never even bothered looking at AP calc, lol. Can’t say much though because it was a fall class vs a summer class so idk how much he would change
The course was curved unbelievably well. There was a lot of BS in it, but if you were able to figure out the basic mechanics of calculus, then getting overall 60% accuracy (which was all you needed for an A more or less) was achievable. For instance, you could earn around 90 points for the final, but it was only out of 50.
The fact that almost half the class got some sort of A indicates that it’s a quality of student issue and not that the class is impossibly hard.
Is it really that bad? I’m taking math 1A online over the summer as a gpa booster to declare econ, and I’ve already taken calculus at a cc
[removed]
Whats the diff between Math1a and MathN1a? Also, are incoming freshmen not allowed to take math1a at a CC?
Paulin is the best, I had him for 1A and 1B. This is good advice.
Yeah I agree, I had friends who took 1A with Bamler and they said he was horrible. Also, there was no partial credit and everything was graded based on final answer which means higher chance of getting a lower grade. Take it with Paulin, he’s good and the logistics of his class are way more organized
was there webwork hw
Nah, it was a massive teaching/grading issue. Most students that had high grades in the class had period experience in Calculus (AB/BC). Moreover, midterms and quizzes were all graded on final answer only and the average MT grade was a 48% while most quizzes ended up being curved.
ur prob right also there might be highschoolers or non students taking it so they dgaf
this seems like a waste of time and money tbh

Why? Is it because for many majors, the only job prospects are to become professors to teach people to become professors for the field? Or because the demands of capitalism reduces human beings into cogs of a process to make profits.

Weighted pull-ups >>>>>>>>>>>> deadlift 🤮🤮🤮


","How else are we gonna get that rippled back sculpted by the gods?
I used to not do any back because deadlifts would terrify me but started doing pull ups now my back looks straight out of an anime. Highly rec
I do both. Do you think it's redundant? I think of deadlifts more as a lower body exercise.
Valid
I feel that weighted pull ups are probably safer, but maybe there's also a big issue with my form.
when the gym only has hex plates then yeah weighted pullups are better for the sheer fact that the weight belt doesnt launch an aggravated assault on your shins every set
One works legs and low back and the other mid and upper back u gotta do bofh 
You just reminded me I gotta go do some
Right?? Well, ripped upper back at least; idk abt lower back

Tbh though I think weighted pull-ups are good for strength, i don’t think they’re that good for muscle.

Bc my back isn’t too prominent but I feel like I have decent strength:

1x53lbs, 2x44lbs, and 6x30lbs
I stopped deadlifts and rows bc I got scoliosis and I feel like it aggravates my lower back even with a guard and good form
Absolutely, you need both. 

* Pull-ups activate the lats, the muscles around the scapular, biceps, and upper back in general.

* Deadlifts activate the glutes, hamstring, and lower back in general. To a lesser extent, also quads and traps.

Deadlifts are one of the best full-body exercises as long as the form is executed properly and you’re not going too heavy too fast. Really good for getting your circulatory system going too because of how much blood you need in those large muscle groups.
Nice. I've been spamming pull ups but I want to do some calisthenics for my abs. Any recommendations?
I really like dragon flags!
Thank you, I'll probably just spam the hell out of them"

What are UC Berkeley students thoughts on people who go to bars in Berkeley but don’t go to UC Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cd51on/what_are_uc_berkeley_students_thoughts_on_people/,2024-04-25 15:41:42,"I'm 25 and new here, exploring places to meet people. But when they find out I don't go to UC Berkeley, their attitude seems to change. Or maybe it’s just me I don’t know. 
Come up with a great attitude and I’ve never had an issue with meeting new people !","It's definitely easy to get absorbed into a student bubble here and just never talk to anyone who isn't a student for weeks on end. Being charitable to the people you met i'm guessing some were just taken aback at no longer having the easy refrain of ""oh what's your major?"" to start a convo lol, i've been stumped at times. Or they're assholes. either way most of our bars are grimy shitholes lol try oakland
Bars in Berkeley generally suck anyways. I’d try Oakland.
I live in Berkeley and the student population hardly exists for me in any way. I've never seen an urban college town where the bubble is so strong.
A sizeable portion of the undergrad student body isn't old enough to be in a bar, and many of the ones who are old enough rarely stray more than five blocks from campus, and many of the ones who do are too busy to go to bars anyway. There are tons of bars in Berkeley where non-students are the norm rather than the exception.

Unfortunately, some of Berkeley's best bars further from campus died in recent years (the Missouri Lounge, the Albatross, etc) but there's still the Starry Plough, Acme, and Fieldwork. Just beyond Berkeley city lines things get even better: Kingfish, the Hotsy Totsy (the best cocktail bar in the east bay, if not the entire bay area), Prizefighter, Ramen Shop, Friends and Family, Tamarack, Redfield (a very cool cider bar), Ordinaire (natural wine bar), Viridian, the Ivy Room, Radio Bar, and Cafe Van Kleef. I can personally recommend all of these. The hours and location for Trader Vics are lousy but if you like tiki drinks this is a great spot, though you'll meet more people at Forbidden Island in Alameda. If you're in San Francisco, check out Specs, one of my favorite bars in the city. Also if you happen to be Ethiopian, the bars at Red Sea and Blue Nile are great hangout spots.

That said, I do think that bars aren't as reliable of a place to meet people as they are in other parts of the country, especially the Midwest or New England. In Chicago people congregate in bars because there isn't much public space that won't kill you for half the year. Californians don't have that problem, and accordingly don't depend as much on bars to meet people. Which is good in some ways, but unfortunate for the bar scene.

Reading what I just wrote, I'm starting to wonder if I should cut back a little. Yeesh.
You need to be wicked smart like Will Hunting
instead of an ice breaker you’ll be asked how you would solve the goldbach conjecture 😔
Well yeah I mean UC Berkeley students tend to be exclusively interested in associating with other Berkeley students. I don’t think that’s a thing only in Berkeley it’s a thing in any college area, really.
Go to different bars

Editing to elaborate: the closer you are to campus, the more likely you are to be surrounded by students. And remember that half of them are using fake IDs so they might be like, 19

Down on Shattuck and closer to Albany there are a few great townie bars. Club mallard is one of my faves 

(For context I went to Berkeley and graduated a while ago and now live in the hills like an adult)
Off with their heads!
Venture outside of the Berkeley bubble. The east bay has tons of bars and spots to hangout.
Umm, I was born and raised here and I went to Cal and I still live and work here and I go to bars here…sooo…ummm…what???
Cal isn’t located in some rural college town where 100% of the people that live there are associated with the school, it’s in a reasonably densely populated area that’s fully integrated into the metroplex of the Bay Area. To judge anyone for going to a bar in Berkeley when they’re not students is ridiculous
Generally people want to know your reason for being in a certain area.  That is natural.  If you go to the bars to meet Berkeley students but you don’t go yourself there will be a natural reaction.
I dig Cornerstone, love all the live acts they have each week and theres a good mix of everyone in there. I dont even notice the UC students or care to ask as the focus is usually music in that bar.
If this happened at a student bar, eg bears lair tavern, makes sense.
Berkeley is more than just the college. At 25 you'll fit in fine. At some point though as you get older you'll actively avoid bars full of students.
I'm a Berkeley Native and a late bloomer in college so went to the bars before going to UC Berkeley. Most bars in town tend to not have students/alumni as regulars (you can tell if they are a student usually if they come in a pack with other similar aged people). If you are looking for places to drink and hang with friends, I would look towards Oakland more, especially on Telegraph, good place to bar hop (also this thread has some great suggestions). If you want a list of things to do to get to know people, DM me and I can send you a list of both bars and not bars that do weekly/monthly events in the Bay, like dancing, singing, open mic etc.
You could also head down to 4th and Gilman and hit up a bunch of wineries and breweries.
What are native’s thoughts on people who come to California to a school and instantly feel entitled and think they own the entire city the college is in? You’re a bunch of colonizers, same mentality.
I am looking for some of my friend addy multivitamins, please dm me if you can sell me some probiotics.
It’s a public place who cares what the students think?
College town bars are full of bums who try to ingratiate themselves into students' lives. Don't be that bum.
It's just kinda creepy like why are you trying to interact with people you know are students, likely underage. You should go to bars in Oakland or Downtown Berkeley. Students are in a unique stage in life and likely aren't trying to become friends with full-fledged adults (unless they're grad students but most people in bars are undergrads)
That’s a really good point!
Facts
Checked out Kingfish in Oakland the other night! Awesome bar met some cool Berkeley students and firefighters
A bar in Oakland??? Yeah better bring a gun if you can 💀💀💀
Insert UCD
I feel like there's a huge disconnect in Berkeley between the people living in the city and the students/the university. It also causes a lot of societal friction, like when the university wants to build student housing next to single family homes in North Berkeley (I'm referring to anchor house). 

Sometimes I feel like the residents of the city hate the fact that the university exists.
Lol, the fact that I have been to every one of those places before 30 makes me think I'm on the same boat
Not being old enough to go to bars does not stop the undergrad population from going to them lol
Mallards has way better vibes than Hotsy Totsy and a younger crowd. However, Tacos El Autlense is one of the top taco trucks in the bay. Their Carne Asada burrito is the best one in the East Bay.
There are some deep cuts in there! Thanks for not mentioning my fave bar in Oakland, it's busy enough as it is.
There are more bars in and around Berkeley to explore: Beta Lounge, Cornerstone. Spats, White Horse Inn..  but Oakland bars are better, cheaper, and easily accessible via BART or A/C transit.  The rules are really the same in any bar. Don’t leave your drink unattended. If someone is acting like a creep, tell the bartender or door person. If they don’t care, go somewhere else.  Plenty of options in Uptown Oakland, KONA, Temescal and Piedmont. If you don’t like those options, take BART to SF and hit up some spots.
You speak the truth.
Wicked SMAATTT
It's not your fault.
Berkeley students famously hate apples tho
Sorry boys, but I’ve gotta go see about a girl
Kinda sucks about Berkeley though. The students at Boston area schools all intermingle even though there is a weird academic hierarchy. 

I was on a club sports team at Cal so we would occasionally host the other schools for parties and things. It was always great to have Cal Maritime, St. Mary's, Santa Clara students partying with us at Cal. Our nightlife is actually pretty good compared to those schools and they liked to come to Berkeley to party. 

We should encourage more of that bc despite the dominant narrative, Berkeley is a hella fun college town and the parties are great.
That’s fair, there whole life is school so having friends that know your own life and experience definitely are more relatable!
![gif](giphy|h724Ile3UWMZG)
Don’t venture out. Just stay on piedmont, get your socialist indoctrination, and go back to whatever state you came from.
Oh snap, sounds like you got the WHOLE Berkeley experience then, any places you recommend?
I completely agree! Luckily I haven’t had to many make it weird once they realize I’m not a student
He was hated for he spoke the truth. Fact is, non-college-students who want go to a bar will go to one of the *many* bars around Berkeley/Oakland that aren't mostly students. Many actively don't want to go to student bars cause the vibe of being surrounded by students as an old person (old = >23yo) is weird as hell. 

Anyways OP just go to bars more than 5 blocks away from campus to avoid the students. The ones near campus, tbh the expectation is either you're a college student, or you're a bum trying to sleep with one. Not worth the effort of trying to not be labelled as the latter when you could just go somewhere with people more in your age group.
Yeah don’t know why you are being downvoted 🤷‍♂️. I mean that makes sense to me. 
Don’t try and pretend to be a student when you’re not!
I love that I'm being down voted by the bums.
At a BAR. What are you talking about, underage? 

And they should go to  *downtown Berkeley* instead?? Where do you think Cal is located??


And *most people in bars are undergrads*? lol, oh dear…
Oakland is a pretty big place. You should check it out sometime
Lol dude it’s literally just North Oakland/Temescal. You’re probably equally as safe there as you’d be near Tap Haus/Kips
Found the suburbanite LARPing as an Oaklander 🤣🤣🤣. “Don’t go there, there are darkies there!” Stay in the Central Valley, friendo.
Pretty predictable comment from a boot licking gun nut.
Oh dear. I’ve even walked a mile or so home from that bar at night.🙄
They said urban, not podunk.
Anchor house is directly across from campus and bordered by other fairly tall apartment buildings to the north, south, and west. No single family homes in sight
I rarely notice the students in Berkeley. I figure they keep to themselves and stay indoors a lot. I hang out all over Berkeley but don’t tend to ever feel like I’m among students.
They do. But that is because they all went to school here and it is no longer the entitled white hippy enclave it was in the 60s/70s man. 


However they hate the homeless even more.  And worry the housing might be for the homeless.


Really they wish Berkeley was a gated community for families.  I rent here and it is a very unfriendly vibe towards young people from the former hippies.


But eff em.  They traded there hippy ethos once the got houses.
There are only a handful of bars that seem to look the other way. I won't name them here, but most bars will spot fake IDs a mile away.
I think the vibes at the Hotsy are great on weekdays (I avoid it on weekends though), but I do agree that Club Mallard is a treasure.
I intentionally excluded a few out of mercy. Some of my favorite spots aren't there at all, including a special little joint on MLK.
I was specifically going to give a shoutout to Spats, but it is close enough to campus that I decided not to. White Horse is very close to my heart, but I often don't even drink when I go there for events.
![gif](giphy|Dvw2lJqlTuJmo)
well the boston schools are a lot closer to each other, it's a lot easier when BU and MIT and Harvard are all ~20m walks away from each other. i have SCU friends and seeing those guys is such a massive pain in the ass
Our nightlife is good? Seriously?
I like Tupper and Reed. Cornerstone is cool. Raleigh’s is cool. Go exploring. Check out bars in Oakland, Alameda, and Albany too. I like the Ivy Room for drinks and music.
Which ones are college student bars? I go to Berkeley rep shows, used to see movies downtown, and I live in the area. Which bars should I avoid? I like Tupper and Reed. Revival. Comal. East Bay Spice Co. The Graduate. These are nice places with mixed age crowds. I don’t tend to run into students when I’m out having fun with my husband.

I never thought places were off limits to someone like me who lives in the neighborhood. 🙄It’s ridiculous to lay claim to anything that’s open to the public.
Dude I was raised there, there is not a place in Oakland that’s considered safe🤷🏿‍♂️ especially bars/clubs and the list goes on
Kips is sketchier than Kingfish.
Cool💀, I’m simply saying to be cautious anywhere in Oakland
I wish I lived in a suburban area outside of Oakland💀💀 But Larping as a oaklander is a new one 😂
I love guns 🤷🏿‍♂️my 2nd amendment right and I respect the field
Idk bro the homeless population at Berkeley screams podunk to me. Davis campus is a 10 minute walk from bars and clubs
Walk a few blocks west and you hit the neighborhood full of ""neighbors not towers"" signs in their lawns with caricatures of anchor house drawn on them.
Then insert People's Park. Plenty of bougie students who never would or will even live there cheerleading for it because they heard about supply and demand in that one econ class they took and think that's literally all they need to know to understand how society should work. And anyone who disagrees is a """"NIMBY""''' and can be immediately disregarded.
Same.   I think because it is a lot of Asian transplants you don't the party bro frat thing here as much.  I honestly thought I would see way more drunk kids in the streets on weekends but not really.
I like the Avenue by the laundromat.
Yeah, I mean between the actual historic frat row with active houses and the co-ops that have their own party scene, there are a ton of great college parties to attend. 

Look at stanfurd, they can't even have real frats. All the students live on campus in boring, dull residences. Parties fucking suck down there, not sure if you've ever been.
Yeah nightlife here is actually pretty great. I was surprised about it coming here because of the reputation but all my friends that have visited from other schools are also surprised at how good it is here
Eh I've been to a few bars there and didn't think anything of it. I was harassed one time but that was on telegraph after dark.
Maybe it’s different now? I almost exclusively hang out and walk around Oakland. Piedmont Ave, Grand-Lake, College ave, Temescal… It’s very nice!
Making guns part of your identity is weird. They are tools not something to worship
Went to Davis for UG. It’s a boring shithole cow pasture with 110F summer days. I was OOS on an athletic scholarship, so that constrained my choice. I’d put a bullet in my head before moving back.
Those signs were put up regarding North Berkeley BART
Being against the people’s park housing is actually wild

Who said I made guns?? Tools? Are you referring to cops or guns? Either way I love guns and Respect the field
Damn that sucks I’m sorry. A bunch of my friends loved it. They would constantly go to Sac or the City on weekends so it does make sense.
Bro idk why you're getting downvoted when it's not hard to get robbed/raped if you aren't careful in oakland, like id never suggest a woman go get inebriated alone at night there...but yeah be careful anywhere? Idk it's weird people can't admit oakland can be as dangerous as it can be
What field?  The grassy knoll. 


Also, anyone worth their salt knows guns don't mean squat, especially today.  I am getting a tank with my 2nd rights. And no I am NOT joking.  I have been looking into it.


Turns out it isn't too hard if you have the money and/or have family in the military.  And I check both boxes.
Law enforcement field, also I was responding to some guy who attempted to knock me because I love guns and Respect LE, If you have the space and money for a tank why not go for it 🤷🏿‍♂️"

Not all 3 tech combos are bad. Plus it also depends on what you are used to. 

In general, I’m going to guess the vast majority of STEM students will take 3 or more techs at least once in their Berkeley career. It’s gonna be pretty unavoidable unless you plan things out 4 years and everything falls into place which it never does. In many cases, if you blow your load on too many breadths at the beginning, you’ve got no choice but to take 3 or 4 techs a semester multiple times later on.

** reads this taking 3+ techs @ same time regretting every second of it 🥲🥲🥲🥲 **
I feel you man I’ve been there 😭 start hitting the gym bro it’s a good way to de-stress everything out
Seconding this. I’m taking CS 189+184, INFO 159, and Wealth and Poverty, and I’m dying right now
Not me taking 3 technicals at the same time and pretty much having to take 4 next semester because I ran through all my humanities reqs (even though I have been taking 3 techs a semester since I’ve been here)
not me taking 4 technicals + cs research position rn
[deleted]
Some engineering majors make the techs 3 units so you have to take 4 just to meet minimum unit requirements and be on track to graduate 😭 3 units for ME C85 was more miserable than many 4 unit classes.
Doing 3 and having a tough time as well, 2 of them aren’t even considered that hard
Are econ classes considered technicals? Or only a class like Econ 140
As an EECS transfer student you don’t have any other choice
Lower div 3+ tech classes is doable (currently taking cs61b, cs70, data100, math 54). Upper div is more challenging fs. Good luck tho :')
You wont graduate in 4 years as a stem major if you don’t take 3 or more “technicals” a semester.
Depends on you and your classes too.
3 techs and more can be fine too. I’ve done 4 every semester except my first and been fine.

Meanwhile, doing 6 techs is unpleasant anytime. Someone save me.

i am praying for you🙏🏽 hopefully it goes better than it did for me lollll
I wanna say most count as half a technical (the less mathy ones like international trade) and ones like 136/140 as technicals with the amount of maths/work u gotta do.
Do you think 61B, 70, and physics 7A together would be management based on your exp rn?
it’s not the worst unless the techs you choose are a bad combo
wtf?? who says that to someone
i gotta say tho, i think having someone that’s in similar situation & form a study group w them would rlly help alot. just bcs u guys are in the same boat & can rlly force eachother to study. i used to take ochem+cal+physics+bio or atleast three of the 4 and i survived bcs i was taking the same classes as my friend & i felt like i had to study whenever we go discuss smth together. good luck my friend ! my dm is open if u need some advice/just someone to talk to :D

But we don’t have the money to pay GSIs fair wages. 🤔,https://i.redd.it/c3swzou4990a1.jpg,2022-11-15 17:13:28,,"[https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/04/12/uc-buys-6-5-million-berkeley-mansion-president](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/04/12/uc-buys-6-5-million-berkeley-mansion-president)
While I agree that there’s problems to be dealt with in regards to admin pay and corruption, why do I see so few people bring up arguably the largest money sink at uc Berkeley which are its athletics. We literally spent over $300 million renovating a football stadium for a failing football team that nobody watches and $153 million on an athletic center within the past decade?! For all those people saying that the athletics brings in more money than they spend where’s the receipt?! According to the sf chronicles it’ll take us till 2053 to finish paying it off. Oh and don’t forget the fact that we pay our football coach $5 million a year. 
Seriously more people need to bring up our disproportionate spending on athletics that’s crippling our school budget.

*Edit: 
So here's a bit of consolidation of fair points raised:
1) The sports programs bring in a lot of money (in alumni donations, brand deals, etc.) and the budget is separate

To address the first point, here are some articles from recent years. 
https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/25/hotline-analysis-cal-athletics-turned-a-profit-in-fy20-thanks-to-a-massive-assist-from-central-campus/
^Notable points:
- ""The Bears finished the 2020 fiscal year with a $3.2 million surplus (in a pandemic) but received $25.1 million in university support — support that was booked as revenue."" - aka the books were fudged to look like the sports program generates a profit when in fact that profit was subsidised by the *school's budget* (not the athletic budget)
- ""In fact, from FY15 through FY19, the Bears experienced budget shortfalls totaling $84.7 million, according to financial documents reviewed by the Hotline."" - the sports program has been experiencing financial loss for years

https://www.californiagoldenblogs.com/2020/7/17/21327417/cal-athletics-nations-second-highest-deficit-2018-2019
^Notable points:
- in 2018-2019 Cal had the second highest budget deficit of all schools' athletic departments

So is it true that sports programs bring in a lot of revenue in donations, brand deals, and more? Undoubtedly. Unfortunately revenue is not the same as profit, and what pain the athletic program experiences in loss the school's budget (not the separate athletic budget) is forced to make up for. 

2) There is cultural value to sports

So I think here we see a battle between luxury and life. Yes, sports events are great cultural events to bring student life and alumni together. But the question is, is it really necessary to run a deficit to maintain this? Or rather, would decreasing our multi-hundred-million dollar athletic budget by a couple dozens of millions of dollars suddenly cause the culture of sports to disappear? 
Pretty plainly, no. 
And especially when you consider that those dozens of millions of dollars (remember that $25.1 million was literally subsidized from the regular school budget) could go to paying the salary of our academic workers. Which is more valuable: The literal ability to live (afford housing, food, and even [shock] afford to do things like fly home to visit family) for thousands of graduate student instructors/researchers, for which this ACADEMIC INSTITUTION (I put in all caps because we seem to forget that Berkeley is first an academic institution, then a sports spectacle) would cease to function without, or renovating our perpetually underpopulated football stadium? No, seriously. 

Also just some food for thought, the notion of 'division I' is such a toxic achievement. It cripples academic institutions who have to bend over backwards to maintain their 'div I' status even if it means taking away from their non-athlete students. But then you remember that athlete students aren't even benefitting because in Div I schools their athletics comes before their academics. Oftentimes, athlete students are forced to forego studying or getting much needed academic help in favor of 'practice practice practice' or risk losing their scholarships. This isn't even considering the terribly exploitative nature of collegiate sports in which athletes make millions of dollars in revenue for their schools but see almost nothing in return. So I guess in the end, we arrive back at the original source of all this insanity: administrative corruption. 

Don't get things twisted, GSIs, student athletes, and students are all in the same boat. This isn't an attack on student athletes but the athletic department and our administrators.
Somewhat ironically (as the Berkeleyside article notes) the University owned this house years ago, then sold it in 1991. Prior to then it had been designated as the official residence of a UC Vice President. This year it has been re-purchased at a considerably higher price. This seems like an instance where the University inadvertently ended up privatized the profit (the vast appreciation in value that accrued to the private sellers) and paid the cost out of public funds.

As the Berkeleyside article also notes, the house was built for the daughter of Elizabeth (Lizzie) Glide in 1928. The year before, 1927, Mrs. Glide built another building in Berkeley, Epworth Hall, which was a Methodist-affiliated private residence for women students at Cal. It was one of the largest private student rooming / boarding houses serving the campus population, housing more than 70 single women. 

The University bought Epworth Hall decades ago, intending to demolish it to build student housing (again, irony). But the residence hall building program was paused and the three story building, now a City landmark, still stands at 2521 Channing Way, next to the Channing-Bowditch apartments. It now houses offices of a good research program, the University's Institute of Industrial Relations. But it might be better if the Institute were given office quarters elsewhere, and the building could be converted back to its original use, housing more than 70 students. The last time I was in it (years ago) it still had the original student bedrooms, bathrooms, common areas, etc. In the old bathrooms boards had been placed over the unused bathtubs so they could serve as storage alcoves (I don't know if this is still the case).

A bit about the Searles Fund which the University reportedly used to buy the house on Claremont. Edward F. Searles, a Massachusetts interior designer, married one of his clients, Mary Hopkins in 1887. Mary Hopkins was the widow of Mark Hopkins, one of the four founders / original owners of the Central Pacific Railroad (another of the business partners was a guy named Leland Stanford).  

Mary Hopkins died less than four years after marrying Searles and he inherited most of her immense fortune. Searle gave the gigantic and ornate Hopkins family mansion on San Francisco's Nob Hill to the University, which operated the Mark Hopkins Art Institute there; he also donated paintings, sculptures, and other furnishings. (The house burned in 1906. The Mark Hopkins Hotel now stands on the site). 

When Searles died, his estate was worth more than $22 million in 1920s dollars and the University inherited at least $1.5 million. With a little bit of online searching I found a powerpoint presentation that noted UC's Searles Fund had grown to $177.5 million by February, 2012.

The Regents apparently designate the Searles Fund *""to fund general purposes of the University which cannot be covered by State funds.""* https://today.ucsd.edu/story/regents\_approve\_phase\_ii\_rehabilitation\_of\_uc\_san\_diegos\_university\_house

So it seems accurate for the University to say that the Searles Fund came not from State money, but from a private gift to the University (and it's probably just that some of the ill-gotten gains of the Central Pacific Railroad eventually went to support the University of California, since other parts went to create Stanford University). 

But perhaps the implicit *""don't worry, this was not paid for with State money...""* argument has its limits, if you consider that UC is presumably not **required** to spend Searles Fund monies to buy houses for the use of chief administrators. The expenses paid for by the Searles Fund are a choice made by The Regents.
is the house paid for by an endowment that funds these specific types of things, or is tuition funding it?

**EDIT**: ""The cost of housing the president is not borne by taxpayers. Something known as the Searles Fund, a private endowment that often pays for things like presidential and chancellor housing, foots the bill.""

**SOURCE**: [https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/04/12/uc-buys-6-5-million-berkeley-mansion-president](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/04/12/uc-buys-6-5-million-berkeley-mansion-president)

**CONTEXT**: endowments often target specific tasks/goals/programs/services/etc in their funding contract. In other words, money in these types of funds cannot be spent on anything other than what the contract specifies.  This is why Cal, with billions of dollars of endowments, had to cut staff during early covid. They had/have boatloads of money, but the majority of it is tied up in specific funding targets and can't be pulled from to simply spend on anything (like paying staff wages).

In short, be mad at the people/entities giving money to this endowment instead of student oriented targets. Campus not spending this endowment on a house (or whatever else it allows for) is like walking out of ChuckECheese with tokens in your pocket. Use it or lose it (more realistically, we don't ""lose"" the endowment money, it just sits in an account unspent, doing nothing). One might think, ""well they should have bought a cheaper house!"".  But, thats like walking our of ChuckECheese with only some tokens left in your pocket.
We should go strike at his house. Anyone have the address?
A private donor paid for this house for the president of the UC system.  Previously, we were renting a house for them at a significant loss each year.  This property is an asset that will undoubtedly increase in value over time.  This is not a bad thing.

Don't worry. Someone like professor Dan will have been paid much more than any GSI/R to make sure the costs and benefits of this decision balanced out favorably.
There are other more important things than arguing about this trivial matter, like Pamela Price being a DA and increase in crimes.

Shiii I'd be cool with it if I were the president
This is one of the [receipt](https://www.si.com/college/oklahoma/football/big-12-revenue-still-third-among-power-5-conferences-but-not-light-years-behind) that each Pac-12 conference school got from last year, and the primary reason that U$C and UC L.A. are moving to B1G conference because it can earn more. Combine with the $86 million/10 year Under Armour deal and the ticket sales and it actually might not be a completely financially-losing operation.

Although I want to back up one step -- if athletics was strictly about making money or not, then I'm presuming it wouldn't have been created in the first place in the late 19th/early 20th century. I get not all students/alumni don't watch football, but it is one of the most popular events and occasions to bring the students and alumni together. Going back to the financials, it would be a severe blow for the alumni associations and the major clubs (i.e. marching band, essentially all Greek life and their own alumni) without the athletics. It wouldn't be too surprising if this eventually translates to decreased endowment as athletics is a major element that alumni connect with the school and some potential students simply not considering applying to the school.

We spent what we spent, and I'm more on the opinion of making the most use out of it. It is a lot of spending on the renovation and the football coach, but those figures are standard for recent [universities](https://www.lubbockonline.com/story/sports/college/red-raiders/2022/07/12/texas-tech-plans-200-million-football-facilities-project/65371175007/) and [facilities](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1625865-texas-am-approves-450-million-project-to-renovate-kyle-field) [renovation](https://www.si.com/college/2022/09/29/northwestern-shares-plans-new-800-million-football-stadium-ryan-fiel), and the $5M pay for a coach is actually right at middle of Pac-12 as unappealing as it may sound.

Perhaps winning more can cure a lot of problems (certainly would cure mine) and have a more positive view of athletics, but it could also start with an environment that having a Division 1 athletics with national exposure is something that not many universities can claim and goes beyond having positive/negative revenue for the year.
> We literally spent over $300 million renovating a football stadium for a failing football team that nobody watches

That was on major seismic upgrades that HAD to be done. The options were either to fix Memorial stadium, build a new stadium (which would be ~3x the cost), play at the Collesium, or drop football.

>2) There is cultural value to sports

Athletics drives a lot of eyes and interest to Berkeley and is the most significant touchstone for donors and alums. Nobody with deep pockets from the class of 1968 is sitting down Saturday afternoon to watch an engineering lecture from that week.
Athletics budget is typically separate from school budget. Especially for football. Even at Cal
Listen I agree with you. But after I left Berkeley I went to a Big 10 school, and during COVID when all the football games were shut down the school lost $200 million in athletics revenue. This meant that many faculty from the liberal arts programs had to be furloughed. I'm just telling you what I know, you can do it that information what you want.
This. Speaking for myself, as a graduate student and a GSI, I couldn't care less about the football team.
Pretty certain the athletic budget is entirely separate and has its own source of funding.
[deleted]
I literally wouldn’t have gone to Cal if it weren’t for D1 athletics. If you don’t want the programs of a big public institution then go to some liberal arts college.
Constructivist theory for all my PoliSci majors out there: “prestigious” colleges have to have a good football team so they’ll spend millions on it. Absolute insanity especially when Berkeley’s football team, like you said, is failing. No offense to all the football players out there my friend is actually on the team.
When GSIs make as much money for the university as football does, then they can get the money invested in them as well.
One other thing to add about the sports — for most athletes that aren’t football and basketball, they do sports to pay their tuition. Many couldn’t afford school without it. Even with football and basketball a lot of the 3rd stringers are doing it for the scholarships.
This is the problem with 86% of the funding for a ""public"" university coming from private sources
The campus can choose not to use it. They should not buy a house for the president while not increasing the salary for GSI. (Instead, they increase the chancellor's salary by 18%). The campus can tell people not to give out money for this useless purpose. (I still don't understand why people donate millions of dollars to the president's housing.)
2821 Claremont Blvd, Berkeley, CA 94705
I'm pretty sure I recognize this house. I think it's just a bit South of Clark Kerr.
We absolutely should, lovely neighborhood
It's a mansion, no one needs a god-damned mansion
Well it’s not like it’s generating wealth. This place is never going to be sold. If anything it’s a liability because property tax
On y va quand ?
Not how this works. It's paid for with funds from an endowment that must be spent on these type of purchases.  That money could never be routed to students.

If you want someone to blame, blame the people funding that endowment instead of donating money to student services.
They bought it during peak housing inflation no? The price gonna go down from now so they should pull out before it dips any further.
Paying your GSI's well avoids PR disasters like this and improves the reputation of your university, while also generating fonder memories of the university for the GSIs, many of whom are likely to become leading scientists in their field or potential wealthy donors. This all generates income through more donations/more prestige.
This but unironically
The stadium renovation has been such a debt trap that the university is bailing out Cal Athletics.

> Approximately $9.5 million of the athletic department’s $18 million in annual debt service payments will be shifted from athletic operations to central campus. A specific payment schedule has yet to be finalized.

https://www.dailycal.org/2018/01/17/central-campus-take-chunk-cal-athletics-debt
It is seperate. Believe it or not, there are BIG TIME DONORS who contribute to the football/hoops programs including the NFL Cal players...
Considering that this is the Big Game week, it's even more depressing lol.
> Berkeley’s football team, like you said, is failing

Source?
Without GSI's, there is no university.  Same cannot be said for any athletic activity or facility.  Worker pay is not an investment, it is a cost of doing business.  Fair pay is a human right.
I don't disagree. It also adds to confusion because most people don't seem to understand how endowments work, and that they represent the vast majority of wealth a university holds.
In the end you can do what you want with your own money. If a private donor wants to buy a mansion for the UC president, there’s not much you can do about it. You can’t force them to spend the money on something else. It’s certainly better than nothing.
I was going to say “well if they use it for events..” but we have a giant college campus and the faculty clubs etc so never mind. Nobody needs a free mansion.
Fine no jokes
If they hold it for 10, 20, 50, 100 years, the purchase time will not be ""peak"", unless something truly drastic befalls the US Economy, in which case we will have way bigger issues to worry about than the resale value of this property.
I worked with the football content team for a semester and the new locker room was a built through millions of dollars in donations from Aaron Rodgers. Dude barely likes or mentions Cal but still wants the new players to experience something great.
Just bought my tickets. I'm going to spend the day in Berkeley, meeting with current students at my old fraternity (where I'll donate some money), meeting with old friends I haven't seen in years (and networking), eating and spending money at Berkeley establishments (giving money to the city and local business), buying food/merch for my kids at the game (giving money to the school). All because of a stupid, ""failing"" football team.

But we've got the Axe. Go Bears!
Without athletics, universities are glorified Khan Academies. Athletics and academics coexist. Nothing against GSIs, but the investment made in them doesn’t have that return like football does.
Indeed. When most of the funding is provided AND essentially controlled by private actors, it almost seems misleading to continue calling it a ""public institution"" as if it's the same thing it was 50 years ago.
Yo, you totally can do something when the donors are dead and ‘what the fund can be spent on’ is broad. 

This was not a case of the UC having its hands tied by donor wishes/demands.
Sorry, it wooshed right over my head, carry on!
It's gonna be a fight of who gets to be the toilet vs. toilet paper, but somebody has to win the game. I'll consider it a reasonably (pun intended) bearable year if we can keep the Axe.
In your case, it seems the pay the GSI's received, the tuition you paid and the investment the citizens of CA made in your education had no net payout, that's self evident.
Add to that huge numbers of out of state and international students, and yeah, it's truly perplexing we still call them ""public state schools""
Trust me, I learned a lot in my time here, namely that the goal of Cal is to develop our lives holistically - not just academically. GSIs and athletics work towards the same goal. Cal is not the same without either. You need both, and more, to make this university great."
I don’t care about your schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14wu4qc/i_dont_care_about_your_schedule/,2023-07-11 08:16:29,"That’s all, have a wonderful day","Obviously you did posted your freshman schedules. 🙄😉
Hmmm...I, too, can admit to some annoyance when I see just a class schedule screen shot and no context...but it is also someone trying to reach out and get some advice in what can be a large and bewildering community, especially if you're newly arrived and haven't yet met anyone in person. It's not sh-tposting, in most cases. And we can just scroll past if we don't have anything to say. I give most of these posts a sympathetic pass because at least it's directly Cal-related.

And, god knows, most Cal students would benefit from someone giving them some objective advice and the University doesn't really have the means to provide it on a case by case basis.

That said, maybe people posting schedules might also briefly include the underlying questions they're wondering about--like *is this too many units,* or *should I be taking these two particular classes in the same semester,* or *what stands out as red flags here?*  Just a thought.

Don’t know where to start as transfer student,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cwu05e/dont_know_where_to_start_as_transfer_student/,2024-05-20 16:43:33,"Hello everyone,
I’m a recently accepted transfer student at Cal and I already accepted my offer to Cal. I just don’t know where to begin because there are so many resources and I have so many questions and I don’t know where to even begin. more specifically I have have questions about my financial aid and I want to seek academic counseling that can help walk me through everything. I tried scheduling a meeting with a counselor but he was no help and was so vague with everything and gave me attitude over zoom. Is it better if I go in person to Cal and try to get help there, or what do you guys recommend. also, I missed Cal Orientation so I’m pretty behind on everything.","You’ll start GBA Advising in June, so that should answer some of your questions.
make a list of all your questions and next steps to take

try other counselors from the Transfer Student Center
https://transfers.berkeley.edu/appointments

this seems helpful, maybe take the Transition Course
https://transfers.berkeley.edu/
https://transfers.berkeley.edu/transitioncourse

on campus is also a good idea
100 César E. Chávez Student Center

hope this helps! welcome to berkeley 🐻
also the calcentral dashboard can be very helpful for telling you what you need to fill out or requirements you have to take
Feel free to message me anytime if you have general questions about financial aid or being a transfer. I'm also a transfer.
The transfer student center was the first place I contacted when I accepted my offer (I was also a spring transfer so I had a lot of time to organize myself before I started). If you have the option to go in person, I would recommend it! Also, depending on your major, your academic advisor should be able to point you in the right direction, answer questions and generally get you situated. GBO is fun and helpful as well, so please make sure to attend as much as you can (I think it’s the end of August). You’ll also start to get more information about orientation through calcentral/bcourses.
I know it seems very daunting and overwhelming, but you’ve got this! Everybody at Berkeley wants you to succeed, so I can understand how the availability of resources might seem complex considering all the questions you’ve got floating around.
I agree with everything bvbyangelina said! Great advice! I didn’t find my appointment with an L&S advisor particularly helpful either, when I started. If you’re in the area, drop by the Transfer Center since I have always found them to be super friendly and helpful. Their summer hours are from 10-4.

I took the transfer transition course and it really helped in introducing me to the resources on campus that I should use. I took it with Lucy (Lucille), and she was amazing! 

There’s also resources you can use for academic advising of you are EOP or reentry.

I’m not sure which Cal Orientation you’re referring to (Golden Bear Welcome? Cal Day?). Either way, you’ll have Golden Bear Orientation in mid-August that will introduce you to the campus. There are some parts you will have to attend, and some that are optional, but the more you do the more you will familiarize yourself with the campus. 

Congrats on your acceptance!"

It’s almost impossible to get your scooter back after stealing, even if you have a AirTag in it.

If you contact UCPD Berkeley, they gonna say they will reach out to youlater, since they have high priority tasks. If you see your scooter is in Oakland right now (due to the AirTag) and thus contact Oakland Police, they will ask you for a report,which need to be made by UCPD Berkeley. If you finally call 911, they gonna ask your location and thus forward the call back the UCPD, go back the infinite circle, talking to thesame guy. ⭕️

A real experience of what I observed tonight. The second weekof this poor guy as a new Berkeley student, lost a $500 🛴 at student Union parking space. The scooter now located at Sycamore Street , Oakland.

🙏","Shoulda grabbed his bag of tolls and ran.
Register your bike or scooter with ucpd

This guy is why god invented baseball bats. Put down the camera, get a couple of people together, and kick this shit eating meth head to the curb.
r/donthelpjustfilm
Just sucker punch him from behind. And he’ll be knocked out for a minute. Dump his equipment far away.
Once upon a time… people would not take out their cell phones, instead they’d simply kick the living crap out of losers like this. These criminals know you’re all a bunch of cream puffs, so you need to start fighting back, or at least start making it known to admin that you’re fed up. UCB is known for its protests, so why don’t you protest against crime?
He lost his keys !
What a lovely city Berkeley has become
Just steal it back tonight.
Remember. Don’t report it to the police because this person may be harmed by them.

Around what time was this happening? I feel like they wouldn't do this middle of the day by Dwenelle Mon - Thurs
He looks like he’s in relatively nice clothes and work boots, and he has a nice bag of tools. Is there any chance this isn’t theft?

I mean, I wouldn’t be shocked at all of it was
Call UCPD at 510-642-6760 if you witness a crime on campus or university property. 911 if it’s an emergency.
*Is anyone else upset about his lack of PPE?*

Hit him in the head with a bike lock. That's the Berkeley way, is it not?

Also, irony points = 10,000
If you set a precedent by kicking their ass to the curb, they'll definitely stop showing up.
UCB is known for its protests so why don’t you go beat up a methhead holding a running buzz saw ????
uh... in Berkeley? I don't vigilantism has ever been a thing here. I feel like Chicago/nyc... maybe in LA they'd run them over. but in SF unless they steal your house rarely is it worth risking death to someone or death to yourself to intervene.
I like that idea. The problem is that, despite the fact that Alameda County does not prosecute/provide consequences for criminals like this, they probably would be more than willing to criminally charge some average Joe who intervenes against crime if the criminal gets hurt. Classic California: criminals can do whatever they want, honest folks get penalized over any little thing.
Hate to tell you but thieves using portable angle grinders to steal bikes and/or scooters are *everywhere*. It's not a Berkeley thing.
Um. No. There's no chance at all. It's a guy stealing. Portable angle grinders are what bike and scooter thieves use these days to zip through u-locks. I hate bike thieves.
Agree, he might be just doing his scooter recycling job. Or maybe he’s a scooter repo guy
But they are busy often, have the high priority task, as I mentioned in the comments. It needs some luck to have someone available immediately

Try that in a small town

Berkeley is full of liberal cowards. When I was there in the early 90s this POS woulda got fucked up hard.
Lol, i don’t know why people are mad I asked a question. I realize these are common tactics by thieves and acknowledged I wouldn’t be at all surprised if this is theft. I merely asked a question.
Again, I wouldn’t be surprised at all if this is a thief.  But if you lose your keys to your own rig, you would be doing what this guy is doing or calling the police or Cal maintenance to be doing what this guy is doing.

The idea of a scooter repo guy is funny though lol
Did you take this video? 

Man id love to set up some bait and call in someone brandishing a gun and hand saw.
and if he does ur gonna miss a limb
It happens everywhere.
Liberal cowards!
Cities have no sense of morale it’s insane actually.
I'm not mad. I just know my bike thieves. I'm informing you.
My friend took the video and shared with me
Everywhere, as in, Oakland and Richmond and every city near Berkeley.

No..it doesn't.
Well if people keep stealing scooters, no wonder morale is down!
PS: I didn't downvote you. I get downvoted all the time for people misunderstanding my intent in a post. I brush it off. I know what you're saying. There's a very slim chance that this guy lost his key and just happened to have a cordless angle grinder. They're expensive by the way. Not in your average college student's gear bag.
Every decently sized city has bike thieves. And they've been using battery powered angle grinders since those devices were available.
Agreed. I've been on both coasts and there's always thieves of every type everywhere. Scooter thieves are common in DC."

Many students scream and yell in the residential areas.  Thus many residents are not well disposed toward students.  

One time though in beginning of the semester, a young girl was screaming, and fortunately enough of us knew it was legit and ran out, and indeed she was a victim of a robbery
and an attempted kidnapping.  We waited with her until the police came.  Since that time, many girls have become more boisterous and like to scream in the residential areas, so you cannot tell anymore.  They have low awareness or just DGAF about residents sleeping at 10PM to 4AM.

this is exactly why I made this post!! i hear girls screaming and many times I ended up going OUTSIDE in the middle of the night because I thought someone needed help and they were just waiting on an Uber drinking lol

I don't think being drunk at work is functional.
Friday and Saturday night are not school nights.
cope
We're all just getting by, any way we can. Judge not, lest you be judged and all that. And, definitionally, if you're able to go to work and function after drinking, you are being 'functional', if not particularly healthy. 

The real kicker comes when you're too hungover to go to work, so instead, you let yourself spiral into not going to work or class for days, weeks, months, and just spend your days hating yourself, until you eventually buck up and go fix your life again for the umpteenth time, knowing full well that you'll make the exact same mistake three to four months from now.
It’s not. But alcohol is so entrenched in western culture, and even more so in college towns. People who need alcohol to get by don’t want to be reminded they may substance abuse problem.
People still deserve to be able to sleep without having to be woken up by someone screeching at the top of the lungs.
No, but they’re nights when people want to go to sleep.
yes, to be more explicit, I don’t think someone having time off gives them the right (or at least, it’s very rude?) to disrupt OP
Yes but they might be work nights or other obligations that require sleep. Not to mention what other people have pointed out: people just deserve sleep, they don’t need to have a reason.

Yes you freaking do. This is the hairy part of the semester, don’t let it overwhelm you. Ask questions, go to office hours, and take good care of yourself. You worked hard to get here, give yourself a chance.
I used to feel this way about everywhere I went but then I realized these were messages my mom instilled in my when I was a kid. 

Think about if this is a pattern for you, if you feel this the most when xyz happens, or if you don’t get a need fulfilled. 

Because you do belong here. You belong everywhere you go.

I don’t care if it hurts
If you are in that much distress, look into getting a transfer or taking a break.
You don’t have to feel belonged at Cal. If you find a sense of belonging at your home, that’s good enough. I believe that not many people feel belonged here either. You are not alone. Good things takes time. I hope you feel better over time."
Berkeley students don’t have an equitable access to fitness resources relative to their cost of attendance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1b0ve54/berkeley_students_dont_have_an_equitable_access/,2024-02-26 14:48:02,Congestion. Access. Quality of resources. All fundamental aspects to health equity or physical and mental fitness equity. How does cal compare to other UC’s? How about other public university’s nationwide?,"You might be right but you have to realise that a lot of colleges have all these shiny new rock climbing walls (which we just got one), peloton bikes, saunas, lazy rivers, etc because they need to lure in students. 

Berkeley’s reputation makes it not necessary for the school to care too much about luring students through amenities the way no name state school might. 

Now if u compare us to UCLA fair enough but it’s not like their facilities aren’t crowded asf either
Berkeley has so much to offer. Please don't limit yourself to RSF.
Berkeley is also one of the best places in the US for indoor rock climbing. It's not campus affiliated but it is notable. There are at least 6 indoor gyms accessible within 30 minutes of public transit and a number of outdoor spots too.
This has been a point of some disappointment for me. I've had rec access at two other big, public schools (UT Austin and Nebraska) and both were much better in terms of amount of space, hours, equipment, and classes.


Both Texas and Nebraska go maybe a little too hard on their athletics programs (seriously, folks get pretty wild). Prolly some of that energy and money spills into student gyms. But the UT gym is one of the main things I miss about Texas.
too much work. no time to workout 😭
I’ve been beating this drum for years.

All the protests for things the admin literally can’t affect change in (international events) and bupkis for real local services. We need 4 RSFs.
All UC resources are crowded, stipulated.  As a public school we have almost 3X the students in 1/8 the acreage of Stanford.  The politicians think all kids in the state need to get an education, but nobody like paying for it.  So you are packed in like Sardines.  By the way, this is not news since the days of Gov. Ronald Reagan.  Google some history of his war on UC.

First, the most pragmatic answer is what mom used to tell you: ""Go outside and play"".  This is CA, the weather is great.  It's why people stay here in spite of the crowding (and house prices).  The local parks (not PP) have PAR courses and trails.  Get a bike, ride it, join a club, have an outing.  There's the Berkeley Y: join it.  The bay is right there: join a student sailing club, it's not expensive.  Local beaches are cold, so hop on the shuttle bus to UCSC.

Rant:  What is frustrating is the real lack of local corporate support, especially from our local tech giants.  They are all happy to hire our grads, and most of the time they enjoy premium salaries.  They do fund R&D at the school.  But you could hear a pin drop when it comes to infrastructure support. That's all left to individual donors.  We are about to open a new student center in engineering thanks to a challenge grant from an anonymous alum.  So things do happen, but the amount of money is a few drops, especially when you consider what our grads have done for ""headquarters tech"" aka the SF Bay / Silicon Valley area...what their market values are...am I right?  Like: we deserve and need to expand the campus by at least 200%, reference figures above.  That means a ton of money.  Time for our local tech behemoths to step up.

Exactly. It’s crappy schools that sell their college like a fitness club. Just go to the RSF if you want to go, what is your problem?
But we are paying for rsf in our tuition and fees
Of course not. But tuition is a product. And if you look at typical facilities at places like Cal you’ll see the inequity here.
The question shouldn’t consider private facilities, as it aims to identify a potential disparity between institutional resources (paid for by students) and cost of attendance.
I agree!
you'll jump at any chance to slither in with some zionist propaganda huh
we pay plenty for it. it's not because the state won't give janet napolitano a million dollar raise that the students suffer, it's because she and her cronies have 7 figure salaries, to do nothing but make the system worse, in the first place. lecturers get 1% of their students' credit hours cost in salary, i sure do wonder where the other 99% is ending up!!
Imagine if snoo gets ripped!
[deleted]
Inequity among who? Compared just to other colleges?

Cal was the place in my life where I had the absolute most access to fitness equipment, classes, recreational activities. There are so many clubs and groups with access to great facilities and equipment. The campus backs right up to open space and a number of amazing parks for hiking and biking. The Bay is extremely close to campus and Cal Sailing Club has boats and lessons available to students to get you out there for very cheap. The Cal Ski & Snowboard Club regularly organizes cheap trips to Tahoe. Lair of the Bear and Forestry Camp will get you into the Sierras.

Cal has incredible local, state, and even national parks within a 50 mile radius. There are so many groups and people interested in outdoor recreation, just by virtue of being in the Bay Area and in Berkeley in particular.

Cal has incredible facilities as long as you like it outside and don't think an ultra-modern on-campus gym facility is the be all and end all of fitness.
Sure, outdoors and rsf wall are free.
🤣

Trying to lift homie
""We"" as in someone from the C-suite or BOD at one of the local megatechs?  Did I miss your publicity announcement?  And if so, amazing career trajectory '18 dude...but somehow I doubt it.  Because a few 7 figure salaries are not the issue.  I'd pay 10x that if they were leveraging the local SF Bay area megatech to cough up some serious bucks. Charity typically comes with all sorts of terms and conditions.  Having charity spent the way you want is not a major issue...but you do have to put up or shut up.  That giving typically only happens when you gently guilt rich people, remind them who helped get them rich.  That's the technique, and it takes real skill not to offend.
Why
Inequity among students who live and work around campus. Amongst people who inhabit the campus vicinity, and rely on resources in close proximity. Sailing is an awesome hobby and sport, but not a fundamental form of exercise/fitness. It’s also miles from campus and not a convenient, routine oriented activity. I mean after all, we have the rsf for a reason.
no, we as in the students that pay 50k a year for tuition you fucking goober. glad you could suck the admins off though :) glad you could speed right past the fact that only a percent of the tuition students pay towards a class go to the actual lecturer. but glad to hear your a 70 millionaire, makes sense why you're showing out for your admin parasite buddies--you give real yuppie liberal landlord energy. there's a reason uc's been getting slammed by strikes. point is, funneling 2, 3, 5, 10x more cash into the system for the admin to gobble up doesn't solve the the problem of the admin's exploitatiom.
[deleted]
What I'm saying is that at Cal, I had access to all these rich people hobbies like sailing and skiing for cheap. And those groups felt very inviting and inclusive instead of how it is in the adult world. It felt very equitable in that everyone had an opportunity to seek out new passions and skills. 

Berkeley is a place to think outside the box. Challenge yourself, find new interests, explore. If you're after convenient, routine activities, maybe you're in the wrong place. Nothing worth doing is easy.
Tuition is not $50k per year '18.  If you're in-state it's $6.2k, and for non-residents it's $22k.  Reference is here:  https://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/tuition-fees/fee-schedule/. That's the #1 education for slightly under the national average of $27k.  Just to set the record (metrics) straight.

Since you keep mentioning lecturer, I assume you're trying to hack it as a professional grad student.  As EECS at some point you gotta just get a real job at one of the megatechs.  If you're as good as you clearly think you are, they will not only give you time off to take classes they will pay your regular salary and tuition at Stanford to get your Masters.  It's called the Honors Cooperative Program. That's what I did almost 50 years ago.  Really great employers extend the deal through PhD with full sabbaticals and a management job at the end.  I was not that good.  Stop whining and go grab that ring. UC doesn't have that deal, really really stupid. Good luck to you.
Burpees and pull ups literally target every muscle group what are you talking about ….
weightlifting equipment, treadmills, rowing machines, etc., are fitness resources that are fundamentally different from hobbies like sailing and rock climbing.

Ask yourself: why do institutions invest in state of the art gym/athletic facilities in the first place? 
- Because gyms offer fundamental resources for achieving good exercise and health.

Not only should Berkeley provide their students with these resources but they should provide them with state of the art ones. They should do this simply because they are worth the investment. Their brains are elite and so should be their health equity.
You have access to weights, treadmills, and rowing machines. But the RSF is dated and crowded.  The athletes have state of the art facilities located at Memorial Stadium. The athletes are elite in their discipline so they should have nice facilities. The university should probably build another gym as part of a housing development near campus. Maybe you can make enough money to donate to make that happen.
Sounds like we’re saying the same things! There are barely 2 gyms between 30,000+ students. Also, I’m an athlete, but I don’t compete for Cal because they don’t have teams that compete in my fields. Should that negate my athletic potential? How about the thousands of other undergrad and post-grad athletes, triathletes, or even just gym enthusiasts? The high performance center is high performance for a reason; The effectivity of high performance equipment is axiomatically superior, which is why every competitive institution with a reputation like Berkeley’s provides these facilities for their student bodies. I’ve personally trained at several Ivy’s, UVA, UT, and University of Washington..Cal’s fitness resources are insufficient, and it should affect the schools reputation.
Maybe you should do something about it then. Fundraise, campaign, contact someone who matters instead of just complaining on Reddit.
This is an effective part of campaigning darlin’

I’ve been thinking of taking a semester off. I know we’re right in the middle of the fall semester but I just can’t do this right now. 

Has anyone had any experience taking a semester off to get better? 

Or maybe even a reduced course load?

Idk what I’ll do but I need a break so bad","I took a gap semester in college and it changed my academic trajectory completely. Up to then I was only following the “next thing”: get to a good high school, get good extracurriculars, do well on the sat, choose a good major, apply to the best clubs, etc. I had never stopped to breathe and consider what I really wanted to do. 

I used that time to travel a bit, reset, build back some good habits that I lost when I was too busy because of college, and set up the plan for the next few years. I ended up being accepted for my phd here, and I don’t think I would have been if I had just continued to do “the next thing” as I had been doing for years.

same as well but just trying to push thru, rly want to get out this school now asap
Taking time off won’t necessarily fix any of those problems.
You definitely can depending on the college. Go and talk to your college advisors and tell them you're struggling right now. There might be a way for you to late withdraw for this semester and readmit whenever you're ready to come back.
HealthyGamerGg on YouTube will help
If you're cool with it, im down to dm and possibly give some advice for how to tackle this sem. For future semesters, I definitely cant give advice but I think you should be able to take the next one off.

Feeling useless since I don’t have an internship this summer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rsdwg8/feeling_useless_since_i_dont_have_an_internship/,2021-12-30 14:19:58,"Am I basically a deadbeat if I don’t have an internship offer yet for next summer? I see everyone around me getting prestigious offers left and right that are paying them 30-40k over the summer, yet I don’t have anything yet. It would be so nice to make so much money from an internship. Being EECS without an internship sucks.","Only the people with internships are posting about internships. Lots of people, including me, still don’t have one secured
Just keep applying, it took me 374 applications before I got an offer.
Also feels like you’re a freshmen. Internships are mostly for upper class man so don’t feel bad but always shoot high!
You’d have to be at $83/hr to earn $40K.  There are only a couple of consulting places in the whole country that offer that much.  Typical FAANG or unicorn or top level Silicon Valley companies will be closer to $25-30K ($50-60/hr) and most of them require you to be a junior.  The average CS internship is more closer to $15K for the summer, around $30-35 an hour.

There are still many of them out there that you can apply to.  You just gotta keep plugging away and eventually you’ll land something.
Dude. I'm a junior who does't have an internship yet and I'm applying for my first one rn. You're not alone.
graduated many years ago but I remember receiving offers in March for internships I applied to in January. I’ve had friends apply to internships in April and start as soon as school ended in May. Don’t stop until the summer starts.
average berkeley student
Nobody is getting paid 40k for a summer internship that’s $83/hr for a full time 12 week internship lol. I don’t even see people getting paid half that realistically so If you’re beating yourself up over money don’t lol. No company is going to pay an intern more than 50 an hour lol that’s unrealistic to expect or extremely rare. Plus the internships are for getting a foot in the door not the pay tbh.
I would chill if I were u lol
I didn’t get my internship last year until march and didn’t even start applying until January, so don’t worry about it!
1) Don't stress too much.  Internships are great, but not getting one (especially if you are a 1st or 2nd year) isn't the end of the world.  Everyone is on their own path.

2) Have you gotten another pair of eyes on your application materials?  Talk to friends and take advantage of campus resources https://career.berkeley.edu/Tools/Resume

3) Keep applying, while a lot of the internships are probably wrapping up their process, it isn't unheard of for random ones to pop up throughout this semester.

4) Take a portfolio approach.  Keep working on getting an internship, but figure out what you are going to do if it doesn't happen.  Can you get experience as part of an open source project? Can you volunteer somewhere?  Any campus opportunities you can be a part of?
Lol, at least you work/study in a field that could pay that much to students. Some of us L&S folks make <$30k or <$35k annual salaries... 🙃
feeling exactly same
I got my internship for summer 2021 at the end of May, so you still have time! Keep applying!
You have so much time still. I got my freshman and sophomore internship offers in February March.
Don't worry when you get into the real world you can get hundreds of rejections from companies that don't want to hire you. It may take months of applying. It doesn't make you any less of a person
you weirdos need to chill the fuck out and have some perspective. feeling useless as an EECS student and freaking berkeley bc you don't have an internship... some people are actually struggling out there
Interns are being paid $30k each summer ?
If all else fails you might try to be a UGSI for summer school. It doesn’t pay much, but teaching is great experience.
Keep applying. USRA haven't put up their summer listings yet, and I am sure other companies still have them up. Don't give up when it's not over yet.
get yourself on linkedin- and grow your network!
bruh i work at a summer camp in the summers fuck internships 🤣
My first semester of classes at CAL is this spring and in a few weeks, should I have been applying for internships already??
We r supposed to be getting internships for the summer already????
God loves you, internship or no internship. First seek His kingdom then everything else will follow.
no
lol i didn't get my freshman year internship until finals week spring.
How do you find this many companies to apply to?
only 374? i def topped out over 500
Thanks, needed to hear this!
To add onto this, it’s still 2021. Some people (at companies) don’t even put in intern reqs until the new year after budgeting and the holidays are over.

I feel like companies advertise earlier and earlier just because the game theory (scooping up prospects before competition) and capitalizing on student FOMO/insecurity. 

The same way students wait to do assignments until the last minute, those same people go on to do last minute intern paperwork.
the CS people making that much all go to quant firms, they give comps near that as well as like $10k signing bonus or whatever it's insane
Amazon (and rest of FAANG) and Linkedin I know pay 50$/hour (+substantial stipend) which makes it 30k/summer. Quant pays more - I know people with 60k a summer. But ofc there isn't reason to compare in that way.
Maybe they included signing bonuses/housing stipends? Even without negotiations that sounds like quite reasonable to me (my summer internship is over 40k before any bonuses/stipends so it is completely possible), but definitely agree with you on the last part. OP really shouldn’t be considering TC as much as how much they’d like to return there fulltime.
A lot do pay that much, according to this: https://www.levels.fyi/internships/
To say that “no one” is being paid this much is wrong. I know a fair number of people (including myself) that are being paid well over 50k this summer
Many companies, especially for UI/UX and project/product management jobs, like to look for English majors.  Those jobs can easily start at $80/100K a year especially in the Silicon Valley area.
High paying companies generally pay 50+/hr and give a housing stipend.

Checkout Amazon for example.
https://www.levels.fyi/internships/Amazon/Software-Engineer-Intern/
It's closer to 20-40k tbh
Summer internships typically start advertising in August, but companies do post them year-round.
I personally just chilled last summer, started applying this year and got an offer for next summer. Currently a sophomore. Ultimately I'd say junior year is where you 100% want an internship, sophomore/freshman summer you can decide whether you want to go for it.

To note (assuming you're in CS), what I've heard is that a degree with decent grades from Berkeley will land you a job for sure even with zero internships over 4 years. Maybe not a FAANG/quant job, but still a decent paying SWE position.
I’m in the same boat. My first semester at cal is this spring
Linkedin, Indeed, Handshake. Set up automatic alerts every day for swe/data interns on Linkedin and Indeed, apply to anything new you see, and note down your application on a spreadsheet every time you apply in splitscreen mode. Listen to something in the background tho, the copy pasting gets boring.

I was on track for 500 by mid-October, but I got the offer and lost motivation.

Alternatively, look at this site ([https://www.levels.fyi/internships/](https://www.levels.fyi/internships/)) and go down the list. You'll only get to $30/hr at the 500th company. You may need to look the companies up on Linkedin/Indeed/Handshake cuz the links are kinda off, but the list bottoms out at 1000.
Look up “CS summer internship GitHub” on Google
I strongly agree with this. Pre-new year internship offers are designed for talent poaching.
Where are u interning out of curiosity
I see… seems like that’s for more SWE side Internships. Well that’s good that SWE interns get paid well but honestly again, pay shouldn’t be your main focus for an internship it really should be to see whether you like the company and for full time opportunities later. Don’t know what year you are but honestly just stop comparing yourself to other people and you’ll be happier
Technical writing too!
Thanks, I know I've read that before, but I didn't really feel confident enough to apply to jobs like that. I had terrible results when I was applying to new grad jobs in general earlier this year.

I'll definitely apply for project management jobs after my upcoming AmeriCorps term ends next year.
65$ an hour? In sf for an internship position? Am I hallucinating? That’s fire
Housing should never be included in a salary lol remote is way better. But yeah the pay bands are typically 40-50 for faang, 50-70 for unicorns, and 80+ for quant
I’m glad I’m not in the same boat cause I’m hoping to meet more spring start students at GBO, makes it feel less alone yknow
keep ur head up homie the cs club at upitt has a list of internships – go through & apply to as many as u can https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships
[deleted]
Yep! A number of times I’ve had good internship positions available but students had already agreed to another company months prior, despite the new one being a better fit.
A small hedge fund that most people probably haven’t heard of haha

It's not important as I wasn't tryna flex or anything, just pointing out that saying ""Nobody"" is false since ik tons of people who are getting paid more than I am as well as me personally to add credibility.
Thanks, I will think about applying to jobs like that when my AmeriCorps term ends next year! I'm hoping to finish a technical writing cert I started but never really got into, as well as the Google PM and UX certs.
https://www.levels.fyi/internships/

The highest ones are for software engineers and quant traders.
A lot of the really high paying ones are NYC since they're almost all finance related, but yep some do hire in SF
Amazon paid housing stipend even for remote.
I literally didn't have enough experience to tailor lol.

Also, I didn't trust my writing skills enough to write cover letters cuz bad ones will hurt me.
sike
and the biggest cap award goes to...
Hells ya, good luck! I am heavily involved in one of those fields and it is so rewarding!
Damn they treated yall interns well during the pandemic. Are they still doing remote this year?
I have no experience either. I’ve been an athlete my whole life. I took my Hs cashier job, athlete position, and looked at the skills the jobs required. Say the job says collaboration skills. I then would say I collaborated with coaches and teammates to ensure success to reach goal of winning pac-12’s. Like it’s just all about bullshitting.

Anyone have information or experience from this? I’m just a bit anxious rn. Sorry.,"you’ll be fine! you won’t get kicked out and you won’t get a late fee, you can pay it later it will just say DUE NOW on your cal central
I promise you’re fine and nothing will happen
if you’re anxious about it take out an emergency loan which u pay pack after 2-3 months and you’ll get it within 3 days
Thanks very much! I have been stressing over this for a bit now.
no worries! i’ve had a late payment before and i just get a few emails but it’s not serious until it’s not paid for several several months"

Go exercise
Delete everything. Don’t keep anything from them and act as if you will never get back together because then you won’t keep that door open (whether it be true or not), and it can help you move on and heal faster. Don’t worry or stress about “I want to be friends” or “I want to talk to her”, right now you need to heal and that’s priority #1. You’re going to have urges to want to check her stuff, from experience, it’s hard to fight them and you will give in. But think about it this way, every time you check their stuff or ask what they’re up to… you’re going back to square 1 of the healing process. Do these things and you will heal sooner, but it will still take time, so don’t be frustrated and it’s ok to be sad and feel this way even if they’ve moved on sooner than you.
No Date Study Now!!

Do what you can and forgive yourself for what you can't. You won't always be operating at peak efficiency and that's okay. Take the time to feel the feelings that make us human. It's hard to stop doing, but beating yourself up over something that's more or less unavoidable will only make yourself feel worse.
Going to put some of my heart into this one for you, because the exact same thing happened to me and I thought my whole world was over. I worked so hard to make it to Cal, I was a first generation Physics college student supporting themselves financially 6 hours away from home. My partner at the time decided to leave when I was halfway during my first semester and left me paying rent on my own at an apartment which costed $2500. I sought help, resources at CAL, but in all honesty in this world no one can really help you other than yourself. I kept myself focused stayed positive focused on eating healthy food and kept pushing forward.  


2 years later I have graduated and have a beautiful wife and child and life is good. Just know sometimes things happen for a reason. Never stop believing in your dream and your purpose. You will be ok. Go Bears!
stop  dating around and focus on your studies
 I would also suggest CAPS -- they helped me though some difficult times
Unfortunately you somehow have to find motivation within you
It hurts. But life must go on. 

Don’t let a small speed bump derail your whole life. In the grand scheme of things and when you look back it will be just another fond memory. Don’t let it turn into a regret
Thank you ❤️ yeah I just don’t know where to go from here. I left a midterm today completely blank because I could not focus and didn’t have the energy to study. This person was my best friend for about 5-6 years and partner for almost 2 so it really hurts to have them missing. I know everything will be okay, but I’m hurting right now for sure
You sound like my mom
Dating around? I said I just got out of a very long relationship.. I haven’t been dating..
I don’t have ship tho
My best advice: Hang in there. Focus on your studies, yourself, and your mental health and wellbeing.   


When you feel ready, reach out to some family members and friends that you trust who can provide personal support and help you make sense out of the finer details of the breakup so you can heal from it.  


Cal is a marathon and requires days and nights of intense dedication, preparation, and execution on homework/exams in order to be successful. It's a life changing and  beautiful process, but can be coated in pain. The amount of attention that is necessary for survival can not be understated.  


Its ok to be in pain while the healing process takes place, but you want to try to minimize the damage (including potential academic damage) that may result from being distracted and heartbroken during the break up.   


*The best thing I could have possibly done when this happened to me was refocus and intensify the desire to succeed in my courses.*  


Cal is a life changing opportunity, and doing well and graduating will open up the world in terms of possibilities and opportunities. You made it there for a reason, you owe it to yourself to see your dream through.  
I can almost guarantee that when you focus and live your life's path/purpose (the reason you came to cal), the person that truly makes your life complete will come along and everything will change.

Sending positive and healing vibes!

I hope you’re not implying it’s okay to take someone’s close out right when the time is done or because they’re a couple minutes late. More than 5 okay, but 2 or 1 that’s bullshit.
How about they set their timer to arrive 5 minutes **before** it finishes? It’s a question of who waits up to 5 minutes. I say the person washing their clothes and so it’s freed up ASAP.
That’s fine and I agree with what you said. 

But when life doesn’t work out as planned you have to cut some slack. Lots of reasons why they may come late and the pricks who take the clothes out a minute after the timer goes off are pricks.
Idk, man. As long as they just set it all on top of the machine, I don't see what the problem is.
To me that’s rude, as is not being there to take out your clothes on time. I don’t touch other peoples stuff.
Ok maybe I'm reaching here, but is it possible you're projecting some discomfort you've got with moving people's clothes onto everyone else? Like if no one thought it was appropriate to empty a washer/dryer when it's finished I can see why not being on time to pick up your clothes would be rude. But if most people are cool moving clothes or having their clothes moved, it's not really an issue."

You’ll see a handful of people who take 24+ units a semester, and undoubtedly being able to graduate in 2 to 3 years and save that extra $70-140K is a big motivator.  So being remote may help in that regard.
And the person who reply don't know this fact, don't ever bother to learn about this fact, and don't even give a $#!& about what the fact is...
Oof
It’s not that hard to live off of less than 80k. It’s very easy if you know how to manage your money. Only people who really know how to manage money is low income and rich people because they actually pay attention to it on a daily basis.

Woman in the picture is an ASUC senator who made some bigoted statements, people asked her to address them/apologize for them, she doubled down and didn’t consider her bigotry to be something to apologize for, that’s the story so far
ayeee dude not cool. Attack her misconduct, not her physical appearance.
someone brought up her comments during an asuc meeting and she provided no explanation or apology. she literally said “i said what the fuck i said.”
she doesn't care to listen. she's full of hate and blocks out any attempt to have a meaningful dialogue.
well then she clearly cares then? i’m calling out the fact that she keeps saying she doesn’t care about what redditors have to say.

also, there are people with valid criticisms and concerns, not just people attacking her for things out of her control. yet when people bring up her tweets, all she has to respond with is “i said what the fuck i said” and not providing an actual answer or explanation.
Wow.  She must be on the debate team with that witty retort.
Omg youre literally obsessed. You are under every single threat that has to do with gabby. Not saying I agree with what has been said, but I find it telling that many other senators have done very problematic things and like SV & SA and have said very problematic things. But they did not receive this much heat. I wonder why…
I doubt that she’s full of hate. Why don’t reach out to her privately? This keyboard stuff is unsettling.  I still need to know why you make those comments about jerking someone off while they sleep?  Don’t know people can’t give consent when they are sleeping?
So does that mean you have reached out in a mature non confrontational way?
Thread*
oh okay, well you go ahead and do you boo. and if you know of any other senators saying some foul shit, bring it forward so that we can hold them accountable too.
i dont want to reach out to her privately. my goal is to help boot her bigoted ass from office. she seems to hate mixed people & lgbtq people who aren't in her circle, those both apply to me. so i'm taking it upon myself to see that she no longer speaks for me in student gov. shes also a well known bully

lol did you not read my last post that answered this question? it was a joke, but yes i've instructed my man to jerk me off while i sleep as a way to soothe me

you can give consent beforehand
i personally have not and don't intend to. but a few people have and were met with indifference and contempt. additionally, she said she cancelled her office hours because she was no interested in hearing from people who disagreed.

I would bet that they told her not to hold office hours. Like what good do you think it would do (for her to hold hours)?

She could actually get some perspective on her actions and engage in meaningful dialogue with those she's insulted. Hopefully to try to patch things up and make things right? Plenty of good would come from holding office hours. She's supposed to look out for students and their concerns.
That’s not going to happen. Perhaps some cultural awareness is needed by many people on this sub.

People are stalking her on social media calling her a racist and bigot, yet you think she would engage in an actual productive conversation? Plus both sides would need to be open to listening and based on these threads, her haters (for lack of a better word) aren’t going to come to the table with open ears either.

Outside of you, not one person posted anything helpful in any of these threads. Yet you think these same people are going to engage in a constructive conversation. Hell you yourself isn’t even willing to do so.
If I made a statement that offended people, and a TON of people started calling me a racist bigot.

I’d probably publicly address the issue, try to understand why I upset people, and apologize.
Not double down on my statements
Like I said: cultural awareness. 

And not one person -who has commented on any of her social media- has come with an approach of “can we have a real discussion.” Every single person has been in their feelings, yet everyone of y’all seem surprised that she is doubling down."
Don’t give me omicron,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/r39y5o/dont_give_me_omicron/,2021-11-27 01:22:21,I will be very sad.,"Shame reddit doesn’t let you change your username
It's time to stop relying on other people to keep yourself safe. Medical-grade N95 masks were once scarce, but [are now in plentiful supply](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164576097503?epid=16040943079). Buy some. They block 99.99% of covid particulates, if you fit it snug to your face to prevent leakage, and are quite comfortable for long-term use. This is a better rate of protection than vaccines.

The cloth and surgical masks that people typically use only block 20–80% of particulates. Even if you force everyone around you to triple-up on regular masks, they're still only blocking 50–90% of particulates. You can block 99% with a good mask yourself.

Second, you control the areas you walk in. Learn about air flow. A good model is that covid is like cigarette smoke — the particulates from cigarette smoke are about 100 nanometers, the same size as covid particles. So imagine that everyone around you is smoking. If you would be breathing their smoke, then you could be breathing their covid. If that's the case, go outside, or stand upwind, or open a window and stick a fan in it. If you're in class, sit near an open door, or a window.

It's time to take responsibility for your own health. The government won't save you. The school won't save you. Other people can't help you as much as you can help yourself.

How do you clean these?
Stop spamming this bullshit on every Covid-related post.
Check the posting history.
Yeah. I have a crooked septum and the masks don’t fit my face well, and the exhaled air goes up to my eyes and dries them out
You can disinfect it by baking it in an oven at 140-170°F for 60 minutes. That will kill all the covid, without hurting the mask's filtration.

Do *not* let an N95 mask get wet. Water eliminates the electrostatic charge on the meltblown fabric that filters out the covids. As long as you keep it dry, you can reuse it indefinitely.

But if your mask is just dirty or uncomfortable, buy a new one. They cost about $3 each on ebay. I tend to change masks every 2 weeks or so.
Different masks are different. Would you like to try some of mine? I have a bunch of extra Auras, and like to give them away. DM me if you'd like.

These ones are very plush, and have really nice foam wrapped around a flexible metal wire, that gives you lots of wiggle room. They also are folded in a way that lets you easily talk without disrupting the fit.
Yup they fit me weird too, I have a small face and basically have to hold my mouth completely open for the mask to make a seal, and if I don’t it completely defeats the purpose of the mask.
Just believe in Jesus Christ, he is the ultimate Physician and protection from all harm. Amen 🙏🏼✝️

Thanks bro I'll check them out. Check out this research study I read today :

""[22] And he said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat, nor about your body, what you shall put on.
[23] For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
[24] Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!
[25] And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of life?
[26] If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest?""

Apps to join clubs is wild to me. Didn't need them when I was a student. You just showed up and were in. 

Maybe I didn't try to join anything more exclusive at the time and just found them a nice way to do something other than study.
Let them vent. I'd be pissed too if I wasted my time applying to and interviewing with some lame ass club.
I am a club.  Join me!  We meet never.  Do not ask for letters of recommendation.
I run an algorithmic hedge fund ($30K AUM so quite small for the industry) that trades with a quarter million dollar positions after leverage. We have 60% annualized return, with 5% annualized volatility. We captured 5% last week before leverage (realized). For reference, that’s how much the S&P500 has returned on average after inflation since inception. Over 52X the returns of the index! And that’s not even accounting for risk-adjusted performance, which makes us even more remarkable.

I was rejected from Traders at Berkeley. The kicker is that nobody at Traders even trades. Explain that. Imagine I made a club called Cooks at Berkeley, and none of us cook.

Or you can join a Berkeley City College club.
Do these clubs give a reason why they didn’t accept one over the other?
also probably one of the reasons they choose this school lol
Depends on the club Lols. Just like a frat.
Maybe they didn’t feel compatible with you.  You’re pretty intense and they could’ve been more hobbyists.
Might be more or a rookie club, or a club for people who need the expirence/internships. If you already basically have this then you'll be fine in the job market. 99% of students don't run hedgefunds and need the leg up in the race.
Bro what?

Clubs got me my job(s) in Aerospace and Automotive Engineering and have helped me get into fairly prestigious labs (I don't like Doxxing myself so I'll just say it has to do with Fusion) more than my degree did.

Don't join clubs that require applications, absolutely, but those that have an intro project or open admission and give you real ways to show that you're willing to prove yourself are absolutely valuable.

This school now has - what - nearly 50,000 students? There are tons of clubs that if they weren't as selective with people would be completely inundated with people and borderline impossible to function. Hell, a leadership/eXeC role on just one of the technical clubs is a ton of work when there's 40 people you have to manage, let alone the brief time when it was pushing 80.

Didn't get in to a club you wanted, fuck it dog, take initiative, Berkeley is one of the startup capitals of the world, start your own club. If it's successful, that looks even better than just being on one.

Sorry, rant over. Clubs that are assholes and exclusive for the sake of it are dumb, but for those looking to make the most of their time in University, join a club, start a club, whatever.
I’ve worked in the tech sector for decades and never made a hiring decision based on the club someone was in.
Agree 100%. I have hired a ton of software engineers and never have looked at which club a candidate was part off.
💀
No, does a job give a reason? Just comes down to application, interview and social skills, and connections. Usually not personal
Don’t underestimate yourself that got the job.  The degree and probably these clubs (maybe) got you the interview, but what got you the job is YOU. 

Reality check; Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, and whatnot Grads are a dime a dozen, not including people that are equally as talented than you - didn’t go to a ranked school or/and even didn’t go to school. Those accomplishments that you gained DOES matter, but at the end of the day, it is YOU that needs to showcase not only your abilities and be able to fit culturally in 7 interviews or less.
[deleted]
That’s not exactly how it works. Being in the clubs get you opportunities to pad your resume. Consulting for companies, working on projects for companies, some of the clients might be impressed and want to hire you directly, etc
Usually it doesn’t get personal, but it can. Following proper corporation HR guidelines will prevent any possibilities of discrimination. If they are not following proper protocols, documentation and records, they are up for possible uncomfortable discussions.
:( #rood
Volunteering at the food bank also gives you a way to pad your resume. Seriously, data sciences is a hot major and if a club helps place you into a summer internship that lets you prove your value, that’s great. But a Berkeley data sciences grad will find a job. 
I agree with the person who said that if you don’t get into a data sciences club, start your own and drive it to success.
I'd hire someone who volunteered with a food bank over someone who made CS/DS their whole life and personality without anything to indicate it was anything but all consuming with no greater outlet. 

Those people aren't fun to work with and are often difficult to coach because they think they know everything because it's been their lives for 18 hours a day for the last 3-5 years.

Though someone who founded or ended up in senior leadership in a tech focused club would definitely get my interest because that shows social skills and initiative. It's about the balance.
The important part is the employer wants to hire someone who can do the job. As a bonus, be  highly motivated and a proven achiever. If your major is in a technical field such as data analytics, don’t just call a food bank. Call the California Association of Food Banks in Oakland and propose an automated system that can help all the food banks in California manage the flow of produce more efficiently.  Most non-profits cannot afford a sophisticated state of the art system to manage their work and they’d likely welcome an ambitious Berkeley expert who will help them at no charge.
If you look into it and realize you need three more people to develop the system… START A FRICKIN CLUB!  Right? 
As a Cal alum and employee of a multibillion dollar tech company, I’ve wandered the booths of the student groups this Fall and they nearly all purport to be business strategy teams who work with Fortune 500 companies.  TBH, I can’t imagine what the university students are going to tell us that will change our company’s strategic plans.  Maybe they do, but it seems a bit fanciful to me, that’s all.
Agreed on all fronts. 

Cal grads are often among the best and brightest, but I also deal with very bright people who come from far humbler schools that are just as talented as any top flight Berkeley student. One issue I've had with young people from prestigious programs is arrogance and an unflappable belief they can change the world if they just wish hard enough. I'm guilty of this myself in my younger days. 

I like the gumption but sometimes there's moments of: ""You really didn't think we hadn't thought of that? Good for you for doing your homework, but you're about a quarter or two too late."" I'm going into my eighth year of my second career in tech, and only now am I really hitting the bricks hard for initiatives and architecture. I'm not going to gatekeep, and I'll definitely mentor bright kids, but there's a world of experience and context you can only get being in the trenches and you're going to get a lot more trenches doing what you suggested -- starting your own club and doing real projects, not riding coattails."

I don’t like my major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pj9p4e/i_dont_like_my_major/,2021-09-06 15:07:31,"2nd year econ here. I will be done with the prereqs this semester and was going to apply/declare the major. But after taking upper divs, I’m having second thoughts.

When I first came here my number one major was business. But I soon learned it’s hard to get in and now I don’t even meet the requirements to apply.

Econ was second on my list. So I changed my course plan and was okay with it. But the thing is, I barely passed the stat requirement so now everything depends on the three prerequisites I am taking this semester. And I’m not confident I will meet the gpa requirement. Even then I’m losing interest in economics more and more as days go by.

Polecon was third on my list. I looked at the course guide and syllabus. It doesn’t look that different from econ. I will be cautious here, but potentially worse bc of more reading and writing, which I try to avoid as much as possible.

My plan was to work in finance with a business degree initially, then econ, and now everything is full of question marks. My parents would stop paying tuition if I were to major in so-called “useless majors”. And I don’t blame them. Because I wouldn’t do it either. Perhaps I shouldn’t have gone to college. Frankly, every day in Berkeley has been a struggle for me, and not a meaningful one. Thankfully it isn’t too late. I might need more time thinking about this very seriously.","i honestly think the problem is with your mindset. this entire post everyone has been trying to give you advice, and you've been dismissing all of it.

'no harm in applying for haas' -> ""i wont get in""; 'econ/business are basically the same, and have the same job prospects' -> you criticize how business frats are overrated; 'declare econ' -> ""im struggling with meeting the gpa requirement"". someone tells you to book an appt with career services and you jump on the one line that you can disagree with. 

if you have that mindset, where everything valid you instantly criticize, then yeah, you are going to be lost.

instead of 'i wont get in', you need to think 'i might not get in, but at least ill have tried'. instead of 'business frats are overrated', maybe you actually try and get in one and decide for yourself the benefits - and looking at the stacked linkedins of the kids in these frats, obviously they have *some* benefit. instead of 'i have zero things on my resume' and having that be an impasse, think 'i have zero things on my resume right now, but how can i add some things'? (non URAP research, joining non-application clubs like habitat for humanity, etc)

tl;dr: if you're going to reject everyone's advice and wallow in self-pity, then yeah, things are going to be tough lol
Highly recommend booking an appointment with the career counseling library or career center to find out what options you have - remember that major doesn’t mean nearly as much as you think it does :)
If you’re a sophomore and you’re intending on majoring in economics, you could easily apply for haas  this fall and take UGBA 10 in the spring. Not quite sure how you don’t have the other pre-reqs done (or in progress)
I’m currently in haas and I truly don’t love my school choice and major. Like you, I heard how Haas was “so amazing” and went for it because I wanted to prove to myself and my peers that I was capable. I intend to go to grad school for a completely different field not offered at cal, but that’s okay because despite this, we have so much time to learn and grow from our experiences here, that it makes these four years worth it. Most people don’t know what they are doing/want to do in the future and that’s okay! You aren’t alone, promise.
First off, the only difference between econ and business pre reqs is that econ you need 100a/b one of the two, and for Haas you need ugba 10. If you are really about to declare econ you can also apply to Haas. You don't need to have all the pre reqs done before applying,I didn't and I got in.

Second off, a lot of econ grads work finance jobs - just take a look at the career survey. The first financial services job I got, I was not a business major yet, you can definitely do it.
what work do you want to do in finance? I’m applying to investment banking rn and I’m a philosophy major. If you don’t like econ then maybe you wouldn’t like a lot of parts of finance since they’re also very number focused and require similar thinking
Econ was meh for me. Went into investment banking, didn’t use any of it anyhow as expected. As long as you can decent grades, I would just stick with it.
If you can’t do math or read or write… getting your depression under control is probably the more valuable use of your time.
[deleted]
Can you explain why it isn’t? Academics is the only reason I go here. Otherwise why would I pay thousands just to get a degree I can get anywhere else.
No my gpa is 3.5-6ish and I have 0 things to write on my resume. I have been struggling with depression and severe anxiety. If only 1/3 of people get in, it’s not even worth applying.
I’m thinking about dropping out. But I realized I might regret that decision without having tried out more than one path or major in college. Yes the money is also an issue here but I also don’t want to drop out without a degree.
No my gpa is 3.5-6ish and I have 0 things to write on my resume. I have been struggling with depression and severe anxiety. If only 1/3 of people get in, it’s not even worth applying.
something like accounting or financial analysis. Definitely not investment banking. I hate competition. But yeah that “was” my plan. Idk anymore.
 I’m struggling with meeting the gpa requirement.
I didn’t mean it literally. But it’s become increasingly harder to focus and my grades are going down.
Academics totally matter, major doesn’t as much as you think it does. The courses you take and connections you make matters (things unique to this university) - the ‘major’ on your degree when you graduate less so
No harm in trying. Don’t worry about resume or Gpa. If you have even a little bit of interest, talk about it in your essay!
Haas and econ majors have same job prospects. At Berkeley, it is more about being in the right clubs. I would 100% rather be a non-haas major + top biz frat/club vs Haas + nothing. Obviously they are not mutually exclusive, but you get the point.
the people that go into finance are kinda competitive especially the junior roles. I worked as an equity analyst this summer at a small office at that was a chill vibe, but having a philosophy degree and knowing what im reading helped more than having microeconomic knowledge. 

Roles in finance recruit off your personal skill in doing the work, not your major. GPA and school are probably more important than what you’re really studying in regard to what they look for.
Failing out for depression is a really not-fun way to spend $12k; taking time off to work on mental health is a really good deal compared to that. Only you know your situation, but it *is* a thing that happens to people.
how do you book an appointment ??
Business clubs/frats are overrated.
I also want to have a small office job. Is humanities also fine?
No it isnt lmfao. You have no idea what goes on within top biz frats. You are talking to someone who just went through an intensive recruiting season within finance.
sure I don’t see why not. Finance is not medicine or law where you have to have certain qualifications to practice it, you just kinda gotta learn it. 

Humanities is fine, but make sure you are doing case work, taking accounting and finance courses, and just overall being ready to recruit
Ok good luck. I’m not the type they look for. And I don’t need them.
How competitive are small office jobs with moderate income? Does it depend on the area? Is berkeley’s name value and some relevant courses in accounting or finance usually enough to get a job?
Not to bag on OP, but if anyone does come across this post in the future, no matter what the consensus on top biz frats are on reddit (majority of berkeley subredditors are EECS) there is a very good reason why semester after semester biz frats have an insane number of kids sending in applications.
depends on the type of job, role, where it is, your skill, a lot of factors. you can always work at a local accounting office or something like that
Lmao multiple biz frats have had to go underground for hazing and almost killing kids from alcohol. Until the culture is fixed, most biz frats have a horrendous and toxic power dynamic. Getting mentally abused or almost dying for a job isn’t worth it
Ok. My bar isn’t that high. I value work-life-balance and mental health more than anything. Do you have any helpful websites where I can look up more information about career?
Big deal. If you cannot handle hazing, do not join. I have not met a single non-diversity finance kid say biz frats are not worth it. Yea plenty are still successful, but sm frats at this school are literal cheat codes.
I don’t for your type of roles unfortunately. I lucked into that one internship but the jobs I’m applying for are ib that are kinda high stress and long hours
I’m sure most kids don’t go into business frats thinking they will almost die… Nevertheless, I understand the networking factor but you have to agree that the culture needs to be fixed. It’s a perpetuating cycle that breeds respect out of fear
I will give you that. It’s just most people outside of the finance circle at Berkeley underestimate the networking factor. LOTS of shady things go on (in a good way for the frat members).
I think at Berkeley it’s so easy to get sucked into a hyper competitive groupthink mentality and like yeah money is great, but when it comes down to it, using the same shady and emotionally abusive practices that were used on you to pound other kids into the biz frat mold might not be something to be proud of later down the line. And I understand it’s not just a Berkeley thing either, but an industry wide problem, but allowing it to continue perpetuates the toxic work place that we are being forced to go into now"
Yo so we don’t get to choose our roommates now?,https://i.redd.it/2aa5jezt5hs61.jpg,2021-04-10 21:49:37,,"Now I’m curious what warrants that result
What was stated BEFORE that portion? It seems as if they indicated why they did this (not saying it’s right), but OP cut that part out
This is so stupid...but we still bunk with someone, huh? Where the hell is the reason in that
Can’t wait to meet who I share a bathroom with!
Bruh I was hoping to request some cool people I’ve met but ríp :/
as a continuing student, what are my chances of getting an offer, does anyone know?
is this a joke?
whaaat
wut
This is only for continuing students!!! They will also offer a way to request a room change after you receive an offer.
[deleted]
Not allowing students to choose their own roommates is quite common among [top universities](https://college.harvard.edu/life-at-harvard/student-stories/first-year-student-housing-explained) and [junior colleges](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/room-roommate-assignments).
Oh wtf, then there’s no point in me waiting for on camp offers anymore.
It’s a way to accept all forms of diversity.
wtf. dumb
Wth this is so stupid. What is the point of that? If you have your roommates/friends together in one room/apartment, then you limit the interaction with outside groups/people. And even then, vaccinations are almost open to the general public now. We’ll all mostly be vaccinated by the time we get back.
did any frosh get this email?? or does this only apply to currently enrolled students?
A nice guy on discord from Berkeley answered this question [here](https://imgur.com/EL0CBuG), so I think they're still giving you roommate request after? Just that right now they can't pair you up yet due to uncertainty in occupancy restriction. TLDR, I think they're not gonna pair you up with a stranger (hopefully). Let me know if the info is incorrect, thanks!
[deleted]
""ROOMMATES

Occupancy levels are determined based on public health guidance from UC, state, county, and local public health officials, and have not yet been confirmed.  As a result, Cal Housing has made the difficult decision to NOT assign students housing with their requested roommates.  If you have a requested roommate, we encourage you to consult with them about if they received a housing offer before deciding whether to accept or decline the offer you received. We do not anticipate being able to reunite separated roommates.""
Would also like to know. I filled out the app the day after release and picked all ""prioritized for sophomores/upperclassmen"" for choices 1-4 and still got waitlisted.
^
nope this was in an email i got
this is from the email- “With the housing assignment process affected by COVID-19, room changes will be very limited and are not guaranteed”
yes this is for all on campus housing
Harvard is not a top university, sorry.
Give those poor RAs a raise...they're going to need it
Down votes and not a single rebut. Good job Reddit 😂
Diversity integration.
Ack why is it a dm now I’m curious too
I assume this was done to ensure everyone had a fair chance to get a room.... but I could be wrong.

Some of my closest friends, I meet in my residence hall, so hopefully this allows people to meet new people!
as did i :/
[deleted]
yeah but your post makes it seem like this will affect incoming students and that there is no way for continuing students to have their chosen roommates
Sorry, your opinion is just that, not a fact.

Part of the elite US group of Ivy League schools, Harvard and Yale are among the world's most acclaimed and competitive universities. Of the eight Ivy League members, these two are among the highest-ranked in the QS World University Rankings®. In the 2020 edition, Harvard is ranked third in the world and Yale 17th.

Berkeley ranking 4th and that’s good as a non-Ivy League. 

Harvard is still better.
its because your comment was a cheeky jab with no substance, did you really expect a rebuttal?
Ack why did you say you're curious now I'm curious too
housing offer email
would this apply to incoming freshman as well??
Probably. They are doing this to follow COVID 19 guidelines
What guidelines are they following? They’re still getting roommates.
I'd really like to see what kind of justification there could be for this. If your roommate is someone you want to spend time with, you are less likely to socialize with other people than if it's someone you don't want to spend time with.
Nanny state COVID guidelines don't always have rhyme or reason. Sometimes it just feels like they're trying to prevent people from having fun. More specifically, they want to control how and when we socialize, and with whom.
I sorta thought it's because they're still tryna figure out if they want to fill triples or not because not doing so would create a supply constraint, esp since they are (supposed) to guarantee housing for freshmen. 

 Don't necessarily disagree with the ""nanny state"" interpretation, but we all know that literally nobody follows the RH guidelines  to a T, and I don't think the uni expects them to either.  I think the uni expects students to listen to a degree, so they make the language strict enough that the degree to which they listen makes their behavior reasonable in practice—there's also the relationship between the uni and city to think about."
Help… I don’t know where to live nearby! Should I bring my car?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1axzx95/help_i_dont_know_where_to_live_nearby_should_i/,2024-02-23 05:02:08,"Just got my acceptance letter for grad school at the College of Environmental Design. I’m from Michigan… so I have zero clue what the housing options are around UCB. I know rent is outrageous in Cali, but generally what are the cheapest options for me? What is Uni grad housing like? 

Also, based on your experiences, should I bring my car or are there good public transportation options? 

Keep in mind my program will only be 1 year!
","The public transit is good and usually cars could become a hassle due to parking, expenses etc. the buses run by pretty frequently although they can be crowded sometimes, but the vast majority of students rely on public transit since we get the bus pass for free. Co-ops can be a great cheap option! They have grad specific housing as well. Other than that, the cheaper option is to get roomates, live farther etc.
All kinds of off-campus and on-campus housing options. You need to do more research, too many to list. Best time with the most inventory to look for off-campus is in the next 6 weeks or so. 

If you bring a car, you bring a whole lot of potential headaches.  You’d have to determine if it is worth it or not.
Don’t bring a car.  Parking can be expensive and tickets and repairs are even more expensive.  My car was hit twice just while parked.   And you don’t need a car.  Public transportation + Uber/Lyft + gigcarshare.com or zipcar.com will fill all your needs and cost less than a car repair bill.    Also, locals don’t call it Cali, you might want to know that.
Public transportation is better than whatever you have in Michigan, but can be relatively inconvenient. I didn’t have a car for grad school here and instead made sure I lived within walking distance of groceries. Living here as a grad student without a car is doable for your day to day needs, but I will caution that you’ll miss out a lot on hiking/outdoors activities here, which tbh is one of the best things about the area. I did different iterations of car share services but it’s not cost efficient to use that for going on hikes/weekend trips.
Bus pass is only for ugrads fyi
And theft. Cars are constantly being broken into. The increased risk, coupled with the fact that you would now be residing in California, would also \*likely\* cause your car insurance rate to increase. Consistent use of public transport adds up. However, gas prices are outrageous. All things considered, as mentioned in this thread, I would store my car at home until you have some secure housing with parking somewhere away from campus. (And Oakland)."
What’s the best way to truly convince yourself that grades don’t matter?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15j6ncw/whats_the_best_way_to_truly_convince_yourself/,2023-08-05 14:02:46,I am aware that I care about my GPA for superficial reasons yet I’m struggling to change this mindset. I’m taking a breadth class this summer. It has an A- average on berkeleytime and I’m only taking it because I thought it would give me a GPA boost. I’m not very interested in the content so I’m spending hours each week writing papers on things I don’t care about and getting mediocre scores. I know that no one in the world would care if I got a B in a breadth class but I can’t help feeling bad.,"If you’re planning to go to graduate school, especially business school, law school or medical school, grades matter a whole lot.
Teacher opinion:

Many high achievers have lived relatively easy lives. They have had access to basic living requirements: shelter, food, support (parent, nanny, coach) AND extracurriculars, travel experiences- that ‘open’ their perspectives, test prep, sports, etc all extras that cost money and time. They (or their guardians) are able to devote themselves to very high standards of academic success, and often become stuck in this mindset that high grades are *the* most important factor in life. Their “today” is a given, so their tomorrow is where they put all their energy. 

You rarely meet a kid at Berkeley who is a caregiver for their dementia afflicted grandparent, raising their siblings, living on the street, malnourished from childhood, etc. Their today is never certain. Those kids don’t have the luxury to even entertain “the perfect grades” mindset. 

I concede there are always a handful of freshman admits who do not share this narrative though. And transfers- these are generally self made individuals. 

OP, you’re in an artificially selected population of people who (for the most part) lead easy, certain lives. Their “todays” are assured, so they can devote all their time and energy to tomorrow. 

My tip for you is acknowledge the background success that allowed you to adopt this mindset in the first place. 

Start volunteering to help spread the intellectual wealth you possess. You seem to know instinctively that grades- especially the one in this class really are not the most important thing in life and best use of your time. Sure, grades help you go to grad school- and got you into Berkeley to begin with. But like most things in life, moderation is key.

Don’t obsess about letters next to your name. Learn the material, and allot time for your studies, of course! But also volunteer, enjoy your youth, live your life. Perfect grades, grad school, the perfect job…all center on tomorrow and tomorrow is never assured. Live today too. 

A Berkeley education is a huge honor. Experience it wisely.
step on the seal 80 times and accept youve crossed the point of no return
Jo Biden was at the BOTTOM of his law school class and is still the president. I’m sure something similar can be said for most politicians.
By taking classes that you're actually interested in. If you're learning something fun and engaging, your focus will be on that, not every random score. And you'll do better work when you write about things you actually give a fuck about.
Lie to yourself.
for what it’s worth, i’ve taken a few breadths just cause it had a high grade average and i ended up loving them. don’t worry about changing this lol, just have fun and try to enjoy knowledge from a variety of diff sources.
I'm twice your age and have had a lot of jobs. None of them gave two shits about GPA, or even really what university I went to. It's probably important for the first one or two but after that people only care about your work experience. I've also been part of teams interviewing people. If someone put their GPA on their resume I'd think they're a fuckin weirdo. Just learn the material, learn how to write and communicate well, learn how to problem solve, etc.
Get a life and have experiences that are more emotionally compelling than grades
Forgot to mention I’m not planning to go to grad school
I had a horrible gpa (less than a 3.0) at Cal but still I graduated and after 20 years of not wanting to go to grad school went back, after a strong work history in higher Ed and got my MA with a 3.95 gpa.. Your GPA doesn’t really matter as long as you finish and you can write an essay about it if you decide to continue.. ps as a former staff at Cal and phd student advisor at Stanford I always told my students Cs get degrees so just finish!!
B-schools absolutely do not care about your undergrad GPA. They care a whole lot about work accomplishments, life experiences, and GMAT.
Based
Great comment!
Most politicians have inherited wealth or connection to politics, either from business or someone in politics.
He also got a job in a much more stable market than now
Totally get that. I needed a second class for fin aid and I wasn’t able to find a better open class that worked with my schedule. But I find myself with the same issue even in fun classes and I want to stop caring about every little grade
breadth reqs please? :)
Gotcha. Of course, I was referring to business school, law school, and medical school (not other grad schools). In addition, you mentioned 20 years of work. That indeed makes up for a lower GPA. But most don’t look to work for 20 years before going back to school.

But people should make no mistake: go online and check. GPA does matter when it comes to getting an MBA. As I mentioned, it doesn’t matter as much as it does for law or medical school, but it absolutely plays a significant role.
I’m in the industry. They definitely do care about undergraduate GPA. You are correct in that they also care a lot about work accomplishments and GMAT. But GPA also plays a role, albeit not as much as it does for law school and medical school.
Most definitely! My route was not a traditional one and I would never have gotten in any of those options you reference… but I hire ppl all day in those environments and don’t look at gpa. Just saying getting your degree and putting in the work to gain skills and expertise in your career for a while can also substitute for a low gpa later
My dad went to an M7 and was on the ad com as an alumni rep. Beyond a basic minimum GPA plays almost no role especially if you apply 3+ years post graduation. But GPA is important to land the jobs after undergrad that tend to be the feeders to top schools (MBB is a big feeder and of course GPA makes a diff there).
Depends on the industry and the company within a given industry
I have no idea why people are downvoting you, there are many cases of people with 3.5ish and even lower at the M7 schools, which is definitely not the case for other graduate programs."

I asked course staff what they recommend I do and they said go to office hours— which in theory is great, but if I’m waiting for an hour for my question, its not really worth it (but I still go).

I really liked data 8 & cs 88 and I want to continue studying data science but this class is making me reconsider EVERYTHING 😔😔

I’d welcome any advice but grateful for a space to rant","same bro. Midterm is coming soon but I barely have enough time to finish the assignments
I'd watch hugs lecture. I'd also hit up discord for quick questions, when I took it there were smart ppl lurking to help, and then I tried to pay it forward and help other ppl (usually right around when stuffs due) and that helped me solidify concepts. Can also ask on Ed. And bridge discussion was so nice for me, strongly recommend it if you can make it. 

After the first midterm the class feels different. The data structures are interesting and you kind of know java and intelliJ at that point so there is less friction from new language/tools. Hang in there you can totally get the grade you need for data sci, you're also building useful industry skills (struggling towards goal). The class is fast, and it's hard. But you got it! 

If you're super stuck feel free to DM me.
i’m in the same boat rn :(
It seems like y’all are implementing the deque data structure. In the lecture, they should’ve went through some ways to implement it."
Question for students who believe CS/EECS students don’t shower:,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w3y61j/question_for_students_who_believe_cseecs_students/,2022-07-20 14:33:14,"I’m going to start my Berkeley EECS program starting this Fall semester and I noticed too many people on this subreddit saying (or at least implying) that current CS/EECS students don’t shower. 

My question is: What makes you think ALL CS/EECS students don’t shower? Is it possible that it was only that ONE CS/EECS person who stank?

I’m asking this because I’m worried that I won’t be able to focus on my professors lectures when I’ll be sitting in a class of over 1500 CS/EECS students in my CS 61A class.

And don’t worry. I’ll make sure to smell pleasant in class.

Thank you!","Cuz a lot of them don't LMAO.
Every time I went to my 16b lab that shit STANK. 😭
Please go to a homework party and tell me later that you didn't smell anything funky
im someone in CS, i wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of ppl didn’t shower often but i’ve been lucky enough to not run into anyone who smells. It’s a meme, most ppl don’t smell. If ppl do though I feel like it’s kind of rude to judge them because a lot of people who don’t shower don’t on account of depression or sensory disorders. It’s really not uncommon that the person being made fun of for not showering is either on the spectrum or going through it. I think it’s kind of dumb.
There’s no time to shower when you’ve got a bajillion lines of code to write

Or something.

*shrugs*
Most hibernate in front of computers and only consume Hot Cheetos and Mountain Dew.
The real problem is they all don’t get jokes /s
In CS. People don’t shower. Combination of lack of social skills/awareness and/or busy.
Not just eecs but so many other majors too. Some mcb undergrads I teach don’t shower 🤷‍♀️ it’s literally not hard to stand under running water in the shower for 5 mins and do a quick shampoo of your hair. If you really can’t get off of Reddit for 5 mins like twice a week to quickly clean yourself, you really need to revisit your priorities.
It's more of a meme/joke, not they actually don't shower.

99% of people care about their hygiene, trust.
lol
For reference I shower every day🤣
No one is too busy for a hoe bath.
It gets the worst during dead week
You smell
Get off reddit and discord and go meet people and form your own opinions. Stop being a wagie.
It's because CS/EECS is chock full of greasy Dravidian kids who don't have concept of hygiene.  It is a part of their culture to not bathe (I am indian myself from rajasthan, so I am aware but not a participant of dravidian hygiene practice).  That is just how it is, and it's an unfortunate culturally insensitive meme around these parts to make fun of others like this.
I didn't smell anything the last time I went to a project party. It was over Zoom thank god.
Thanks for the warning!
Baby wipes and go
You can still get a decent clean with a 5 min shower. There’s really no excuse other than laziness and habit.

Busy gaming 24/7 and never leaving their room,how do I know? I live with one 🤮this dude also only ever cooks with his air fryer, hash brown every meal, stinking up the entire place with fried fumes, lord save us all
Twice a week?
I actually knew a handful of CS/EECS students that showered at a below average frequency, that frequency being once a week to once a month. In addition to that:

- Hair was always greasy. Immediate area would start *snowing* if they ever scratched their heads during office hours. 
- They had a terrible diet . Ramen/fast food/microwaved meals nearly everyday, also always throwing out the veggies. And no they weren’t poor. They were interning at top tech companies and had a maxed out gaming rigs, macbooks, etc. All fast food was delivered through uber eats.
- They considered axe/old spice and baby wipes as “good enough”. They never washed their sheets throughout the whole year according to former roommates and were too lazy to do laundry in general. Same unwashed set of clothes would be worn for long periods at a time. 
- Just overall poor hygiene in other areas like terribly bad breath, long dirty fingernails, dirty keyboard, spit stains all over laptop screens, etc.

Wtf??
Classic hoe bath.
Yeah that’s like the minimum for cleanliness lmao
Second this
Nah 6-7 days if you have access to one
Ew no

The avg human starts to smell after 5 days
Found someone who doesnt shower 😂😂😂
How do you come to find out this knowledge? I’m genuinely curious.

CS/EECS: I don’t know how to leetcode,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13oddyx/cseecs_i_dont_know_how_to_leetcode/,2023-05-21 19:08:55,"Im an incoming lscs. I’m trying to self teach myself data structures and algorithms in python to prep for interviews. but am overwhelmed with what resources are actually useful. 

tldr: provide your best recommendations on how to learn ds & alg for interviews to learn how to solve leet code problems.","Wait until you start here. After some classes you will feel a lot more confident.
some unpopular advice ig and ill prob get downvoted but wtv. instead of leetcode i would personally start with a website called codeforces and just try and get to a point where u can solve 1300-1400ish level questions. while at this level u really don't learn any data structures or algorithms, you still build your intuition (and in my experience at a faster rate than starting with leetcode). after doing some cf you can honestly just watch like some youtube 10 hr crash course on data structures and algorithms and begin solving some lc problems from a list. edit: perhaps worth mentioning is that i think most people are fine with just leetcode, im just sharing what i felt was helpful for me
I get the desire to prep during summer, but as an incoming student you should take this last chance to truly relax. Your next 4 years are going to be hectic as is. 

On a more practical side, practicing leetcode now is pretty useless. I honestly wouldn’t bother with leetcode until you’ve finished 61B. Picking up bad habits or learning “tricks” without understanding is detrimental to you in the long run. Plus the content in 61A/B is very useful for interviews anyway. If you really want to prep, why not do the 61B labs and hw. 

Tldr: too early to leetcode. Learn a CS skill instead? Build a full stack project or sm
Take 61A, 61B, 170. Get really good at recursion in 61A (because recursion is foundational for DP), most of 61B (don’t worry about union find, RB trees, A* search, and put less weight on MST), and the first half of 170 up through DP.

Don’t worry about seriously practicing harder Leetcode questions until before you are recruiting for junior -> senior summer.

Most people don’t do internships their freshman year, and some companies tend to ask easier questions to sophomores (I know Google’s STEP questions are definitely easier than their SWE intern questions). Mastering the above courses are plenty.

If you want to recruit for quant, in addition to strong algorithms skills, in my very limited experience quant firms also like to see engineering experience/knowledge. For instance, when I interviewed at Jane Street, they asked me to design a garbage collector (granted this was for full time though). Classes like 162 are good classes to take, for example, because operating systems are some of the most complex systems we have.
Touch grass now please, and continue to do so over the next 4 years. Too early to be worried about this stuff.
True, after 61a I felt much more capable of solving leetcode-style questions. Throughout the course, you will solve 7-10 leetcode problems a week in labs, homeworks, and projects.
thanks! just checked out the website, is it like default in russian or am I on the wrong site

Why don't UC Berkeley foreign language courses focus on speaking? Like they don't? At all?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/166ltqw/why_dont_uc_berkeley_foreign_language_courses/,2023-08-31 13:20:00,"I'm taking an advanced language course at UC Berkeley, and I have friends who take language courses, and we're all wondering the same thing.

These classes focus on reading, writing, and grammar, but barely any speaking practice. 

In my advanced class, we barely practice speaking. It's just reading and writing every day. Don't get me wrong, those are important elements of learning a language.

But you realize how many people I've met who can read and write, but can't hold an actual conversation in that language? A lot. 

So I feel like these courses are doing its students a disservice by not emphasizing speaking practice.","Depends on the department I guess. For example, the Japanese courses require a lot of speaking practice, including an oral exam with the professor as part of the final (at least when I took it as a student many years ago).
I’m an advanced class they likely expect you to already be good at that. By advanced level you are basically in a language arts class but for a foreign language
I learned my Japanese at cal and throughout the intro and intermediate level, the classes were very heavy on speaking. 

We had to do skit performance fairly frequently (which can be very fun or cringe lol), and every class you get to speak to the instructor a lot if you want to. We also had oral interviews as part of the final exams 

But by the advanced level, I do think the focus was shifted to reading more difficult texts, although I didn’t get to finish the entire advanced series due to scheduling conflicts
I am taking advance Urdu we do alot of speaking and reading and barely do any writing
It is strange for an advanced language class to allow students to speak in english. What language is this?
My reasoning taking Russian was that it’s easier to find someone to practice speaking, but particularly with languages that grammatically different from english, it’s harder to find someone who will teach you the grammar and intricacies of the linguistic history well. 

If you want practice speaking, I recommend checking out language exchange apps like hellotalk and tandem. Good luck on the language learning journey!
That is unfortunately very common. My daughter has done immersion her whole life and past grammar school, the emphasis is on reading and writing in that language. The courses are also taught in that language. It is really important to take a semester abroad in a country that speaks the language and seek out speaking groups that meet for coffee to practice the language.
I tried to take french once and it seemed all of the intro classes taught only in french. First day of class, the instructor came in speaking french and only spoke english after class with students. I learned that I’m not learning french.
Create your own club , “practice speaking “
It’s less work to teach
There’s a whole separate class for conversation. And as someone said, once you get into the hundreds, you’ll have great convos in class.
I imagine, if you’re in an advanced class, you’re probably expected to already have speaking experience. By the time you hit proper upper-divs, think of them like literature courses but in your chosen language/not English.
Why would they expect someone to be good at that if in all of their language classes they barely practiced speaking? Which is the case in most american foreign language courses. I know plenty of people in my advanced class who aren't that good at speaking and i mean, it's not even their fault. Just because you;'re good at reading or writing doesn't mean you';ll automatically be good at speaking.
That’s actually the best way to learn
call it, ""practiCALy speaking""
I had the same issue with the Chinese series
Well I don’t know what language classes you’re taking but in all of mine we did a lot of speaking. Anyways, yeah that’s tough.
I’m taking the basic level German classes and we do a lot of speaking. I think the original commenter is right, they expect you to have practiced a lot of speaking in lower level classes already, so the higher level classes focus on it less.
I hecking loved the instructor coming in and talking in French and me having no clue what anyone is saying and by the end of the first day, still not clearly understanding 90%. It especially doesn’t help that everybody else also did not know any french, so there was plenty of speaking attempts amongst each other where neither party knew what they were trying to say. It’d be infinitely better if there was English instruction and rigorous speaking practice, but this methodology did nothing but make me completely lose all interest of attempting to learn some french.
Disagree. I was a language instructor for German and we used that approach to great success. English as an instruction language makes adoption of the target language much harder. Diving right in will confuse you for the first few sessions but after that, you’ll actually learn better. The reason being that you will always not understand something unless you are truly proficient, so navigating this confusion is the most important skill in learning a new language.
Genau. 

I was able to hold reasonable ""tourist"" conversations after German 1 and by German 3, I was articulating myself on important topics with reasonable fluency and by the time I studied abroad, navigating everything wasn't a big hassle.

I had headaches after a lot of classes but damned if I don't still speak German well 17 years later.
Congrats! Happy to hear that! (Let your old instructor know, they love to hear that!)
I'm actually astounded that Niklaus Euba and Deniz Göktürk are still there. Seems so long ago, I don't know if they would even remember me. It's been almost two decades since I took their classes."

Lol it ain’t that deep, please look at the title of this post. This was supposed to a funny meme joke, i was really hoping that other campuses would be open to having cross campus jokes and fun. I’m sorry you think I’m a disgruntled freshman, I’m perfectly happy where I am and I’m very happy for the privilege to go to a great school as UCI. If you want me to go into the nuance meaning of the meme I’d love to but I’m very sorry that you think this is an attempt to attack Berkeley through a dumb meme. If we’re talking about maturity, id take a look at a mirror because attacking another UC student for making a harmless in offensive stupid joke is not something that is very mature. I have upmost respect for Berkeley and have a lot of friends attending the university and I couldn’t be happier for them. I’m sorry if I made you upset over a stupid meme it was never my intention.
To add on the COVID response of some in our community, I’m sorry you think that the actions of few speak define a city and the students that attend UCI. I’m sure you would not particularly enjoy discrediting you or your community over the ignorant actions of a few, I hope you would not to the same to us.
Not saying anything about UCI, just shitting on Newport Beach. Yea I suppose not everyone in OC is a covidiot, but OC has a reputation of having NIMBY suburban republican politics, so these anti-masks rallies happening there wasn't all that surprising. Its kinda similar to how Berkeley has a reputation of radical left-wing anarchism. Tbh both forms of politics are toxic in their own way.
Whatever your intentions maybe, you must realize it is unfair to the greater population who do not agree with the ignorant minority. Like I said it’s not fair to judge a group based on the actions of a few, and I’m sure you would agree with me on that."

A bunch of family stuff ended up happening and I quickly found myself just drowning in assignments while being incredibly depressed. Every grade back feels like a slap in the face after weeks of studying with barely anything to show for it. This combination is not for the weak, and boy did I realize that I am not built for it. My GPA is tanking and my self esteem is gone. It’s not worth it to do these classes together.

You are correct, and freshman tend to bite more than they can chew, and that has nothing to do with you and your worth as a student. Berkeley is not for the weak, and you are already going through so much in your first year.

I'm sorry you are going through a tough time, OP. Please make sure to utilize the resources on campus, like free drop-in therapy.

Would taking chem3b and bio1b together be doable?
 What if I only did chem 3b/3bl and bio 1a/1al and didnt take any other classes?
Shit I’m a med student and I don’t know what an ORF is lol
i did mcb 102 with bio 1b. honestly bio 1b is nothing
definitely. bio 1B is significantly less of a workload compared to 1A and it was honestly super manageable when I took it
That’s suggested for the fall semester of sophomore year for the microbial biology major.
Because my only other option is chem 3b and physics 8a, which seems worse…
ORF refers to Overly Redundant Flashcards if I remember bio 1A…
Well, get on it then. The med school I work at now has dropped most of the basic biology courses because they expect students to know it coming in now (or to self study). Sounds like it’s becoming a trend.

Open reading frame. An in-frame coding sequence with a start and a stop codon, and everything in between. Although apparently some definitions don’t include the start and stop codons within the actual ORF, even if they punctuate either end. Whatever.
you’d be below the unit requirements bc together thats only 10 units. it’s not like it isn’t a doable combination and you can manage an A in everything if you’re super on top of things, but if you care about your gpa you should really take them separately. it’s a lotttt of work to balance them out and you need to be giving it your absolute all to see good results.
I know what an open reading frame is, I just didn’t know the acronym. Cellular/molecular and biochem was just about a month/month and a half for us at the beginning of M1 which makes sense given what you’re expected to be familiar with coming in."

Hot take: I don’t support the strike,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ywok0i/hot_take_i_dont_support_the_strike/,2022-11-16 01:01:54,"Hot take:  since these are grad students with degrees from a good university, let them quit the program and get jobs if they want better pay.  If grad programs paid as well as the free market everyone would do them.  I know many people who have quit or rejected grad programs for that reason.  It’s why I will not do a grad program myself.

Berkeley’s primary objective as a public institution is to provide as many people with a good quality education as possible, especially those who cannot afford undergrad at private institutions.  Paying GSIs more (who, having a college degree, are well capable of providing for themselves) would mean a proportional reduction in the economic diversity of students admitted (many of whom struggle to provide for themselves / their family). Not to mention, the strike has immediate negative consequences for students who are just trying to get a degree and make a bit of money.

No matter how hard the protesters try to portray their struggle as “oppressive”, I simply don’t see how a grad students union is comparable to, say, an auto workers union.  Unskilled laborers are forced to strike because there are no other alternatives to further their (barely livable) income.  They can’t just switch jobs and double their income. Grad students can.  That’s the fundamental difference between a truly oppressive system and the current system at Berkeley.","Let students give up their dreams of reaching jobs that require higher education just because the university isn’t able to allocate their resources properly and it provides an inconvenience to you? Man that’s gotta be the coldest and most entitled take I’ve seen in a while.

Berkeley’s primary objective is indeed to provide people with a good quality education… why are you discriminating between undergraduates and graduates? Graduate students are the reason that this university is able to function in the first place, good luck getting a degree here when all graduate students do realize they’re better off somewhere else. GSIs and GSRs are essential to any university (more so than your presumably undergraduate self) and should be compensated for that.
>If grad programs paid as well as the free market everyone would do them.

A lot more people may want to apply for graduate programs, doesn't mean they would all get in. If your point is that increasing compensation would increase competition, then yes, that's a fairly obvious point. That's not necessarily a bad thing as grad schools would be attracting more talent.

>Paying GSIs more (who, having a college degree, are well capable of providing for themselves) would mean a proportional reduction in the economic diversity of students admitted (many of whom struggle to provide for themselves / their family).

Um no. You're assuming that the money would come from scholarships for undergraduates (or similar programs) which is not a valid assumption. While it's possible that this is the case, it's fair to say the university will first look at other areas of its budget (so that this doesn't become another issue later on). I don't think they have information about this so your statements are all just speculation. It's an even bigger reach to say proportional reduction lol.

>the strike has immediate negative consequences for students who are just trying to get a degree and make a bit of money.

You're saying you have a problem with the reason why a strike is effective.

>They can’t just switch jobs and double their income. Grad students can. 

Posting what I said elsewhere: we want to work towards a fairer society where people don't have to give up great opportunities because they weren't born rich, this kind of thinking is just a dead-end in the long run – just maintains the status quo and so the inequalities in our society today. We would be missing out on the contributions of a lot of people because of people like you.

Tldr: pretty bad argument
If everyone made utility maximizing, ""rational""  like they do in economic models, no one would decide to be a GSI/GSR and UC would be forced to increase pay. But since many career paths require academic degrees and there are a limited number of top research institutions, the ""free market"" doesn't really work in this scenario and we need some other way to figure out how much people should get paid.  In a state as wealthy as California, I don't think it unreasonable to expect their public university system to be able to pay a living wage to GSR/GSIs. 

Also, my personal reasoning for supporting the strike is more so about reducing UC's administrative bloat. This [article](https://capitolweekly.net/tuition-uc-administrators-tripled-csu-data/) from 2015 says administrative positions increased at ""10 times the rate of growth of tenured faculty positions” across US universities. Since administrators control university operators and are incentivized to pay themselves well and hire people below them, administrative bloat is inevitable unless there's other external pressures against it. If we want to change this, we have to force the university to allocate more of its budget to people doing the actual teaching/research work. One of the GSI union's issues is improving staffing in EECS (since UC has been cutting TA budgets the past few years, on top of EECS already having the least funding per student). Who else can stop admins from allocating more and more of UC's budget to themselves, if not the union?
Adding on to the other arguments - there are a lot of careers that require a PhD

Your argument of economics and supply and demand would work in the reverse- Berkeley is a top institution with critical research output that is done primarily by GSRs - if many just quit and moved to industry as you said, both the value of your degree and undergraduate experience would plummet (both from the value GSI/Rs provide- and from students choosing peer private institutions instead of Berkeley) . 

The graduate programs fuel the undergraduate programs.

Additionally, I don't think paying them more would increase costs for low-income students - financial aid scales to match your EFC.

Oh, here we come with the Ayn Rand arguments. There are quite a few things to talk about here.  


""since these are grad students with degrees from a good university, let them quit the program and get jobs if they want better pay. If grad programs paid as well as the free market everyone would do them**""**  


This is at best naive. You are completely ignoring the presence of positive externalities of education and technology development to society.   


More than that, you are proposing that the worst qualified go on to be more educated, which has obvious consequences.   


""Berkeley’s primary objective as a public institution is to provide as many people with a good quality education as possible,""  


How do you propose to do that without high-quality GSI's holding sessions? Or high-quality GSRs doing the ""grunt"" work for PI's? Or  faculty having high quality grad students to collaborate with?  


What you are proposing here is essentially that Berkeley should give up on being a research institution and turn into a teaching school - which is an opinion you are free to have, but one that most people would disagree with. Not paying grad students enough here won't lead them to the private sector, it will just lead them to competitor schools. Decreasing the quality of grad students 1) increases the work of instructors 2) decreases the quality of instruction 3) makes Berkeley a less attractive choice for faculty, which then cycles back until the UC system merges with the CSU. Not that there's anything wrong with the CSUs, but the whole purpose of creating different types of universities is that they have different types of contribution to society.  


So I encourage you to change your talking point. Don't say ""I think free markets should dictate where people go to"". Say that you think public education and research is useless and shouldn't be funded.
I am one of the few people to whom the strike is not an inconvenience to me at all.  It has hardly effected my major classes (I watch the online recordings of discussions anyways) but has allowed me to not have to attend my 8am Non major course which has been a godsend.  Additionally I can go back a few days earlier and see my family for thanksgiving since nothing is in person.  It’s actually slightly positive, for me personally, from a convenience perspective.

The reason I discriminate between graduate degrees and undergrad degrees is this.  An undergrad degree is just short of a human right in industrialized countries.  It is the difference between a life of monotonous underpaid labor and a life where you can afford good healthcare, send your children to good schools, not have to worry about whether you afford rent tommorow.  A graduate degree, conversely, is a personal indulgence.  You do it because you either really love the subject, or you want to stay in school for a bit longer.  There are a few very rare circumstances where people do it for money but even then they are already in a good position to make money so why should undergrads be subsidizing then when they are pressed for money even more.

From my perspective Berkeley’s goal is to lift as many people from the lower 20 percent to the upper 20, and favoring grad students over undergrad students is not consistent with that goal.  

I recognize a certain amount of grad students are required for a well functioning university, but being a public institution I think the primary support should go to undergrads.
“You’re assuming the money would come from scholarships for undergrads, which is not a valid assumption ”

No, I’m assuming it will come from our tuition dollars, which I think is a totally fair assumption unless somebody donates a huge sum of money specifically for graduate students .  The money is going to be diverted from SOMEWHERE that will negatively effect undergrads (unless they crack down on corruption or athletics which I could get behind, but I’m not optimistic would happen).  Meaning at least one of the following will happen:

1.	⁠A higher proportion of full paying students will be admitted (more rich people fewer poor people) reducing economic diversity
2.	⁠Tuition will be raised
3.	⁠They will reduce their focus on housing (housing prices will go up in the long term)
4.	⁠Education quality will be reduced as they cannot afford to hire the best professors anymore.

As the system currently is, any gain for graduates comes at the expense of undergrads, who are in a much more sensitive position in life.

Also there’s no need to be rude.  I was not rude to you.
This is by far the most convincing argument I have heard.  If the funds come from UC bureaucrats I totally agree with the strike.  But that needs to be the primary focus imo, any other source of funding results in a less equitable Berkeley.

In other words the focus of the strike should be “pay the administrations less” or “cut down on corruption” imo
The undergraduate programs also fuel the graduate programs.  Without grads the undergrad program is a CSU, I agree, but without the undergrads the grad program is a UCSF at best.  Really what needs to happen is the money needs to come from the bloated administration.  As the strike is happening currently, that’s not what is going to happen.  

There is a good balance of graduate student privileges to undergraduate student privileges and grad students currently carry all the cards imo.  Imagine undergrads trying to strike!  We would get kicked out of university so quickly for academic probation.
Exactly as you thought it would. L take from OP.
There’s no need to be rude.  I didn’t insult you.  You don’t need to react like that.

I also have debt.  But the difference between me and you is that you have a degree which, if all else went to shit and you had to drop out of your grad program, you could pay your debt.  I couldn’t, because I would be flipping burgers with no degree.  I respect the ambition in going for a grad program but it shouldn’t be paid for by undergrads who don’t have their life together yet, that’s all.

If you got into Berkeley grad school, 95 percent chance you went to a decent university and can make a good amount of money.  Even if you went to a mediocre university, you clearly did very well to get into Berkeley and would have no problem getting a job.

I actually dropped out of high school so your last point is pretty fucking accurate.
Here’s a fun fact for you: less than 50% of Europeans pursue a higher education degree. Attending college is not even close to a human right even in some of the most industrialized countries (see Germany at ~30%). 

The earnings increase from a bachelors to a masters is around 20%, so there is definitely a financial incentive to attend graduate school. Not to mention degrees such as MDs and MBs which are basically required to work in those respective fields. Graduate school, while in some cases is a personal choice, is much more than a personal indulgence, and to think otherwise is laughable.

Once again, you don’t seem to grasp the role that graduate students play in your everyday life here. As a public research institution, the majority of funding comes as a result of the research that goes on here. Do you think without the successes in the 20th century Berkeley would be where it is now? Furthermore, do you think those successes happened without graduate students? Without GSRs and GSIs Berkeley would cease to exist, while without undergraduates Berkeley would transform into a fully functioning research institution
Ummmm current undergrad here who is also currently applying to grad school. NOT because I truly am so obsessed with the subject that I want to learn more or because I want to stay in school longer, but because it is a requirement to pass a licensing exam to get a job in my field that require certain credentials and make money. It’s not as rare as you might think, my friend
Hmm - while undergrads do significantly add to the graduate programs and a core mission of the university is to educate us -- you say ""UCSF at best"" - but that's one of the very top medical research institutions in the nation.

I think certainly more money could come from bloated administration... or if the state properly funded Berkeley..
[deleted]
Germany is not California.  The difference between a college degree and not is monumental here.  Even in the US, where we have a huge college educated population, a college degree is unimportant in a lot of states.  California is not one of these states.  

20% is not much in the grand scheme of things.  One good internship is the same as a PHD in many cases in terms of pay raise.  The difference between a business or technical degree and working minimum wage is in the ballpark of 150%, that’s my point.  

Graduate students are free to chose to not attend Berkeley, either by not pursuing a graduate degree or choosing a different institution.  If some of them left, then the school would be forced to raise their pay.  Undergrads often do not have a (meaningful) choice because they have to deal with economic necessity.  Berkeley was my only real choice other than a mediocre cal state for example.  

I’m doubtful about your claim that grad students generate the majority of revenue for the university, considering how little money the government invests in research (I know companies do as well) and how much tuition they extract from undergrads.
Berkeley is great because people can express a plurality of views which people can generally express in a civil manner.  I encourage you to participate in this tradition.  You are acting like I’m spouting hate speech.

The strike should be directed at the administration, not your pay.  If the goal is increasing your pay it’s gonna come from my pocket. If it’s at the administration it will come from their pocket, which I can get behind.  I agree they are corrupt, which is precisely why they are going to make undergrads foot the bill.

""Cal students clash at sticky note 'Lennon wall' over Hong Kong protests""
So since everyone is just a product of their environment, then there is no true free will, noone does anything wrong, atleast not purposely, and we should feel bad not just for the victim of a crime, but the perpetrator as well, because they are the real victims of this world.

For ex: when i see the ted bundy tapes and the level of manipulation that guy used, and how doing everything he did was a means of pleasure to him, I should actually be compassionate, like i wish i could talk to him to make him see the wrong of his doing, while he plans how to chop me up/have sex with my corpse.

I think a lot of humans just feel “compassion” because they have a mini messiah complex.

If instead the initial comment had used “empathy” i would have agreed. The exchange students don’t us to be compassionate. They need us to be able to *empathize*, because that is the only way to tackle xenophobia, at least the only non-violent way.

But the microcosm of Berkeley is not the rest of the world, fuck it’s not even the rest of the Bay Area. Once I was doing internships and getting job offers not once did anyone give a shit if I was a part of some consulting club or business frat. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, just do the best you can and don’t worry too much about what other people think of you. Don’t compare yourself to others and remember that you’re the one living your life.

Go Bears.

PSA: Don’t Major in CS,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qnw6l5/psa_dont_major_in_cs/,2021-11-06 01:40:06,"EE is fine, but don’t become a software engineer. 95% of SWEs waste their time on unimportant problems that make people slaves to consumerism and materialism. When you join this industry, and slowly realize you aren’t actually a real engineer (a software engineer is an engineer the same way a University of Phoenix grad is a college grad), you’ll ruefully wish you majored in something that could create real impact (materials, chemical, mechanical, etc engineering). 

Also, money isn’t important after a certain number.","[deleted]
If this is how they plan to reduce CS enrollment it’s not gonna work
[deleted]
Not everyone has the luxury to not care about money
It's really funny to see someone decry to horrors of a consumerist and materialist system (which I want to note are horrible and should be decried) only to turn around in the next sentence and gatekeep what it means to be a ""real engineer""
>Also, money isn’t important after a certain number.

Sure, and it's easier for software engineers to reach that number compared to other professions. Software engineers in this country make the highest salaries out of any other profession, even new grads are making 120k. Whether you discourage this or not people will do it and live better lives than you are capable of paying for. 

I get your point, but still...
lol say what you want. Some people just want to make 300k
I’m making as much money as I can. And just because you can’t make an impact with software doesn’t mean that I can’t.
Just because you’re useless doesn’t mean we are. 🤷‍♀️
who care lmao
Everyone is a slave to something bad, it’s just how you define the least bad thing to be a slave to
That’s the 5% (I said 95% are doing unimportant things). Maybe I should revise and say 90% instead.
This guy gets it!!
That’s a non-sequitur. Engineering is not just petroleum engineering.
I said after a certain number though.
It is true. Engineers are supposed to solve problems that exist in the world. 
Most Software Engineers (I said 95% but now I think it is actually 90%) are not doing that. Instead, they are finding (harmful) solutions to problems that never existed. Or they do solve a problem, but because of market demands, they focus on growth at-all-costs and then make that solution a harmful one. That’s basically all major companies and gig-related companies. Even chip companies do this. At first these companies made useful core products, but then to grow, they start solving useless problems (or inventing problems) and employ the 90% for this.
Yeah that’s why I said 95% is doing insignificant stuff. Hopefully you are in the 5%, and not suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect.
5- 10% of software engineers will actually work on something useful. Statistically that probably means you won’t be.
Sooo many non-sequiturs and seemingly deliberate misinterpretations of your argument here. For a group that tends to pride itself on a devotion to logic and reason, this has clearly struck an emotional nerve.
And who are you to determine who’s work is insignificant. Lmao
You pulled that statistic out of your ass. This is a you problem, it has nothing to do with CS or engineering. Get your life together. You clearly have nothing worthwhile going on if this is the type of shit you post.
Oh please. You're right, there is clearly an overwhelming amount of logic and reasoning in OP's post . What a bastion of logic and reason /s. On the contrary, it seems to have stuck an emotional nerve with you, pal. I'm not even a CS major.
That is true. I have nothing going on. I already implied that in my original post. And yet if someone were to look at LinkedIn, they would likely think differently. That’s the big disappointment of it all."

You should probably contact the enrollment manager for Physics (sorry, not sure who it is but ask one of the Physics advisors) and ask when they will add another discussion/lab section.

As for Engin 7, there are a couple of lab sections open, but if you’re picky about your times, that’s why you’re still on waitlist - sorry can’t help you there.
Emailed someone but should I wait to talk to a counselor or should I take a chance and drop a class and quickly re-enroll to get Engin 7. Also i’m still not sure what to do about Physics.
You should be able to get into one of the 2 open labs for Engin 7 by dropping the lab (and the lecture) that you’re waitlisted in, and then quickly adding the lab section that has an open seat(s).  And the lecture of course.
I had to switch around my schedule and it ended up working but for that i’d need to get on a different physics waitlist which I don’t mind BUT it intersects with my Chem Lab which resets the whole process because then id be waitlisted for Chem 😭"

Why don’t men ask women out anymore ???? Or is this just a Berkeley thing ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qhbxkk/why_dont_men_ask_women_out_anymore_or_is_this/,2021-10-27 18:40:37,,"bestie i’m afraid to tell you this but they still do…
we’re shy nerds
u gotta take initiative. ask the cute guys out ;)
Speaking very frankly for me personally, the stigma about being perceived as “creepy” or as a harasser is super strong and the opportunity cost of cold asking a girl out isn’t worth the potential reputational harm if she says no and bad mouths me to others. I’d rather deal in less ambiguous situations like dating apps or if it’s very clear to the both of us we are into each other.
I don’t wanna seem creepy leave me alone
Because they think men only want one thing
From a guy's perspective, the return on investment is pretty low. I think women should share the burden and ask men out just as men ask women out 🤷 

As we say in Egypt, ""between what is said and not meant, and what is meant and not said, most love is lost"".
[deleted]
Afraid of a law suit.
People here are just too … well if you’re a good looking guy & ask a girl out you’ll probably get a yes. But if you’re not, you’re perceived as a creep and weird. One or the other , no in between
In my day, about half the time girls asked guys out...or made it hard to mistake they really wouldn't mind being asked.  You nevagonna learn till you try.
If you’re a woman, you should ask men out too! Let’s share the burden and make the playing field equal. 🤘🏽
Be the change........
Um they still do
It’s cuz the girls here r way hotter AND smarter than the guys 😭
We do.
OP is just insecure. Literally one of those girls at a party “omg why is no one paying attention to me???”

flip the power dynamic, take the initiative
dating is pretty time consuming so even if you get asked if might never happen unless you put in the effort as well. i make a lot of loose plans with people on campus and it rarely follows through because we both forget, or just don’t have time. my advice is that if you’re looking to go on dates, don’t look at school. go out to parties and events because those are generally people who put aside time for their social lives
Prob main reason because rejection hurts....deeply so.

Fear of being branded a creep definitely holds true too.

Especially after that orientation stuff before fall, where pretty much everything can be considered harrasment.

Personally, asking for verbal consent before a kiss or even a touch, as someone from south america (where we are very jovially/casually physical), is beyond awkward. 
Its all too sterile here. Cant relate.
Meh @ these comments like, “we do.” I’m new to the school as a transfer this semester, and I definitely also picked up on the lack of thirst in comparison to most other places I encounter. Have also been wondering what the reason is. Assumed it was a combo of shyness/nerdiness and that its social acceptability is considered somewhat questionable.
It's a Berkeley thing. Berkeley dudes are nerds and don't know how to talk to people when it comes to asking people out
we do sweetheart
Depression
It’s literally the most effective way to meet someone and that will never change, but we do have a large amount of computer introverts here lol. If only they knew how effective it is. I have had a few dates and girlfriend from tinder, but I can pull wayyyyyy hotter girls in person, most girls on there just fish for compliments to get their endorphins going.
You wanna go have pizza?
Cause women don't make any efforts neither while stating that they doesn't need men and partly even looking down on us. So why should we bother to make the effort?
I feel most men either don't know who the person they like even is personally, or they try and follow the unwritten rules of 2022. They have to have money, a good job, purpose in life etc. Now that may seem obvious but these days, I still don't know when what I have would be enough or if I would be good enough a boyfriend then or later down the line. 
Plus, just a nit-pic ig, but as a dude, I feel more like women compare guys based upon their wealth and status. I simply don't like that idea and kinda avoid women romantically.
Because we don't want to lied on by being called stalkers, rapists and or perverts and have our lives ruined. So we just leave the ladies alone.
They still do, but its hard when women and men shame men for hitting on women in person these days.  Like, if she says no, it automatically makes you a creep.  IF she says yes, then everyone pats you on the back for ''shooting your shot.''
Because we’re tired of rejection or being told about a boyfriend you don’t have or even worse being called creepy for even talking to you. Ladies, if you like a guy, you should make the first move because 98% of the time men won’t now.
Because men are tired of being rejected, and treated like dirt, and  they have been rejected so much they don’t bother asking anymore.
You got that right camelfucker1955
Yes, love this!
Yep. Make some effort and prove your worth yourself
That’s why I never ask someone new out on a date. I just say “hey, wanna go do xyz?”

This way you can figure out if you actually have anything in common, as friends. If you don’t, at least you just made a friend. Idk why people want to cold go on a date with a stranger anyway. If that friendly outing goes well and there’s obvious chemistry, shoot your shot. If they don’t want to hang out at all, let it ride and move onto someone with more things in common. 

Now, if you know you like someone, just be cool and upfront about it, taking any potential “rejection” as a polite social encounter. If anyone talks shit about you after that, chances are everyone they talk to already knows they’re a bit of an ass. “Hey, I think you’re cool and I’d like to take you out sometime” goes a long way. Definitely never ask over text though because people are far more likely to misinterpret what you say, and (some) confidence goes a long way in not looking creepy. 

Note: all of this also applies to dating apps if you’re not just looking for a hookup. Anyone who is actually worth your time won’t hold it against you for being interested in them. Don’t be afraid, most people are a lot cooler than we make them out to be in our heads.
This 👆
Seconded. Too many virtue signalers for asking out to be perceived as non creepy
And that one thing is literally “fucking disgusting”.
Nice saying
No. I'm not asking any man out.  Men get some balls and ask women on real dates and I don't mean ' hrs come over and shower and cuddle' that ain't a date.  Also sending dick pics....not a turn on and kind if gross when you haven't met yet.

Was their name the only one on the lease?
Go check out the East Bay Community Law Center they might be able to help you out with this.
As long as you have a clear paper trail of evidence including proof of your deposit you should just go to the city of Berkeley courthouse and file an [order to go to small claims court](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc100.pdf).   The court will notify your roommate of your intent to pursue this matter and let the court handle it from there.  

I hope you get your deposit back, that’s a large amount to loose for anyone.
what does the school have to do with it? was it student housing?
If your roommate is a student, file a complaint with the Office of Student Conduct. You can complain about any behavior that is against the student code of conduct. They will charge him with theft.

You can also take him to small claims court or report it to police."

Just curious do you have a 4.0?
It is real and considered an honor. How useful it is is another question. If you continue in academia I'm sure it will be a boost on applications and resumes. Perhaps also a bit in academe-adjacent fields. High academic performance translates well to good job performance in some places, but less well in others. Conceivably also helpful in networking in those areas if you work at it.

I got invited and I don't have a 4.0! I'm also a junior, for reference :D
Juniors and seniors are eligible, though it is ""harder"" to get in if you're a junior.
Good amount of premeds will have it.

I was a junior when I qualified
I got invited to Tau Beta Pi after my first semester because I entered with 59.9 units from high school AP/college courses (they capped me at just under junior status) took a few classes over again that I could have used AP credits for, and got a 4.0 for one semester. So I was a junior with a 4.0 (even though I only really had 16 units or something). I joined, and apart from a few events with free pizza, it didn't really do anything for me. But I guess if I was more aggressive about networking it could have helped.
Whhhooaaaaa so humble. Congrats!!!!
Can I ask what your GPA is 🙊Ik it’s a very personal question so I understand if you don’t wanna answer it.
Why is it harder? Do you know what the requirements are?
Thank you!!
Haha, I'll DM you :3
They only permit 40 juniors to be invited per college at  UC Berkeley, but they will allow up to 10% of the senior class to be invited so long as they have above a 3.7. Whether or not they do invite up to 10% of seniors is something unknown to me, but I think we can infer from this that the process of inviting a junior is ""more selective"".   
Additionally, juniors must have completed 90 units, have a GPA well above a 3.9, have completed the breadth requirements, and have completed the foreign language requirement. It's a lot to have done for a junior.  
I tried to do my own research when I got the email about Phi Beta Kappa, so I looked into their bylaws and their eligibility requirements!
out of curiosity, would it be okay if you told me too, what your gpa was? I would greatly appreciate it!"

Dang, didn't know about the June 30th deadline. Still had to borrow this semester though.
Can you link to the application for loan forgiveness?
Y'all should apply just to be safe but DO NOT count on Biden's college loan repayment thing actually happening.

The legal backing for the program relies on wilfully misapplying some legislation written for military & first responders as a response to 9/11 and also relies on Biden holding special emergency executive powers related to COVID even though he just said the pandemic is over. It might still happen but it's going to get held in court for a long time.

cow parsnip or giant hogweed in Wurster plaza! don’t touch it because it can cause severe burns,https://i.redd.it/0sryuh9nykw61.jpg,2021-05-01 14:53:09,,"I wanna touch it

It’s worth telling groundskeeping about this. The pollen can cause severe eye damage or even blindness if in contact in high doses. Very nasty stuff

why is it there ???
Challenge accepted
Guys guys guys, chill. Very unlikely that it is hogweed. https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/cowparsnip_a_common_look_alike_to_giant_hogweed Like much more like cow parsnip from the picture. Doesn't have the red dots or ridges and spines you would expect on the hogweed and has the inflated sac at the base of the leaf. Obviously approach with caution, but it's not even giant. It is very smol....
What makes you familiar with botany?
Around every river and canal, their power is growing! Watch out they'll give you nasty blisters
it’s closely related to poison hemlock! and also carrots for some reason lmao
should I just email them or smth??
I suspect this is cow parsnip which is less dangerous than giant hogweed — for cow parsnips you actually have to touch the sap to get burned but it’s still scary 😦
it’s a weed
well what do you think it is??
They're all in the same family, Apiaceae.  Reminds me, there was a plant identification book (""The Jepson Manual"" of California plants) which, when the reader got down to distinguishing between poison hemlock and cow parsley, says ""cow parsley tastes like parsley"".  I doubt it still says that.
I would and provide the exact location + a photo just to be safe. Seems like something that is better taken care of sooner as they grow quite tall.
It's cow parsnip, I wouldn't bother contacting them.
[deleted]
Don’t take it offensively. I meant the question to ask what got you into it, because I thought it was interesting how you were knowledgeable about some random weed on campus. I don’t know jack.
They're super invasive too, if this goes to seed that whole area will be filled with them next season.
It's not going to get any taller, it's already flowered. They top out at flowering. This is obviously not a giant hogweed, given that it's size is so compact.
Cow parsnip can still cause skin damage tho
the flowers are pretty and look like Queen Anne’s lace. if I wasn’t familiar with these dangerous baby’s breath lookalikes I def would have been that deranged wannabe cottagecore girl checking it out 😬
ah, I was standing on a bench when taking this picture — I’m a short girl but it was taller than me 😅
Right but, it's something they'll find through regular maintenance. It's not an immediate hazard, it's unlikely that someone is going to cut it and touch the sap. I just wouldn't bother through the trouble of reporting.
LMFAO ""deranged wannabe cottagecore girl""
So this was maybe 7' tall?
I meant compared to a giant hogweed."
About to be a sophomore and I still don’t feel like a Berkeley student,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n271hv/about_to_be_a_sophomore_and_i_still_dont_feel/,2021-04-30 17:19:12,"I don’t even feel like a college student at all. I never walked the graduation stage in high school, I never went to grad parties, I never experienced a real in-person GBO, and I’ll never know what it’s like to have a dorm experience now that I’ve been denied on-campus housing for next semester. 

I just feel so dissociated from my life, as if I’m just an observer drifting by each day. For years I looked forward to the college experience but I haven’t even had a drop of it. 

Now I’m just left here with nothing but the insane workload that Berkeley gives, zoom lectures, and a whole lot of regrets. Just thinking about how much better life could’ve been sunk me into the deepest depression of my life for a while. I really wish that I didn’t go here considering how shit their housing situation is. I could’ve gone to any of the other colleges that I was accepted into and I definitely would’ve been able to have had the bare minimum of knowing what a dorm room is like. 

On the bright side, I was really motivated to pull myself out of my depression through my creative passion. I started learning how to produce and record music and I’m proud to say that I’m going to be releasing my first single in a few weeks. Making music has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and it feels like the only thing left that has given my life deeper meaning and happiness (which was needed, because life can feel especially meaningless in zoom lectures). 

All in all, I’m at a weird place in life right now. I was a straight-A student for all of my life until this this semester (failing 3 classes because depression and suicidal thoughts made it hard to focus), yet I’ve found true fulfillment through my music. I’m pulling myself out of this hole and I’m really grateful to still be alive and pushing forward, even if the covid situation sucks.

Maybe I don’t feel like a Bear, but at least I’m learning how to be happy again.","petition to give incoming sophomores a makeup GBO but without all the online orientation modules
about to be a junior and feel like i never really ended my freshman year
Honestly op, I feel. I’m a transfer student. I know I can’t relate to losing high school graduation and grad parties since I graduated from high school long before this pandemic. 

But I’ve been denied on-campus housing too, and my first year at university has been remote. I only have three more semesters here at cal and I feel like I’m not apart of the cal community in any shape or form. I feel like I hardly know anyone here, and I’m disappointed that I lost the opportunity to have on-campus housing.
I certainly feel this; I'm also a rising sophomore and I don't feel that ""college student"" vibe at all - not even close. We're all looking for to this Fall where we'll (hopefully) be able to set foot on campus :)
Spoiler alert: every freshman feels roughly the same way.  When everyone gets on campus next year, just start making up for lost time.

Example: Organize get togethers and stuff for sophomores, so everyone can meet each other and talk about what a shit time the COVID year was and how happy everyone is to be out of it and together now.  You all do have shared experience and common ground building bonds already, it just doesn't feel like it.  Make time to go out to parks, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. and meet others.

I'm completing a 1-year masters program and campus has been closed for the entirety of it.  I moved to the area anyway, not letting the pandemic take it all away, but got quite a different experience.  I'll never get the full experience, but it's OK.  You still will, though!

Honestly freshman year is usually kinda weird and messy and awkward anyway.  The years after are better.  You'll certainly have a unique college experience, probably more differentiated than pretty much all other classes of students in recent history.  This is an early exposure to lessons of life - you will likely have to deal with plenty of negative unexpected situations and ""get knocked down"" repeatedly.  But you're still just getting started.

Just keep movin forward! Keep your chin up and Go Bears.  :)
Hang in there young padawon they will reopen schools soon. It's one of those things we got dealt with. I'm super disappointed at the fact that I did all what I did and there's no big ceremony (graduation) but you know what as long as we find happiness these things start to become insignificant. Do your music, pump some good stuff out and share it with everyone. I'm so amazed at what technology allows us to do these days. Play that shit loud and you can pretty much create a party, all you need is stupid drunk ppl lol
From a rising senior who experienced in-person GBO, I wanted to say that I did not enjoy the experience at all and do not consider it to be a significant part of my college experience. Most of my friends say the same. (That is not to invalidate your feelings of missing out on the in-person experience.) 

If you want an experience similar to living in the dorms, try living in the co-ops! The social experience is vibrant and it's like living the dorms but with no RAs.
me too. i discovered baking & anime, but I just wish that phase had come earlier in 2020, back when I was salty about having to choose a college closer to home, about college apps, about staying at home etc.. wasted those precious free hours — I don’t even know if I still care about college
you will be fine just chill out
Yeah its been tough, I’m a rising sophomore and Ive never been to Cali or the west coast lol (I live in Georgia). I was supposed to visit after I heard back from places last may but ofc COVID. Hopefully next year will be more normal, I’m going living off campus too cuz ye I didnt get an offer for on-campus housing, but honestly I dont think we’ll miss too much being off campus because everyone is in the same boat.
Yo props to u for pushing through with ur creative endeavors. Super happy that you found a way to get through the not-so-great parts of ur experience the past year or two. U got a SoundCloud acc or sth? I’d be super down to give it a listen

Now this is a new level of sadness
Graduated at the beginning of the pandemic and now, a year later, it doesn’t actually feel like college is over.

Life really do be like that :/

To be fair, transfer students often feel a bit left out of the “college experience,” even before the pandemic. 
You’ll be graduating and have a UC Berkeley diploma all your life. The college years are a blip. 
Just be proud of yourself for getting through this.
Why were you denied on campus housing out of interest ?
Well said!
Sorry you’re getting down voted. This is actually some of the best advice for students pandemic or not. 
In your life, this is a sliver.
You’re right. All these people are way too stressed. I am a transfer student about to graduate. Got one and a half semesters on campus. Does it suck? Yes. Am I going to let it bring me down? Nope. 

Chill out people. It’s just college. Not the rest of your life.
Trueee. Thx. It’s so easy to get caught up in the moment and think stuff rn will have a monumental impact on my future. But ur right. This year has sucked for almost everyone. The great thing is that the pandemic is ending
I’m a Fall 2020 transfer. I’ve been at cal for a year. I decided to live at home during this year cause everything is remote. I applied for on campus housing for fall 2021-spring 2022. But was denied. I guess priority goes to newly admitted transfers/freshies
I mean, things you do do sometimes have a monumental impact. The fact that you’re so close to having a degree from UC Berkeley is monumental.  
I mean, really. But in the grand scope of this lifetime, these few years are going to be hazy. 

It’s like worrying about the difference between an A and A-, it’s still an A.

With CS/DS I’d graduate in 4.5","The job market right now is influenced by the Fed increasing interest rates to fight inflation. And for tech roles specifically, there's the added issue that tech companies over-hired during COVID and now can't afford their investment in new employees due to the interest rates. Once inflation is under control and the Fed starts lowering interest rates things will get back to normal for tech workers.
AFAIK the CS requirements are mostly math, I think EECS has more physics and data science has more stats? Honestly I would go with whatever you think you'll do better in, a 4.0 or 3.9 is probably what you need to be competitive with even DS being capped now. 

CS is still worth it imo but you will not find a job as easily as 2021/2022 when everyone was hiring like mad.
Stay in CS. It’s the better version of EECS w no bs classes that you are required to take, especially now that there is basically no GPA requirement.

Any role that you could get w a data science major you can also get with a CS major but not the other way around. 

You can also take all the EE/EECS classes as a CS major so if you ever decide to go into hardware, the door is open.

Edit: also, double majoring is feasible unlike in COE where you would need to take close to max units a semester to do that
Little to no difference between CS and EECS. DS could probably get you the same jobs, but some of the good CS classes are restricted to EECS and CS
we are never going back to normal lol
Double majoring in ee/cs? Confused 🫤 Yeah I’m a transfer that’ll be able to apply to to all the ucs but my top choices are UCSD, ucsb, ucsc, Berkeley and then maybe ucla idk. I like the beach and a good program. I wanna have job offers after graduation and internships during my two years at the school. I feel like Berkeley will help me make the most.
are you serious or is this satire?
In COE you will need to do random hard classes if you want to double major basically.
No? What do u think is off here
What year are you and have you gotten any internships? How has it been for ya
ur argument that cs is a better version of eecs? i’m trying to be neutral, and even with that i can see more upsides to eecs than cs . plus your bio 💀
Luckily I did, yes. Berkeley will provide opportunities but you have to put in work.
Haha yeah I’m an eecs major.. and I’d rather have done CS because there was no point in me lowering my GPA by getting Bs in classes that I would have never taken as a CS major.

I feel like if u r going the general swe route or want to double major , CS is better than EECS

Edit: out of curiosity , What do you think is better about EECS?
yeah so i’m a cs major, but feel extremely limited abt my future career options. i’m confident that an eecs degree could’ve broadened my career to go into deep electrical engineering fields like developing cpus and gpus , and i want to do those stuff. im considering transferring from here to be able to get those opportunities. i really don’t want my future to be limited the general path of CS DEGREE -> SWE, 

tldr: i just wanna do more, cooler stuff
You still have access to all those ee classes though.. unless u just want ur degree title to include ee

hey OP can you please elaborate… I’m really passionate about the subject and as an incoming freshman this post is scaring me.
Thank you for sharing your experience. I’m actually pursuing a similar academic path (double majoring in history and political science) and I was curious what career path you chose. 

I’m in a bit of a rut in regards to what to do after college and I would be interested in knowing what you did! :)
Sure. Suzanne and Efrat (major advisors) were amazing & always very responsive. Courses are indeed large but once you become an upperclassman (even for sophomores) seminars open up, which are usually discussion sized. Be judicious in your class selections and grade deflation isn't a problem at all, particularly for the upper division classes. OP has obviously had a different experience than I had with the program, but there are plenty of redeeming qualities about the program.
Don’t be scared :) everything is going to be challenging but it’s up to yourself if it’s worth it. Study something you want to pursue especially if you see a future for yourself in it, and try the experience out for yourself first rather than letting someone else’s experience paint your story.
I did what many other social science and humanities majors end up doing - I went to law school 😄. Although I originally considered pursuing graduate work in history or political science - intending to become a college professor - research and reflection persuaded me not to pursue that career path, primarily for two reasons. First, a PhD would take too long to achieve (approximately 7-8 years, possibly up to a decade), and second, the state of the job market for PhDs was horrible. Simply put, it was extraordinarily difficult to land a tenure-track teaching position. Just not worth the risk after nearly a decade of graduate work. Law school?  Three years and you’re done.  Occasionally I still have a wistful thought of “what if,” but realistically I don’t regret my decision.

Feeling Extremely Unmotivated: Hiring Someone to Beat My Ass When I'm not doing work For $10/day + Studying Space in my apartment. Non STEM majors only (don’t want you to know wtf I’m working on lol),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/195taoz/feeling_extremely_unmotivated_hiring_someone_to/,2024-01-13 09:34:49,"Tldr: I am having discipline issues and need someone to monitor my progress every 30 minutes. If I get caught slacking the 2nd time per day, I will get beaten.   


2 things that lead to my inclination to slack off: 

1. Thinking that not doing it won't hurt in the short run, or don't think what I'm doing is important, where it actually is, 
2. The task is too annoying, which makes me want to slack off for some time before coming back to it

2 sources of incentives/drive:

1. Passion
2. being pressured & having immediate consequences

A lot of things that I am interested in can be driven by passion, but for things that I hate doing yet still very important, I have to motivate myself through the second method, which is having someone monitor my progress at regular intervals. 

**Context(Explains why I am hiring someone for this, and convince that this isn't a troll post):** I'm far from a disciplined person, and often choose to slack off and get distracted due to not having enough motivation to do stuff. This upcoming semester I am taking 3 techs + English, doing projects w/ a few people, applying for clubs, and applying for jobs. Since I'm gonna have a lot of stuff to do every day, I might not have any free time, not even time to j\_\_\_ off, but that's fine. What I am worried about is that sometimes when I am finished with class work, I fall into a false sense of security that I can start slacking, when in reality I still have tons of other work to do. I need someone to check me in every 30 minutes to make sure I'm being productive all the time whenever I can and follow my plans. School work is semi-easy and trivial for me, because all the materials are given to me, all I need to do is pay attention and spend time to understand everything and get carried by my IQ during exams. As long as I understand all the materials presented to me, it's impossible to get worse than A-. However, works outside school aren't as trivial and straightforward: often you encounter information or challenges that may not have been covered in your formal education, which requires you to explore and perform research on these topics. This demands a higher level of motivation because, unlike school work where everything is fed into you, you need to actively seek out new information. In addition, you often get thrown into unfamiliar situations and don't know what to do next, you try out something and you don't even know whether it will work, or even on the right path. This repetitive cycle of not getting desirable results and bewilderment makes me feel annoyed and kills my motivation, which is one of the biggest reasons to slack off/procrastinate. 

I know this is a very unconventional way of making myself do work, but I don't care, I will do whatever it takes for me to reach the desired result. 

&#x200B;

**Job description:** Every day I will list out tasks that I'm supposed to be doing in a specific time frame. Let's say a task is 3 hours long, for every 30 minutes remind me of the time and check to make sure I made some reasonable amount of progress. If I don't make a reasonable amount of progress for lets say the second time, I deserve to get beat. I haven't decided what to beat me with, for now I go with hanger because that's what my mom used to beat me with when I was young (not anymore because nowadays she just hopes I don't violate any laws). By using hanger, it will give me a flashback of my mom, serving extra emotional damage, which should be pretty effective.

**If you often struggle to find a study place or like to beat someone up, you are a great fit for this job!** Feel free to DM me or add my discord: beechasny","I'm ngl, whether you're conscious of it or not, this reads like some major bdsm kink

Why not do this with an arduino instead?
Actually I suffered from no motivation for a while. What helped was getting enough sleep, nutrition, getting exercise, and removing a lot of social media. Also kinda random but getting sun or vitamin d esp is important. After that, you should try to do work for a certain amount of time a day. It shouldn’t need any motivation and you should want yourself to do it. After doing this for a while it’s built up to a habit for me and I’ve struggled less with this no motivation bs. Hope it might help.

Maybe a better first step would be to get one of those pomodoro timers. I'd be kinda surprised if there wasn't one on AliExpress that let you record your mom saying ""Take break now"" and ""GET YOUR ASS BACK TO WORK""

It’s kind of a win win because you get to study in my apartment, which is way better than moffit cuz good lighting, quiet asf and not crowded
true
Can confirm. Was undiagnosed during my first year of college and I felt like my brain was grinding gears constantly then I slipped into a depression and withdrew from my future semesters. Got diagnosed, started taking my medicine, now I can just sit and study without needing a break every 2 minutes. It helps to get a formal diagnosis. I thought maybe I didn’t need it because I was probably just lazy or something. Not true. Brain was not normal
This is a good thing to know lol
LMFAO

The truth is I feel this is just gonna be another time being wasted. I already screwed last semester and the previous one I chose to withdraw without any real plans on what to do next.

So two semesters with failed academic progress and not able to get any financial aid even if I choose to go back later… haha.. what a wonderful time we’re living in right now.

Thanks for letting me know my maximum capacity, Berkeley. I think this is it for me and my poor life. Bye.","Please don't let this set you back, I withdrew from Berkeley back in 2018 due to severe mental health issues. I failed most of my classes in my last year at Berkeley, I hate how difficult this has made my academic career but what is done is done. I'm finally readmitting this fall with a few cc classes under my belt, a sense of direction, and overall better mental health. Please take this semester off to really work on your mental health and set yourself up for success this fall if you choose to readmit. :)
Take this time to really reflect and construct a plan, a plan that fits your needs and ambitions in life, and most importantly, improve your mental health. It’s really important you are emotionally well enough to continue taking courses as it be quite overwhelming dealing with classes and your mental health at the same time. there’s no rush to graduate, and i really do wish that you get better (:
Sounds like you're on the right track! You'd be surprised how common this is. Young adulthood is a tough time emotionally for everyone, and to put on top of that a pandemic and a school and city like Berkeley understandably is just too much.  


Take this time to work or decompress in other ways. When you feel better you can think about school, but this time, I would suggest considering the overall environment when choosing a school. You don't have to come back to Berkeley. There are schools that are going to have environments that are more supportive and easier to feel good at. Going to such a big school in an urban environment doesn't provide what a lot of people need.
Even if you’re doing “nothing”, you’re doing something. Rest is equally important to your personal growth as traditionally “productive” tasks. It’s great that you are getting professional mental help! 

One thing you can be mindful of is how “restful” your rest is. Give room for you mind to wander and reflect by not constantly relying on distractions like scrolling social media or  bingeing shows or playing video games all day.
Thank you so much 😊

imo the tests are actually fair, and the things you mentioned reviewing does help a ton. The main issue most people perceive with the class is the workload, and focusing on some odd things. The content is genuinely interesting, but we often have too much work to enjoy stuff, and sometimes we focus on niche ideas in linear algebra, which takes time away from bigger concepts. Tbh if the series was like 3 or 4 classes instead of 2 it’d prob actually be a really fair workload, and let us hit every cool idea without rushing over things."

He’ll look a bit shabby- his coat is a bit blotchy and more brown than red, and he smells a bit like the steak that I forgot on my countertop for a few days. If you ask about his reindeer, he’ll point his antlers towards the nearby forest and you can hear them murmuring. He’s a bit twitchy from the cold, and he’s so anxious to get in that he’ll just smile (I think it’s a smile?) and let himself in. Poor man must be freezing....

He goes straight to your bathroom to take a bath and warm himself up. He’s so jolly, he sings pretty loudly while he washes, and he bangs around a bit in the tub to the tune of his singing. He never cleans up after himself though, so I have to scrub the mess off the walls every time after he leaves.

He’ll leave a few presents under the tree before he goes early in the morning, but they always rot before I manage to open them. One of my family always gets sick after he leaves as well- their nose won’t stop bleeding, and they’ll turn pale and droopy. If only Santa wore a mask-then my family wouldn’t have gotten sick and would be able to speak right now.

Anyway, even though Santa isn’t the best guest sometimes, he’s still full of holiday cheer and I can’t wait to see him again! Since I haven’t been on campus for Christmas Day before, I was just wondering what Santa does here if you don’t have a chimney        （＾ω＾）","Pretty sure that after 15 minutes of waiting he’s legally allowed to leave

TA Here - I DON’T support the strike stopping those from wanting to teach,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/z0sdvn/ta_here_i_dont_support_the_strike_stopping_those/,2022-11-20 23:11:05,"First let me preface that I understand the issues being faced and understand unfair pay. I don’t think it’s fair how little the GSIs are being paid

What I don’t agree with is insulting those who want to continue to teach for the enjoyment of helping others 

I was too afraid to speak up against my other fellow TAs regarding the strike and I didn’t want to cancel my section. I love teaching and yes I want to get paid more but at the same time I want to teach and learn how to explain things better  

I don’t feel comfortable talking to the other TAs about my opinion because I didn’t want people to start hating me. 

I am sorry for those who I didn’t get a chance to help finish the rest of the semester. I understand the situation","…so, assuming you are actually a GSI (kinda weird that you call yourself a TA since that’s not the language used for the position, and your statement itself is unsophisticated, and veers into bait-y: “I didn’t want people to start hating me”). Are you perhaps an undergraduate student instructor? If so, I’m sorry to you and the other undergrads who have been put into such a difficult position, on the back of an enormously difficult past few years. 

But… most of the people who are striking love to teach. That’s why they’ve been doing it on a unsurvivable income for years, and that’s ultimately why they are striking now: so they can afford to eat, have safe housing, and weather small emergencies without having to forgo their food, housing, and/or position at Berkeley. It’s easier to explain things better when you aren’t hungry, unable to ever spring for a ride share when you aren’t feeling safe walking or biking back home late, unable to travel to attend a loved one’s funeral without going into debt, unable to leave a bad relationship because of housing dependence, and/or constantly filled with fear about life.
it is completely fine to miss teaching and feel disappointed you arent holding section anymore. 

besides that this is a totally dismissive, unproductive, and belittling take on the strike lmao do better
Please take a moment to realize the selfishness of your position. You are willing to go against the needs of thousands of other TA’s because you want to “learn how to explain things better”. I am not trying to insult you, I just want to be firm in making sure you understand that your refusal to stand in line with your coworkers is supremely insulting to all of us.
Yes, the Strike definitely puts on a lot of pressure for those graduate students who could tolerate low wages. The same goes for research - those of us who love research and are personally invested are now being pressured to halt. 

However, I have come to understand that striking is the right thing to do if you do love teaching and you do love research. If this strike succeeds, it will set the standard for fair wages offered by public schools to graduate students and draw more brilliant minds into research/teaching/graduate work. 

At first, I was opposed to the strike because my research could not afford interruptions. Now I have learned that my participation in this strike is much bigger than myself. And, research/teaching will always have their day to shine in the future.

 If you feel that the needs of the students in your section outweigh all of the GSIs/GSRs/Post-docs earning a living wage, it's your life to live.

Don't try to justify your selfish actions, live your life.

How tf did they know so fast that I parked without paying?","The meters have small flashing LED lights that face the street that flash red or green depending if you've paid the meter or not.  You can see the lights from up the block or across the street.

Good tip to see if there is still time on a meter you can see the blinking green light on it so you can score some free time on the parking meter when you are looking for parking.

The meter maid carts also have license plate scanners so they can scan plates and write a ticket quickly too.
bruh they really want your money
They get notified when the meters run out and they go out to check on them. There are meter maids roving around campus all the time who are no more than a few minutes out on checking these- they're fully funded by the parking fees so its critical they don't miss anyone who's improperly parked.
Do they really not have parking meters where you are from?
FWIW I got fucked yesterday too, in SF. I parked on an unfamiliar street for like 20 minutes with a sign that said no parking from 12pm to 2pm on the first and third Thursday of the month.  For some reason I thought yesterday was Wednesday first of all, and I paralleled park between 2 cars, so no, stupid me, I didn’t read any signs.  I literally came back to the car at 12:05pm and voila, an $83 ticket.

Not that hard.
They rarely chalk now except for 72-hour abandoned vehicle checks.  Chalking cars was found unconstitutional in a landmark case and Berkeley Police and many departments have eliminated that practice:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/tire-chalk-parking-unconstitutional.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/tire-chalk-parking-unconstitutional.html) 

Back in 2016 the city bought the license plate scanners and then in 2019 they stopped issuing stickers for the residential permits.  

Residents now register their license plate online and the city just scans them as they drive down a block.  The little 3-wheel carts scan plates and have GPS locators so non-resident vehicles that don't have a permit are recorded with their parking location and time stamped.  The meter maids come back and if your car is still there the computer red flags it for citation.

They even scan plates and can find stolen cars that way or determine that the car has 3+ unpaid citations and then install a boot on the cars.

I was reading someone up above basically explaining to you how modern parking enforcement works while shaking my head but it all makes sense now lol.

The real issue is that you parked on **the** major downtown commercial throughfare during **lunch** hours. Enforcement is always higher on Shattuck but it's increased  during high traffic hours because they know they're more likely catch someone like you slippin.

But also, welcome to Berkeley. I once read that the city of Berkeley earns more parking enforcement revenue per capita than anywhere else in the nation. I don't know if that's true but I would believe it. Oakland is bad, San Francisco is worse, but no where I've been compares to Berkeley.

They don't get notified when meters expire (aside from the metering light indicator) but their routing and street coverage is pretty sophisticated.

Pay extra close attention to signage, particularly residential parking time limits and street sweeping!

Saw some discourse about it in comments and wondering what y’all think lol (they were a Berkeley student)

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/xtqtwm)","CalFresh is used as an assistance. If you really need it and qualify then use it. Your money is allotted to you and what you use doesn’t take away from anyone else. That being said I don’t think it’s wrong if you meet the criteria.

They set the requirements carefully, if they say you qualify then you should take advantage of it imo.
i mean if you qualify you’re allowed to use it.
As long as you aren’t scamming/lying in your application it’s fine. If they are spending what little discretionary income on eating out it doesn’t make them any less deserving of someone who is on foot stamps but let’s say has a MTG habit or likes to go bowling couple times a week.
I mean it’s pretty hard to use calfresh as a student already, they require you to work like 20 hours a week while in school or satisfy a different thing like no family contribution or get cal grant and you need to have income below like $2k for one person. if they qualify they qualify. calfresh is on a sliding scale based on how much your income is so it’s definitely not something that’s super easy to scam 

not to mention you can’t live in the dorms and use calfresh with ucb’s auto enrolled meal plan 👎🏻
I mean people get dsp accommodations all the time even though they don't need it so it's less bad than that 🤷‍♂️
Moral punt. Can doesn't mean should.
agreed. i don’t think they should but it’s not against any policies. i qualify for cal fresh myself but i don’t use it because i don’t need it.

Cal guy is in the bathroom taking a leak when a Stanfurd guy walks in and goes to the urinal next to him. Cal guy finishes and starts to walk out of the restroom. Stanfurd guy sees Cal guy doesn't wash his hands and smugly says, ""At Stanfurd they teach us to wash our hands.""

Cal guy replies, ""AT Cal they teach us to not piss on our hands.""
there are so many germs about the urinal splash back becomes negligible
Same reason that I don't shower. The stench repels people. Can't get cooties when you have a 5 foot stink forcefield around you.
God this was me at the dorms like wtf are y'all doing?? Nothing in here is clean, at least do yourself a small favor by not contracting E. coli
I carry cleanser wipes in my purse and use that, too many germs on those sink handles/hand dryers.
PSA: 
Most people don’t wash their hands correctly.

The correct method:
https://www.cdc.gov/features/handwashing/index.html

The most important step is to SCRUB for at least 20 seconds. It’s more important than using soap which literally does nothing for disinfection by itself.
I lick my hands after using the bathroom. If it doesn't taste bad, then that means i don't have to wash them. Go bears

I recovered for two weeks until I got discharged two days ago. Now I have a mountain of things to catch up. I’m so lost.

Is withdrawing the only option? I already paid 2/5 of tuition for this semester but had to stop everything from Week 4. Idk what week it is now but it seems impossible to get good grades based on how much the classes have progressed so far. It’s not even worth doing it if I become stressed as hell all over again and collapse again. Then it’d all be a waste of time and effort. 

Anyway I have until next Monday to catch up. I think some will be willing to extend the deadline, but even then I don’t think I could handle anything beyond simply laying on my bed and forgetting everything that happened for two weeks from now. Like bruh I need time to recover after a heavy ride. Maybe Berkeley isn’t for me... it’s not just bc of this.. I regretted that decision since last month so maybe I should leave when everything is already set as if I’m destined to be out of this school. No offense to anyone. I had no problems with people, it’s just my personal issue with the cost and overall culture.. Please let me know what I can do.",">lung collapse

>""Maybe Berkeley isn't for me""

Give yourself some slack, the inflatable meat balloon that keeps you alive just popped. It's logistically and objectively a difficult situation, regardless if you did feel like you belong at Berkeley or not.

The medical issues and your self esteem are two different things that independently feed into how you'll do at Berkeley.

That being said, there are concrete resources for the former. Talk to your professors about working out an incomplete, basically to extend your semester to be able to finish the courses. There is also a possibility (under misc. policies) that you could work out reduced course-load somewhere along the way, which should allow you to finish your courses. Email your academic advisor and set up an appointment ASAP - they will know the answers to this. If you're under 8 units, you may qualify for tuition reduction of ~1/2. (there's a deadline, ask about it)

And at the end of the day, withdrawing won't be all that bad, just gives you a little more time to get through school at a pace right for you. Especially in your case, it'll be easily granted, and they'll let you back in p much no problemo.

Edit: Disclaimer that it's probably going to be a stretch of hard road ahead of you. I won't downplay anything to be easy, but there are options and hopefully, your outreach for additional help will be answered.
I am so sorry you are going through this right now. Honestly withdrawl might be your best option because, like you said, you need time to recover. Maybe you could reach out to an advisor or try the student advocates office if you’re looking into a medical withdrawal. But there are definitely options :) you still could definitely reach out to an advisor about dropping some of your units or switching to p/np late due to your unique situation which is something I was able to do just last week (after the drop deadline). Or reach out to DSP about temporary medical accommodations for this semester. I have been in your shoes before, feeling like there’s no good reason to carry on at this university, but I promise there are networks of support out there to help get you through this.
Worst case you can p/np if your courses suck.
[deleted]
Thank you. Exactly what I needed.
How would changing every class to pnp help me achieve satisfactory grades? By this point I’m aiming at best to literally pass the course and get the units I deserve. 

Also how is a medical withdrawal different from the normal one? I have heard someone leaving the course as Incomplete and doing it the next semester or over the summer. This was my first time having lung collapse, but there’s no guarantee it will be the last, so I am cautious about it, i.e. next semester might be just as bad as this one.
Thank you. I initially contacted GSIs for all of my classes and asked for a three week extension for every assignment. Next Monday is when everything should be finished. I haven’t contacted them thereafter. I doubt they would give me more time, and even if they do there’s simply too much to do in a short time frame when my body is still getting healed.

But I can also see your point about withdrawing. I agree there’s not much I can do at this point if I choose to withdraw. I guess the best choice then is to pnp some classes and come up with valid excuses for my low gpa later?
Absolutely talk to DSP. These situations are exactly what they’re there for. Disability status can change at any time. Moreover, they’ll know of the more complex, less known options that exist.
1 week follow up - how are you doing? Find any answers? What are you feeling, or thinking about?
I emailed the Tang center to verify my illness. They haven’t replied but I will use that to extend deadlines for my classes. 

I’m still recovering but I’m almost back to normal now. The only thing that still bothers me is going back to studying. For some reason I just can’t resume. I know it doesn’t make sense to drop out just because I was ill for some weeks but it really blew everything I had suppressed up until the D-day. So it’s really hard to go back doing what partially contributed to the illness. The only thing that’s still keeping me from withdrawing is the number of units I will miss this semester. Also I don’t think I can get a refund for 40% of this semester’s tuition that’s already paid. It’s not looking good."

You only have to be in Bio 1A and Chem 3B to declare ([http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring)).
I don't know of any stats requirement for that major. 10A/10B is definitely preferred, but the Math 1 series works as well!
Honestly math 10B wasn't bad, it dealt a lot with distributions, CLT, permutations/combinations, etc... I would stick with the 10 series (it was pretty interesting as well)
Nope. Stats is not required to graduate
Fax, 10a’s pretty interesting as well. I have nothing against the professor, the mc exams were just terrible.
Ah, thanks for pointing that out. Not sure if OP is premed, but if they are stats is a prereq for a lot of med schools. Math 10A and 10B would fulfill that, but if they take 1B I think it would be in their interest to take it."

Samantha stood in the middle of the main stacks at the library, her phone pressed to her ear as she chattered away. She had been waiting for her friend to finish studying for their upcoming exam and had grown bored, so she had decided to call a friend to catch up.  
As she talked, she failed to notice the annoyed looks and shushes from the other patrons who were trying to study in the quiet library. She thought she was being perfectly reasonable, after all, she was only having a conversation with a friend.  
But as she continued to talk, the noise level in the library began to rise. More and more people were starting to get annoyed by her loud talking, and soon enough, a librarian approached her and politely asked her to keep her voice down.  
Samantha was taken aback. She had no idea that she was being so loud and causing a disturbance. She apologized profusely to the librarian and the other patrons and quickly ended her phone call.  
From then on, she made sure to be more mindful of her volume when in the library, and she even started using the designated quiet study rooms for her phone conversations. She didn't want to be the reason that someone else couldn't concentrate on their work."

Where do I get my cap and gown from? HOW do I register for L&S or the psych department graduation (neither of them have info on this)? How do I register for the commencement? It’s still not open for registration.,"They will send you an email in a month or so for the main one. The psych department will likely not have a graduation until the spring.
Around the end of October, you will be getting an email with information on how to obtain tickets for the winter graduation ceremony (probably at Haas Pavilion) and obtaining your cap and gown.  Do note that you don’t have to attend this graduation, you could also attend the Spring 2023 one instead (or the Spring 2022 one which you obviously did not do).  Or none at all. Undergrad Department graduations are always in the Spring, usually on a morning or afternoon on the week after the college-wide undergrad graduation. 

Cap, tassel, stole, and gown can be obtained (maybe) at the bookstore,  or online thru the Cal Student Store.  The regalia set together costs roughly $85 IIRC. Some departments/organizations may provide cords as well (different from a tassel).  Regalia is optional, though I would say that 90% of the students do come with regalia.

The main thing you want to triple check, pretty much now, is to make sure all your graduation requirements are met and that your EGT is set to your desired date.  For some majors, (like CS) the APR report might not be 100% accurate and you may want/need to go over things with a department major advisor."
