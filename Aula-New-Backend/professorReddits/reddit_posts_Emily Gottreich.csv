Global 45 for historical studies breadth?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dx12nx/global_45_for_historical_studies_breadth/,2019-11-15 18:43:05,"Just wonder how is global 45 (SP20 = Emily R Gottreich) for historical studies breadth?  How's the workload for it (reading, etc) (compared to Anthro 2AC)?","Um, I don't know who these other commentators are, or if they know anything about UC Berkeley social science classes (Global Studies is a social science and not a humanities discipline), but that class should probably not be taken as a breath unless you REALLY like world history.

Global 45 (formerly known as ias 45) is a required course for all Political Economy and Global Studies majors. It's like our version of CS 61A. If you get below a B, you automatically fail out of the major (and go to polisci or legal studies lol). They curve it to make sure plenty of people don't make the cut, so we don't overload the major.

Yeah, don't take this class expecting a fun easy time. Go with Anthro 2AC - a true breath class.

(Evidence: you used to be able to skip out of this major requirement with AP world history, but they changed it because the class is much harder than AP world. And it's in one semester, not a full year.)
Lower-division humanities class? 

Easy
Itâ€™s not that bad but the class is more about themes through history then exploring particular events in detail. Covered 500 years in one lecture kind of thing"
