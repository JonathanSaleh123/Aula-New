Math 53, Suncica Canic

Physics 5A, Andrew Charman

English R1B, Alba Tomasula y Garcia","Looks good to me, that's a very standard freshman/sophomore year schedule. Two classes for your major, one for school requirements, and one for fun (and maybe school requirements). 

And the best way to prepare is to just take your mind off of it and enjoy your break! If you haven't done any calc in a while you *could* do a bit of recap (look over a math 1A and 1B syllabus and make sure you're at least acquainted with everything) but really only do it if you're stressed. You'll be best served just resting up and establishing a good daily routine again
Your schedule looks good, but just a little heads up on 5A.

I took physics 5A first semester and my friends took Charman 5B and 89. Long story short, I highly recommend you review math 1B stuff and even get a little ahead on math 53 for 5A. Some topics from math 53 that show up early in 5A are vectors, some multiple integrals (gravitation), vector calculus (force along a path), and some basic partial derivatives. You don't HAVE to know these as they will be taught but it makes the physics easier if you already know the math.

5A was a pretty challenging class and Charman is notorious for being a tough professor to have because of general difficulty (exams and assignments) and course load. He has mixed reviews on Rate My Professor but his classes are generally considered difficult regardless. If my expectations hold, 5A with Charman will be quite tough. Best piece of advice, find a study group and go to OH/HW parties.
canic is great, shouldn't be too bad. Go to office hours!!!!
Language classes are hard. Even if the grade distribution is good, they can be more work than you’re expecting. Meeting every day is a lot. Just keep that in mind."
Is discussion Attendance Mandatory?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/109koem/is_discussion_attendance_mandatory/,2023-01-11 16:16:29,hey yall. I am taking physics 89 with professor Ori Ganor and Physics 5a with professor Andrew Charman this spring semester. Do you know if discussion attendance is mandatory for them? I am going to have time conflicts with discussions during the first 3 ish weeks of class.,"Yes
Don’t take lower Division physics courses
Got it, thank you for the reply. If you don't mind me asking, for which class is discussion attendance mandatory, physics 89 or physics 5a?"
Who is the coolest physics prof?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/19601h2/who_is_the_coolest_physics_prof/,2024-01-13 14:28:15,"By cool, I mean on a personal level (ignoring their research). Do you have any anecdotes? Something inspiring or quirky? ","Oppenheimer.  

There's a story about him that after he had been teaching at Cal for a while, a group of his students came privately to the Chair of the Physics Department and said they were really worried because Professor Oppenheimer was so brilliant and went so fast in class with his theories and teaching that they couldn't follow along with him. 

Then, separately, Oppenheimer came to the chair and confessed he thought he was failing his students because he wasn't giving them all the information he wanted / needed to give them.
Albert Einstein
Prof. Michael DeWeese! I loved his drawings in free body diagrams, remember him drawing a knight on a horse on the board to analyze
Nathan Lowhorn for sure! I took physics 8A with him in spring 2022, and he was always so fun! He was quite energetic and entertaining, and he loved to crack random jokes and make all sorts of fun noises. 

It's always great when you see a professor genuinely having fun at their job.

Prof. Andrew Charman. No further questions.
Steven strogatz
I can attest to this, as I was one of his students.

He also frequented the topic of receiving “Sloppenheimer”—perhaps, this was the crux of his research."
