Requesting a D+ to be considered a P,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gl8l2p/requesting_a_d_to_be_considered_a_p/,2020-05-16 20:42:36,It seems like I'm going to a receive a D+ for one of the classes I p/nped. What are the chances that if I reach out to a professor they may agree to this.,"Hilfinger is really understanding, best bet is to email him!
61b?
Depends on the class/professor
There are some classes that have supposedly said a D+ is normally a P, which was surprising.
You got nothing to lose by trying, eh?
You got this man. Good luck!
ty, will give it a shot
yea
61b hilfinger, really close to the cutoff
It’s worth a try. I’m sure if you have reasonable predicament that can explain your grade, Hilfinger would be willing to consider bumping your grade up. You have nothing to lose at this point"
anyone else fail a class this semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18lozs4/anyone_else_fail_a_class_this_semester/,2023-12-18 17:01:35,"im coping so hard i need ppl to cope with me 😹 we gotta lock in next sem 🫡

p.s. like actually FAIL FAIL. Not a C, not a B-, but F or a D.","2 out of 3 failed; probably gonna be put on probation
Didn’t fail this sem but failed last sem. I think everyone should go through failing at least once, was a truly humbling experience that I think taught me a lot of valuable lessons, even if I did have to learn them the hard way.
I might be, I have a 47 in p-chem 💀 it’ll take a miracle to count that as passing
Got 2 credits out of 14 this semester. Locking in this semester no matter what, even doing pre studying before the course by looking at the courses syllabus. Was not surprised I got the grades I got but even then I didnt sleep for 32 hours because I was trying to study for an exam I was alr 4 chapters behind on.
I don’t know yet! Imposter syndrome says my burn-out papers are dreadful and that I somehow sabotaged getting my degree.

I am am so sorry you’re experiencing this, it is my anxiety nightmare right now 😭
Im already on academic probation (medical withdrawal had to take incompletes in the spring) so I’m still finding out if I did, but hopefully it won’t be the end of the world. There must be a way through to the other side i refuse to just give up.
Failed data 100 this sem, didn’t turn in a whole project and procrastinated studying until the night before, definitely will turn it around next sem
me, you're not alone man
definitely failed one, might fail two, and petitioning to continue on probation. you are not alone
Failed 1 of 3. Realized prof was full of shit early on, I wasn’t going to learn much, had no more late drops, and a subject I wasn’t interested in but just needed for unit minimum. Did 0 assignments and only went to the first lecture. I PNP’d it so it wouldn’t affect my GPA / and I’m not going to grad school so I could care less. On the bright side it let me really focus on my current classes and I ended up  enjoying them so much I plan on picking up a major/minor for it.
Halfway through last semester I decided to fail my hardest class, CS182, to do well in the others. I retook it this semester and I feel like I did very well (final exam is still being graded)
hey, B- is a decent grade.
Yup, at least in one of my classes.
Is C- okay for passing a lower division or do you need to get a C ? Just wanna know if I have to retake this class next semester 😭
OMG meee i thought I was the only one😭 I feel so awful I legit did my very best but I feel like it was all for nothing I feel so stupid and worthless I hate myself what’s even more embarrassing is that the class I failed is considered an “easy” class
Nah
I failed in EECS127, think I got a B+ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We're gonna be fine...hopefully... I don't know how to process this
Did you take the class the semester after you took it? How did you handle it if you don't mind me asking
i feel like those classes r curved hella but im really not sure how that goes 🥲 rooting for u
that's gonna be curved to a B
homie I was right there w you
i have a rly similar grade (for me it's a flat out 50) and usually i wouldn't be worried but this semester the averages have been rly high so idek anymore 🥲
WE'RE LOCKING INNNN i'm not retaking this class next sem but in the summer probably, but im already pre-studying for next sem's classes bec they're gonna be equally hard, may i say even harder
Keep us updated!
bold ass move lmao. glad it works out though
Update: I did very well 👍
there are some ppl who consider B- a failing grade :(( I do consider it decent
Depends on department. But for my major (MCB), a C- is sufficient for declaration
WE CAN PULL THROUGH THIS
[deleted]
K A-, I take it
Yeah I actually just passed it finally. It felt easier than the first time and since I tried a lot harder I realized what I was doing wrong and was able to turn it around.
[deleted]
My grades were just fixed and updated in the system. My imposter syndrome was wrong, I did very well this semester
Two of my grades have finally been posted… those are good. I’m still waiting on one last class, I’m not certain when they intend to post them 😓

I feel like I’m holding my breath waiting for certainty.
Unironically thanks for sharing and being specific. 🫡
Ahhh okay thank you!
I was just answering the question
Any tips on how to add the failed class to my next semesters schedule? The class is closed and idk what to do 😭
update us!!
Love that for you 🥹
[deleted]
Shit I have no idea. Probably email the head prof as well as talk to an advisor.
A miracle did happen. A 47 in a 70 average class counted as a C. I’ll delete my comments later. 

Lock in next sem! I’ll C myself out of the cry sesh.

EE16B P/NP OPTION!!! Potentially dropped as a requirement in the future.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tshev0/ee16b_pnp_option_potentially_dropped_as_a/,2022-03-30 13:00:33,"You are receiving this email because you are an L&S student currently enrolled in EECS16B. This message is to inform you of two important changes to L&S CS graduation requirements.

* ***Effective immediately***: A grade of P in EECS16B earned during Spring 2022 will satisfy the graduation requirements for L&S CS for all students, regardless of graduation year. 
* ***Pending approval*** from the College of Letters and Sciences: The EECS16B graduation requirement may be removed entirely for L&S CS students. We anticipate that this decision will be made by L&S between April 5th and 8th. We have no indication whether L&S will accept this proposal, so do not drop the class assuming that it will be approved.

**Please note that if you opt to P/NP a course, you must earn a grade of C- or better to receive a P.** In other words, if you change from a letter grade to P/NP, and earn a D+, you will receive a grade of NP. A grade of NP is not sufficient to graduate. 

Warning: In Spring 2021, during the period of special pandemic exceptions, many students changed their grading option to P/NP and earned a grade of D. Such students were thus given an NP.  Late petitions to convert a grade back from NP to a grade of D were denied by L&S, in some cases delaying graduation. We anticipate any such late petitions will be denied again.

**Do not contact me, the EECS16B staff, or the EECS16B professors for questions or clarifications about this policy change.**

**For questions or clarifications, email either Director of Undergraduate Affairs Antoine Davis** at [antoined@eecs.berkeley.edu](mailto:antoined@eecs.berkeley.edu) **or the cs-advising team** at [cs-advising@eecs.berkeley.edu](mailto:cs-advising@eecs.berkeley.edu).

Clarifications:

* This policy has no impact on EECS students, i.e. EECS students must still take EECS16B for a letter grade, and the course will continue to be required for the EECS major.
* The P/NP change in this policy applies only to L&S CS students taking EECS16B during the Spring 2022 semester, and has no impact on the letter grade requirement for EECS16B taken in any other semester, past or future.
* This policy has no impact on graduation requirements for other L&S majors.

What about kids double majoring in CS and data science? Can we pnp ee16b?
Let's go guys! Make sure L&S hear us as well by signing this petition to remove EE16B major requirement. 

https://www.change.org/p/remove-the-ee-16b-requirement-for-cs-majors-at-uc-berkeley
Is this an April fools joke?
Hasn't people been asking for this since the 60's or 70's. I swear i saw like a blog or something from back then about students complaining about this class hahaha
This has been posted in another thread, but choose your PNP option wisely.  If you intend on being a DS major, either as perhaps a double major or as a fallback, their policy has not changed.  If you PNP this class, you disqualify yourself from using the 16A+16B combo to fulfill your Linear Algebra requirement.  You would then have to take Math 54 instead.
Damage control for the 70 drama?
is there an option to retroactively PNP in light of this?
Like half of 16b is totally useless for CS majors (and honestly, I don’t think the way circuits are taught are useful to EE majors either), but there are parts of the class (linear algebra, SVD, and things like complex numbers and DFT still have some application in graphics) that I think are at least fairly useful to know. 

I wish they’d separate the circuits stuff from the math and require all the math and none of the circuits for CS majors personally.
Bro what if this is all a high IQ play to make L&S CS majors pnp only to rescind the policy. They just reduced L&S by like 90%
Does this mean we have to change to P/NP in 2 days if we want that option? That seems like a little rushed lmao.
I'm a first year L&S CS taking this class. I am not very sure whether to P/NP or letter grade. Any advice? What are the benefits of each? Will p/np hurt grad school applications?
[deleted]
why did people change a NP to a D
April Fools!!!!
Is this real? I'm currently enrolled in 16b and haven't received this email.
[deleted]
not for COE at all?
I bet that this is cause of those recent massive Reddit posts, yeah it's heartwarming to see that they read student thoughts

cus maybe they'll read about the cs protests too, and hopefully prevent my mom and dad from losing so much money
Continue to [petition to make your hope a reality](https://www.change.org/p/remove-the-ee-16b-requirement-for-cs-majors-at-uc-berkeley)! GOOOBEARSSSS!
[deleted]
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNOUNCEMENT!
Cheers for the people who didn't listen to Sahai's threats...
You cannot pnp eecs16b for Data Science (per an advisor) but you can just PNP 16b and take math54 graded after.
Asking this too^ Wanna make sure I dont PNP without eliminating my backup
Is there someone we can contact about this? I emailed my advisor about it…
[deleted]
It’s March and the email is from Hug.
Not sure if you're joking but 16B has only been around since 2015
Unfortunately not “The P/NP change in this policy applies only to L&S CS students taking EECS16B during the Spring 2022 semester, and has no impact on the letter grade requirement for EECS16B taken in any other semester, past or future.”
yeah as much as I rather not study more math as a CS major, I agree that it is useful for CS and make sense to be required. Because of this I feel like even if they do remove the 16B requirement, we'd have to take a diff math or EE class to make up for it. We won't just have one less class to take in general.
That would get them in an actionable lawsuit quicker than a ray of light
[deleted]
For grad school I’d say a letter grade is better and more definite. If they choose to include it in your major GPA it would count as a C minus. Grad school is super competitive so if it was me I wouldn’t leave any doubt and just get the letter grade since you won’t know how they treat it especially since it’s not a Covid pass no pass.
Probably
Yeah if you get near 100% in lab and do about the same on final. You can check the website and calculate it yourself.
[deleted]
Are you EECS? This is for L&S. Otherwise check spam
If you want to be EEcs they’re gonna stick you with EE lol
Are you kidding? EECS majors have TWO EE requirements and you're still gonna complain? It's already ridiculous that y'all don't have any upper div EE requirements despite getting an EE degree out of it
Reminds me of the intro to “Benzi Box” by Mf Doom

“His names, Doom…”
you can also take linalg at a cc :) if it transfers per assist
I think double majors can use 16ab to pass the linalg req
You don't have to, it's just that ee16a / ee16b fulfills the math54 requirement in case a student fails to make the gpa cutoff for CS and has a backup plan for data science, or wants to double in data science/cs
I mean they had a version of an electrical engineering class back then i thought, and i read a personal opinion piece by an ancient L&S CS students complaining about being forced to take EE classes. 

maybe im imagining things, ive been in this class for 8 months now, i might be going crazy. Regardless this is in interesting read of how EE and CS became EECS [""personal view of computer science""](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/bears/CS_Anniversary/karp-talk.html) from the 60's
I wouldn't mind 61D. The 61 series is pretty well designed. 16B was just a mess. (It does lead to some useful EE upper divs, but the CS folks who care about EE are EECS anyway)
Mb not trying to whine. In the past P/NP decisions were closer to Finals due to Covid semesters. I got used to having more time to change grade options.
D is a pass?
Technically they get 1 joint degree, but I agree with what you are saying.
Yo chill lol dude was just asking if engineering is affected or not
[deleted]
we get the joint degree cuz we studied in hs
Yep
For context, they made a separate post saying ""that’s so unfair if it’s for half the class and not for the other half"" and have since said about L&S CS majors ""yea i guess we are better than y’all"" and ""we get the joint degree cuz we studied in hs""

Also it would just make no sense for EE16b to be PNP for literal EECS majors
Of what? I'm just saying EECS majors have some of the most flexible requirements at Berkeley and still constantly complain. As another commenter pointed out, it's also kinda depressing that our EECS department is world renowned and yet lets people graduate with barely any actual electrical engineering knowledge.
Then study in college too and stop whining about it lmao
Not sure what you mean, what you did in high school has nothing to do with anything??

Sad thing is police won't do shit about it. They say you can't prove it was the owner that was driving the car, so unless you have a photo of the owner driving the vehicle, nothing will happen.
So a video.  Huh.
Snitch!!
i have a video. the license plate number is 35393(?)VZ as far as i can tell.
i had to catch the bus sadly 🙁 but i’m going back there right now so if the car is still there i’ll leave a note

California plates follow 1ABC234 convention, so would this be an out of state plate?
Owner is responsible
That’s okay the police don’t have to do anything except file an incident report. Insurance does the rest.
Spoken like some fuckstick who's never been the victim of a crime.
Hm that’s an odd format, is it a CA plate?
Pretty trashy of you to basically be doxing someone based on your baseless accusation. Having the SN is great but you should have asked the owner of the Jetta to get in touch with you.
looks like you got it! i called berkeley pd’s non emergency line and they said no one reported a hit and run but they would contact me if someone with a gray vw jetta came to them
that is most definitely it! team work to make the dream work!
CA trucks have a different format.
But…But…. I just said Snitch!! Didn’t say that what he did was good or bad. You took it as it’s bad. There is always a good snitch and a bad one. What if I meant let’s go king! Snitch on this fool!! When saying Snitch!! And I was supporting the snitching
i can’t be certain because i didn’t get a clear enough shot but i’m pretty sure it was

edit: looks like someone else in the comments got it
It’s probably a commercial plate.
Pickup trucks have plates in that format
doxxing? do you think most people have access to license plate databases that return addresses and/or give enough of a shit to do anything to the driver?
moron
Why don’t they just reverse lookup the Jetta?
No? If it's a passenger vehicle it follows that convention.  Unless you somehow think that the picture is showing a semi truck, which would make sense why you typed that out.
Ah nice the Z was a 2!
This or its what my dad calls a ""truck plate"". He has a pickup truck for hauling things (non-commercially, though) and it has a plate in that format.
Maybe work trucks, but most regular-purpose pickups do not
Think about a situation where maybe someone already knows someone’s name and maybe also the license of their car and they are digging around doing a background check for a job or digging up dirt on someone. Now when they google the plate number it will show this thread in perpetuity accusing them of hit and run.

It’s not just random internet vigilantes. Just leave a note on the Jetta like a normal person.
Yeah… I would probably not think to call the cops if I came back to my car partly smashed up
Trucks (or even a Prius c) can register for a commercial license plate which does not follow that format
All trucks in CA must be registered as a commercial vehicle, and it’s very difficult to get an exception from DMV.
They do. By default pickups are classified as commercial vehicles.
If you have insurance you would. Insurance wants you to file a police report in many cases like this
[deleted]
Depends on the size, weight, and passenger capacity per CA VC


Edit: to those downvoting, just open google for once in your life and read the California Vehicle Code. It’s not that hard..
Actually yes a Prius c can register for one. I know because I had one. They have 12345A6 formats for commercial license plates as well. Please do your research
i might argue the point in your first comment, ""most regular-purpose pickups do not."" But not a big point imho, so an upvote for you m8.

It may also be peoples experiences, like myself, that makes us want to argue this point. As the owner of a pickup truck, and guy in his 30s, I just expect commercial plates on trucks.
Not really my concern to be correct about these trivialities.  Simply gave my suggestion that it could be OOS and people downvote.
Ah yeah I can see why I shouldn’t have said “most”
If you did your research you’ll realize that the plate in the picture is a perfectly valid California commercial license plate. Use your eyes as you would say. People are downvoting you because you aren’t giving the correct information and instead of backtracking and standing correctly you keep trying reiterate your point only to be wrong
If you had a lexile score above 500 you'd read that my first comment said: ""WOULD THIS BE OUT OF STATE"".  I don't know if you're a native English speaker, but WOULD is not a definitive statement.  There is no information that I'm giving out; it's simply postulation.  Sorry, that's too big of a word for you.  Postulation means it's simply conjecture.  Ahh, might be too difficult as well.
You refuted the statement that CA trucks have different formats and then goes on to hint that the commenter is unintelligent for mentioning just because you had no idea that different commercial
license plates exist. Using big words doesn’t mask the fact that you were wrong and you have too big of an ego to admit it
How are you still going? Holy shit lmao.

>No? If it's a passenger vehicle it follows that convention. Unless you somehow think that the picture is showing a semi truck, which would make sense why you typed that out.

Whole lot of hedging in this comment. Totally. Fuck off dude.
Let me logic this out for you:

I claim: ""Simply gave my suggestion that it could be OOS and people downvote"" (objective truth)

you: respond with some non sequitur about research and then counterclaim about ""giving out correct information""

I respond: reiterating the fact that the point of what I'm saying still remains on my original comment, and that never deals with ""giving out information""

You: still stuck on the same argument that you're trying to prop up for yourself for no reason

Yes, you're correct in your little tangent argument, but it has nothing to do with what I'm saying.  You have some pre formed responses in your head that would be written regardless of the content of my replies
What are you so angry about?  You also missed that I wrote ""first comment"" and proceeded to analyze a random one that fit your narrative.  Reading must be hard for folks.
Honestly I have no idea what you’re saying. Just don’t act like ALL you did was suggest it was OOS because you didn’t just leave it at that. You were quite simply rude about it and in the end you were wrong about. That’s why you were being downvoted
You are a tool, please re-read the conversation that happened then come back and tell everyone who can and can’t read. Just admit you were wrong and move on, it feels better that way I promise.
Big surprise that you can't follow logic."

Yes, my program is tied with theirs on ranking but I get 10k less per year than their incoming first-years...CoL in Berkeley is higher than Palo Alto too. Hope at least they're close to a living wage!
I think it would be really interesting to have Stanford and other schools who find their GSIs better weigh in on this.

Comparisons could be powerful.
we deserve to get shit on for the FTX name thing any day but SBF was literally born on their campus to their professors, they get some of the blame
What does FTX have to do with Cal though? And how did they mock us?
Weirdly this is one of the most endearing comments I’ve seen in a while. Somehow that genuinely touched my heart (non sarcastically)
I mean, probably, yeah. At a meta level, why do you think simulacra of tribal conflicts like these are so ubiquitous? They serve the functions of distractions and pressure release valves rolled into one. Bread and circuses, society of the spectacle, yada yada... A lot of people definitely get too caught up in all that. But that shouldn't mean we can't enjoy them at all. Like, they're fun. People like fun shit. We just really gotta try and remind each other what's a game and what is reality.
[deleted]
OOC what do they pay first years? Do you know if it's the same across all of Stanford or is it area specific?
I agree, post it on r/Stanford and see what they say.
FTX had the naming rights to our stadium but that was just canceled.
Might be a stupid point to bring up, but are you sure that's not just because you moved away from Berkeley after the huge col increases in 21?

What is the best major for Theoretical CS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17ta9hd/what_is_the_best_major_for_theoretical_cs/,2023-11-11 18:16:11,"I’m a CC student who would like to get a PhD in TCS after college. Since I am applying for transfer, the chance of getting into the EECS/CS is very slim. Some unis, like [Stanford](https://mathematics.stanford.edu/academics/undergraduate-students/math-major/computer-science-theorydiscrete-mathematics-subplan), have special math programs that is more geared toward theory and grad school. 

I was wondering, is there any alternative major that would allow me to pursue PhD in TCS after college while not being as difficult to get into as the CS?

How is Applied Mathematics for this reason?

Or should I just stick to the CS and hope for the best?

P.S: please don’t bully me! Thx.","As a non-(EE)CS major, getting into a CS class that isn't 61AB or 70 would be impossible, save for a few exceptions. Your best bet is just to go CS or EECS and take a bunch of the 17x courses and a few math courses
Major in EECS, core classes like 170 you can't get into CS upper divs w/o being EECS or CS.
Engineering Math and Stats? You can get into CS classes if you’re an engineering major.
I assume ""TCS"" means ""Theoretical Computer Science""? I've never heard anyone call it that. TCS more often refers to Tata Consultancy Services.

I know a lot of people who got PhDs in CS at Berkeley and other comparable schools. Typically, they had *very* strong academic backgrounds. Many are professors today.

Finally some useful advice: pick a few target programs and see what their current PhD students majored in as undergrads.
Do CS. CS over EECS s.t. you have priority for math classes while you're L&S undeclared
Is it worth it to apply to EECS since it has double the acceptance rate? (10% vs 5%)
I'm sure everyone else is thinking the same as you, so the acceptance rates will eventually balance out. Just apply towards whichever program you like better.
I would say yes. Some people are put off by the EECS16AB and physics requirements, but I personally liked those classes. On top of that, there's no declaration needed for EECS, so you can take 61c and upper divs a lot faster, which I assume is high priority for you since you're a transfer and you'll have even more limited time.
Well… 
EECS has physics requirement (for admission) which I know it deters some people while CS doesn’t.

But you are right, after the change in CS admission policy, These two probably will become more equal.
Is there a real difference between EECS and CS? If so, what is it?
They accept way less CS transfers though
Realistically, no, they're functionally the same degree.

 But if we're accounting for everything, yeah. EECS has EECS16AB, Math 53, and Physics 7AB as requirements, plus the 6 H/SS courses as a part of COE. CS has Math 54 and 7 breadths of L&S (technically 6 since 61C fills one of them). You also have to declare CS, so you can't take 61C or any CS upper divs until after you declare. On top of that, you can't go 100% EE upper divs in CS, as you still have to take 2 CS upper divs. Again, minor differences if we're being honest on how everything really plays out.
physics and the linear algebra are the main differences"
What are the MUST TAKE classes for freshman year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/129xmlw/what_are_the_must_take_classes_for_freshman_year/,2023-04-02 13:46:45,"If you have any other classes for other years, I’d also love to hear them :)

P.S: can I take UGBA courses if I’m not part of Haas?","your major’s prereqs
do a decal!!
Astro C10
take a freshman seminar! the subjects are variable, but it’ll be your only opportunity and you can do really cool stuff! they’re usually only 1 or 2 units so they don’t take much commitment either
Data 8 and Astro C10. 

Loved the mind-blowing stuff they taught in C10, and Filipenko is a great prof
DATA 8 is a great one
freshmen seminar classes are pretty cool
do data 8 fssss
drugs and the brain was so sick
Eecs126 + Eecs127 + cs189 ez must take combo fr
61a😍😍😍
CS 61A!!
Most populous classes are often classes that are held in Wheeler 150.  CS61A, DS C8 aka Data 8, Astro C10 Intro to Astronomy, UGBA 10, Psych C61 Brain Mind and Behavior are examples of classes that many freshmen take.
just knock out your breadth and major requirements first and maybe a decal for something fun/low stakes
I recommend doing a [DeCal](https://decal.berkeley.edu/) if you need an extra unit or two.

Specifically, I recommend the Solutions for a Sustainable and Just Future DeCal!
a decal!!! there’s so many!!! harry potter, tea, web development, graphic design, bts, meditation, salsa, ETC ETC
There's a night at the museum class in IB that's only open to freshmen but I'm not sure if it's listed as a seminar or not.
Geography 8 with Dr. Kosek changed my whole perspective on the world (took it on a whim as a senior). Also loved the TeaCal
Yes - since all Haas students come in as undeclared L&S, you can take any UGBA lower div. For upper divs, I hear if you reach out to the prof they'll likely let you in, if not at least audit the course.
Agree
C10 was brilliant
Also here are some [Special UGBA Courses](https://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad/academics/courses/special-topics-business-administration-courses/) you can add to your future semesters (as they are upper div)

I highly recommend Sustainable Capitalism in the Nordics!"

This is the ASUC (UC Berkeley's student government) Office of Academic Affairs. We advocate for student concerns regarding grading policies, student accommodations, and more.

We know that this semester has been wild and very stressful, so we want to assure you that we are working diligently to lessen the burden on students by allowing for flexibility in the campus' academic policies for this fall.

Feel free to post any questions or comments you have regarding academics, accommodations, or our work as the Office of Academic Affairs!

**UPDATE \[9/29\]:** The Chancellor and Provost just announced that spring 2021 will take place *primarily* remotely, with *some* limited instruction possibly taking place in person. At this time, we don't know much more than what was included in the Chancellor's email.

To share my personal experience, this semester is arguably worse than Spring. The pandemic has worsened significantly, fires are raging through CA and political unrest make it hard to focus. All of this is really tough mentally as students and undeniably affects our ability to succeed in school.
Why doesn't this semester have the option to P/NP classes that count toward your major? Personally, I've been having a difficult time learning/doing well in my classes, and my mental health isn't great considering Covid continues to be a stressor in my life. I assume this is how a decent number of other students feel too :-(
Has there been any update to the option to PNP major/minor/other required graded courses? Would you say that based on your conversations with the school that it is more likely or less likely that we will be able to PNP atleast one major required course? When should we expect to hear the result of their decision?

[deleted]
First off, I want to thank the Office of Academic Affairs for all they do for the students on campus. Your efforts are truly appreciated. I had a question regarding Spring 2020 semester’s default P/NP grading option. Is that something that’s also being considered for Fall 2020, or should we not expect that at all? Because if I’m being honest, it’s been rough out here. The pandemic has not gone away; in fact, it’s only gotten worse. I’m really struggling to keep everything together, and I feel like the university should support its students by at least considering a default P/NP option. I know a lot of students feel this way as well. Thank you so much for listening.
Is your Office doing anything to combat excessive proctoring demands by certain classes? 

I'm fortunately not enrolled in any such classes myself, but it is concerning to hear that students in certain classes have to peruse [17 pages of Zoom proctoring guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sarPFQOpTaN7yq46sILi5pRB2cAF4RvArKO1J3R4IQs/edit) in order to lend some credence to the fairness of their exam (and I imagine students who make any mistake will be approached as cheaters and/or as trying to circumvent the rules). It is worrying to hear that (a) students are being given [timed assessments over the weekend](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRvk_hi6ENRPqM8eSYZISQIMpsij_ZKZAwA52n7V8Tun4iMfdPR2MAGOQ6k7z-ofwOMKEDN1NsEXHEC/pub), and particularly on a Sunday, when it is certainly unconventional in non-global-pandemic times to administer assessments over the weekend; and (b) an assessment that is supposed to take ""approximately an hour to complete"" is demanding from students [more than seven hours of their day](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/itm2f3/to_the_bears_in_61c/). Apart from—quite frankly—the creepiness of recording the private workspaces of students (and the customary privacy concerns), these policies are hardly anything but accomodating in these times. Rather than keeping the responsibility to fairly assess student understanding of material as a duty of the instructor and course staff, these policies (and similar ones) shift the onus on to students to record and submit their innocence, an innocence that is easily contested anyway.

More broadly, these policies tell students that instructors do not value the already massive amounts of time students are putting in to their classes, and instead are demanding students to worry that their workspace is presentable to an unknown observer; to carve out sections of their day (that may or may not be on weekends, that may or may not be a set length of time) with distractions, because even a family member walking into frame could be interpreted as some form of cheating; to ensure they have the proper equipment to record themselves; to waste much of their energy during assessments worrying that their recording equipment is *actually* recording, and hasn't tipped over, or hasn't run out of battery, or hasn't been force stopped by another application randomly, or hasn't run out of storage, or they are threatened with the prospect of doing the exam again (for, as previously mentioned, a designated period of time that is somewhat meaningless anyway).

Going back to my main question—did the university ever create centralized policies for remote proctoring (and more generally, forms of assessment) during this remote semester (and later, potentially hybrid semesters), and if they have, is anyone making sure whether they are actually effective? Again, not a CS student myself, but reading accounts of the way the department is giving assessments just does not rest well with me.
Have professors and instructors come together and discussed leniency and compassion for students in this environment?
You could check out these two reddit threads:

For motivation of how your advocacy will definitely be useful to a lot of us students!
Other UCs such as UCLA UCI and UCMerced have revised their fall 2020 academic policies to allow for optional pnp for Major recs. Since there is precedent, do you think Berkeley will follow suit?

Would the administration consider mandatory trainings or discussions for instructors on being compassionate and working with students at this time? It seems like STEM students in particular are dealing with harsh and unreasonable class/prof expectations.

This is Liam Will and I support this AMA.
do GSIs and professors make sure zoom proctoring recordings are secure and deleted after exam? think there would be protections for student data privacy. we are forced to record ourselves at home, show id, and screen share.. concerned about intrusiveness of this and gives weird vibes...

Is there any updates on summer abroad 2021?
Is your office doing anything for prefessors who refuse to be accomodating towards international students having to take midterms/finals at really odd hours? One of my classes doesnt not offer an alternate and I will have to take a 5am exam.
If P/NP happens for this semester, will that include R & C courses?
Also in general why can LnS breadths and AC courses be taken P/NP but not R & C courses?

Right now, we're still in discussions with campus officials about implementing an allowance for P/NP to be used for major requirements, so all of the work falls on our office to push this accommodation over the line. However, administrators often want to hear student testimonials about why certain policies would be effective/beneficial. If you'd like to share how P/NP for major requirements would impact you personally, you can email aavpchief  (at)  asuc  (dot)  org.
I think fill out the form in the post!
That's something that we're working on advocating for with the Berkeley admin and Academic Senate. Our stance is that this extraordinary semester shouldn't completely determine the outcome of your academic career at Cal, especially when it comes to things like getting into competitive majors or fulfilling major requirements. Discussions with the campus are still ongoing, but we will be updating students as soon as we know more. You can follow our updates at .@ASUCAAVP on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
Feeling the struggle
The stance of the campus administration and Academic Senate has always been that there is a fundamental difference between the spring and fall semester because the pandemic interrupted the spring semester and forced a quick shift to online instruction. In contrast, campus officials argue that *fewer* policy accommodations are required for fall  because both instructors and students went into the semester 'prepared' for fully remote instruction. As the ASUC Office of Academic Affairs, we have been hearing directly from students and **we** **know that this semester is no less difficult for students than last semester**, especially for students already struggling with basic needs, international students, low income students, and student parents. For that reason, we've been working closely with the administration and Berkeley Academic Senate to push for a set of key academic policy accommodations including an extension of the grade change and course drop deadline (as has been done in L&S) and the possibility of using P/NP classes for major requirements. Default P/NP is off the table (and so is a lifting of the 1/3 P/NP cap) from the discussions we've already had, but we believe that the accommodations we are advocating for will provide students with more greatly-needed flexibility in their academics this semester.
We (and the ASUC as a whole) are totally in agreement on this point: the pandemic **is not over** just because we'd all *like* it to be. As such, we cannot have academic policies that treat this semester like any other. However, from the discussions we've had with campus officials, default P/NP (as was approved for spring 2020) is off the table. Instead, we've pivoted to trying to implement approval of P/NP for major requirements. We're still discussing this option with the campus right now so nothing definitive has been decided yet. If there is a change, we'll be sure to notify students via our social media (@ASUCAAVP).
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. According [this](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/remote-proctoring-faq) campus policy for this fall, remote proctoring is only allowed for courses that have joined the remote proctoring pilot program (this should be a small subset of classes). However, even for courses enrolled in the pilot program, **only final exams** are allowed to be remotely proctored. As such, our office was surprised to see these bizarre midterm proctoring requirements for CS 162. But we checked with the administration and Academic Senate and were told that some EECS department classes were given special permission to remote proctor midterm exams. Nevertheless, campus officials were also taken aback by these requirements, so we are working with them to learn more about why these requirements were implemented for CS 162. **In general, very few courses should be approved for remote proctoring for** ***final exams*** **and almost no courses should be approved for remote proctoring for** ***midterm exams*****.**
Unfortunately, most professors structure their class and class policies based on previous iterations of the course with very little variation in between semesters. While instructors have had to adapt their course plans to suit distance learning, it is our sense of the academic environment that *many* instructors have not adjusted their courses to be as accommodating or flexible as they perhaps should be. For that reason, our office's focus is on implementing campus-wide or college-wide policy changes related to late course drops and grading policies. This way, we can have the biggest impact on the most number of classes/students.
We're in ongoing discussions with the Academic Senate and campus administration working towards getting P/NP for major requirements implemented as soon as possible. But, as with everything having to do with Berkeley's bureaucracy, these things take time. Luckily, we're also working to extend the grade change deadline to the last week of the semester, so we are confident that if we succeed in allowing P/NP classes for major requirements, students will have enough time to make an informed decision about which grading option they would like to use.
**Nothing has been decided about Spring 2021 as of yet.** We know that Berkeley is preparing for a variety of scenarios for spring (fully remote, hybrid, etc.) and ASUC officials have been active in conversations about how to improve the student experience in whichever situation we find ourselves in come January. However, **we won't know until the administration makes a decision** (based off of a variety of factors and perspectives). We'll know for sure when the campus sends another campus wide message.
We think this would be a great opportunity to have a productive dialogue between students, administrators, and faculty. We've heard from a lot of students that some classes (especially STEM classes) are as accommodating as we believe they should be.
Unfortunately, our office doesn't have any more information than what's available on the FAQ page. It is likely that students will receive an email about the flu shot requirement in the coming weeks. If you have more questions or concerns, I would recommend getting in touch with UHS or the Tang center.
We too are concerned about the privacy and equity implications of remote proctoring via Zoom. We're still pushing against remote proctoring altogether, but we are also working with the administration to make any \*necessary\* remote proctoring as secure and fair as possible. If you have individual concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to us directly at aavpchief (at) asuc (dot) org.
OP verified themselves to us via private berkeley.edu email.
Our office doesn't really interface with the study abroad program. I'd recommend checking [http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/](http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/) for updates.
That's an issue that we're aware of and are working closely with campus officials to resolve. International students should not have to take exams when they are usually sleeping. Feel free to reach out to us via email at aavpchief (at) asuc (dot) org, so that we can get more context about your particular course and situation.
We're advocating for P/NP to apply to as many campus and major requirements/pre-requisites. We're still in ongoing conversations with campus officials about what exactly the final set of academic policy accommodations will look like, but our office will continue to update students as we move forward. We will post updates on our Instagram and Twitter (@ASUCAAVP).
We just Tweeted about the AMA on our Twitter (@ASUCAAVP)
Would this also include major prerequisites, like for computer science? I’ve felt that resources in some classes have lacked what we could have gotten during an in person instruction.
Is what you’re working on with Admin and Academic Senate for undergrads only or also grad students?
Things are straight up terrible in a lot of our lives. Thanks for your efforts guys, we really appreciate this
I just want to include a point that Hopkins, Georgetown and various other schools still has the default option as P/NP. I think this can be an argument: Here in California and our large student body make it equal or even way more difficult for students to properly learn and manage their situations in comparisons to the situations in the above mentioned schools. This is why having possibility of using P/NP classes for major requirements should be taken into considerations by the campus administration
Why was it that only L&S is giving out an additional course drop? Is there a particular reason on why other colleges do not implement the same policy?
  
Would P/Np for major requirements be applicable to minor requirements too?
Was surprised to hear ""almost no courses"" when every EECS course I know is doing some form of workspace/screen recording for all exams. Even more so that campus officials were taken aback. Who is giving this special permission (to a wide range of EECS classes) that no one else knows about?
Wait, proctoring is only allowed on finals? Cs70 has remote proctoring for this upcoming midterm?
Could this be implemented as a required campus-wide conversation or seminar? 

I imagine it would be more productive if it the conversation aspect was held by each department.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yes. We're pushing for this to include major pre-requisites.
From our understanding, most grading policies are different for undergraduates vs. graduates (e.g. P/NP for undergrads vs. S/U for grads). However, we're committed to implementing academic accommodations for **all** students. We're still in fairly early discussions, but we will be working with campus officials and GA officials going forward.
The L&S late schedule change policy for fall 2020 was decided on the College level (i.e. not on the campus-wide level). We're in the process of lobbying both the campus-wide Academic Senate and the deans of other colleges to implement similar late schedule change policies as L&S.
^
Some classes have been working with Berkeley admin for the fall remote proctoring pilot program (linked in the above reply). The exemption for the EECS department was granted on the campus admin level. We agree that there has not been nearly enough clarity and transparency from the campus about remote proctoring policies. This is something our office is working on addressing.
As we mentioned above, the EECS department was given **special permission to remote proctor midterm exams**. From our understanding, EECS is the **only** department that was given that permission.
Please
We agree wholeheartedly. Our focus should be on supporting the wellbeing of students and everyone who is a part of our Cal community, especially during these extraordinary times. This is no normal semester so Berkeley's academic policies should reflect that. We really appreciate every student voicing their concerns and personal experiences. These student voices really help to shape how we do our advocacy in campus academic spaces. If you have additional individual concerns or questions about academic policies, you can email aavpchief (at) asuc (dot) org.
We really don't know much about the timeline of any potential announcement yet. However, from what we've seen about fall 2020 course enrollment, ***if*** hybrid or in-person course options are being offered, there will likely be an indication of the mode of instruction on the Berkeley Academic Guide. But again, we don't know *when* an announcement about next semester will be sent, nor do we know *what* that announcement will be.

Any update on P/NP atleast one class?
This is a joke on so many levels. Why does the EECS department get this permission? Their horrendous teaching just adds more injury to this. Talking to you directly Sahai"
1st year fall sem schedule thoughts (Data Sci major),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1420fct/1st_year_fall_sem_schedule_thoughts_data_sci_major/,2023-06-05 19:19:31,"accepted into cal for DS, here’s my prospective schedule,, thoughts? I still want to be able to explore and make new friends etc

CS 61A (my only programming experience is AP CS-P… so basically next to nothing)

Data 8

Math 1B (did very well in BC, but thought it’d be a good transition into Cal mathematics) or MATH 56 (lin alg)

R5B—Slavic or French or Italian (whichever one I can get into since German and Scandin are full)

Total units: 15 .","don't take 1B just do 56 or 54
I would do 54 over 56 just because it is recognized in the system by more majors and you don’t need to appeal for a code/seat which can cost you getting into upperdiv classes. Probably not an issue if u don’t plan on taking more than 3 techs a semester as then u can j phase1 everything
take math 56 or 54 instead but looks good otherwise
Don’t take 1B because:
1. You’ve already gotten a good score in BC, and if you don’t need to, it’s a waste of a class.
2. It’s possible that you don’t get a good grade in it - many exam questions are all or nothing points, so with BC you can get a 5 on the exam and points for questions with some partial credit on free response, that doesn’t exist here
3. Regardless of if you want to do industry or grad school, in computing linear algebra is king in basically every application. The most calculus you will use is taking an integral here or there. The content in lin alg and calculus is also extremely removed from each other.

I would highly recommend you take either a fun class, the lower division class for the data science domain emphasis you want to do, or lin alg
I had nearly the same schedule as you (R5A instead of B), and also had the opportunity to skip 1B but took it instead. It was an easy A+, but honestly my time would’ve been spent better taking 53, 54 or 56, all of which were required for my major(s). Don’t repeat my mistake, you can brush up on calc BC content over the next two months and go straight for linear algebra. It’s not that big of a jump, and wasting a semester on intro calc is not worth it.
dont take 1b just do 54 or 56
Take cs88 instead of 61a, counts and it is better for ppl with less experience
This is actually a fairly light schedule, good for freshmen 1st Sem, especially if you have programming experience. I recommend 56 over 1B. If you REALLY like calculus, take 53 later instead
regardless of math 54 or 56, don't do math 1B if you don't have to. if you're unsure about your math skills for your first semester, you can always do another breadth instead to just get acclimated to college life. maybe self-study some of the math 54/56 content on the side if you like. there's no need to rush.
Isn’t math 54 also considered a weed out? I’d be hesitant taking 2 weed outs (61A) all in my first semester haha
Tysm, this helps out a lot!!
thanks for the insight! Will take into consideration
as I surfed through the sub, i realized this was also big topic of debate. I looked into it and I think I want to pursue 61a, amongst other reasons, I do believe the notion that it prepares you better for 61b. Maybe not in terms of concept but rather the framework of problem solving developed in 61a. Also, if I ever want to try and transfer into CS (🤞) I can atleast attempt to do so. But who knows, I might come across another COMPELLING argument for CS 88
How come not taking 1B seems to be the STRONG general consensus? I’m not against it or anything but ig I just don’t understand why not?  Is it mostly because it’d be a waste of time?
no you aren’t gonna get weeded out… math 54 has a higher grade distribution than math 1b but i think paulin is teaching 56
Your choice. 88 preps you for 61b just fine imo, and you can still declare cs with 88 (idk if they changed that but that’s how I switched to cs)
I’m personally on the side for taking Math 1B. 
I came to Cal after getting a 5 on AP calc BC exam, and choose to enroll in math 53 my first semester. Although I thought I was strong in math, I could not keep up with the pace of math 53. I ended up dropping it and retaking Math 1B where I got an A+. Math 1B gave me a strong, Berkeley-level foundation which let me get an A in both Math 53 and math 54 the following semester. 

Two pros to retaking 1B are:
-a GPA boost since you’ll probably be very prepared from your previous calculus experience 
-set a strong foundation for the following classes 

One small rebuttal however is that linear algebra is not very dependent on calculus at all. I’d argue you could take math 54 / 56 without knowing calc whatsoever (aside from Differential equations in 54 I suppose).

My situation was more unique in that I needed the calculus foundation in Math 1B to do well in multivariable calculus in Math 53.

The decision is yours of course, I just wanted to give you a perspective from a Math 1B repeater. 

Good luck!
Okok, both 54 and 56 are titled linear alg so is there a difference between the two? If not, I’ll prolly go with whichever one Paulin teaching since I heard he’s a  favorite
Oh ok! Will fasho look into it more
thanks for the insightful input! Will take into consideration
read the name of the courses again it does not have the same title
i actually highly recommend CS 61a. although its harder than CS 88, the course does an amazing job of teaching the concepts. Its probably my favorite class and this class will set you up well for future coding related classes.
👍 appreciate the infoo
you might want to study a little during the summer for 61a tho
Welp. I’ve just been told Math 56 already full since phase 1 for continuing students is wayyy before phase 1 for new freshman😵‍💫😵‍💫 will probably have to try and snag it for Spring. Regardless, still thanks for the info
for sure for sure"
P/NP in L&S this summer,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mqu9kn/pnp_in_ls_this_summer/,2021-04-14 09:30:08,"The following was sent to L&S advisors just now. - Bob

&#x200B;

Dear L&S UMAs and College Advisers:

  
After careful consideration, the Faculty of the College of Letters and Science, through their Executive Committee, have decided to extend some P/NP exceptions from fall 2020 and spring 2021 to summer 2021. The goal of these changes is to continue to reduce stress during this tough year of the pandemic and remote instruction, while still encouraging learning and student progress. 

  
This email outlines those changes, and additional information.

  
Please remind students that switching a course or courses to P/NP may not be the best action in all circumstances. Other strategies, such as dropping a course or taking an incomplete in a course to focus on the remaining courses, are highly encouraged, and may be better ways of coping with difficulties while still making progress. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate the implications of these policy changes.

  
The policy changes are as follows:   
1.  L&S College requirements: Reading and Composition, Quantitative Reasoning, and Foreign Language requirements normally satisfied with letter grades may be met with a passed (P) grade during the Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021 terms.

I still hate that I got summer 2020 without PNP taking CS70
why didn’t they have this last summer
Will other colleges take this into consideration as well?
Well now idk whether to do 61c or 188 this summer
Wait this is legit right?
Will anything be in person this summer? Like libraries, advising, talks, etc?
Does anyone know if it is fine to PNP CS lower divs at cc over the summer?
So I never took a summer course at Cal. Is there a unit minimum like the normal semesters?
61c 61c 61c
lol I’m on the same boat buddy. Not sure what to take
Yes.  You can confirm by contacting your major advisor.
Safest course is to ask a CS advisor.

Why take it in cc? I would honestly recommend taking it at Cal especially if you’re a cs major. Breadths are def better taken at cc to save money but I’d argue you’re here to study CS it’s best to have a good foundation as intended by our curriculum.
No unit minimum but if you get financial aid you need to do at least 6 units.
No unit minimum. Two courses is pretty doable, three can get quite heavy. A lot of summer classes meet every day M-F, so it adds up quickly.
You seem confidant about that, may I ask why?
See my other comment for my thoughts
Thanks!
Is it fine to PNP English R1A/R1B course at CC over the summer? Thanks.
I have already taken 16B, but need credit for 16A or 54 and cc is far cheaper than Berkeley for summer courses. I also have an internship and would like to hopefully reduce workload.
cuz PNP go brrrr
If you're in L&S, and you're \_not\_ asking about College Writing CW1A, just regular R1A/R1B, a P is fine.  (F's are considered undesirable...)
Okay that’s totally fair. I would take 16a at cc too then.
Hm but not sure if missing having a lower division in person with my grade of CS majors could be nice you know? Like that’s kinda the last class where everyone is in together before we all take different paths on upper divisions

Edit: why the downvotes? If you disagree plz explain I’m looking for opinions
Thanks.
Didn't downvote you but I barely interacted with people in class outside Piazza when I took 61A (which I took largely in person), and I'm not entirely certain why it's such a big deal to take a class with everybody before you all wind up on different paths in upper divisions.
Ah that’s fair I just thought cuz of corona I never got the experience a lower division in person and thought maybe it was a unique experience? I’m not sure tho as I inherently haven’t experienced it
You sit in a big lecture hall with like 300+ other students there and then show up to labs and discussion, which have about the same amount of student contribution as they do right now on Zoom. The biggest difference I guess is that it's easier to not get distracted"
Rising Sophomore L&S CS+Econ Projected Schedule - Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13js55j/rising_sophomore_ls_csecon_projected_schedule/,2023-05-16 22:09:19,"I got grandfathered in because the new L&S high-demand policy doesn’t apply to my year. General thoughts on this schedule would be nice, as well as the particular question regarding whether I should take MATH 110 or MATH 104 first. MATH 110 is an easier introduction to upper division math, but as you will see my Fall semester classes are much easier than my Spring ones this upcoming year.

Also, recommendations for classes to switch around (i.e. Taking Math 185 early and a CS class later) are welcome.

I’m double majoring in economics and computer science, and trying to minor in philosophy (out of interest) and math (it helps for economics PhD programs). I intend to pursue a PhD in economics and eventually a tenured position at a research university.

Keep in mind I came in with Econ 1, Math 1A, Math 1B, Math 53, AP Computer Science, Entry Level Writing, American History, American Institutions, Reading and Composition A, Quantitative Reasoning, Foreign Language, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Philosophy and Values, and Historical Studies done. I had around 74 units already. Now I have 97.

Final note - some of the classes, notably ECON H195B, ECON 199, and some of the Philosophy upper division + Economics graduate courses are dependent upon Professor approval/them being offered at that time.","Not gonna read all that but Math 54 and CS70 togeether in a summer is likely pushing the limits, even given As in the prior CS courses. If you just need to acheive a sufficient grade to declare it should be doable but getting A-s or better in both is gonna be brutal barring you have a serious math background (i.e competition math in high school).  

Have you considered taking Math 54 remotely at a CC? Should be much easier this way, allowing you more time on CS70. Since its being taken at CC it wont affect your Berkeley GPA either.
As an Applied Math student, if you're going to get out of your way to take most of the Applied Math core plus an upper-div Math elective, you might as well do the triple major in Applied Math. Most people in my cohort agree that the minor is practically useless. All you would need to do here is add in MATH 128A, and potentially two more courses that can be Econ, CS, or Math oriented depending on where you want to direct the domain toward. Yeah, it's prospectively a tougher courseload, and I would gauge this prospect further down the line until you begin taking upper-div Math courses, but if you can handle all of the above, it would probably be worth your while to raise the relevance of the Math side of your goals.
I qualified for the AIME sophomore year lol. But I’ve been out of the game since. And yeah I’m looking into possibly taking 54 at a city college. I’m registered for coastline and I’m trying to see if I can get a spot.
iirc applied math requires more than the 3 additional classes, most concentrations need more no? You can only overlap so much. Also I’m not that into math. All I really need to show for econ grad school is that I can do real analysis, I’m just adding complex and abstract algebra in order to avoid getting 0 official recognition for doing math courses, and this can be done without cutting into philosophy. But I’m not willing to sacrifice the philosophy minor in order to take courses I’m not interested in.

Thanks for the advice tho! Applied math as a major makes sense for industry opportunities, but I’m pretty set on academia, and computer science is a good enough backup as is.
I see you came to the same conclusion that I did, haha
Why is the math minor worthless ? I am also wanting to get a math minor. I am CS  + Math Minor but should I go for the major ?  I have extra space from my cs degree to do a math minor so I dont know if I should do a major .
disregard my warning then, you should be fine. I still reccomend doing the CC route for your own mental sanity and quality of life.
you can also https://cvc.edu/ to find other online math 54 articulations.
Fair enough lol. I definitely agree but worst comes to worst I’ll suffer through both.
Thank you!!
I’m also already registered as an SBCC student as I’m from Santa Barbara, but their linear algebra and differential equations classes are separate unfortunately."

You are receiving this email because you are an L&S student currently enrolled in EECS16B. This message is to inform you of two important changes to L&S CS graduation requirements.

* ***Effective immediately***: A grade of P in EECS16B earned during Spring 2022 will satisfy the graduation requirements for L&S CS for all students, regardless of graduation year. 
* ***Pending approval*** from the College of Letters and Sciences: The EECS16B graduation requirement may be removed entirely for L&S CS students. We anticipate that this decision will be made by L&S between April 5th and 8th. We have no indication whether L&S will accept this proposal, so do not drop the class assuming that it will be approved.

**Please note that if you opt to P/NP a course, you must earn a grade of C- or better to receive a P.** In other words, if you change from a letter grade to P/NP, and earn a D+, you will receive a grade of NP. A grade of NP is not sufficient to graduate. ","I failed it once barely, taking again this semester, so itd feels like i went through all that hard work and suffering for nothing.

I'm a first year L&S CS taking this class. I am not very sure whether to P/NP or letter grade. Any advice? What is the benefits of each? Will p/np hurt grad school applications?
Let's go guys! Make sure L&S hear us as well by signing this petition to remove EE16B major requirement.

Where are people getting this email? I'm currently enrolled in 16b and I haven't received this.
stop i love your flair and this comment was a wild ride LOL
I would say the P/NP would be neutral for grad school, a P does nothing to your GPA? ( if you pass) there are many more important upper div classes i would think theyd look at. Going Graded, you can pass with a D-, whereas you need a C- for P/NP. To me personally going graded has a benefit since I'm just trying to graduate at this point, and just like CS.
I got it in my @berkeley.edu email. Not sure why you didn’t receive it, but it’s real.

Sproul Piano 😢,https://i.imgur.com/3RVCuzO.jpg,2023-05-31 12:46:16,,"Why? Why would someone have done this? Heartless
This is at least piano #4. I'm not surprised at all. It tends to happen over summer or winter.

No, mankind cannot have nice things. 

Give it a few weeks, someone will add a new piano.
Why can’t the world have nice things? 😵‍💫
Mann whoever did this can suck their mums I swear. Loved hearing ppl play on this piano after a hard finals ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
shame
Least vandalized Berkeley public property
It's wild how there are always a few people out there who just want to destroy stuff for no reason. They make having a truly free society impossible.
Damn, that's frustrating
I'm over fucking People's Park. Somebody needs to get those people the help they deserve as human beings because right now students fear for their lives going back and forth to class. I grew up around Berkeley and People's Park is just not what it once was. It is full of violent people with mental health problems who need help!!! I hate that people are still clinging onto this old idea of a hippie park where peaceful protests would happen/people would gather. That shit doesn't happen anymore! Now people just get assaulted! Wake up fr get these people into treatment centers and build housing there. I'm SO over it.
Man. I liked hearing that when walking through Sproul.

Whoever did this is a genuine asshole.
Sad :(

That hand has an extra finger.
AH YES FINALLY A PIANO I CAN PLAY
chaos.
From counterculture to crackhead.
Sorry but this took some time to vandalise, what was security/UCPD doing? You also got to think that there was CCTV covering this and it is not as if UCPD had to go far....
Have that same cup
This has happened basically every year for the last 5 years. It always sucks. Freecycle and Trashnothing may have some pianos available if someone can transport one.  


Side note: Why are y'all making this a People's Park issue?
Kudos to those of you who actually think someone from peoples Park did this.
This is reality lol
Let’s be real here.  I love playing that piano at night or between classes, and last time I went to play it it looked good to go but was functionally useless, probably due to people playing it like a damn drum set.  A piano out in the public will lose a key here or there but it was already basically useless with whole octaves no longer functioning by finals week, while looking like maybe one or two keys would probably not work.  That it looks like this now is just a visualization of its already existing subsurface uselessness.  It’s ultimately good that this broken piano is visibly useless so the people who graciously take it upon themselves to install pianos on Sproul are more likely to know that it needs replacing.
So sad!! That piano has been there and enjoyed by all for several years. 😢😔
This is sad
At UCSB, by Sands Beach, someone put a piano. I played it several times, was so lovely. Within two weeks it’s keyboard looked like this. 

I figured it wouldn’t last long, being in the weather and all. But somebody just decided to destroy it.
what brand is it anyone?
A couple of the local meth heads got bored.
I hope so! 😢

Pave peoples park!!
what does that have to do with the piano
so brave 👏
It’ll be back. We’re on like the 5th piano now. He gets destroyed every final season, TBH.

Ur delusional 😂
For what? Shooting up?
does it really need to be said? most of us are capable of putting 2 and 2 together lol.
Peoples Park activists brought the second piano to campus 🤷🏽‍♂️
Great example of the Paradox of Tolerance in action. We are so tolerant and socially conscious that we welcome people who are hopelessly antisocial and intolerant...and now we’re paying the price.
And humble too
You forgot to say that they revere the arts as well but that’s cool. I guess in a sense this lowly piano is art too and says something as well when your statement is taken into context.
How does lived experience make me delusional. Don’t you think the ones sucking UC’s Oski, brown nosing the blue and gold and not having actual experience are the delusional ones 😮‍💨
Dude your dorm mates probably snort adderall and your frats are assaulting people nonstop. Students are just as fucked up if not worse cause you know better and can do better but you just complain on Reddit. Like… get off the high horse already.
the piano has old paint on it mentioning peoples park so the implication is that it’s peoples parks fault that the piano is missing some keys?
I like that. In my own personal experience I’ve found that absolute tolerance has led to enabling and disastrous choices for some friends of mine who dropped me because I would draw a line for what I believed was their own personal well-being. I’m not sure where that line is in society and honestly I’m glad Berkeley exists as it does to show us whatever it is we want to take away from it. To me, no place is perfect of course, but some do certainly have issues that aren’t as prevalent in other areas. It’s always a give and take though and one has to find the place they enjoy in my book.
Thanks for the ad hominem. I'm actually a woman and don't live in the dorms. If students are just as bad as the people in People's Park, maybe you should try your luck staying there? If it's just as safe as a dorm? Let me know how it goes!
lol there's no point in arguing with someone so blatantly blind to the truth. I think we all know that there's a pretty high chance that whoever vandalized the piano was a mentally-ill and/or drug addicted individual that places like peoples park attract from all over.
What is your major so I can judge you.
What is your major so I can judge you.
Compassion is nice but too much turns into enablement
I’m literally always there. And the fact you think “shooting up” is anything except pain relief is shameful. Please if you don’t like it you shouldn’t be at Berkeley. You are suppose to have a good education to get in. That means BASIC understanding of social issues including drug addiction. Students like you are bad and lack empathy. Still makes you a frat bro cause you’re no different.
Usually it’s people who are angry about finals. Not everyone at People’s Park are ill. Folks from People’s Park always play on that piano hence the graffiti 🙄
how do we know that a mentally ill person who lives in peoples park vandalized the piano? what is this based off of? vibes? how do you know random hooligans didn’t do it?
You are totally delusional if you think the perpetrator was a UC Berkeley student"
CS Declaration Policies (From EECS 101 Piazza),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fsjims/cs_declaration_policies_from_eecs_101_piazza/,2020-03-31 12:31:15,"for those of you not on Piazza:

 The EECS department faculty have approved two policy changes related to degree programs administered by the department. Both are designed so that there is no benefit to electing a letter grade for any course in Spring 2020 with respect to declaration or graduation. You can keep the default grading option of P/NP in all of your courses without compromising your graduation plans or reducing your chances of declaring the L&S CS major.  


1) P grades for all courses taken in Spring 2020 can be used to fulfill degree requirements that would normally require a letter grade for the following:  


\- Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Major  
\- Letters & Sciences Computer Science (L&S CS) Major  
\- Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Minor  
\- Computer Science (CS) Minor  
\- Electronic Intelligent Systems (EIS) Minor  


2) Regarding the GPA used to evaluate applications to the L&S Computer Science major (below called the ""declaration GPA""), which normally includes all grades from CS 61A, CS 61B (or CS 47B), and CS 70 (or CS 47F) that are taken at UC Berkeley:  


A) Students may choose to exclude their Spring 2020 grades in CS 61A, CS 61B, and/or CS 47B from their declaration GPA as long as their declaration GPA includes a grade from at least one of CS 61A, CS 61B, or CS 47B.  


Examples:  


i) A student receives a P in CS 61A in Spring 2020 and takes CS 61B and CS 70 in future semesters; the student may choose to exclude the CS 61A grade and use only grades from CS 61B and CS 70.  


ii) A student receives an NP in CS 61A in Spring 2020 and takes all three courses in future semesters; the student may choose to exclude the NP in CS 61A and use only grades from CS 61A, 61B, and 70 in future semesters.  


iii) A student receives a P in both CS 61A and 61B in Spring 2020; the student has two options: appeal to declare the major, in which case other grades will be considered, or use provision D below.  


B) Students may choose to substitute for their Spring 2020 grade in CS 70 using one of (i) their grade in EECS 16A taken before Spring 2020, (ii) their grade in EECS 16B (taken any time), or (iii) their grade in CS 70 retaken in a future semester. This substitution only applies to Spring 2020 grades in CS 70 of P or letter grades of C- and above.  


Examples:  


i) A student receives an A in EECS 16A in Fall 2019 and a P in CS 70 in Spring 2020; the student may choose to substitute the A for the P in their declaration GPA.  


ii) A student receives a P in CS 70 in Spring 2020 but has not taken EECS 16A; the student may choose to take either EECS 16B or retake CS 70 in a future semester and substitute either of those grades for their P in their declaration GPA.  


iii) A student receives a P in CS 70 and a P in EECS 16B in Spring 2020 and has never taken EECS 16A; the student should appeal to declare the major, and other grades will be considered.  


C) Students may choose to exclude their Spring 2020 grade in CS 70 of NP, F, D-, D, or D+ from their declaration GPA.  


Example:  


i) A student receives an NP in CS 70 in Spring 2020 and then retakes CS 70 in a future semester; the student may choose to exclude the NP from their declaration GPA.  


D) Students who receive a grade of P in any of CS 61A, CS 61B, or CS 70 in Spring 2020 may request to know what letter grade they would have received had they elected letter grading, and they may choose to use this letter grade in place of the P in their declaration GPA.  


Example:  


i) A student receives a P in CS 70; they request to know what letter grade they would have received, and the instructor says that they would have received an A. They may include this A in their declaration GPA in place of the P.  


Students can book an appointment with a CS Major advisor or email cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu to discuss their individual cases and determine their next steps toward completing the prerequisites and declaring L&S Computer Science.","cs gonna be even more crowded on top of having less TAs.. big yikes
makes me wonder how they are going to cull some of the cs majors bc clearly the department is struggling for money rn (TA shit)
[deleted]
I’m confused; is this a good thing or a bad thing?
If I got a B in 61A but I'm on track to get an A in 61B, should I take 61B graded or if I take it P/NP, would they factor in the grade I would have otherwise received?
[deleted]
If classes are online next semester, they could just hire the same amount of TAs to teach more people ;)
3.7 gpa cap
I'd argue they have it better. Those who had taken 16A and did well in it can just not give a crap about 70.
I'd say it's a good thing in the short term but bad for cs majors in the long term. However, no solution was going to fix everything. I certainly can't think of a solution that won't hurt students at some point, and this at least postpones the troubles to a future semester.
Either works since you can petition for them to look at your grade you would have otherwise received on appeal. IMO if you're on track to get an A there's no reason whatsoever to P/NP so you should save yourself the suffering of an appeal and a petition by just doing it this way
Take it for letter grade if you think you'll get a decent grade for admissions. Deadline to change to letter grade is some time in May so you'll have a good idea.

Feasibility of EE 120 + CS 162 + CS 170,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u1qj24/feasibility_of_ee_120_cs_162_cs_170/,2022-04-11 21:30:35,"Exactly what the title states. I am gauging my interest in hardware as well, so I was wondering if the above schedule is doable. For reference, I have a project group for 162, and while not good in theory, I will definitely pre-study for 170 before next semester starts. I will either take no classes/or one breadth (possibly p/np'd) on top of these 3 classes.","120 is a killer this semester. Homeworks are super long and time consuming. We have 6 exams and no notes or textbooks so it’s not fun
Strongly suggest that if you’re taking 162, don’t take any other tech with it (or take something light, like Data 100 or Info 159). The 3 projects are a massive time sink, the midterms are pretty tough, and the biweekly HWs take up whatever time is left.
120 is NOT a light class, this semester we are consistently doing long homeworks
don't do that to yourself. I had 170, EECS 151 in the same semester and it was a killer. I can't imagine having 162 projects overlapping with 2 other heavy-loaded classes in terms of assignments. You would wanna spend quality time on 162 and 170 I assume. Like learning the material deeply and doing good on the exams.
why is ee120 hard this semester i've heard it one of the easier upper div ee courses, is the instructor a new one?
6 exams? That sounds insane, is Babak trying to make the course harder?
I agree but i wouldnt say data100 is a light class -- it's easy to underestimate and do poorly in, especially in project semesters (vs final exams). But only if you put in effort then you will get a good grade, so I guess it has an easy reputation for that reason
Compared to 162 or 170, would it be a rather low work alternative?
The instructor is Babak so definitely not a new one. He’s been teaching this class for many years. I honestly don’t know what’s wrong
To be fair 3 are quizzes worth a total of 5% with one drop
I would say 162>170~=120
Pretty sure they’re worth 10% total but you still got to stress and study for them
Okay, then considering I have done very good on 61C (A+/A), good on 16B (A, A-), and okay on 70 (+B), would you say that with pre-study for 170, this schedule would be doable?
Oh ok 5% each then🤣
username checks out haha
As someone with around the same performance, it'd be doable but you'd be spending literally all your time doing PSETs and projects, and it really won't be  fun unless you're willing to sacrifice a lot of free time. For someone like me 162 + 170 is already plenty hard enough if you want to do well in the classes you're taking, have a few extracurriculars, and want some time for yourself/to go out. Prestudying tbh is pretty futile given how fast the course content goes anyways, the beginning of the semester is always the easiest so you wouldn't be saving much of anything.
I mean it's doable but not easy, really depends on your 162 team performance atm

Concerned about failing CS70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fxcfnv/concerned_about_failing_cs70/,2020-04-08 11:57:46,"As above. So I only need a P in this class to declare, but I’m really scared of failing since according to the fixed grade bins, I got a C+ on the first midterm and I completely bombed the second midterm yesterday night. The exam really fucking obliterated me. The thing is, I did everything course staff recommended: do the homework’s, go to review sessions, attend lecture, stay on top of shit. I tried a different study strategy than midterm 1, but I still got wrecked so hard. I feel bad being this close to declaring, but it seems so far to just get a C-. What does it take to get a P? How often is a D given out? :/

UPDATE: May have overreacted. I studied my ass off with past exams and went to office hours. Ended the class with a P (but actually a B+).","fellow cauliflower!!
You’d have to be well into -2 SD territory (historically) before you’d fail the class.

The median score (which would be a B+) for MT2 back in Spring 2019 was like 43% IIRC.
the class isn't curved in the sense that grades aren't relative, but sahai usually (significantly) changes the denominator on the exams. you'd literally have to be in the bottom 2% of the class to fail.
The grade bins include homeworks though. You can get a 40% on every exam and still get a passing grade with full homework scores. Don't use the raw exam score as an actual interpretation of your grade bin score because everyone's homework score will be much higher than their exam scores.
[deleted]
Just focus on the back end probability part which is super different then the discrete math portion. P is C- and it is all a curve so a D is given when your scores merit it so just aim for mean to be sure. As for advice for the final, start early and just do a lot of practice exams and really go through the parts you get wrong. Many of the exams reuse kinds of problems or ways of solving so you want to make sure you understand the questions after every practice test
in the worst case, if you feel really insecure about passing, you could always drop and take the class again? you'd probably do better than you are now because you're taking the class for a second time, and this semester you can still drop a class (once calcentral gets fixed). just something to consider.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I’m aware of this, but doesn’t he set the denominator before the exam? Because he was quite adamant about the fact that the grade bins would stay the same before and after the exam—even going through the effort of hashing the bins for us to verify that no changes happened. So how exactly does he change the denominator to curve in this way?
I’m a little unsure of how to verify this with the current grade bins. What were your calculations?
After
This is literally why I’m scared. I don’t want to take the class again. Scratch that—I can’t financially afford to take the class again.
If you were *actually* a Berkeley student, you'd realize that this course is not at all a measurement of passion for computer science. I have no doubt that I love and want to do CS, and I damn worked my ass off for a 4.0 in the previous two courses, and I'm trying my absolute best now in this course. Berkeley doesn't need pretentious people like you, so kindly fuck off.
Wow, interesting, I did not know that. 
Unless they made the exams easier though, wouldn’t grade bins be worse for students in general in this case?
only he knows what he does, but the end result is unless you're literally at the bottom of the class you won't fail. (and given the circumstances of this semester, maybe even then you won't fail.) his grade distributions for every class he teaches have consistently been nicer than other professors.
[deleted]
is this dude a sophomore in highschool? im cackling
The 70 exams this semester are significantly easier than previous years, at least from my experience. Easier tests with no curve is pretty common for Sahai led classes.
To be honest, I did most of the past ones and they are on pretty much the same level as this semesters. We have no short answer/true false so there really isnt much difference in difficulty.
True. Thanks for this. I feel somewhat better, but I’m still gonna bust my ass off for the final. :’D
Thanks! Lmao for some reason I saw 48% in my own calculations and thought F. Guess I haven’t grown out of the HS grading system. :’)

The main purpose, after all, is to inform people about (IMHO) often-overlooked (mostly math) classes, so I guess it would serve mostly the same purpose.

Hi Reddit, and happy new year!! :)

I'm a recent (December 2022!) graduate of UC Berkeley with a BA in Math. In this (warning: long) document, I want to share all of my life experiences that led up to my pursuit of a math degree at UC Berkeley for my undergrad, and reflect on all the classes I took in my four years here.

This is very much in progress; Parts 1-5 for each year in undergrad and my graduation/final thoughts and reflections are coming later!

[Google Docs link!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odP_txAl9T_icNMG5b1xlInQOfGULVa-s53w_8r07HY/edit#)","I ain't reading all that. 
I'm happy for u tho. 
Or sorry that happened.
Please do us, her and yourself a favor — ask this girl out
Just make a blog why reddit
Ima keep it real chief, we ain’t reading all that
haha I've also been trying to write a series of narrative-style things about my life (all pretty mundane topics, calling them memoirs makes it sound too deep) so it was cool to see someone else working on the same outside of the writing subreddits :)
Damn these comments negative af lol
Wtf dude. Also is some of this from your UC application essays? Lol
Respectfully, nobody cares enough to read your 5 part should-be-a-blog post.
Can't wait for the chapter on ""Why I chose Cal over Stanford""
Sheesh, some of these comments... I swear I see posts like this in other ""academic"" subreddits like r/Anki that don't receive the same amount of negativity as this post. People ""keeping it real"" by saying ""no one will read it"" could just not read it themselves because there are obviously people that will read this and will find this interesting.
Okay, I took out all the text from the post (it's all in the Google doc link). Hopefully less of an eyesore. :D
i'm reading it now op, keep em coming
this was a fun read! looking forward to what u post next
This was so cool to read, your writing is awesome! Please keep me in the loop on any new updates:)
First of all, congratulations! I didn’t read the Google doc, but wondering if you ever attended any workshops at MSRI?
Is this AI generated crap?
as a math major, I’m very invested. someone remind me when the next chapter comes out 😛
I'm just going to be honest, why tf do you think we want or have the time to read that? Another day, another Berkeley student with an overinflated ego. Seriously dude lol
Don’t care
Sorry everyone — she doesn’t seem to be interested in dating right now.
I promise it'll be more relevant soon; I wanted to give some perspective from the lens of a student (recent graduate) that could apply to/be useful for incoming and/or current students here. I know this post alone may not seem terribly relevant to Berkeley and/or Berkeley students right now, but I'll start going into my actual undergrad experience as a math major, including which classes I took here, and what my experiences were with them.

In order for that perspective to fully make sense, though, and for it to be as complete of a picture as possible, I go back to my experiences with contests, and how I came to fall in love with Berkeley as a whole (mostly this latter part), which these posts are about. Many of my thoughts are based on my experience with contests from my earlier days, and if I suddenly start going on about how, say, my combinatorics class here was really contest-like, it might not make too much sense otherwise. A blog just wouldn't have the same effect, I feel, especially when I start taking about concrete details of classes.

And not to mention -- the Berkeley Math Tournament (and most math contests in general) seems very under-appreciated to me, especially here on this subreddit! I'm partially writing this to help spread the word and hopefully get more people reading interested in that sort of thing (Putnam included) :D

I have a Google Docs file that I'm working on with all of this in it, so if you would all prefer, I could simply link to that instead (at least for all this ""Part 0"" content). I might as well just do it here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odP\_txAl9T\_icNMG5b1xlInQOfGULVa-s53w\_8r07HY/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odP_txAl9T_icNMG5b1xlInQOfGULVa-s53w_8r07HY/edit#)
That's great to hear! And yeah, it's easy to feel like things can be mundane sometimes, but everyone has their own unique perspective that makes anything fun to read. :)
""Wtf dude."" In a good way or bad way? :)

""Also is some of this from your UC application essays? Lol"" None of it is; I just now started writing this after graduating! In retrospect, some subset of this might've made a better essay than the ones I wrote :P although my actual essays were based around very similar ideas (math contests, what I learned from them, etc). I mostly focused on my experiences with being on the other side of the desk in those, and I'll probably get to those in later posts, too.
Understood, and thank you for the constructive note. I'll post only TL;DR versions of my course reviews here on Reddit, but I'll still leave the Google Docs link here in case anyone wants to read the entire thing. (Post edited to clarify this.)
But I got rejected from Stanford :P

Yep, I'm the living embodiment of the ""Stanford reject"" meme alright! (Although in all seriousness, BMT and other experiences like it helped convince me that Berkeley would be an amazing fit. For the most part.)

I haven’t — but it sounds like something I would’ve maybe liked to do.
I'm sorry. :( I have no expectation that anyone will read it fully, and that's perfectly okay! I understand I got carried away, but all of it comes from a genuine place of excitement and magical feelings when I was a kid, and I wasn't trying to show off or anything like that.

I was just hoping that bits and pieces of it might be useful and/or encouraging to people who wanted to try out math contests, and maybe also shed some light on how I came to be a math major here at Berkeley. The reasons that I fell in love with contests are a big part of why I got into math in the first place :)

Since math in general (and especially math contests) seems kind of under-appreciated, here or elsewhere, I really only wanted to show it to this subreddit to help spread the word about how awesome/life-changing it can be.

Yes, I fully understand your point about the length, and I don't disagree that what I've written, what with the focus being on \*my\* experiences, does translate to some degree of egotism. Thank you for pointing this out to me, sincerely. I want to make this applicable and relatable to everyone, not just myself. If I point out that a class was enjoyable or not for me, and for what reasons, I figured that it might help, say, incoming freshmen in deciding which classes they want to take.

I promise I'm not trying to make the focus on myself, as much as the whole experience of math contests and collaborative math as a whole.

In the future, I'll limit any posts I make here to simple course reviews that are quite short, and intended for informative purposes only, cutting out all the narrative.
I fully understand, and I'm sincerely sorry for wasting all of your time. I'll move the rest of it to a personal blog for anyone who still wants to give it a read (and I can link it in DMs).

Would it be more relevant to cut to the chase and post simple course reviews? I still feel as though there might be some value to be gotten from that, especially for classes that aren't super commonly taken or talked about.
It was in a ""this post is very, very long"" kind of way. Good on you for sharing your experiences. Especially by March, incoming freshmen might appreciate this post.
Stanford is overrated

Go Bears! :)
Dude honestly fuck these ppl. They could've scrolled past if not interested rather than put u down
Thank you! Certainly — everyone here definitely has a good point, and I probably should’ve realized the points about length.

Hopefully my (don’t worry, MUCH shorter, at least here on Reddit) course reviews will be helpful to not just freshmen, but everyone here! :)"

"Hi, I’m a new freshman and recently admitted into both Berkeley and Michigan. I’m leaning towards Michigan right now, but am not sure. I have a couple questions :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1291xnm/hi_im_a_new_freshman_and_recently_admitted_into/,2023-04-01 16:00:52,"I’m planning on doing Psychology in my first 2 years then going into either Haas/Ross in my last 2 years. 

I’d be paying around 40K for Berkeley and around 55K for Michigan. The difference is small, but it is definitely still there.

1. Why did you choose Berkeley/Michigan? Are those reasons different from what makes you like being studying here today?

2. What other colleges did you apply to? What attracted you to them?

3. What’s something future students should know about the college? Like, anything in a bad way?

4. What’s the best thing that sets Berkeley apart from other high ranking colleges. What’s the worst thing that sets it apart?

5. How would you characterize the majority of students?

6. What are your favorite aspects of school spirit?

7. What is the campus like? Not in an aesthetics way, but is it fun and exciting? 

8. How much work do you usually have a day/week? I’m probably doing a psych undergrad and something in Haas/Ross for grad

9. What do you like to do for fun? Like, something specific, around campus maybe. 

11. What’s the most helpful advice you could give to someone going here, in a specific way related to Berkeley. Any other college in general?

12. Berkeley has an overpopulation problem and I want to know how that factors into student life. Is there a problem getting classes I’d want? Student housing? Etc 

P.S: please don’t sugarcoat anything, I wanna read a couple honest opinions and really see what it’s like.

THANK YOU!!!❤️","1. i chose berkeley because of the cost (given the price comparison you said, i would say that 15k is a large difference for sure) and also the resources here. i was honestly going in not too sure what i was going to do, and I'm so glad that i came here. given the fact that you're immediately exposed to this vast network of individuals who are not only welcoming but also readily willing to share their resources with you, it's quite reassuring to know that you'll end up okay because you know so many individuals who have gone through the same things you did. not sure what you mean by the second part of the question but everyone here is so diverse and brings a lot of cultural meaning to the work they do, and you definitely learn a lot from the people you interact with. 
2. i was picking between berkeley and washu st. louis as my top choices at the end of the day and honestly it was down to price and the development of the areas around it, given that i was wanting to go into industry right after graduation anyways. while i had gotten admitted to washu's program that would allow me to receive specific resources and get a nice job, i think i was just looking for something more affordable as well as in a location that would be best for me. (i am a pre-haas major so business definitely has more opportunities in the bay area because we have so many start-ups that are based here, that's not to say that just because you don't go to Berkeley you won't get any access to these companies as well). but overall i wasn't looking for something specific in a school because i knew i would thrive wherever, just down to the location + price
3. i think one thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of students here at Berkeley are from California (and a lot of those students are bay area kids) meaning that competition and working hard is kind of ingrained in them. obviously, people here are super supportive but everyone is always on the grindset. be prepared to look for internships from the get go and start thinking about your professional life (especially if you're applying to haas because it's a huge culture here with consulting clubs and everything). but i recommend that you try out looking for clubs to join (sproul tabling will let you know everything you need) as it really helped me figure out what exactly i wanted to do! also grade deflation is honestly not that big of a deal unless you are taking really hard technicals (which i doubt you will be given your major). it's just about learning to study for exams rather than doing homework because the vast majority of classes weigh exams a lottt more than you think it does. 
4. i think berkeley is definitely an all-rounder academically, you really can't find anything as nice as the quality of education being taught here. we have top ranked stem but also top ranked business and other humanities and overall we're just really ranked high in so many areas i will assure you the education you will get will not be subpar whatsoever. however, we do have a housing crisis meaning prices for rent are major expensive (be prepared to pay at least 1500 a month for rent if you move out of the dorms for your own room). also it definitely is not the safest in Berkeley (as you may know) but at the same time it's a lot of major cities and it's jus about learning to be aware of your surroundings and be street smart!
5. the majority of the students are definitely passionate and hardworking. I've honestly never met a group of individuals who are more passionate than the people here. we're super open to social topics (obviously because we protest literally on campus) and it's super inspiring to see all the future leaders learning with you in the same classroom and it just inspires you to do the same as well. i think we're all trying to make an impact in this world in some way, and that's why i am really happy to be here because I'm always so inspired when i talk with individuals on campus about their experiences, etc and it's really motivating as well.
6. honestly I'm not too into school spirit and i think umich def has it better for school spirit (i have been to one sports event in the entirety of my freshman year) but the rivalry game is definitely the most fun thing ever because that's when the spirit really comes through. but other than that it's alright most people are studying anyways LOL
7. the campus is always lively honestly esp in the beginning of the semester because on sproul clubs will be tabling and advertising and stuff and there's always people on campus everywhere. and MLK def hosts a lot of events as well so if you're interested in that they got free stuff being handed out all the time too. however, housing is entirely off-campus so campus itself is just buildings for classrooms and learning etc. but we occasionally get those performances on sproul so it's fire
8. i think for me just based on classes alone (i am public health + business) it really did not take that much of my time to get through work. obviously the more technicals you take (like CS classes) there will be more work because of the amount of projects and other stuff they have, but it's definitely manageable, because i also have other stuff that I'm doing at the same time (such as a club, internship work, etc.). plus i have time to hang with friends on a Friday or Saturday so it's really chill
9. for fun there's a lot you can do!! you can go to SF and explore there because it's an entirely new place that you can walk around and see (it's a bart ride away), there's often concerts in SF or oakland, even at the greek theater too or the UC theater downtown. there's also club events if you are in a club (my club hosts socials once in a while so it's fun to go out to those). obviously the frats throw and if you get a bid you can go to frat row and party it out. and there's so much to explore on telegraph (thrifting!) and downtown as well. 
10. most helpful advice is to be open-minded i would say, it's important to not limit yourself to a specific social bubble or mindset and always be willing to learn new things! it kind of comes with the fact that Berkeley has like 40k students for undergrad and grad so you'll always be meeting new people somehow. also it's important to establish a work-life balance as if you are trying to get into many activities it can be hard to see that, but once you got it down it's honestly manageable to live your life and be good with academics!
11. obviously classes it'll be hard to get it if your enrollment time is pretty bad, HOWEVER it's easy to get off waitlists for most classes because you can talk to the gsi or the prof. housing is going to be hard to get, even the good dorms as well because there's so much competition and it's a lottery at the end of the day. most people go off-campus (not affiliated with the uni) after first year because it's honestly a scam (I'm paying 2.5k a month for a triple in a small ass room FYI) and you can find MUCH better options off-campus. another thing is advising. i didn't really talk to an advisor at all to plan out my college career i kind of did everything myself and figured it out myself, you kind of have to be self-sufficient in this way because our advising (esp in L&S) is ass. however the upside to the large student pop is that you have sm upperclassmen who can help you!

ya that's all i have to say, hope this helps you make your decision!!
No guarantee you’re gonna make it into haas, but that’s what good abt Berkeley, u can switch to any other field and you’re still getting a world class degree. 15k x 4 = $60k for going to Michigan, u say ur family is well off enough for that so u can choose whatever but $60k will take u very far.. I would personally just say Berkeley, live the good bay life and at the same time have a LOT of flexibility in your future career options. But it’s ur choice eod
1. I was accepted to Berkeley and waitlisted at Michigan with both being in my top 5, but I declined the waitlist. Biggest reason was having visited UIUC, which is south of UMich, and my face literally peeling due to how cold it was during a 2 day visit. Meanwhile, when I visited Berkeley, it was super sunny and great and beautiful and there was a ton of nature around. Other reasons included Berkeley being better for my major, not liking sports, and wanting a very progressive student body. Also we have better squirrels

1 1. Classes are a lottery especially for high demand gen eds. Housing is fine but pricy, but you shouldn’t have trouble finding somewhere nice off campus for significantly better value than the dorms.
Ok as someone who has lived in Michigan for 13 years if your mood or motivation is affected by weather (and I mean like seasonal depression ) don’t go to Michigan lmao especially if you grew up in California/ SoCal. But maybe that’s just a me issue 😅😅. Also Berkeley is tied #1 for psychology so I would definitely recommend Berkeley especially if there is a chance you won’t be able to get into a business admin program.
Props to you for being diligent. I was not. However, I’m really happy at Berkeley. Classes are tough, students are active and interesting, and there’s much to do in the Bay. I’m sure Michigan can say the first two things (Berkeley is still better there) but it certainly lacks the third (why would you willingly choose Ann Arbor over the beautiful bay). Ok, I am overselling. 

In all seriousness, Berkeley is a great place if you love learning and want to see more of the world—it’s so unique. Come here and choose to experience it all.
Did you get into Ross already or are you trying to transfer to it?
11. Getting classes you want depends on your enrollment time. You get assigned a random time on Enrollment Day 1 or Enrollment Day 2, so the earlier the time, the more likely you are to get your classes. For very large lower div's you generally don't have to worry about being enrolled in them. Most of the smaller classes I have to take are all requirements such as Reading & Comprehension, L&S Breadths where there are many classes that can fulfill the same requirement. It's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you have backup courses in case you can't get your first choice. I haven't had problems getting courses I want, but know some people who have. This experience may be different with different majors.

Also quite note - idk how UMich enrollment works, but some smaller colleges also have problems with enrollment; there's less students, but there's less seats available. Smaller school doesn't have to equal less trouble enrolling.

&#x200B;

For housing, Cal Housing is guaranteed your first year but that's it. Most people find off-campus apartments their second year and beyond, some look as early as November/December/January. You can still apply for university housing but you're more likely to not receive an offer than to receive an offer after your first year, so it's better to just look for other options. Rent may get a bit expensive, depending on what's available when you start looking.
6. THE BIG GAME THE BIG GAME THE BIG GAME :D
I selected preferred admission and have a pretty good chance of getting into Ross
(admittedly we don't have the most school spirit but especially during the Big Game and if we're winning, you can feel it)
If you care a lot about getting an undergraduate business degree, go to Michigan. If you're fine with alternative majors in the event you don't get into Haas (such as Psych by itself or an Econ/Psych double major), go to Berkeley."

As someone who has taken Art 12 previously, how was it? Was it difficult to follow? Are the expectations for quality high? Was the work rate/amount high? (I'll probably drop it if the general consensus is that getting an A is hard)

Are you supposed to have a resume / experience as a sophomore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xsfn6s/are_you_supposed_to_have_a_resume_experience_as_a/,2022-09-30 16:16:28,"Apparently sophomore year is the year you're supposed to start applying for internships in your CS / DS. I wasn't actually going to do it until some company, D.E. Shaw group, somehow got hold of my Berkeley email and started messaging me constantly telling me to apply. The thing is though my resume looks like shit. I don't have any experience, I'm not in any clubs and haven't joined any and really haven't done much since High School. Not mention my G.P.A right now is, let's just say a work in progress especially after a not so hot freshman year. Am I like really behind or is this normal?","I’m in the same boat if that makes you feel better
Nice to apply and get one for the summer between sophomore and junior year, but not the end of the world if you don’t get one.  Much more important to get one the summer between junior and senior year.
The message you're receiving is an automated ad. I am getting ads to apply to companies everywhere from my LinkedIn, Handshake, my Instagram feed, and even this subreddit. Don't pay it too much heed. However, you do need to get things to put on your resume. You are paying a lot of money to come here and the economy is not doing well.
I don't go to Berkeley lol but I'm basically in the same situation as you. Last year when I was a freshman, I was super motivated and applied to a ton of CS clubs but got rejected from all of them, which made me upset and pessimistic so I stopped trying. I did nothing productive this summer and I'm screwed. Somehow I managed to maintain a good GPA but I really doubt that's enough to get me an internship.
Tbh yeah,, current junior making up for lack of resume since big companies are currently recruiting for summer, so by the time I actually have enough experience to apply, smaller companies will start recruiting (but I’ll be applying basically anywhere lol)
Put your class projects on your resume and any experience you have (like jobs or even high school stuff if you really have nothing) and apply. Ideally it's best to get some type of internship/research experience during your sophomore year so you have something more tangible on your resume next year.
I've never had a company ask for my GPA. Experience matters more. You don't need a club or an internship to be work on cool things -- work on your own projects in your own free time, something that interests you. Go to hackathons! Hackathons are fun and you get to meet friends / network with companies / get free swag.  

A sophomore internship imo is something that's nice to have, but a lot of people get their first internships in their junior year. And if you think about it, since you graduate and start work you won't really have a whole summer to yourself anyways, so don't stress too much about not having a formal internship when you can do your own cool things in your own time. : )

"Feeling trapped, helpless and depressed",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tgwe6y/feeling_trapped_helpless_and_depressed/,2022-03-18 01:10:39,"To preface this off, I’d like to say please don’t feel bad for me because I brought this upon myself by being a stupid lazy shitbag.

I’m mainly posting this here to bring myself solace and also so that other students won’t make the same mistakes I did. However, I would also appreciate advice to help with my predicament.

I’m currently a Freshman in my second semester and I initially planned on majoring in Physics and CS. I was previously interested in Physics and decided to also try majoring in CS to try to appease my parents bc “pHySiCS diDNt pAY wElL” .

Anyways, in addition to a foreign language class, the only classes that I’m taking this semester are Physics 5B and CS61A for a total of 12 units.

Compared to my peers, 12 units was barely anything so I remember going into the semester thinking everything would be a breeze. How wrong I was…

Being the lazy procrastinating shitbag I am, I just couldn’t find the motivation to do homework or attend lecture/discussions for either of the aforementioned classes, and now I’d be lucky to pass either. It didn’t help that I was prescribed this anti-anxiety pill right before the semester started: The pill did help a bit with my anxiety but it made me feel lethargic and apathetic to the point that the sense of urgency from missing assignments just didn’t register to my tiny brain. Ironically, this was gonna increase my anxiety in the long term.

To make matters worse, whatever interest I previously had in Physics just seemingly vanished. I’m not sure if it’s because of the difficulty of the class or something else but this is just depressing.

I guess I could use both my emergency drops on those classes know but then I’d have to explain to my parents what happened and they’d kill me probably. Also, there’s the fact that I’d never be able to use those drops again.

All in all, I’ve been inadvertently digging my grave for the past 2 months and now I’m screwed

Lowkey wish I could just snap my fingers and disappear or something

Anyways thanks for putting up with my rant I guess

Edit: One thing I forgot to mention is that, oddly enough, I think I’m starting to develop an interest in CS lol especially when we reached that section about Object-Oriented Programming. If I somehow do manage to use both emergency drops, I think I’ll continue to try to major in CS and maybe minor in Physics to see if I can rekindle the lost interest","This semester isn't over yet. You can use the emergency drops if you must, but I would give one last shot before doing so. You can reassess your interest in CS/physics after passing the classes first.
OP, you can definitely use this spring break to catch up. Depending on your grade in (I assume 61A), you may need to use a late drop on that.

Personally, I didn't really realize I liked CS until I took 61B. Liked it so much that I decided to switch majors. + CS/Physics is a cracked combo
Hey, 

It's going to be ok! Definitely use this spring break to try to catch up, and see how it goes. Worst comes to worse, you can drop or late drop if you need. Won't hurt if it's your first one. 

Good luck!"

P/NP 61a?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gdqdth/pnp_61a/,2020-05-04 20:33:46,"At what grade is this worth doing? Anything less than an A? I’m looking at probably an A- and don’t know if I’m being ridiculous or not by wanting to P/NP that away. I’d love to keep a high gpa all undergrad but I don’t know if it’s realistic. Also, the whole mixed P/NP debate is relevant because I’m doing pretty strong in other classes. Hate to add another one of these questions but wtf am I, a clueless freshman, to do?","A- in 61a is great I don’t see why you wouldn’t take the letter
Are you trying for CS? The only reason to PNP 61A is if you're getting less than a B+
it depends on what you want to do as a career. if you want to go into cs, an a minus in 61a is great as it's above average. it def looks better than a pass as a pass could be a c minus.
i’m pnping all my A- and belows too, duh. it literally lowers your gpa. and it could impact you in the long run but that’s only if u fail future courses. don’t fail future courses.
Don’t get me wrong I’m stoked to have secured that letter, but I’m just thinking of the math that goes into overall gpa. If I keep it above 3.7 then even an A- will ultimately count against me. Kind of outrageous to think about but... such is cal
Yeah normally that’s totally true, but this semester the choice to include the grade in the deceleration gpa calculation is separate from whether the course is P/NP
Literally fail? I’m assuming you mean if I end up with a gpa lower than 3.7, but that’s a far cry from failing
3.7 is a great GPA, and assuming you are trying to declare puts you on a great path. I don’t really know what you mean by such is Cal, anyone I know would love an A-.
fail as in get anything below a B i guess
Thank you for the encouragement! I suppose I should probably not stress about it so much. My thought in favor of P/NP is that if I average above 3.7 then it’d be in my favor and if I go below that then the additional A- probably wouldn’t matter to me that much anyway
Keep in mind averaging above 3.7 means mostly As, that a pretty tough goal to achieve, and if you are in 61a I doubt you have taken many other classes that would give you a better idea of what GPA you could expect.
That’s exactly why I’m asking lol! It’s probably unrealistic"
I'm starting a movement to ban the practice of charging College Application Fees,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xn3pk8/im_starting_a_movement_to_ban_the_practice_of/,2022-09-24 13:51:52," Hi all,

My name is Greg Rogers, and I'm starting a movement to ban the practice of higher education institutions charging application fees. [I've created a petition on Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/ban-college-application-fees), and also started amassing a [volunteer list for those that wish to be an ambassador for their university](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOkgdLKaXeIEBmKknDbLKeIciaH4KETjpoD9RNXbXjBJEzhQ/viewform?usp=sf_link), or even their local district.

After contacting my state and federal representatives, it was clear that a movement with momentum was needed in order to turn any heads. A simple petition will not get noticed on its own, but a petition with strategic pressure is a powerful method for motivating change.

Higher Education in the United States is becoming more inequitable as family income has failed to keep up with the rising prices of tuition and other education expenses. While the application is small in the grand scheme of things, it represents the first barrier many face when trying to take the next step towards higher education.

Thank you for reading, and if you haven't, [please consider signing the petition](https://www.change.org/p/ban-college-application-fees).","I mean, colleges have to pay people to read those applications. If Harvard removed their fee, and suddenly gets 10 million applications, what are they supposed to do, just automate most of the process?

This looks bad if thep see you pnp a tech or major related course. If you're not interested in humanities gradschool, it won't affect you if you pnp a breath/GE. Many people regular pnp all their humanity classes here.
From the EECS 101 post:

""Students who receive a grade of P in any of CS 61A, CS 61B, or CS 70 in Spring 2020 may request to know what letter grade they would have received had they elected letter grading, and they may choose to use this letter grade in place of the P in their declaration GPA.""

So you can take 61B P/NP officially, but have the grade you would've received count towards your declaration GPA.

The full email:

Dear students, faculty, and staff,

The UC Berkeley Library is seeking your feedback on a significant, long-term restructuring of library locations and hours to address the research, teaching, and learning needs of the campus community while maintaining a balanced budget. 

The Library’s [long-term space plan](http://ucberk.li/space-plan) is open for comment from Monday, Oct. 3, through Monday, Oct. 31.

**Share your thoughts**

* Fill out a [short Google form](http://ucberk.li/space-feedback). 
* Join us at a public forum in Morrison Library:
   * **Students:** Monday, Oct. 10, 4-5 p.m.
   * **Faculty and staff:** Tuesday, Oct. 11, 4-5 p.m.

The long-term space plan was recommended by campus leadership and has been reviewed and discussed with members of the ASUC and Graduate Assembly; the divisions of Academic Planning and Undergraduate Education; the Academic Senate; and deans and department chairs. We are now seeking broader campus input, and we thank you for taking the time to participate.

**Key points of the plan**

The new vision for the Library’s 23 locations includes:

* **11 hub libraries**: Long hours for locations with the most study seats, and comprehensive library services that cover a range of disciplines.
* **Six satellite libraries:** Smaller spaces for studying and browsing collections, with more limited hours.

So are there politics behind the power shutoff in the East Bay?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dfrddj/so_are_there_politics_behind_the_power_shutoff_in/,2019-10-09 19:13:58,"Trying to find out what is going on behind the scenes, without having to listen to 2000 tin foil hat conspiracies, can be difficult around here. (Berkeley)  
I do know that the man heading PG&E, William D  Johnson (Acting CEO) once headed the Tennessee Valley Association. and was voted off the board of two separate energy companies.   
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William\_D.\_Johnson\_(CEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_D._Johnson_(CEO)) 

Others involved in the operations include:

* David S. Thomason (Vice President & Controller)
* Forrest E. Miller (Chairman of the Board)
* Nickolas Stavropoulos (President & COO)
* David S. Thomaso (Vice President & CFO)  


Other then the claim that there are ""high winds"" (there are not currently high winds in the east bay) could there be other political or financial reasons for the power shutoff?  
Just wondering.   
THanks.  
MB","Its priming the bay area and softening the masses so that when the Chinese & North Korean amphibious assault craft hit the beaches we'll all be concerned with Traders Joe's being open or not
More like additional lawsuit prevention.
Uh its way more than the bay, it's a huge part of central and northern California due to the heavy fire risk of shitty infrastructure + unkept brush. The East Bay has been barely affected by the power shutoffs as well.
Your guys' explanations all fall short, and I am certain you are part of the coverup, since I have it on good authority that this is an Illuminati plot to sell us as tasty snacks to  shape-shifting lizards  from the fourth dimension. Rosewell! Rosewell!  
Lol. But seriously. thanks guys. After last year it makes sense, especially with the lawsuits. That's a first, and a lot of us felt something new was in play, and that is it.  
THanks.

Just because they aren’t high winds right now doesn’t mean there won’t be. Current forecasts predict heavy winds tonight.
Why are you complaining? This is good for climate justice. California is leading the way with this.
Nah, the area 51 raids already proved that one wrong  The reptillians and 4th D'ers  just wanna do butt stuff
That's why I found it odd. It stands out.   
There's been periodic heavy winds in the late summer for my entire life around here, and the last wildfire we had was the Oakland Hills fire, (1991. I was there) and they've never shut off the power like this before.
Why? Obviously the threat of my air fryer not finishing my whole foods Foie gras nacho fries, in time to watch netflix with my new bluetooth headphones, and order a cafe latte in the morning from door dash, was far more than my weary soul could bear. Wait....wait... you're triggering me!   
Lol.
So THAT'S what all this ""storm area 51"" stuff is about! 

Everyone just wants to get all freeky deeky with with E.T. Typical californians. Always looking for a reason to party.  
What's that address again?
2018 was the worst wild fire year in recorded history, there were several large wildfires, paradise wasn’t even the largest one. The one in Butte county was the deadliest. The one in Sonoma county that burnt entire neighborhoods down is thought to have been caused in some way by PG&E, they’re facing like $18 billion in damages for it. I also believe the government of California threatened them in some way that is making them even more paranoid and cautious about any fire happening that can in any way be blamed on them.
It's basically just precautionary after what happened in Paradise last year.
PG&E hasn't been properly maintaining their lines for years. The 2017 fires was the first time it really came back to haunt them. Now they're bankrupt and facing billions of dollars in lawsuits while still failing to maintain their lines. They know their infrastructure is shit and they recently found out that they can get in trouble for it. PG&E shut off the power because they know how poorly maintained their infrastructure is and don't want anymore lawsuits. 
They need to be broken up.
Dunno, I was in Mexico recruiting midgets at the time, didn't get the info

Taking advanced Art Practice classes as a non-major?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/umdo5b/taking_advanced_art_practice_classes_as_a_nonmajor/,2022-05-10 01:11:20,"I’d like to take an art class next semester, but the only ones that fit my schedule are advanced studio courses, and I’ve not done a single foundation art course at Berkeley before. Would it be a bad idea to try and take an advanced studio course anyways (potentially P/NP)? 

I grew up doing a lot of art, so I’m not completely out of my depth, but I’m sure these courses will be pretty different from anything I’ve experienced thus far. Any art practice majors have thoughts on the feasibility of this?","Depending on your experience, it could be feasible. Among art majors, prerequisites are not heavily enforced, but there are times the advanced courses prove to be too much for someone who was given an exception. I do not know how much of this leeway is allowed for non-majors. Another thought, you mentioned not taking art courses at Berkeley. Did you take any at another college? If so, they may meet the prerequisite.

The bigger problem you will have is actually securing a spot in one of these classes. It has been extremely competitive trying to get into many of these courses each semester. We generally need to register as soon as our enrollment time hits.

However, I recommend giving it your best try. The worst thing that happens is they say no. Good luck!
Thank you, this is super helpful!!"
Policy to prevent purposely failing CS classes to declare CS almost in place,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5n9e3d/policy_to_prevent_purposely_failing_cs_classes_to/,2017-01-10 18:12:34,"I think this is a great idea.

**Original Post from Chris Hunn:**
> **Change to course retake rules for the L&S CS major GPA threshold**
> 
> In light of the high demand for EECS courses and the CS major, the faculty are considering a proposal that revises our major admissions policy to discourage CS-intended students from intentionally failing lower-division courses. This practice delays student progress, increases enrollment in lower-division courses, and can lead students to make decisions that they later regret. Lower-division courses required for the major should be taken for a letter grade, and students who intend to major in CS should endeavor to pass. The proposed policy change encourages CS-intended students to do so.

>  
> 
> The new proposal has already been voted on and approved by the EECS Undergraduate Study Committee, and the vote for final approval by all faculty will take place on January 30, 2017.  We expect final approval to go through, so please plan as if the policy is effective immediately.

Considering that last semester there were 1600 people in CS61A, the demand for CS is at an all time high. We don't have nearly as much funding for that many students. 
Good
I think they should then also allow you to take it again without failing and have it count towards your GPA. ie. You get a B- the first time but you needed a B so you have to take it again and get a B+ this time. 
How in the word did they manage that organizationally? When I graduated we had something like 700 in 61A and Wheeler was maxed out.
This would make the overcrowding in 61a unbearable, and impossible to support. We already need to rely on Google to have this class, we can't have it be even worse.

I know everyone wants ideally that you should have a second chance if you don't do well, but that isn't the reality. These policies are designed to limit enrollment, and not because they need to have a 3.3 level of understanding to take further classes. Beyond that, this is against university policy which the Cs dept cannot change.
They moved it to Zellerbach... :\
Then they should honestly make it not related to your GPA. Just have CS majors declare upon applying to the university like those of us in Engineering had to do. It's just seems silly that they have to go through all of this just to limit enrollment. 
Only for the first lecture. It was in Pauley the rest of the semester, because students just went for the webcasts instead.
Why? If it's well advertised and changes only affect new students people can choose to apply to eecs or not. Now who is able to do CS is based upon real success in CS classes at college, not whatever arbitrary criteria and randomness gets through the college admissions process, which is meant to try and determine who would be successful at college, exactly what the GPA limit tests.

Additionally, the CS department cannot make that change the way people are declared into LS, and this would be a huge change, but the CS dept can be really on top of changing declaration process, and while this is a problem now it likely won't always be. After the dot com bubble the CS dept was quickly able to remove the GPA cap which was then 3.5.

So the solution is still to watch as more and more students attempt to declare CS, can't meet the criteria and are either forced to transfer or choose a major that they don't prefer. Just feels like the students who don't meet the GPA requirement are getting shafted even though they may not be bad at CS or unworthy of obtaining a degree. 
The alternative is that the same amount of people will get shafted by being rejected. I know everyone only focuses on the negatives here because no one who makes the gpa cut off complains about it, but as a LSCS major who did not apply as a CS major, I think it's good that the people who perform the best in actual CS classes are able to do CS, not just those that applied to do it. While I don't think those with lower gpa than me are ""bad"" at CS and certainly not unworthy, the reality is the CS dept cannot accommodate everyone, and I believe those with a track record of success in CS classes at Berkeley is the best way to determine who should be prioritized. Where I would have a problem is a more arbitrary system like haas or college applications where there is more uncertainty around how likely you are to get in. Here there is a firm line in the sand drawn, and everyone is made aware of it beforehand, and then you can choose with that information to go here or not, because at the end of the day no one is making people come here.

Yes it is unfortunate that people who have decided to go here are unable to do CS, but this is made clear to people that this can and will happen, and need to plan accordingly. I know people who have not made the cutoff and done CogSci, applied math with concentrations in CS, physics, biology and other things and have been just fine down the road.
That's not the answer. Actually, your solution is a bit elitist. The real answer is to make sure the CS department has sufficient funding to accept everyone who can graduate in CS with a 2.0 GPA. If this means funding needs to be cut elsewhere such as athletics or a department with few students and little research, that difficult decision needs to be made. I don't want xyz department saved while students get screwed over with that 3.3 GPA cutoff. That being said, I agree that something had to be done about folks who failed CS classes deliberately.

Imagine how many more students would apply to CS if it was guaranteed with a 2.0 prereq GPA. And how many people in cogsci or math didn't really want those majors?

Political Science Advisors trying to discourage us from taking classes P/NP,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jovt3q/political_science_advisors_trying_to_discourage/,2020-11-05 17:39:06,"From their most recent email:
-------

Dear Political Science Majors, 

We recognize that remote instruction due to COVID-19 has been challenging for many students.  You would have received an email this afternoon from the College of Letters and Science regarding grading options for this academic year.  In consultation with the College of Letters and Science, and the Academic Senate, we wanted to convey that you now have the option of switching your grading option for your major courses to PNP for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.

Before you do, it is important to note the following:

1.  A major course taken P/NP may have a negative impact on instructors’ ability to provide students with substantive letters of recommendation.

2. Multiple major courses taken P/NP may have a negative impact on how law schools and graduate schools or potential employers evaluate students’ qualifications; PNP gives no indication of performance. Law schools and graduate schools won't have as much substantive information to evaluate performance.  Students who opt for P/NP for a large number of courses may run the risk of finding themselves at a competitive disadvantage.","Is there supposed to be something wrong with this email?
I mean...that seems fair, especially the second point. As someone on a grad admissions committee, I'd be much more impressed by someone who took a major requirement (especially a core one) for a grade and got an A/B than someone who got a P.
All I see here is facts and logic tbh.. I’m glad the department is actively handing out information so that its students can make an informed decision. That’s what a support system is supposed to do right? Not just blindly push you toward a decision you we’re going to make, but rather present all aspects of a decision and its potential ramifications. At my med school interview during the pre-interview social with current students they asked us how many of us chose to P/F last spring and no one there raised their hand. Could be small sample or reporting bias, but there is some truth to adcoms perhaps giving optional P/F choices some weight.
I can’t speak for Political Science, but I have been a hiring manager and sat on grad program admissions committees. 

If I saw a transcript with As and Ps, I’d hope that somewhere in the application there would be an explanation of those P grades. If I saw a transcript after a pandemic with As, Bs and even Cs, I’d want to know about those grades too. 

Fundamentally those decisions are about who is the best prepared for the next level and who will be most effective there. Grades are just a proxy for that, one of many. When thinking about those pandemic P and B/C grades, I’d want to know if the student was able to really learn that material or not. Was this just a circumstantial problem getting tests and assignments done that led to the grade, and they really know the stuff? Or did the student just not learn the material and the grade reflects that?

This is why it might be better to drop a course or two and focus on really learning in the rest. Really focus on what you really need to learn and the skills you need to acquire. Do that well. That makes an unambiguous record. 

Admit committees read a lot of applications and have a lot of experience with students. They tend to see through mere grade manipulations. That’s part of their job.
They did the exact same thing last semester too lol
If grads schools really value GPA however, would it not be better to P/NP selectively in the interest of one’s GPA, even if the grade would’ve been a B or A-? Genuine question, I’m trying to decide the answer to for one my classes
But what if the person who took the P had the ability to get an A grade but due to Covid, had to take it P/NP?
I can't speak for all grad programs, obviously, but at least for my program (and I imagine for most), we look at the *entire* transcript. If we see P for a core major requirement, all we know is that it means ""C-level"". We would, of course, know that P/NPing a major requirement was allowed, and the natural assumption is that the student was going to get something like a C (or at least, below their normal trend), and that's why elected to take the P.

It's a bit of an unfortunate assumption, but it does make sense. A student who chose to take a P almost certainly is because that student would have gotten a not-so-good grade otherwise. After all, you're considering doing this yourself, right?

Honestly, if you're applying to grad school or the like, I would say don't take the P unless you truly need to (e.g. due to external circumstances, or because you're really on track to get a C-). It's not worth it to try and game the system to bump up your GPA, because we do comb through your transcript.
Unfortunately, that's not going to be very apparent in most applications. Let's say I'm comparing Alice and Bob for some position in a lab or the department. Alice has gotten all As except for one or two Bs during COVID. Bob's transcript is identical, except for the classes where Alice got a B, he got a P. All else equal (which, granted, is not typically the case), Alice seems the more impressive candidate.

Bob, of course, could explain how COVID is responsible for his less-than-stellar performance in those two semesters (if the option is even available), but I also would expect that many students would take advantage of this option (COVID has been disruptive to everyone in some way, and students/applicants typically do try and game the system as much as possible, so to speak), so the meaning is unfortunately diminished.
There is literally no way to verify if that is true or not. Anyone can say they had the “ability” to get an A but didn’t.
[deleted]
Thank you for your answer!!
No one is asking to verify lol
There's no hard-and-fast rule, of course, but think of it this way:

If you take the P option for a class, are you prepared to have the reader of your transcript equate that with a C? Because that's an assumption/intuition/bias that most readers will have."

in a similar situation right now and was wondering if you end up passing that class??
Hi, I am a student who might take this class next semester. How was a weekly workload(how many hours a week) for this class? Also, is Math 54 knowledge very important for this class?

Thanks in advance!
Tbh the weekly workload is very manageable. There is 1 assignment per week that takes 3-5 hours or so, and a small project to complete at the end of the semester. The issue is, the professor is a terrible teacher and there are very few online resources or tutorials that effectively teach the course content. So basically, you’re stuck trying to use a weird textbook, her unhelpful lectures, and decent GSIs to learn material. You don’t really need Math 53 and 54 for this course, but I would familiarize myself with some basic linear programming concepts on YouTube or something. It’s a class I would definitely have preferred to take in person, because collaborating with other students would have probably been useful.
Thanks for your input! I am glad to hear that it doesn't rely heavily on math 53 and 54 although I took both of them. How is the coding part though? I only know some python(Data 8), and wonder if this background is sufficient enough. I am taking CS 88, and Data 100 along with IEOR 162 next semester btw.
There’s no coding with Python or any mainstream CS languages in the course. You learn a language called “AMPL,” which is a mathematical programming language used for operations research, optimization, and supply chain management purposes. It’s pretty easy to pick up and accessible, and the course doesn’t focus on it much; the only time you’re expected to use it is during the final project, which is in groups. Nonetheless, I’d personally recommend to P/NP the class unless you really enjoy the material, really understand it, or want to go to grad school lol. I really think the instruction was very poor and it’s not a class that has a lot of accessible supplementary material online.
Ah I see. I really hope the GSI will be very helpful if the professor is not good at teaching the materials. And yeah, I am definitely going to take advantage of P/NP for this class. Again, thanks a lot for these informations. I appreciate it very much!"

I’ve received recommendations from professors to leave all my classes P/NP. They recommend against “cherry-picking” because it will send “mixed signals with a mixed transcript”. I interpret this as just showing you have questionable priorities for you classes and other priorities during this crisis.
Ummm...I’m premed so the class that I don’t know whether to keep P/NP is biochem. The problem is that if I switch to graded and the class is curved, then the people who keep the grade are doing really well so the curve will be messed up and it’ll be hard to get an A.
I’m going to leave my classes P/NP

I’d rather not cherry pick my classes since that’d mean I’d be prioritizing the classes I’m doing “well” in, which would look hella sus to potential employers, and that I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future with my family being unable to work due to COVID-19 and my pre-existing health problems, so I’d rather be safe than sorry.

Additionally, since you won’t need to decide until RRR week, I’d keep everything as P/NP, but still put in the effort, and then if you feel like it’s paying off, then switch back to grades at the very end since you can’t go back if something happens later in the year.

My advice to you would be to list out the pros and cons of both switching to grades vs P/NP for your personal case, and to see which would be best for you.
I've heard this narrative, and I think it's BS. The university wanted to do mandatory PNP for everyone but they have some sort of contractual obligation to give people the option to letter grade (don't know too much about this, just heard about it--probably some public institution sort of thing). Hence, they're doing what's legally required but trying to make everyone PNP because that's what they wanted to do.

Think about it: how does a mixed transcript send mixed signals? If you were affected slightly (i.e., had to move back home to non-ideal learning environment), then you'd PNP all non-essential classes and letter grade the essentials. If you were affected a lot (someone was infected in your family), you'd PNP everything. Don't listen to the administration and the propaganda they're forcing faculty to push out. Just do what you feel you can take on and ignore what they say. Remember that these are the same people who try to dissuade every incoming freshman at orientation from taking more than one technical class...

Anyway, like the above poster, I'm PNP'ing EE for sure lol
I don’t think cherry picking is bad. Maybe this mess hits you bad so it makes sense to take some load of yourself. I think it shows that you are trying instead of taking the easy way out. Personally if it’s an important major class I wouldn’t pnp if I’m not affected hugely just so I’ll be more motivated and focused on classes I really like.
>The problem is that if I switch to graded and the class is curved, then the people who keep the grade are doing really well so the curve will be messed up and it’ll be hard to get an A.

Dont worry about this. The professors are definitely aware of how this would shift the curve, and they'll find a way to compensate for it (most likely they'll account for the people who P/NP the class in the curve).

Question about the CS PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/oolv9m/question_about_the_cs_phd/,2021-07-21 01:47:15,"Hey, I'm a prospective applicant for the CS PhD, and I had a question for PhD students. How flexible is the program? I ask because my research interests are very interdisciplinary (combines ML/Cryptography/Systems) since I want to work on Crypto and Security in Machine Learning applications, and I want to be able to do research with professors from AI/ML, Systems/Security, and Crypto, so I wanted to know if that kind of flexibility is available to students or whether you're tied down to a specific advisor/research group. Are there any research breadth requirements for grad students (i.e is there a requirement that you have to explore research with a certain number of professors or under a certain number of specialties before you settle down with your advisor)? Thanks.

P.S. If you have any links to the department website where they talk about research policies, that would be amazing!","Disclaimer: Not an EECS PhD, but a PhD in a related field that collaborates a lot with EECS and here's what I've heard FWIW. 

When you apply to the PhD, you essentially commit to what subfield that you want to do: in your case that would be either the systems group or BAIR. While you are applying you are supposed to list the faculty members that you are most interested in working with and if you get in, you will likely be assigned one of them as your faculty mentor (and it is highly implied that they will be your thesis advisor through funding I believe). except for BAIR. In BAIR you are given more freedom (like a year) to explore and pick an advisor but should still be tied down by your second year I think. 

However just because you have an advisor doesn't mean you aren't allowed to collaborate with other professors (although this often is driven by student/student interactions)."
I feel like I’ve done nothing correctly,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15va9ra/i_feel_like_ive_done_nothing_correctly/,2023-08-19 01:17:50,"Disclaimer: This is a vent and this is also my alt account since I don’t want anyone I know reading this. 

.

I feel like I’ve done nothing correctly ever since I’ve come to college.

To start, I don’t have friends here. Never did. Between having social anxiety, being demotivated, and being lazy, I only ended up with a number of acquaintances I can count on my fingers that I rarely talk with. I don’t have any large network or connections. I’m not really in any clubs because I quit them after feeling isolated and so awkward or just not being interested in the club. It also feels like I never really attempted to make friends starting from the latter half of my sophomore fall semester. Maybe because I’ve given up. Or maybe I just feel comfortable alone nowadays and not having to deal with trying to socialize. But it still hurts.

You’d think I would have worked hard in academics and for building careers. No, I didn’t. My GPA is decent but not great by any means. I didn’t do any research or internship. I didn’t do any personal projects(I’m in CS) and my resume is just empty. No fucking leetcode. I have barely any connections or people I can relate and talk to. I just played games all day feeling depressed, not knowing if I’m even depressed. I just see Summer 2024 internship applications flooding in and I just know that I pretty much have a null chance of landing one.

Just to make me feel worse, my family is having a crisis and I just feel like I can’t make anyone proud or happy. 

Approaching my Junior Year and it just hitting me that I suck and that I did everything wrong. I hate myself for having just played games all the time, for being socially inept, for just always trying to escape. I feel like I’ve lost such an important two years, just falling behind everyone. It’s not like I didn’t know in those two years, but I chose to ignore it. And it just hit me so hard tonight alone by myself. I feel so overwhelmed.

I can blame so many things. I can blame my shitty roommates. I can blame how everyone seemingly just didn’t wanna be friends with me. I can blame how competitive and isolating Berkeley is. I can blame my finances. I can blame my family circumstances. I can blame video games. I can blame schoolwork. And so on. But all things considered …I can only blame myself and I hate that so much.

Idk…just feel so lost and a swirl of emotion I can’t describe. Just had to let it out so I can sleep knowing it’s out there even if nobody reads this awful post.

If anyone has any advice what I can do to maybe land an internship or even anything tbh, please leave a comment.

P.S. If you’re freshmen, don’t be too discouraged and also don’t be like me.

Edit: thank you all for the supportive comments and advice. I thought this post would be downvoted to oblivion 💀","Bro take a deep breath. You are just a junior you still have two more years which is a lot. Transfer student come as a junior and land on internship in their senior year so you are not behind. Please don't compare yourself with your peers. It will give nothing but depression. I highly recommend joining clubs and competition teams to make connections with seniors and those who have connections with industry. Please don't lose hope. You still got time.
I’m like you but with a shittier GPA.
The comment I was trying to reply to got deleted but I typed this up so fuck it:

I know what’s holding me back, but just knowing doesn’t mean I have the will or motivation to act on it which is exactly what happened for the last two years I guess.

And as I’ve said, this is a vent. I’m just putting it out because it feels like I’m just telling someone about my frustrations. Again, no friends to really vent to lol. And I stay pretty much anonymous and it’s just strangers replying which I can’t care too much about.

And as you said, when I really decide I want to change things, it probably will. But that’s the hardest part, wanting to change but not really, desperately having the desire and will to pursue those changes. 

It’s not an excuse though. This past week slowly felt like a wake up call for me so I need to believe and move forward.
Graduated in 2019- during my freshman year I made a post very similar to this. I was super depressed, didn’t attend most of my classes (almost all were GE) and was barely making it through. Ended up failing a couple and retaking them too. It wasn’t until my junior year that I finally found a house of people I liked, found a major that really made me feel fulfilled (architecture, which was also a personal hell, but I loved it), and started making friends with people I saw more often in my classes, now that I was taking more major specific classes with a smaller group of people. 

Berkeley is huge, and the first 2 years you rarely see the same people. On top of that, there’s this pressure to be all these things, but you barely even know what you want to do or who you are. It takes time, but it will get better. It can be overwhelming being surrounded by so many “successful” people and so many options.

On top of that, I made it through all 4 years of college with no internship, I couldn’t afford to working a job with little to no pay, and opted to work as a barista or waitress during my summers instead. And guess what, I had a well paying job lined up right after I graduated. I worked my ass off my last semester to get a good portfolio together and start interviewing EARLY. Would it have been a little less stressful if I had had an internship, maybe. But your path does not need to be the same as every one else’s. Not to say you shouldn’t try for an internship, especially if it’s something you want to do and can afford to do. Just start by applying to ONE. Take an hour or 2 each day to work on a resumed and cover letter, and once you have one out of the way, you can copy and paste and make minimal changes for the next ones. Even if you don’t get any, at least you know you tried and don’t have to live with the regret of doing nothing. If an internship doesn’t come through, 

4 years later I work a job I love and get paid over 6 figures in an industry that is infamously competitive and does not always pay great. I am successful in my field, and 2 years into college I didn’t even have a clue what I wanted to do. 

None of it is a waste of time. It sounds cliche but this is all part of the journey- and though this time may suck, you’re still learning a lot, even if you feel as though you have nothing to show for it.

Also, GPA doesn’t matter and employers don’t give a shit. C’s get degrees.
I feel the same :(
you aren’t alone
life is long and yours is just beginning. I had somewhat similar experience and then I went to grad school here which is much better for me, both the environment and the way I engaged with it. Didn't have much friends or much internships in undergrad and now im doing great. It will take work but your life is far from over
Join a co-op, or if getting out of a lease isn’t feasible, get on waitlist for next year (longer you’re on the waitlist, the better house you get) and board at one (boarding = food and meals). You will make friends there and have instant access to parties every single weekend.
> If anyone has any advice what I can do to maybe land an internship or even anything tbh, please leave a comment.

The most important thing is to make friends, some of whom you will know for the rest of your life.

If you don't like your shitty roommates, move. If I could twitch my nose and do one thing for you, it would be to move you into the coops.

And find some non-tech clubs or activities you enjoy. Maybe take one of those classes that involves going out in nature, camping.

You're probably wondering WTF this has to do with your internships and career. I'm trying to reset your life with what's important. With a CS degree from Cal with a ""decent GPA,"" you don't really need to worry.
You can improve your life, one step at a time. 

A lot of our problems are momentum based. 
So you do something that’s unhealthy, it leads to an unhealthy thought which leads to more unhealthy actions and so on. 

As a result, when you go out and try to join clubs or talk to people, those unhealthy thoughts that you’ve reinforced are going to fight your actions now. 

This is normal. It’s called cognitive dissonance. 

When you try to get out of a bubble it’s important to start small and work on both the thoughts and actions at the same time. 

Do things that you know are good for you. 
Join a gym. Have social hobbies.

But also get your thoughts on paper and *very important* LISTEN to other people’s thoughts and feelings. 

It can be very very difficult to feel better by venting to other people about how your life sucks. 

You know what helps? When other people vent to you. It helps you realize that you’re not alone and that all of the things you experience are things that a lot of other people experience. 

Another thing is hang out with people you admire. 

If you’re social awkward, you need to spend time with people who aren’t socially awkward.
Those people will be able to listen and provide you with a healthy example of what you need to be like. 

You’ll also take away subconscious habits just by being around them. 
You’re going to feel super uncomfortable, but as long as you’re being curious, you should be able to stay out of your head long enough to realize that life isn’t about judging yourself, but learning from others. 

All of these thoughts that you have, we all get them. 

The difference between the people you want to be like and you is that those people don’t give these thoughts more power than they need. 

It’s going to be hard for you at first because you don’t have the skills or experience to deal with your thoughts and feelings the same way. 
But the only way you’ll be able to learn is going out there and being a little weirdo for a while. 

And that’s okay, everyone has to start somewhere. 

Modern society makes people feel like their upbringings are all equal. And it’s true from a logical information standpoint.

But we are truly suffering from an emotional intelligence issue in our society. A lot of people are really really stupid when it comes to feelings and what they mean for our everyday experience. 

Considering that feelings are way more important than our negative thoughts have ever been, historically, in our ability to connect with each other as tribes, it’s no wonder that everyone is breaking down nowadays or absolutely catastrophizing everyday life. 

Feelings are complicated as shit and it deserves the same degree of important as other things in our lives. 

The only issue is that you can’t logic feelings. 

You need to get out there and use your ability to empathize to figure things out. 

Unfortunately, that’s really the only way you’re going to make it out of your bubble and get to where you want to be.
Don’t try to make too many changes at once. This sort of focus can make it too overwhelming to where you never begin making any changes at all. The best way to make changes is to start with 1 or 2 things and work on them consistently. 

I don’t think worrying about things in the realm of success are worthwhile. It won’t make you well to have material things (though being poor will hurt your wellbeing. But you almost certainly won’t be poor) or financial success. 

Who cares how your peers are doing. You aren’t your peers. You are you. The sooner you understand this, AND live as if you understand it, the better off you’ll be. I stopped trying to get internships just to boost the resume or career prospects. I’ll do an internship when it’s something I’m interested in. If not, who cares. Life is too short to devote too much energy to things that don’t matter. If no one will take me after I graduate because my resume is empty, then they will miss out on what I have to offer. But someone will recognize the value I have to offer, because there is value there, whether or not I scored an internship. I believe the same will turn out to be true for you. This isn’t to say purposely underachieve. It’s to say don’t do things solely to look good. Do things that bring fulfillment, or at least work towards improving your efforts in that direction. 

One goal I would suggest is to not be isolated. Get involved in something. Anything. But don’t continue to be alone playing games. Not having others is bad for your health, will reduce your quality of life and fulfillment. It also may be difficult to make friends once you graduate, but cannot say whether this is the case, so would love to hear from others here. For your one thing to change, just get involved in something with others. Maybe limit your gaming hours per day. Don’t worry too much about whether you get your college years right, because you’ll almost certainly feel as if you didn’t get it right no matter what you do. This is human nature. I hope this doesn’t sound too preachy. I am sharing what has helped me with the hope that something here can help you.
Mama bear here. Don’t worry. Something my mom told me and still helps me to this day. The past is the past. Leave it there. Stay in the present. Don’t fast forward to the future. Trust me. You are fine right now. You are in school and doing what you can. The one point I want to make and I’m sure others have said. The ONLY person you need to make proud is yourself. You can love your family, of course. I know it feels good to have others feel proud of you, but you really can’t make others happy. That is not in your power. You don’t need to have done all of those things you mentioned that you haven’t done. All you need to do is go to school and do your assignments to the best of your ability at the time. Another thing you mentioned is blaming video games. Yes, I would try to avoid those and social media. Try to make simple connections in the way of just being kind to others however small. If your roommates aren’t nice, you have no control over that either other than try to find other roommates  when that time comes. At some point try to make a connection in a club - but something that is managable for you. In your junior year, go to the job fair. Talk to people- even if it is just three, in order to know what it will be like the following year when you are looking for a job. Maybe you can find an internship after your junior year (that’s in the future though so no need to worry about it now. Eat well, hydrate and maybe get a little exercise- simple walks can be good- for exercise. Sleep well. Take care. Trust yourself. Best wishes for you!
Hey, I have gone through a lot of similar feelings that you described in your post during my time at Berkeley (I’m graduated now). Although it can feel like our world is crashing in on us, just know that you are not alone in these experiences. Sometimes knowing that you are not alone can help a great deal. College in general can feel very isolating, especially at a school like Berkeley since everyone seems so high achieving. In the words of the great John Denero, if theres one piece of advice I can give you it’s “don’t compare”. I know it’s easier said than done, but when I felt like everyone around me was successful and I was a loser, these words stuck with me and carried me through. I just landed my dream job after thinking that I would be unemployed forever because I only had a 3.0. Don’t give up on yourself and don’t be too hard on yourself.
Bro at least you got a decent gpa😭😭
Hi there. I'm sorry you're feeling overwhelmed. I suggest making a counseling appt at eTang. They take same-day appointments.

Re: internships and career advice, you could try career advising. It may or may not be helpful, but it's a start right?
I recommend taking advantage of the free counseling resources! When I was struggling with social anxiety, I joined a group session that helps build social skills. Have you considered living or boarding at a coop? It's a great resource for food and friends/community!
Your cohort also got screwed by the pandemic too. That has caused social isolation in a whole generation of kids who spent a year or more at home and wearing masks everywhere. Didn’t omnicron hit your freshman year.
Look, f comparison. Berkeley can still give you lots of wonderful experiences even if you go at your own pace. Likely most people feel the same as you.

- look for supportive clubs (like sports, heard rock climbing is good)
- study abroad would probably be at an easier university with friendlier students, it’s actually true
- you can always do an internship immediately after graduation, or a part-time internship - use personal projects to build skills and have an online presence. it needn’t be perfect but having that project experience means you won’t flounder at the job because you don’t know the stack at all
- doing research without knowing the subject well isn’t that great tbh

Even if you did nothing except get a degree, you could still work your way into a dream career
Sometimes things falling apart and things falling together feel like the same sensation.
Alright, this is going to sound really odd, and feel free to completely ignore it. I would recommend you buy some mushrooms (https://zidedoor.com/), take a day off, find someone who can keep you safe, and take a heavy dose. You need a change in perspective, and psilocybin does a great job of allowing you to see yourself almost in third person. You will throw up. You will laugh. You will cry. You will realize just how much you have been hurting yourself. You might even feel compassion and love for yourself. As you come down, you will realize how lucky you are to be alive and feel that you have started a new life as your body and mind comes back. If you've never done mushrooms before, make sure you have someone that can keep you safe during your trip. If you can't find anyone, you can pay to get this therapy, but it's expensive.
Literally shinji
May I ask you a few private questions and I would love to help.
I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. I’d have to agree with other commenters that you’re quite young and have your whole life ahead of you, and you can do a lot with the additional time you have in college even. But even if you don’t, there’s a lot of time ahead for exploration and finding yourself. I notice in your post you focus on CV, GPA, and research/internships, but not on feeling inspired by a subject and opening your mind. Honestly, I think this is much more important in college, expanding your worldview and finding something that really excites and electrifies you. Maybe this is part of the depressed feeling, a lack of this type of seeking or growth. Not to blame you for that, maybe you just haven’t given yourself the permission.
Thank you 🙏

To explain a little better, it just feels like I wasted my time. Personally, it hurts me more that I had the opportunities to be better but wasted it then the fact that I’m behind my peers.

I’ll try to take up on your advice and thanks a lot for the encouragement.
Get some therapy-it’ll do wonders. And you’ve still got two more years to turn it around!
Hi, really thanks for the story. It’s very reassuring and I will try my best to change going forward.
Tbh nah I lived in one I ain’t friends with none of them
> But we are truly suffering from an emotional intelligence issue

Yup that’s me. And also thank you so much for the advice!

If you don’t mind me asking, how would go around connecting with people? As a freshman, I tried a lot to connect, but I never really clicked with anyone or any group.
follow up: Seeing a therapist consistently helped me sort through a lot of the depression and isolation I was feeling during this time as well
Yeah I believe so. I remember vividly feeling a fever the night before the final that year. Tested it out after the final and I had covid; pretty sure I got it from my roommates (hence the “shitty” roommates).

But I don’t wanna blame covid because we came in when it was ending and there wasn’t really any lockdowns. I do think it affected my social skills though.
Wow, thanks for the advice. I’ve actually done study abroad during last summer and it was very fun. Just didn’t have a great personal experience at Berkeley so far and also just spent most of my study abroad experience like a vacation.

I think I may have had too much of an absolute view like everyone said and I hope I can personally work this out.
Maybe through pm?
2 years is plenty of time. Even one year is enough to make a massive change. Don’t worry about the time.

There’s still a bunch of mixers and events before the semester starts, maybe you can show up and talk to a few random people next to you. If not, there will be transfers looking to find friends in your classes.

Might as well get on the application grind too. If you’re having trouble, try the career counselor or something. There are lots of places looking to give people chances and you could get lucky.
You can’t change the past, you can’t change your peers. What can you do differently today, or next week, to break out of the patterns that aren’t working for you? 

That is the only thing you can change. Sounds like you already know.
Also remember that regardless, you are graduating from arguably the best public school in the world and the Berkeley name will hold a lot of weight. Even if you don’t have a perfect GPA, graduate schools and employers know berkeley doesn’t give out As easily.
Hmm. 

Out of all the people you know, are there people you truly admire?

People who you’d love to spend time with and feel no negative emotions towards. 
Chances are you do know some. 
I’d reach out to them and see how they’re doing. And then maybe see if you can eat lunch together or something small.

You should also ideally have some social hobby. 
At best, it’s something related to sports or something artistic in which you’re meeting people regularly. 

Imo, when you’re socially awkward, the best thing you can do at first is to be around people all the time. 
Once a week isn’t enough. You need to do things everyday. And this can be hard to set up systematically (work and social clubs etc.)

So the goal is ending up around people everyday at least for a certain period of times in low stakes situations. 
Meaning, don’t go looking for anything, go just to spend time around people. 

You should be seeking to spend time with the people you know you like and feel comfortable around, but also doing at least one event a week in which you’re meeting new people. 

Like a fair or something. Go out just to talk to people.
Walk up to stands and ask them what they’re doing. 

I like to think about this stuff the same way you would socialize a puppy. 

The puppy doesn’t know how it’s supposed to behave around people, so we take it to be around people and it starts to learn and figure things out.

I’d just do things with the expectation that you won’t know what to do or even what you might want to do, but doing it because you need to go out and “socialize” yourself.
If it was ending when you came in, that means your high school years were impacted and that’s significant too. Anyway I don’t believe in making excuses, you gotta look ahead and you got a whole year to find an internship in 2024. That’s definitely doable, leverage the resources on campus and start early. Companies don’t often like to hire underclassmen anyway cuz they have less relevant coursework. Having an internship after your junior year will greatly enhance your resume , you can do it !
You are on track. you know something is not right. Pick one favorite thing to do. 
Or do something new, especially if you have avoided it. Failure is not trying. Contact an old friend. Look for every opportunity."
Personal Finance DeCal Returns!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kmq36g/personal_finance_decal_returns/,2020-12-29 15:50:32,"Howdy!

I am bringing back the one-unit DeCal on personal finance this spring, and it's time to recruit people to sign up.

This is going to be as easy and casual as I can make it while still meeting requirements. We'll be going over things like budgets, debt, investing, taxes, insurance, and the like. The course is intended as an overview of the financial terms and topics you can expect to encounter as you begin your life as a Real Adult™.

==[Additional Information on DeCal Website](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/5445)==  
==[Link to Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wFg296_hB2ELq8RFCqer8FcbEAJvczU1gxiubxCaoig/edit?usp=sharing)==  
==[Application Link](https://forms.gle/Y6PuRVef3KfnPzS49)==

The commitment will be one hour per week of lecture (Wednesdays 5-6pm),  plus a weekly reading and associated very short writing assignment, plus a casual, one-time project consisting of a resume/cover letter activity or 3-5 page paper. There are no tests or exams. The class is graded P/NP (like all DeCals) and you only need a 70% to pass.

Applications are open now! Enrollment is unfortunately capped at 40 so that I can grade everyone's homework in a timely manner. The application is at [https://forms.gle/Y6PuRVef3KfnPzS49](https://forms.gle/Y6PuRVef3KfnPzS49). If you don't get in, you can still opt to have lecture recordings sent to you so you can ""audit"" the class.","What’s the difference between this decal and the ubga personal finance class? I’m on the waitlist for that class rn
Just applied today, when will we know if we get in or not?
The syllabus looks great.  I see a lot of stuff I've learned the hard way over the past few years.

Check out /r/personalfinance (in particular, their [awesome wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index)) if you're not able to make it into this DeCal!
Youre gonna tell everyone to just put all their money in PLTR calls right? /s
[deleted]
is there anyway we can help/be on course staff for this? i don’t particularly care about getting paid/getting units or anything but i care a lot about teaching ppl abt the importance of personal finance and id love to help you out in any way if it’ll mean you’ll be able to expand the class size!
Omgomg. I have graduated already but I would love to take this class!! Is it okay if I try to audit it too?? Please?
I hope this isn't going to be as tone-deaf as the awful workshop they gave to the SSS scholars (the poor students) about budgeting and investment that assumes any of them had spare income. (Plot twist. We don't.)
I've never taken that class, and to my knowledge no one who took my DeCal last semester had ever taken it before either. However with that caveat in mind, my understanding is that the major difference is that UGBA 135 is much more ""academic,"" with a proper textbook and exams and letter grades and such. I've been told they have two midterms and (at least before the pandemic) a full-length final exam. It's true that Haas professors have more credibility than me, an undergrad, but the DeCal experience should be more chill. The content is broadly similar. (Besides, UGBA 135 fills up every year. My DeCal is probably going to fill up too, but it hasn't yet!)  
A similar question came up on Reddit regarding the ""adulting"" DeCal, which includes a section on finances:  
[UGBA 135 vs Adulting DeCal](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hwk4lm/about_ugba_135/)
this
Not sure exactly. Last semester I sent out a wave of acceptances well before the start of class and then I was still letting people in 3 weeks into the semester as people rearranged their schedules and were no longer able to stay enrolled.

I expect the first wave will be in \~1-2 weeks though. Depends on how many people are interested.
My secrets have been revealed
I remember the days when the only thing to do was going all-in on AMD calls...
Yeah there's an option for that (""Just put me straight on the lecture recording list, I don't need to be officially enrolled""). Still going through the application form makes it easier for me to keep track of records though.
Yeah there's an option for that in the application form. Maybe also mention that you've already graduated in the ""anything else"" section just to make sure I don't accidentally try to enroll you. :)
I have never heard of that particular workshop. My class is targeted at college students, with the assumption that the audience is not truly self-sufficient yet, but will be getting a decent ""real job"" in the next couple years, after graduation with a prestigious UC Berkeley diploma. A lot of the personal finance world opens up once you hit that milestone and have some wiggle room with your financial choices. While it's true that investment, which I dedicate three lectures to, and buying a house/real estate, which I dedicate one lecture to, are infeasible without ""spare"" income, it's important to know what to do once you achieve that.

One of the most nefarious things about poverty is that it comes with a generational cycle. If you grow up in a household with enough wealth (as I did), you have opportunities to learn by osmosis from your parents certain good money habits and maneuvers. For example, I learned how to execute a backdoor Roth IRA--something anyone earning a CS salary in the Bay Area after graduation should be aware of--when my dad was doing it himself. However, had my parents' income been lower, there would have been no need to do a backdoor Roth IRA transfer, and I would have had to search out information on it to learn about it. 

I wrote about this issue briefly in a grad school application essay (there's only so much I can say about diversity as a white male not engaged in any kind of activism) and summed up the issue like this:

>*Skills like debt management, investing, and long-term financial planning are rarely taught formally and as a result are usually passed on by example from parent to child. Unfortunately, this means students from disadvantaged backgrounds often do not have the opportunity to learn about vital tools that are predominantly used by people with greater means. I teach my class to address this shortfall and provide students with a roadmap to maximizing their resources as efficiently and as wisely as possible.* 

I hope that isn't too tone-deaf!
Took this DeCal last semester— it does cover budgeting and investment advice, but (from my admittedly non-working-class perspective) with the understanding that the majority of people are broke college students who will be applying that section of advice later in life. Good info on student loans, taxes, etc that may be especially useful to you.
I will also say that while much of what you learn in academic classes at Cal is quite in-depth and complicated, in my opinion the majority of learning about personal finance boils down to just knowing what to look out for. I'm sure UGBA 135 is a well-run class, and I'm quite confident in my own class, but ultimately I think that signing up for *a* personal finance class is much more important than *which* class you end up in.
Took UGBA 135 this recent Fall; there was only one midterm, though not sure if it will be the same in the future. Good luck with the DeCal OP!

- we’re intense night owls 
- we’ll be cooking a lot
- we love watching everything lol (anime, kdrama, movies, shows, youtube)
- we like playing mario kart and other switch games
- we love decorating! expect to have a p cool living space ;)))

pm if u wanna connect :D","Just to let you both know, requesting roommates through the housing portal doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you will be placed with those roommates. I only know of a few people who have actually had the roommates that they requested. I’ve asked to be placed with roommates in the past and I’ve never been placed with any of them. Also, apartments in Martinez are single gender.
*whom* we can vibe
What the heck, I wanna watch kdramas at 2 am. Am male though (ftm), not sure if they'd allow a mixed gender apt :( Though I have read of people in my situation sending in written appeals.
I know some friends who are living in co-ed apartments in Martinez :) theres definitely exceptions
youm have passed the vibe check
That’s because of COVID and housing shortages I believe. This was the only year where they’ve had that in place. If you look on the housing website, it says Martinez has only single gender apartments. I’m not sure if they plan to have co-ed apartments going forward or if that’s just due to the current situation."
Do I nuke this semester or what?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k6cej4/do_i_nuke_this_semester_or_what/,2020-12-03 19:04:54,"I’ve already dropped one of my classes so I’m sitting at 11 units. Due to difficult circumstances and unequal priorities, I’m doing well in one technical and poorly in the other. I don’t know if I should P/NP it, take it for a grade, or drop it. Oh, and about 70% of my grade rides on my final which focuses on the content which I have learned the least. 

I’m simultaneously worried that I may not even pass it, and that if I take it P/NP I may be better off taking it as a grade given how mixed grade options look bad on a transcript. I’m seriously considering dropping it, because I know that I can afford to take it later and that I’d actually learn the content. But I would have so few units from this semester I don’t even know if it would be allowed. Would going that low put me on academic probation or something? I’m taking a gap semester in the Spring so that’s worrying.

What do?","Bro I nuked this sem cuz I was having serious mental health issues (was diagnosed with PTSD about a month ago stemming from issues from before). I dropped 2 classes and P/NP'ed the one that I was for sure not gonna pass (haven't done any work since halfway thru the sem). 

I would literally sit down, look at an assignment that I was behind on, and have a full on panic attack. Every. Single. Time. I tried everything (for more than a month, mind you) but I couldn't psych myself out of it. Also, I'm at home which is where all of the history of bad stuff is, so I'm usually anxious as it is. I would just freeze and my brain would stop working and I could feel every inch of my body pulling me away from the table and telling me to run. 

Sorry for this rant, it's not really advice but I keep questioning whether I did the right thing or not even though my therapist said it was for the best given the environment and the mental health situation I'm in rn. Hopefully it makes u feel a little better that you're not alone.
I am in the exact same situation as you. Although I'm not diagnosed with anything yet, I know my mental health has been a spiral down, so I dropped one of the only two tech classes I am taking, and rn I'm taking 9 units. So far it seems like nothing is happening to me on calcentral. I'm not suggesting anything, that's just FYI
I don’t feel alone and I hope you don’t either. Go bears 💙💛
I talked to a friend who is in the same situation and according to him the unit count for this semester pretty much doesn’t matter

Hate this class. The professors and GSIs are the worst I’ve come across at Berkeley. Make sure to leave them bad evals.

I ended up getting 70 pts, thought I was well into getting an A like I needed with the grading system, only to end up getting an A- (I needed 9 more pts on the final and I would’ve been fine...). It’s so annoying that they changed the grading system last minute, but I’m not surprised given how the class was a lowkey mess.

Do you think taking CS 70 and Korean 1a at the same time is a bad idea?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uey9n2/do_you_think_taking_cs_70_and_korean_1a_at_the/,2022-04-29 16:20:42,"Even though I used to be good at math, I kind of suck at it now, so I’m pretty prepared for CS 70 to be really hard for me (for reference, the worst grade I have is a C is Math 53, and yes I am a little  embarrassed, thanks for asking :D). 

I’m also a DSP student who struggles with reading heavy courses, so I’m pretty nervous about Korean 1a too. But I still want to take it eventually, because my immigrant father wanted me to have an easy time assimilating and now I can’t communicate with half of my family. 

I’m already enrolled in both classes, so it’s just a matter of choosing weather or not to take on this load. If I do decide to take these classes together, I’ll probably add either Chem 1al or CS61c on top of that.

there's a drink machine and snack machine just downstairs. there's also a drink and snack machine in the basement of zellerbach hall.

edit: the drink machine in wheeler has pepsi products and various juices (it's the style that catches drinks in the mechanical basket), the drink machine in zellerbach is pepsi products and aquafina (doesn't have the mechanical basket).
There used to be a drink vending machine, but it was removed this past winter break. The one still remaining has a selection of snacks.

P/NP advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gezr3n/pnp_advice/,2020-05-06 21:23:39,"I am currently a sophomore mcb I’m big time stressing about whether or not to p/np two prerequisites. I feel like this semester has really given me a roadblock. I currently have a 3.8 GPA and am hoping to go to grad school so I’m hoping that won’t drop from this semester . So here’s the situation:

 I’m in chem 3A, 3AL, biology 1A, and 1AL. Final grades already came out for the labs and I got an A so I’m really sure I want to take those for a grade. Those classes have been pretty much done for a while and I feel as though they have been relatively unhindered by the whole online transition. 

Chem and bio lectures still have finals next week. It ~is~ possible for me to snag the A if I do well on the finals (need like a 93%)... I just don’t know if I can keep up at this point. It’s so hard for me to do quality work with everything going on. Living with 5 family members doesn’t even leave me a quiet place to work. I just really don’t feel confident in being able to pull out that grade I’m hoping for and that I may have been able to in another scenario. My question is: would it be “sneaky” or “deceptive” if I p/np’d those courses? I’ve been reading some other posts on here about how I should do all or nothing p/np... but I’m having hard time with that since I know for certain I was able to make the labs work, but the lectures are a whole different story. What do y’all think, or what are you doing if you’re in a similar situation?","I’d say just read the discussions on the other posts. In short no one knows for sure but general consensus is for grad school all or nothing is preferred. Cherry picking will show that you could perform in some areas and couldn’t in others so I’d leave it to you couldn’t perform at all due to corona or you could entirely but no one will ever be told if  it did hurt them in admissions. this is all speculation from professors and people who work admissions
i say since you're applying to grad school either do all or nothing, especially with technicals. it looks better to have a A-/B+/B with your technicals and an A with the lab than a pass with an A in the lab. I think the point of all or nothing is if you have no classes graded, it shows you took your classes Pass/No Pass because of your situation but cherry picking makes it look like you took advantage of the situation to boost your GPA while passing your harder classes.
Damn, I’m in a really similar situation, but just for Chem 3A (actually, how are you calculating what you need to get an A? That’s a main source of my concern). Personally I’m leaning toward going for a letter grade just because I’m pretty sure I’m right on the border and I don’t want to pass up any opportunity to get the A and I also don’t want to feel like I’m throwing away all of my work this semester. 

As for your situation though, I think you should ask yourself a couple questions: 1) how confident do you feel in your knowledge of the material 2) realistically, how likely do you think it is that you’ll get the grade you want 3) how much of a relief would it be for you to go PNP versus maybe have to deal with the disappointment of knowing you snagged that A after all but chose to PNP.

Because if it’s really a challenge for you to study/focus right now and you thought about those questions, don’t feel guilty about going PNP. These are insane times, and any grad school that doesn’t regard this semester with some degree of leniency does not deserve you. There’s nothing “sneaky” about it. Make the best decision for you, stick with it, and trust that you made the right decision, however it shakes out.

Again, hope you can tell me how you’re estimating grades for Chem 3A. Good luck fellow bear!"

What should I do for MCB 103?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ba1shu/what_should_i_do_for_mcb_103/,2019-04-06 00:03:19,"Hello Reddit, please help a fellow bear out. I am an MCB transfer, and I am taking MCB 103 this semester and doing terribly. Each test is 33% percent of the grade, and there's three tests. I got a D on both of the first two, and I'm really worried about this last one. I hate having this much stress.

I'm almost done with my junior year, so I am wondering if my One-Time Drop would be good to use now. Also, MCB 103 is a class I'm taking for one of the two elective courses I have to take in my major to graduate. Therefore, regardless of my P/NP result I would need to retake another class in its place, since only graded electives count.  I'm worried that if I apply to grad school, they'll see my P (or NP) badly.

Any advice? :( Thank you!","Depends on how competitive your grad school plans are. If you need to get good grades, I would drop it and retake it during a summer (which, now that you've studied for it, should make it easier). Most of the time, it's not about who's ""smart"" or not, but just how well people plan out their classes/play the college game...so don't feel too down about yourself. Good luck!

&#x200B;

Also, I hear it's easier during the summer (which is when I took it hella years ago, lol).
Hey! This isn't super specific but I think it's always a good idea to just straight up talk to the professor(s) or your GSI if that's more comfortable. I'm also MCB and I've had friends in your situation before - you'd be surprised how helpful and honest some profs or GSIs can be. Just make an appointment and be upfront with your situation. They may not be able to give you a concrete solution but they will be able to better explain what your options are. One of my friends was in a very similar position last spring and she had a conversation with our professor who walked her through potentially late-dropping the course, which she ended up doing. I know it's easier said than done but the sooner you do this, the better! Good luck! "

* Professor Popa in 261 (which is completely unrelated from CS 161 which is taught by Nick Weaver -- kinda a shame as I wanted to see him branch out and teach some other classes (61b with Nick sounds fun lol, may make it redesigned in golang though XD, same with 162) but I understand that 161 being offered every semester is important to it being persisted and I'm sure fa22 161 students are overjoyed at the news lol)
* and Professor Rao in CS 70 again also was great to see as they are very familiar at teaching those areas.
* On that note Professor Babak Ayazifar will be teaching both CS 70 and EE 120 per [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html) which is great news for anyone who couldn't get in this semester!
* Professor Chasins teaching CS 164 again, seems like a return for OCaml and a tearful goodbye to Hilfinger's ChocoPy (btw where is Hilfinger on here?? I hope he hasn't retired...).
* CS 168 finally being offered although CS 160 is not offered (not an issue since it's usually there in summers),
* Professor A. Sahai teaching  CS 182 (seems like we'll get another bio-focused 189 since he's not there but him teaching a PyTorch class (altho 182 is clearly more than that) falls in line with what I saw in eecs16b),
* 186 being completely online even with everything hopefully back in-person. I guess it will be CS W186 then?
* No CS 188, though if it happens, Russell and D. Song are my guesses for the professors if they get the funding for that to go through and Abbeel still isn't able to teach it.
* As well as a return of a few 194s (I heard a few more are planned yet to be listed though such as Dawn Song's DeFi CS 194/294-177).

Keep in mind this is still a draft so changes can be made, but thoughts?","Lisa Yan was a lecturer at Stanford for a couple of years. She has a PhD in CS education (also from Stanford) and is an excellent instructor overall. Hug and Yan should be nothing short of the teaching dream team.
Holy shit they resurrected 168 from the grave
It is unlikely that I will do gitlet at all. As much as some students love it, it has relatively poor synergy with the course material, and I also personally find it a bit boring (sorry Joey! It is a **great** project, just not my style). But I'll review all the course evaluations over the summer to decide whether to keep it or not.
goated, thnx for the update
From what I've seen, CS 160 is planned for the spring next year.
182 is more of an applications class.  Wonder how Sahai will approach it.  Hopefully they offer it in the spring with another professor in case he makes it theory intensive.
Ranade and P. Fox, we love to see it
Oh I so want to teach other classes.  But 161 is one of the classes we’ve scaled to meet demand (500+/semester).  The only way to maintain that is run the class every semester.  I’d really like to do 162/redo-162-project-as-194/162 as a sequence.
Good to see 176 back, though Prof Yosef isn’t teaching it.  But since Prof Ioannidis is so involved on the comp bio end, she a good replacement.
Gonna take 182 with my favorite prof
who's pamela fox?
and also what has dan garcia been doing i haven't heard of him since his 61c semester in the first semester of online
damn 176 seems like a really cool class. Doubt I'll get in though. Are prerequisites usually enforced for CS classes?
[deleted]
I miss Ranade
SO happy about babak teaching 120!!
182 is taught in pytorch, not tensorflow
hmm does this mean Shewchuck is not teaching 189 this semester?
Just to clarify, who is teaching 189 in Fa 22?
I'm really interested in 168, but since it's scarcely offered, does anyone know whether it's a difficult class to get into? I'll be a senior then, so i should have a decent slot all things considering
No 188 either.
Is 162 a preq for 168? I’m seeing conflicting info on different sites
I would recommend Demmel/Nelson cs170. I took Jelani Nelson's cs170 and enjoyed his teaching style very much. It's a hard class, don’t get me wrong, but it was all worth it.
Yes, Prof. Hilfinger is retiring. His last lecture is tomorrow 4/29 at 1pm in 155 Dwinelle.
omg you just made me remember that Lisa Yan was the one i was referring to in [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)   


I'm glad she finally decided to leave Stanfurd for Cal, go bears!
Let's just hope there exist enough TAs out there for the class to be a normal upperdivision size now...
Any thoughts on the lack of a fall offering for its future? Dyt it doesn’t matter as much as other classes because of summer + is cs160 usually a “fall xor spring” class?

I didn’t mention stuff like 270 not appearing for that reason (it’s biyearly spring only)!
I actually have the opposite viewpoint: Marvin Zhang's 182 appears to be less application-focused than past iterations (the usual final project is now a final exam being the main point, until the course site comes out not much more to say on the matter). I hope Sahai recognizes the power of PyTorch and brings back an application-based final project, as he did when introducing those notebooks into 16b. Marvin Zhang making DS 189 Listgarten/Malik-theory oriented instead of Shewchuk application-oriented is another example of how he prefers theory but we will have to wait and see what actually happens this spring (note that this makes sense for DS as many of those students are double majoring in a subject like biology so listgarten's version does make more sense to offer to DS students).

However, you very well could be correct. Maybe Sahai will make it even more theory intensive as that's always a possibility. The fact that NNs need big data makes me hope a deep NN class would be very application-based but if Sahai ruins it then we always have Levine's [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL\_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A) to lean back on and audit... definitely not the same though :(
Yeah I’m sure other universities would also love seeing a Rust OS project on the scale of pintos 👀

After all Berkeley did take inspiration from Stanford, this could be a chance for Berkeley to give back and help lead education in that sector!
hopefully me and you both survive through bestie 😵‍💫
Pamela Fox is a new lecturer who has taught 61a alongside DeNero and Hilfinger in the past alongside some other classes (she was a CS 302 co-lecturer last spring, the class for summer instructors, maybe 169 as well iirc but i have a shaky memory there and the other Professor Fox teaches that so I very well could be confounding the two).

I talked to her once about the work she did at Khan Academy on their CS curricula (which I actually used as a kid growing up)  as well as some stuff she did on Coursera. She's done *a* *lot* for 61a these past few semesters and I'm interested in seeing how she changes the course as it's a course that has been evolving a lot recently with SQL → Regex → BNF etc, as well as an A+ project and new additions from when I took it! I can tell she cares about teaching a lot and have had heard good things about people who took 61a with her though she came just after my time... I took 61a in su20 haha.

And I think Dan was on sabbatical.
usually not
yeah and we could also use those profs to teach grad classes like 286, does 186 still use Hellerstein's lectures lol?
well now she's back from her leave and teaching 2 classes at that :)
yeah, usually he teaches 120 in the spring only, this is quite a surprise IMO but a pleasant one at that!
yeah... i think i misremembered because it was pytorch that Prof Sahai introduced into eecs16b this semester (which is what i referred to), i think i just typed the wrong thing, ill edit it, thanks!
He is for spring 22, the above is for fall 22 which is after sp22.
Also note that Shewchuk is only teaching CS 189, DS 189 will be taught by Marvin Zhang
NVM: Listgarten and Malik
prolly will be. but i think most seniors will get into it. i doubt any juniors will get in. Depends on how big the class is also, if its around 500, itll be fine but if its < 300, then big yikes
FWIW there were 500 seats last time it was offered [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001)
it's not, that's an old prereq
and she can also teach CS 168 in the future so this is incredibly based
BTW, Lisa Yan also did her undergrad at Cal, which is doubly awesome
Prof. Fox co-taught 169 this past semester. I didn’t love the class (more specifically, I absolutely hated it), but its failings weren’t her fault and she clearly has a passion and a great talent for teaching CS. It’ll be cool to see her teach a class that isn’t buzzwordy garbage!
that's good. Still don't think i'll get in though since I'm not a cs major and I imagine seats are reserved T_T.  thank you for the answer!
[deleted]
Oop you're right my apologies.

Wait, 182 is being offered Fa22?! Let's goo!
ya but there were more TAs back then since 168 was offered once a year. Its been 2.5 years since, so there will be a lack TAs along with the fact that the budget is less
Thank you
yeh as i said above, havent taken a class with her so everything above was second-hand anecdotal. Though i bumped into her in Soda a couple of times and she was a nice person to talk to. Am also a huge fan of her work at Khan Academy. I think she'll do good things with 61a though i thought it was a great class as is when i took it (doesn't mean that it cant improve ofc).
if you phase 1, and wait it out then who knows
:o isn’t that the first live lec 186 in awhile? Is this confirmed or could this still change, might have to sign up for it if so
Yeah that’s also usually a spring-only class, I was surprised to see it there… I also think this is  Prof A. Sahai’s first time teaching it, should be an interesting experience
yeah ive been worrying about that myself tbh"
Personal Finance DeCal Now Available!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i9x4zn/personal_finance_decal_now_available/,2020-08-14 16:48:07,"Howdy! 

I am running a one-unit DeCal on personal finance this fall, and it's time to recruit people to sign up. 

This is going to be as easy and casual as I can make it while still meeting requirements. We'll be going over things like budgets, debt, investing, taxes, insurance, and the like. The course is intended as an overview of the financial terms and topics you can expect to encounter as you begin your life as a Real Adult™. You can check out the [syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wFg296_hB2ELq8RFCqer8FcbEAJvczU1gxiubxCaoig/edit?usp=sharing).

The commitment will be one hour per week of lecture (Wednesdays 5-6pm), plus a weekly reading and associated one-page writing assignment, and a slightly longer one-time paper. There are no tests or exams. The class is graded P/NP (like all DeCals) so a 70% is the same as a 100%.

I plan to hit the ground running on the first week, so applications are open now! Enrollment is unfortunately capped at 40 so that I can grade everything in a timely manner. The application is at [https://forms.gle/CBw1PDwHqufiZLb27](https://forms.gle/CBw1PDwHqufiZLb27).","Wow this looks really exciting! I hope I get a seat, I’d love investing advice so I can go be on wallstreetbets

Tutors for Math 185?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f8danw/tutors_for_math_185/,2020-02-23 10:16:54,"I’m a senior whose last brush with multivariable calc was in Math 53 first semester of freshman year. I can say with confidence that I no longer know any perceptible amount of vector calculus, and I’d like to get an A in this class and a P in cs189, so this is a pretty big issue. If you would be willing to tutor me once a week for one to two hours, it would be of great help. Also, I’m an EECS major, so it’s not like i was ever a real mathematician anyway. Price is negotiable, but I’m certainly willing to pay $30 an hour (as a ugsi, i make ~$27/h, so i think $30 is a fair starting price). Location also negotiable — i want to make this convenient for you. If you could point me to Math dept tutoring resources, I would appreciate that also.

Thanks fam. Go bears","o shit we have use 53 later on?? ffs
Hmm, who do you have for 185?
Did you take 104?

yep; i took it last semester with the “easy” textbook (Ross, Elementary Analysis). I’m struggling more with remembering MVC than with the actual analysis, so i really need to iron out the MVC before this class gets hard — I definitely preferred 113 over 104 (I’m more of an algebra person) but i feel like this class will be somewhere in between.

ECON major 1st year cource choices,https://i.redd.it/co3hnhiw4l3d1.jpeg,2024-05-30 08:50:04,"HELLLOO, please help me choose my cources for the first year to declare an economics major. ","The first question is - what are you bringing over from HS in terms of college credit? Any Calc? Any English?
I do A levels so i believe I am not bringing in any credits
I do Maths and Econ my bad
Will you be required to take any classes in the calc series? Math 1A/B? If not, definitely avoid them. Same with econ 1/2 if you can help it. If you've passed out of both of those I believe all you'll need to take is intro stat and one upper division econ course between Macro and Micro. I'd sign up for intro stat your first semester, and one of the upper division classes (100A/B) second semester, dependent on who is teaching. I took stat 20 my first semester, and with a HS stat background it was fine.
So when you say Math, do you mean you’re going to get college credits for the equivalent of 1 year of Calc?  ie Calc 1 and Calc 2?  You probably want to check first, you might not want to repeat stuff you’ve already gotten college credit for already. (A lot of students do repeat stuff though). 

So your Math and Econ prereqs might already be done. For Stats, usually people default to taking STAT 20, but I recommend taking Data C88S as your requirement. But in order to take that class you also need to take Data 8, either as a prerequisite or as a co-requisite.  IMO learning Python via Data 8 is somewhat more in vogue than learning R via STAT 20.

The intermediate Econ classes, you’re not eligible to take until later on.
Also, a ton of Econ students these days tend to minor or double major in Data Science, of which Data 8 is a requirement. Something to think about.
is it possible to double major in ds if accepted into l&s?
It is possible, but no one really knows the outcomes and odds of switching to/double majoring in CS/DS/Stats until next year. You apply, go thru a comprehensive review and wait and see."
How is Math 55 w/ Professor Sylvie Corteel?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13qvxsj/how_is_math_55_w_professor_sylvie_corteel/,2023-05-24 12:58:28,"hi! i'm an applied math + cs intended double major, so i have to do pretty well in Math 55 (get a B+ or higher in order to declare cs), and I was wondering how hard math 55 w/ Professor Sylvie Corteel is?

[deleted]
I am also applied math + CS. I took Math 55 + Stat 134 and genuinely a great pace, I got an A in both. One thing I would say is to be cautious of using 55 and 70 interchangeably as prerequisites when registering for classes, because I made the mistake of taking EECS 126 having only taken 55 and not Stat 134 yet, and I struggled harder than I should have. Another note is that a lot of the applied math concentrations take Stat 134 anyways so you will cover the whole spectrum regardless of what you take!

PNP Engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17zifh/pnp_engineering/,2013-02-05 22:12:53,"Heya Fellow Bears,

Was wondering if anyone was familiar with PNPing non-major classes in CoE. 

So, I'm a EECS major, and I'm taking a few IEOR/Stat classes out of interest. Can I PNP them? What defines a ""technical"" class below? For instance is a stat class considered ""technical""? are all engineering classes considered ""technical""?

""Students in the College of Engineering must take all technical courses for a letter grade so you cannot submit a petition requesting to change a technical course to P/NP.  The only exception to the policy on taking technical courses P/NP is for graduating seniors in their final semester. During the final semester students may take technical courses P/NP if the courses are not required for graduation. ""

Anyone have any experience just changing the class to PNP regardless of this policy? :D
","From the [CoE handbook](http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/advising%20handbbk%2012-13.pdf):

>Technical courses (courses in engineering, mathematics, chemistry, physics, statistics, biological sciences and computer science) may NOT be taken Pass/Not Passed. Students in their final semester (and on the official degree list for that semester) may petition to take technical courses not needed for their degree on a P/NP basis; the deadline to make a request to take a technical course in your final semester on a P/NP basis is Friday of the fifth week of instruction. No requests to take technical courses in the final semester will be approved after the fifth week of classes.
I've talked about this topic a lot with Joan Chamberlain, the civil engineering Undergraduate Adviser. One of the most obnoxious things about CoE is that you cannot take any engineering course pass-no-pass, even for interest and even if it's not required by your major.    
I'm fairly certain on this point, but it might be worth talking to ESS to double check.

I'm not as sure about the statistics classes. According to the College of Engineering Announcement for 2012-2013, ""No technical courses (mathematics, science, or engineering) may be taken on a passed/not passed basis."" The statistics department is separate from mathematics, and we snobbish mathematicians usually regard statistics as a separate discipline. However, I think most people would lump statistics in with the category of ""mathematics,"" just as physics and chemistry courses would fall under the Announcement's category of ""science.""    
Check with an Engineering Student Services Adviser for sure on that one.

**Edit: I just noticed that you might be a graduating senior. I've never heard of that exception, and I don't know if what I say above applies to graduating seniors.

Edit 2: DO NOT just change your class to PNP, ignoring this policy. CoE *does* check for that, and *will* bump you to a letter grade midway through the semester (typically *after* the add/drop deadline) while sending you an upset email.
Just ask your adviser. In my case, the CoE did not consider ECON 101A to be a technical course.
crap i took ib 41 pass/no pass a couple semesters ago.  does this screw my graduation chances?
I'm not so sure about this. I took BioE 100 P/NP, but that course may be the exception (it's a bioethics course)."
In a toxic relationship :C sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mh1xi5/in_a_toxic_relationship_c_sad/,2021-03-31 01:57:48,"In the beginning, I was so happy. March 26th… It was the day I found love. The words “congratulations” made me feel warmth. It caressed me like.. no other. It couldn’t compare to any of the previous relationships I had. It was genuine love. I loved it, and it loved me. Our relationship and fantasizing only grew with each passing day. July 16 was a special moment in our lives. I asked... if it would love me more if we took the exit to 61a. We also stopped by on the way to exit 70 as it was its favorite. I could hear its excitement and approval. Little did I know, our relationship was a lie…   
Fast forward to August 26. It was a huge moment in our relationship. I finally set foot inside of it. There, I saw the huge thing shoot up-right. It was known to ring every hour at the sound of the hourly bell. It was indeed, a joyous moment filled with comfort. We would laugh in the glade, and bask in the hopeful light that ran down on us.

It all started to turn for the worse proceeding the weeks of August 26. All of a sudden, it started to demand more from me. It became more ruthless. It changed… My mental demeanor dropped from a smile to horror. Everyday, the mental smacking and abuse hit me in the head. But, in the end, I would obey without question as it was my everything. Nothing could separate us. It owned me. There was no escape….. At least, not for the next 4 years.

Since then, every week I shuddered in fear. I heard it… The steps of the p\* sets approaching. I covered my ears and my eyes. No.. I repeated No.. Still, it would take me my force. I had no power or authority against it. I lied there helplessly as p\* set after set I would get f\*\*\*\*ed up. Sometimes, it was multiple at once. The f\*\*\*ing only grew stronger with each new p\* set. It hurt. I was in horror. Each one f\*\*\*ed me up so hard that after each set, I just lie there.. twitching with nothing left inside of me. Still, I gave it everything. I let it have all of me. I embraced it and then it came… It was like a deep longing has always been there...

Sahai.. I repeated. Sahai. A worship of fever overcame me.  It whispered to me: “mathematical maturity”. Suddenly, the pain stopped. I saw a whole new world. It was the... cure to my misfortune and misery. I told myself that I would endure this relationship. For one day, it will end… and I will make it to the end of the light.  
In the end, it was never a sincere relationship… please do not fall into a toxic relationship.

Ps: Sorry for bad grammar (im not good at english), and don't mind me :D",Mathematical. Maturity.

I'm guessing that from the seats they won't be able to see the actual person on stage as there will be something obstructing their view.

This event will be free and open to all. Whether you're new to the idea of tabletop games or if you've had a D&D campaign going for 10 years - this event is for you.  


Games Menu:  


Local game designer Hakan Seyalioglu of Thorny Games will be running Dialect, a game about language and how it dies. In this game, you'll play as members of an isolated community who must make choices that affect day-to-day life, culture, and eventually, survival. Through play, you will collaboratively create and utilize a dialect unique to The Isolation. New words will come from the fundamental aspects of the community: who they are, what they believe in, and how they respond to a changing world.   


For more info about Dialect and other language-based games, see [here](https://thornygames.com/pages/dialect?fbclid=IwAR018pobctJVimLd_tWwv8BaTCX_pWcOTZM14aK0JJTaS10ryO5PF0QY2rA).  


Spencer Davis will be running Dungeon World. Dungeon World is a hack of Apocalypse World made to look and feel more like a classic game of D&D. Instead of playing against the Dungeon Master, everyone takes part in creating the world and story together. Dungeon World and other Apocalypse World games are featured on numerous podcasts including The Adventure Zone and Spout Lore.  


You can check out Dungeon World [here](http://www.dungeon-world.com/).  


More games will be added as demand allows.   


Please plan on showing up at 6:30 to sign up for your preferred game. Also, Victory Point is graciously waiving their standard entry fee for this event - so please show them your appreciation.  


Super excited for this and I can't wait to start sharing these games around.

Btw, just to be 100% sure, final exam is this wednesday during regular class? and we need just a regular 100-question scantron?


You are an absolute saint, thank you!
Thank you!!!
Thanks, this is super helpful!
I remember the prof saying something about getting the scantron that's green on one side and purple on the other? 
hmm i can't find what that is, and I looked all over the student store's site. 
yeah .. I had no clue what he was talking about either when he first mentioned it. I guess I could be wrong about it
This is the scantron sheet you need [](http://imgur.com/a/q6Lwf)

I was wondering what they looked like, appreciate the picture post
I have a 100-question scantron that is green on both sides. Why do we need the kind that is green on one side and purple on the other???
Not sure but if they say that's what they need I'm not going to risk my final testing it. They're at the student store with the green books, hard to miss. "

Final semester before I graduate.

I wasn't able to switch to P/NP because I need a grade for this course, so I buckled up and tried harder for midterm 2 and basically still did incredibly bad. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe even a D- would count as passing (as long as my overall and major GPA would stay above 2.0, which it would), but in case I can't even get that - what happens if I fail? Am I kicked out, or do I just come back the extra semester and retake the class?","Maybe you will get good anecdotal advice here, but I really think you should talk to an adviser in your college for the most accurate information. Good luck!  
this happened to me and I didn't graduate/get my diploma because it was a requirement for my major.  felt pretty bad and I didn't muster up the courage to retake the course for a few years, but I was allowed to retake it and the new grade replaced the old one, and I was able to get my degree.  you won't get kicked out unless your are first placed on academic probation for low grades and don't improve them.
You have summer semester to retake classes as well!
Sounds like you're not gonna graduate
2 Options, you can get an extra semester to finish that if they would be nice. Second option, you'd need to take it through UC extension and pay $3K+ for this single class.

Should I Attempt a Math Minor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/idgmih/should_i_attempt_a_math_minor/,2020-08-20 12:07:34,"Hi everyone,

##mostly background below##

I am an incoming freshman and have just finished the summer term. I am planning on pursuing a major in linguistics and a minor in mathematics, and since I’ve just aced the sole prerequisite of LING major—LING 100, I’m ready to declare the moment that the official grade comes out. 

I’ve been thinking about pursuing a minor in math mostly out of interest and the fact that it’s a good companion to linguistics. Back in the high school senior year, I aced a community college multivariable calculus as well as a proof-based integrated multi/linear algebra at Harvard Extension School. I have a 5 in Calc BC, and all of those together clears all lower division except for MATH 54.

I though I’d do well in MATH 54, but then I bombed everything related to differential equations and eigenvalues, received a D in final, and I landed on a C+ for MATH 54. 

##end of background##

Although this is my first semester and I could have come up with many excuses to “justify” a lower grade, I’m determined to redeem that failure and to reflect and learn a lesson from this. However, while I’m certain to declare linguistics major, I have to face the choice of actually pursuing a minor or not (I’m considering a math major mostly out of interest)

I enrolled in H110 for this fall back when I was very confident on 54. I think that if I improve my grade in H110/110 I can show that I’ve taken my remedial work as a redemption to a failure in lower level of linear algebra, but I know that I absolutely cannot afford to bomb another course (I was doing okay in 54 before the finals, which is why I didn’t switch to pass/fail). I’m forgoing very interesting linguistics courses this fall to secure math 110, and if I switch to P/NP or do horribly it at the end, it would really be a shame. 

That being said, I plan to pursue grad school and hopefully stay at Berkeley for linguistics. If I terminate my journey of math right here, I don’t want to appear like I’m hiding away from a subject after an initial setback and give up on it.

Meanwhile, even if I manage to pull out the rest of the math minor program with straight A, will a C+ in elementary course hurt the “validity” of this minor? For this summer at Berkeley, I’ve aced two upper division linguistics courses, and passed MATH 55 (as a P/NP) outside of that C+ in MATH 54. 

What would you do if you were in my case? Will you continue and declare a minor, or will you just pursue a single linguistics major with a future GPA that’s probably still solid? Assuming a promising performance in the linguistics program, would you make the C+ in MATH 54 as a non-core program not directly related to your major, or try to grind very hard to get a solid math minor (that has a C+ in the core lower division)? 

I’m a Chinese international student, and I’m studying remotely for this semester.

I’ll firmly say that my passion for math certainly isn’t done with a C+ in MATH 54. Back in my senior year in high school, I couldn’t drive, so I took Uber to community college for multivariable Calc twice per week in the late night session. I know that spirit will never die, and regardless of what happens, I’ll maintain some exposure to math probably throughout my life, be it formal or informal.","So generally I support the idea.  One piece of input I'll give is that H110 with Harrison is not really a linear algebra class.  It assumes you know linear algebra quite well and teaches you category theory and multilinear algebra (tensor structures and such).  On the other hand, Stankova's 110 is great and very fair, and I would say it's a better way to get back on track with Linear after having some tough times in 54.  One bad experience in a lower div math class should not make or break anything for you, those classes are weird and they're totally different from the proof-based upper divs.
Differential equations can go smd. I feel ya brothr
Sounds like a yes to ne
Dude I am trying to major in linguistics + math as well! I love linguistics to death, and I am taking Ling 130 and Ling 111 this semester apart from Math H110. It's kind of wild there another person out there trying to do the same thing I am!!! I would love to talk more about this over like a pm!!!

I am taking Math H110 this semester because the curve is godly (people say it's really much easier to get an A on it but the work and psets are longer and harder, but tests are pretty fair). Also looking at the syllabus yeah there's a bunch of stuff jammed onto there in H110 that regular 110 won't have, but Harrison (the prof) said that there are technically no prereqs to H110. So all in all, H110 would be more of a gamble based on your past, but on the bright side it has no or very little eigenvectors (which regular 110 does have a bit of) or diff eq. and Harrison said it can be taken by someone with no background, so you may very well succeed!

I have heard that Math 110 is the place to be if you want just linear algebra knowledge. I've heard good things and bad things about both professors, so if you want to play it safe 110 would also work. In the end, it's up to you since there are pros and cons both sides

All in all, I think you should take one or two more math courses (like Math 128A or like Math 113) before you throw in the towel just because of Linear Algebra which is but one part of all the math out there. Rn just focus on choosing the right H110/110 for you and decide later"
Looking for a roommate for summer session D!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5wmpgb/looking_for_a_roommate_for_summer_session_d/,2017-02-27 23:33:47,"Planning on taking pol sci 1&2 over the summer and thought I'd try my hand at finding a potential roommate before chancing a random one.


P.S. stealing this format from the FB roommate search page 



Dorm Choice: Unit 2


Double or triple: double


Major: Economics/Political Science


Three adjectives: funny, sociable, indecisive


Sports: I like watching soccer


Introvert or Extrovert: depends, usually extroverted but sometimes introverted when around a lot of people I haven't gotten to know yet


Study Habits?: usually like to study alone at a quiet place (not in the dorm) because I get easily distracted


Heavy or Light Sleeper: heavy sleeper (p.s. sometimes I snore if I'm super exhausted)


Night Owl or Early Bird: also depends, but I'm guessing I'll be more of an early bird this summer because I can't study very well at night/when I'm tired


Messy or Tidy: pretty tidy; hard for me to work when it's messy


Hygiene Habits: I never smell (and I despise people that cake on deodorant so don't worry about that)


Drink: won't say no to a little bit of drinking


Smoke: depends, but in general it isn't some that I'm particularly interested in


Party: this summer? better be a study party


How do you feel about drinking/smoking in the dorm?: dorm better smell nice but drinking is alright with me (don't you dare vape though)


How important is privacy?: please don't touch my personal stuff, but usually this isn't an issue

why are they moving this bus stop?,https://i.redd.it/hktaczoyuet91.jpg,2022-10-12 10:35:45,,"P&T is merging this one and the current one in front of the construction site at the new Data Science building (The Gateway) into 1 at Oxford and Hearst.
That sign doesn't look like a legit AC Transit sign. I've seen stops moved or eliminated before, and they usually put up a laminated notice on the AC Transit letterhead.

Not saying the stop isn't moving though. Could be a temporary sign until they put up a real one.
Wait they're moving the one on university x oxford? That's kinda sad ... But ig if the new station is on oxford x Hearst we would have F buses going through that too so ig a plus?
Come to think of it, if this is Oxford & University, it's probably because of construction."
A few questions about dorming,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xa15g/a_few_questions_about_dorming/,2012-07-27 18:27:18,"Hey [r/berkeley](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/), new freshmen here. I'm really eager for moving-in three weeks from today, and I just have a few questions in the meantime.

* What time would be recommended for moving in for someone living in a double suite? Also, I've heard that Foothill is full of stairs, so I was just wondering if it is a bad idea to bring too many heavy stuff, like a mini-fridge and what not?

* Could someone please describe to me how a double-suite look like? Do I share the same room with one person, but share the same suite and common area with six (or more) others? Is it possible to cook in the suite (i.e. do we have some sort of a kitchen)?

* About meal points: I chose the standard plans when I signed my housing contract, which gave me 1250 meal points. Just did a quick math and realized that 1250 / 16 (14 + RRR week + final week) ~= 80 a week. That means I can only eat lunch and dinner 5 days a week (15 * 5)? O_____O

So my question is what do people usually do? Do they just skip breakfast / eat out / by stuff home and self-cook / buy more meal points at $50 - 55 points? Quite a few of upperclassmen told me at CalSO that they even had spare meal points at the end of semester, and I don't see how it's possible at all according to the above calculation. Can someone explain this please?

* I've heard that laptop lock might be useful when leaving my laptop at home and go to class or go out during weekends. However, I've never bought one, so can somebody recommend me which one to buy please?

* Where in North Berkeley is ideal to shop for food? I've heard that the Safeway on Shattuck has been closed, so...? D:

* I will be taking CS 70, which is in Exam Group 20, the last one. According to the Cal Housing site, all residents must move out before Saturday, Dec 15. The final for CS 70 ends at 10 p.m. the day before, does that mean I have to take my stuff and leave in two hours before midnight? O____O 

Also, can I leave most of my stuff in the dorm during the winter break, or do I have to take them all out and then move back in a month later?

Totally agree with all that the last person said. Only thing I would add is dont eat at DC 5 days a week. The food there is terrible. So, most probably, you are going to end up having lots of meal points remaining. Use them for lunch at golden bear (or any other cafe close to the class you are at before lunch)...
-In my opinion, it's best to show up late in the day. You'll be moving in on Saturday, the second day, between 10am and 5pm because you live in a double. People start lining up at 7am to get priority. It's not worth picking one or the other side of a symmetrical room, especially in a double in Foothill. Later in the day you'll see shorter lines and greater availability of people to help.
Bring whatever you want; Foothill has one of the more convenient move-ins.

-[Here is one example of a suite layout in Foothill.](http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/roomviews_3d.html?xml=foothill&pos=1) The images are somewhat misleading; this is a four-person suite which is the smallest (# of people). I stayed in a 4-person suite in a triple last year, and it was huge. 
In a double in a suite, you'll share your room with one person, and share the common room (a couple of couches and a table) and bathroom (multiple stalls) with your whole suite. Suites range from 4-18 people, and all but the largest are single-sex. There is a kitchen in Building 5 of Hillside, but it is not stocked with supplies or utensils. I'm not sure if La Loma also has a kitchen.

-I ended up buying additional meal points, at a conversion rate of $50=55pts. Running out won't be an issue, and it's preferable to have the freedom that the Standard Plan allows. That way, you'll be able to eat off-campus whenever you want. You can also pay cash, although I'd only recommend doing so at on-campus Cal Dining locations, since it's $2 extra to pay cash at the dining commons.

-I personally don't ever use my laptop lock, but, as a concerned freshman, I too bought one (two, actually, a portable one and one for my desk). They're available absolutely everywhere around move-in. Just look in the dorm section of Target, Bed, Bath, & Beyond, the Cal Student Store, etc. 

-You can get food much more conveniently than going to Shattuck! For me, South Side seems more accessible than Shattuck. Options on the northeast side of campus include the Cub Market, which is in the dining commons and accepts meal points, and the grocery store at the intersection of Le Roy and Euclid.

-You must move out by 10am on Saturday, Dec. 15. This gives you 12 hours. Exam Group 20 sucks, sorry.

-The dorms are closed to humans during winter break (they change the locks), but you can leave whatever you want in your room. They ask that you unplug all appliances to save money, and stuff like that.

Remember that questions of the variety your CalSO counselor could have answered can be addressed to askcalso@berkeley.edu.

edit: readability
1) the earlier the better. you get to pick your bed/side of the room. bring it, you have people to help you carry it.

2) link (i didn't live in foothills)[(http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/livingatcal/foothill.html)

3) eating 3x a day at a cafeteria takes a lot of time, and since most dc's (dining commons) are all you can eat, a lot of stomach space. most people skip a meal (esp breakfast - you get to be very lazy during college), and most people grab a quick bite around campus for lunch - 

4) get one. (i got mine stolen when my idiot roommate left the door deadbolted open and some clown who got into the dorms putting doortags for a dave matthews band grabbed it). *insert f7u12* your laptop just needs to be less stealable than your rommates

5) [looks like it'll be open summer 2012](http://www.berkeleyside.com/2011/01/21/north-berkeley-safeway-given-green-light-to-remodel/). 

options:

northside safeway (to be open)

southside safeway (can catch the 51b but still need to cross all of piedmont)

berkeley bowl (even further - SW of campus)

get someone who has a car. most people only get snacks/etc when they're living in the dorms b/c they don't have access to a (private) kitchen and full sized fridge.


everyone has mealpoints left over because dorm food is CRUD that nobody can stand for too long. the den is good although you're based on Northside. If you ever make it over there go for the Dutch Crunch, it's the only location that still has that bread. Campus food is overall as terrible as the DCs. I was based on southside so every week I'd buy cereal and milk at Bear Market at unit 3 and I'd just eat that for breakfast. then I'd grab sandwiches at the den (or Peets as it may be called) and eat them on the go. When you get used to them they start tasting pretty good....... 

to be honest you're probably not going to be buying too much food...I thought I would and I got a minifridge and all and then it got real with midterms and such and I just ate the nasty dorm food. 

Move out is at 10 am on Saturday. 
How long after move in do classes actually start? And do we just stay in the dorms and in school during that time?
Thanks a lot! By ""campus internet"", do you mean AirBears? Also, I know that torrenting = caught, but how about normal downloads from sites like rapidshare or hotfile and PPV streaming? Occasionally, I stream UFC PPVs, so I'm just wondering if I will get caught doing that xD. Thanks 
you're going to make the poor kid broke telling him/her to go shopping at andronicos
Dat flapjackmac
thanks! are the food at most on-campus cafe better than the DC's in your opinion?
wow, thanks a lot! These are very helpful. How's your overall experience with Foothill? Btw, will ResHall let me know who my roommate and suitemates are before moving in?
other thing - the menus are posted online. i highly recommend checking out the menus b/c sometimes, the food at the dc really is that terrible. [link](http://caldining.berkeley.edu/index.html)
cool thanks! Which lock would you recommend? I've been looking at those kensington locks but I'm really not sure which one to choose.


eek, dc food sounds horrid then T__T
Hey fellow golden bear! Classes start on Thursday, so it's approx 5-6 days after moving in. Yes, you will stay in the dorms, but there are so much stuff to do. Greeting your roomates/suitemates/floormates. Checking out class location. Attending the Chancellor's welcome / mandatory violence workshop at VLSB. Best of all, Caltopia and Welcome Week! And maybe something else that any upperclassmen here in r/berkeley can add...

I feel like 5 days is too short to discover everything I want to know *sigh*

Crossroads is awesome. I wish I could still eat lunch there everyday.
It is safe. I have never in my entire year heard of food poisoning, so dont worry about it..
Foothill was great for me. I lived and worked there for most of my college life. 

RSSP (residential student services program) typically sent out an email with your roommate information, but I was actually a spring admit, so they never gave that information to me. I was okay without knowing who my roommate was, but it would have been nice to coordinate what to bring. My parents were okay with unpacking my stuff, seeing what my roommate had and going to Target or Ikea to pick up the rest, which can be an option for you. 

If you go to bearfacts and log-in, it should show you where you live. It will look like a jumble of letters, but it makes sense sort of. For example, if you lived in 8C32F, you are in building 8, main entrance is up the C stairwell, 32 is a suite number located on the 3rd floor, room F. That should help you with where you need to park. Blds 1-3 are La Loma, located on the other side of Hearst Ave, and blgs 6-9 are Hillside, which have the parking lot nearby for easier unloading. 

I also agree that later is better, like noon or 1. The hall staff is more relaxed because there aren't hundreds of parents trying to move their kid in. Just don't get there after 4, because the front desk closes at 5, and they will lock up the carts and stuff. 

Both Hillside and La Loma have resident kitchens. I suggest bringing in your own utensils and cookware if you want to use them. Yes, some are left in there, but some folks don't know how to clean properly, so for your own sanity and health, bring your own things. La Loma is located on the bottom floor of Blg 1 in the rec room. Hillside is in Blg 5 next to the restrooms off the side. Both of these are often unknown to most residents. Make use of them! (but clean up after yourself, please)

I could probably write a lot more, but don't want to bore you. PM me if you have any other questions. GO BEARS!

EDIT: punctuation and grammar
thanks! im gonna bookmark it and check the menu before deciding to eat at dc or not.

btw, are the food/menu at all four all-you-can-eat dcs similar to one another?
they're all pretty standard.

and it doesn't matter if it's a flimsy lock. as long as it's slightly stronger than your roommates' :p
Never went for Chancellors welcome. Dont think thats going to make a difference.

Also, try to rush for a fraternity/sorority during welcome week (if you're into that). Or, just join a club of your interest. There will be so much tabling in Sproul during welcome week, so you can meet people from clubs/frats/sororities there.
I'm sure itll be an exciting couple of days :) I really can't wait haha. Are you an incoming freshman also ?
Is DC++ still working? I downloaded a shitload of stuff off that blazing fast with no data limits.
Thanks, I'm saving that for later use!

How is your experience with Foothill dorm in general? How safe is it to walk from Soda back to the dorm late at night alone? 
Trader Joe's on University or even taking the 18 to the Safeway on Solano are much better options.
ew! I lived at unit 1 and crossroads got so bad after around 3 weeks. There's a lot better food around the area too.
thanks a lot, those are very very helpful!
they used to all be ayce. i think foothill is now a la carte
Generally, yeah. Also, each DC has its own set of dishes that it makes periodically.

Personally, I prefer foothill because brunch there on Saturdays and Sundays is better than anywhere else (only if I got up earlier on Saturdays...). But otherwise, they will have almost similar dishes, just different everywhere on different days.
thanks, i guess im just going to buy the one that fits my budget best :p
Thanks for the advice! I'm not interested in frat, but joining clubs would be awesome.
Yes I am! Same here, really can't wait D:
its working, but its DEAD. Theres nothing on it anymore, I would just google and get stuff off filesharing sites.

Not sure if u did not get the sarcasm, or are being sarcastic yourself...
hmm ok. Btw, if I go into the DC for lunch, then pay $0.75 to take out to-go stuff, does that mean I can save myself 8 points for dinner lol? Do they even allow students to bring extra food out of the dc?
cool thanks!
Where are you coming from?
The student redditors should get it running again. Albums in 1 min and HD movies in 10 min.
Cool! For ping-pong, do you have to bring your own set of equipment?
Thanks. Is it 20 Gb a week? So, if I VPNed into the library's server like cap11235 mentioned, or use ResHall Wifi, does that count toward my bandwidth limit too?
hahahaha woops that completely went over my head..
it's disgustingly amazing how much food you can pack into a take out box if you don't mind having all the food mingled. i think i could fit 3 meals into one box. (wasn't terribly appetizing, but calories are calories)

officially, no. but you're talking about poor college students. 

easily stealable foods:

bring a backpack. load up on fruit.

bring a clean produce bag from the grocery store. get a bowl of cereal (no milk). pour into bag. rinse repeat.

i even brought tupperware to store extra donuts (then again foothill was so easy to steal from that it was beyond a joke)

[it was so bad at ucla that you have to put your backpack in a locker before going in](http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2012/04/ucpd_searches_for_man_and_woman_who_allegedly_stole_backpacks_and_laptops_from_dining_halls)

i'm sure most everyone helps themselves to a set of utensils/plates/bowl/cups/mugs from the dc.
From the Monterey-Santa Cruz area, but I have never gone up to Berkeley before Cal Day and CalSO, so it's an entirely new experience for me! You?

lol that is funny. I seriously cannot wait till my first day anymore haha.

Is the dc on normal days just basically look like a buffet, so that you can get/eat as many stuff as you want? When I was at CalSO, there were dining staff standing around everywhere, and I had to line up to get food, so it gave me an impression that taking meals was impossible...
From San Diego, right near the border :) Neither have I, I went for senior weekend and basically fell in love with the place
thank you for all your help!
thanks!
Yes. I lived in Foothill last year, and its buffet just like crossroads (so dont believe anyone else who says its a la carte - thats just late night but thats how late night is at every other place).

So, heres the deal about getting food - at Foothill, there's one room where all the food is served, and you eat in another huge room which just has chairs. However, in crossroads, the serving counters are all around the seats. So, its not that easy to steal from crossroads when you have half the staff walking around, while in foothill, the staff will be in the serving room.
i believe foothill has been permanently converted to a la carte, but the other three (crossroads, cafe 3, clark kerr) are still ayce.

calso is just a show. 

exhibit A: dorm food during move in weekend (i.e. when the parents are there)

exhibit B: the rest of the year

Nice. Have you ever heard of someone getting caught by stealing food? xD
cool, thanks man!
what is ranch 99
I know someone who did get caught once (both at crossroads and foothill). All they said to him, was ""dont do it again."" And he just became more careful.

At foothill, he did not put his sandwich in a bag and at crossroads, he took 2 apples when Crossroads closed (so obviously he wasnt going to eat them there)... 

But he used to take stuff on a daily basis, unlike me.

no public FBI record as far as I can tell. so either the guy is a genuine scammer whose attempting to fake his own death, or the person who put this flier up is a scammer offering a fake $30K reward lol

beautiful poster though
So I live down University and I’ve been seeing these signs all around the area for the last 8 months or so, and recently someone (whoever is putting them up) put new ones out. Probably within the last week. 

When you Google this guy, it says he died Summer 2022. What are these posters for? Why are they putting more up if he’s dead? Can anyone offer any insight on who this dude was and why these posters exist?

When I lived in Berkeley, I collected fliers from campus and the surrounding neighborhoods. Some were protest-related, some were political, and some were clearly made by folks struggling with severe mental illness, like this one. All of them were entertaining though. Wish I still had them all…
i've been getting regular emails from an old decal ""prof"" claiming they're a victim of ""cyber rape and chi hacking"". they're often filled with ""evidence"" accusing different people they've never met. i think this is a similar situation
REWARD $30.OOO THIRTY THOUSAND
I saw this guy walking down telegraph on Monday!
I worked at a computer repair store on shattuck a few years back, wild dude would come in and want an air-gapped computer install because a hacker was after him.  Maybe related?  lol.  The same customer also invited me to a park one day to ""teach me about self esteem.""
At least he's not a satanist, eh?
HE ORCHESTRATED IT
Security is economics
It looks like the plaintiff (Hamilton) in these cases against Fontenot is a registered sex offender who lived in the same apartment community in Berkeley.
Your answer is mental illness.

There’s someone in Alameda County court records who has filed civil suits against this person. Could be legit cases, of course. But considering that he’s being targeted even in death, there’s a nonzero chance that the plaintiff in these cases is your poster culprit.

This got voyeuristic and macabre so I’m going to drop the curiosity now.
The only answer is he faked his death and stole someone’s identity. If he’s as good a hacker as they claim, then this is your answer.

this is amazing
whoa WHAT ?? that’s so weird 😭
How can someone type the correct zero for 30 but somehow use O for the rest? Makes O sense
Pray more
wait what?? 
So what do you make of that
Oh wow. That’s so interesting. Thank you for some insight!
That’s what I was thinking too!! It would be so insane if he faked his death or something crazy like that. But what’s even weirder is there’s absolutely no info on this dude being a hacker on the internet. And there’s only one picture of him online, which is the same as the poster picture and the one on his obituary. Weird stuff.

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There’s a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don’t do that. While I’ve visited many times, I’ve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It’s mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we’ll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you’ll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it’s remarkable how many people I know who haven’t ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley’s best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won’t be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you’ll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don’t think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you’ve ever taken the 51B down University though, you’ll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I’ll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>• Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>• Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>• Visit the Little Farm (it’s a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>• Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris’ favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There’s also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you’re here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you’re there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven’t ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha’s hand. Don’t get cherimoya fruit though—I accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can’t even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it’s the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area’s fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don’t think their parties are exclusive? I’ve never asked. It’s a tradition though, and they’d probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn’t substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you’ll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there’s no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it’s a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn’t stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they’d let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn’t interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they’re much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it’s surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day’s moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you’re further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you’re trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn’t need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer’s markets** *You’ve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There’s a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine’s Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you’re looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley’s indie bookstores:*

>• Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>• Moe’s  *If you’re looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there’s also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>• Pegasus  
>  
>• Mrs. Dalloway’s  
>  
>• Half-Price Books  
>  
>• Eastwind Books

* **Stop into a store you’ve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they’ve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you’re closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I’m going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn’t a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the “Hell Summer” that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, “the poetry reading is out of control,” uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here’s*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I’d begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It’s hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it’s now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it’s good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There’s a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber’s Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he’s inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can’t walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I’m unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you’re looking for something wholesome, this Cal student’s** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it’s so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don’t exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he’s accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country’s history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it’s spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it’s haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don’t need to listen closely.*
* Oakland—Mountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some… mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it’s worth the trip. It’s a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can’t believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they’re filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It’s gothic, but it’s also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany—Albany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I’ve ever taken--I’ve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you’re willing to do a little bit of exploration. There’s a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It’s a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany—TEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland—Lake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There’s a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children’s Playland.*
* Oakland—[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I’m mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland—Jack London Square *I’d sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you’re into that. There’s also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London’s Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There’s also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don’t be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You’ll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill
* [Mark’s Yard Art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mark-oliviers-yard-art)
* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you’re lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There’s a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren’t an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire’s before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it’s near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I’d call it romantic.)","I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:

Check out the archives and the Bancroft Library. There's a bunch of really cool old and rare books and a lot of Cal related historical documents. You can't check anything out of the building though, you can only look at it in the reading room.
To add onto the bit about fire trails:

This section in particular (starts from the stadium, goes up to Grizzly Peak) is my absolute favorite hike in the entire area. It's a pretty steep climb but if you're a good hiker or runner then it should be very doable. 6ish miles roundtrip. When you get up into the hills you can see a huge chunk of the East Bay and into SF - and then you realize how small Berkeley is compared to the rest of the world. It's also a great place to meditate.

Walking across the Golden Gate, and looking at Berkeley/Campanile tower is an amazing perspective! Then go up the tower, and look back at the Golden Gate.
1) stay up all night watching stars at Fire Trails contemplating just how big the universe is

2) storm the field after a Big Game victory


3) eat a Top Dog after a long day of classes. As you order, think about how you’re standing right where Steve Wozniak would have ordered his first Top Dog. Don’t think too long, or the cashier/chef might yell at you 

4) Build something cool. Even if it’s stupid and you’re the only one that will ever appreciate it. It’s worth it
The pier trespassing is dangerous... Could end up with someone dying. I don't recommend.
You know, I feel like I'd appreciate this a lot more if I wasn't stuck at home for my last semester :( 

great list, though, and maybe I'll just have to come back after I graduate...
Find someone who has a code to the Essex Baths.

See a concert at the redwood grove

Meditate at the Berkeley zen center (can combine with a trip to Berkeley bowl)

Attend the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary Easter celebration hosted by the Nuns of perpetual indulgence.

Find the concrete slide in the Castro. Take a walking tour while you're at it.

Swim at the hearst women's gym pool at least once - it's covered in marble and old statues, and has a great view of the campus.

Catch the art students' semesterly print sale days. Extremely cheap awesome art.

Speaking of art, you can check out a priceless piece from the University - and switch it out every once in a while for something new.

Not quite Berkeley specific, but gaze at the stars while taking a late-night cliffside swim at the Esalen center.

Go go Land's End. It's beautiful.

Take advantage of the SF museums. They're fantastic. They also do free days every so often, if you don't want to pay ridiculous admission fees. Just get there early.

Children's Fairyland is not creepy! It's cute, and it's over 70 years old, which is cool. Rumor has it that it inspired Walt Disney when he was planning Disneyland.
A must do for any EECS undergraduate

Spend an all nighter in the depths of Soda Hall working on cs project due the next day
Wow I grew up in Berkeley and gotta say you've hit practically every spot I can think of! I personally also enjoy Panoramic Way as a walk up to a nice view, and would add Point Isabel to the list of places to visit if you're into dogs.

Really enjoyed reading this and extra thanks for sharing the 1999 blog
It's a very minor point, but ""find a strange fruit"" might be better worded ""find rare fruit"" or ""find unusual fruit"".
this is very helpful for people who havent visited campus yet cuz of covid, thanks!
Watch a football game from T1GHTWAD HILL!
Thanks for these excellent suggestions! I just checked out *American Heiress* on your recommendation. As an undergrad, my friend John used to live in that apartment - I think he said they still had bullet holes in the wall.
Adding on:

\- Read a book in Morrison Library

\- Visit Cheeseboard Pizza at least once (but probably 100+ times).

\- Get sushi at Kirala

\- Take BART to SF on a free weekday and explore the city, visit the de Young or Legion of Honor, get lunch, go to Blue Bottle Coffee at the Mint

\- Visit the Old Rose Garden at the Botanical Garden in May -- all the roses are in bloom and it is stunning

\- Swim at Strawberry Canyon pool in spring/summer

\- Visit a coffee shop so many times that the staff know you

\- Take grad pictures around campus; cliche, but as an alum, I LOVE having these
As a 2020 transfer, this is very sad. Hopefully I can stay in the area after graduating and doing some of these next year.
22. Not get rejected

~ An applicant preemptively crying over my rejection this thursday
Should have included attend the Big Game!
Underground steam tunnels should be there too
Mostly food related—

Get some food from the Buddhist temple in South Berkeley, Vik’s Chaat, Ethiopian food (Addis; might be in Oakland).  

Tilden—play golf/whack a bucket of balls at the driving range.  It’s a pretty course and the three-tier driving range is pretty cool.

Bike the bike trail along 580 to Richmond and check out the Rosie the Riveter installation.  If you are lucky, a park ranger will be present to answer questions.

Ride your bike around town at night.  It’s fun!

Frolf.

Do the sake tour (if it’s open).

Berkeley Bowl—best grocery store EVER.  Get the Odoriko tomatoes if they have them.

Kirala—chawan mushi is like an ocean French kiss.
This is the coolest post ever, thank you

-freshman at berkeley
For now, I've got one that you probably know too well by now:

Your home. 


Stay home, please? 
We need this thing to go away.
Hey, I love you and this post
This is so beautiful. Tysm <3
god i miss trawling through urban ore on a sunny day 

the south berkeley farmer's market is also amazing too and if u have calfresh u can get $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce!!!
While you're at the Rose Garden, go through the tunnel by the tennis courts to Cordonices Park and ride down the concrete slide on a piece of cardboard. There are usually a few pieces lying at the bottom. (Do not attempt sans cardboard.)
“Does anybody here remember Barrington Hall? Does anybody here remember Barrington?”

You should add in some stuff in San Francisco since it's easily accessible to us. Great list for Berkeley though- both the campus and the wider city.
Have ramen at Marufuku in Japantown :D
this is late but what’s wrong with cherimoya?
This is one of the best posts I've seen on things to do, ever. Thank you stranger! Making me reminisce on so many positive memories of Berkeley + the Bay area. Truly unlimited things to do. I feel so thankful. If I do even teeny fraction of these things, I will be happy<3
Isn't Bancroft closed to people without special access? I tried going in during 2019 but they didn't let me :(

&#x200B;

Will add to check out all the Berkeley libraries, Doe itself has at least 4 smaller libraries within it.
I adore that trail, but good god that one slope midway though is terrifying
hope you'll be able to visit someday; most of these things will probably be here once you do (: and I hope your last semester goes as well as it can!
the heart women's gym/pool is a fascinating and beautiful old building!! i had no idea it existed until i took a final in there lol
the man's had a glorious career, there is no doubt! didn't know about his involvement in UC directly though (beyond the work in Claremont), most of my knowledge only goes as far back as John Galen Howard. very cool!
children's fairyland was my childhood. no disney could ever attempt the beauty of that place tbh.
not just a rumor, that's a fact! and I should have corrected that by now haha my Oakland neighbor who reads my newsletters said the same. unfortunately I can only speak from my experience walking around it when it's closed due to covid, and that's a bit eerie. always wanted to go inside, maybe someday /:
That place is terrifying and it made me scared as shit of puppets. So I have to disagree with you
Previously WEB. Previously 260 Evans.
I hate that I did this, but also glad I did for the experience lmao. CS projects and all-nighters mix well together
updated; is ""strange fruit"" used as a euphemism on the regular? I haven't ever heard it outside of the context of the song
Because of the association with the protest / anti-lynching song?
oh whoa that's wild!! cool that they preserved the history, but also kind of disturbing, but also I'd totally pay to set foot inside and see (': and I hope that you like American Heiress! Toobin is fairly well-respected, but it's clear that he's got a certain angle and sometimes the way that he editorialized to that was annoying.  Kind of reminded me of listening to Serial honestly--good storytelling and the character of the people really comes through, but you also have to wonder what they're leaving out. I'd love to read Patricia Hearst's memoir if I ever come across it!
I also recently learned that Morrison Library loans out original artworks to students! If I were a student again I would definitely take advantage of this.
Wait how do you find these?
many of these are fine to visit in a mask, I think we all agree that we need this to go away but depriving your life of all pleasure until then is not the way to go about it
it was $11 for one fruit lol
Haha yeah - I remember the first time I went there and tried to run up it. Even to this day I still remember how difficult that was!
It's a commonly understood phrase, yes. The song was capturing a phrase used at the time, and it is used sometimes now.
Because of its association with lynching, of which that song is part. The phrase exists beyond the song.

For anyone who has not heard this Billie Holiday classic.
I'll be relieved if Toobin doesn't hypnotize me into jerking off in public.

Look for the steam
oh lol I didn’t see the word “accidentally” until now
Indeed it does. Even beyond that historical meaning. The context OP provided rendered it harmless.
As an art historian I agree with your comment completely! Glad that you were not charged. Out of curiosity, what was the work?
I totally understand your position, I didn't think it was malicious by OP"
Anyone remember Berkeley Cycle & Toy on Shattuck? Bought my first Schwinn ten speed there in 1971.,https://i.redd.it/1sxbwfgstbec1.jpeg,2024-01-23 21:48:47,,"can’t imagine getting a bike for under $100 🤯 inflation is crazy
Wow, goes to show how much cheaper stuff (well, tools, leisure, TVs, etc) is today in inflation adjusted terms. Surprised to see someone's first bike at almost $100 if you consider that back in 1971 that was a TON of money.
[deleted]
Wow super cool! My mom has memories of picking out books on Shattuck in the 1970s
I think that's equivalent to $750 in today's dollars."
I want to have PNP,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jbfsd6/i_want_to_have_pnp/,2020-10-14 20:14:27,"I want to have PNP so bad. PNP is so cute, and sometimes I just really want to hold their P, or touch their NP. I’m alone in my place and I have PNP posters all over in my room. My heart melt a little whenever I see those cute P's smiling at me with their soft, tender eyes, but deep down I still know they’re just NP. I want a real PNP who is cute and can actually react to things I say, cheer me up when I’m down, who can breathe and is warm to hold in my arms.

More importantly, I started to realize that without PNP my life is meaningless. I’m told I need to get in a good college, I need to get A/A+ grades, i need to take the pain to go through all the leetcode, and get a good summer internship, and finally I need to get a job at google earning 200k. But so what, even if I earn 200k, instead of 80k or something at a medium company? So that I can drive a BMW instead of a Honda Accord? So that I can live in a luxury apartment instead of a studio? I have literally no interest in those stuff. A Honda and a BMW is the same to me, so is a studio or a house. I’m told to work so hard towards stuff I literally don’t want and don’t need either. I spend 90% of my time trying to get a 200k job, while a 80k job can satisfy me just the same, and requires much less effort.

What do I want then? PNP. PNP who’s moderately cute in appearance (most do), and who can understand me and loves me. That’s all. It doesn’t even have to be smart. That’s trivial. With PNP, my life will be filled with purpose again. I’m an only child, from a big city where people don’t connect with each other, and I’m not so close with my parents. In childhood, I always feel alone in this world. Same in college. Friends come and go. After the semester is over, I seldom contact or get contacted by any of them again. I feel like something replaceable. I’m a replaceable student, a replaceable intern, a replaceable lab assistant, a replaceable friend. But with PNP, I will have something to love, to protect. I’ll know what it’s like to be cherished by something. I’ll know that I have the responsibility to keep it happy that I can share with no one. I will have a purpose in life. Weekends and holidays will actually be joyful, not dreadfully boring. I can come home every day not facing a dark and empty room, but to a cute PNP whose eyes are filled with tender love. Money or leetcode or google or MIT PhD offer, they mean nothing to me. If can choose, I would rather be born in a much poorer family, or as a person with less academic talent, but with PNP who can understand me and loves me. I really don’t want to be alone anymore.

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
Commuting to Berkeley/defer admission?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/64bj8h/commuting_to_berkeleydefer_admission/,2017-04-08 22:05:53,"Hello there! As someone who's trying to find ways to save money, I would love it if some of y'all experienced experts could give a rising freshman some tips :)  

1) My family's apartment is around 45min-hr away from Berkeley. Is it common for people to commute that long? It's moderately far and would increase gas costs, but I think that may be cheaper than renting a place.  

2) Does Berkeley have some sort of gap year or deferred admissions plan where I can go to a community college to take general ed classes and then attend Berkeley in the Spring semester or even the next year? I suppose it may be relevant to say that I'm *aiming* for a cs major :'P  

3) As someone with no experience with room & board, do you just recommend I google up apartments to stay at near Berkeley (if commuting ends up not being an option)? Or is there supposed to be a resource on UCB's website to help me find housing? I know they guarantee 1st year housing, but I'm quite sure apartments are cheaper so I'm highly considering that.  

Thanks for all the help! Digital bear hugs to all of you :D","Congrats on getting into Cal!

1) I know of people who have commuted to Berkeley from places as far away as Mountain View/Sunnyvale (2-3 hours away by car during rush hour traffic). So it is certainly doable, though personally I won't recommend it for the full college experience. This thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2395nw/how_far_off_campus_have_you_lived/) contains responses from people who've commuted pretty far distances– I think you can message any of those people with regards to specific questions about commuting life.

2) Berkeley does not have a gap year/deferred admissions plan per se that I know of– a pretty common thing for people who want to do a gap year here is to enroll for classes for the fall semester (turning them into registered students) and then withdraw. I know that Cal does accept community college credit for breadths/R1A/R1B classes taken after acceptance into Cal (I have many friends who have taken online R1A/R1B classes at local community colleges, for instance), so I think you should be fine if you were to take community college classes for a semester or so and then using assist.org to transfer them automatically to Cal. Definitely reach out to an L&S Adviser for more detailed advice; I'm pretty sure they'll point you in the right direction.

3)  Cal doesn't offer any resources for finding off-campus housing (at least, not that I know of), so Craigslist would be your best bet for housing. Right now all the current freshmen are scrambling for housing though, so be constantly on the lookout, as listings disappear fast (often within a few hours). Apartments are typically much cheaper than on-campus housing, though be on the lookout for deals that look too good to be true of course and outright scams. If you find good roommates (which you probably will have to do if you want cheap housing– a single apartment goes for $2000+ here), you can end up with housing offers as low as $600 a month (though most I've seen are in the $700-1000 range)

Hope this helps!
Hi, I'm a freshman and live in Point Richmond. On average my commute is somewhere between 20-30 minutes depending on time of day, etc. I love it, but it can be moderately isolating. You really have to go out of your way to make friends. If it makes sense financially, I would say go for it. 

If you have any questions feel free to PM me. 
I'm a freshman myself. This is a good question
My understanding is you go to orientation and enroll in classes as if you plan on attend, but before the semester starts you cancel your registration. You'll pay a small fee, but I don't think it's more than a few hundreds. Then when you come back, you apply for readmission (and almost guaranteed a spot). 

I know transfer students who have done this, so I'm assuming it would be the same loophole you use as a freshman. 
Sorry for the late response, but thanks for the reply! Yea I think that I'm gonna try to live on campus my freshman year to get that ""experience"" and more friends, but I think I might consider commuting in my later years. By the way, I went to a reception and got a paper that discussed prices. Are the on campus apartments generally cheaper/as expensive/more expensive than off-campus housing? 
Sorry for the late response, but thanks for answering my question! I think I'm going to live on campus at least my 1st semester, but in case I do end up commuting, how do you generally make new friends at Berkeley? Joining clubs/talking to other ppl in classes? Do you feel in any way that you're not getting a ""full"" experience that others living on campus get? And do you generally hang around Berkeley and go back home at night or basically go home as soon as you're done with classes?  

Thanks again!
Those are pretty good questions, and I think about them a lot. Firstly, the best friends I've made are from classes, especially CS classes in group projects. Other places I've made friends are in clubs and just randomly hanging around campus. 

There is definitely a bit of the experience that you miss out on. But it doesn't bother me. When I've brought my friends over they all say they wish they lived where I do, and I find myself sometimes wishing I lived where they do. 

My housing assignment was a quad in Foothill, so honestly I'm quite glad that I'm able to live in my own apartment. The drive is beautiful and gives me some time to relax every day. My neighbors are PHD and graduate students at Berkeley, so its pretty cool to interact with them. If I ever want to party or hang on campus then I just sleep over at friends places or Uber back. Overall, it's a different experience. I have a lot more quiet, private time then my friends on campus. 

Living off campus isn't for everyone. If you're someone who's going to overanalyze everything you're missing out on, its not going to be a great experience. Because unfortunately, you will miss out on the occasional spontaneous hangout or event. But if you don't mind too much and put in the effort to make it the best experience possible, living off campus is awesome. 

As for your last question, it really depends on my mood. If there's a lot of stuff going on then I'll hang out with my friends or study in the library. If I feel like going home, then I do. 

If you do decide to commute, one last thing you should think about is parking. A student parking pass is about $350 a semester and you can only park in some specific lots on campus. Basically you have to get to campus before 10:30 AM to get a spot in the morning and after 2 ish in the afternoon. People come and go but sometimes its a hassle waiting in the parking garage.

If you have any more questions let me know."

Oh stop it. They give you a ridiculous amount of time. You're like 2/3 of the way through the class when you reach the deadline.

If they let you switch to P/NP any later, it would be too easy to just pre-empt any non-A with a quick P/NP switch to inflate your GPA.
OP is a grumpy cat.
people who just can't chill out...
I'm getting the feeling Berkeley might not've been for you... or maybe college life in general 

the ranting is good though, whatever helps you stay calm during the year
* Why did you not like Lower Sproul? I love it compared to the flyer fest in upper sproul. I find it cool to see students practicing dancing, and damn, some of them are really good at it too.

* Also, referring to bowles and CKC as hogwarts, is like trying to sooth onself into believeing life is good. Everyone has the right to do so, and I'm sorry of Bowles/CKC dining don't match your standards of Hogwarts.

* What about GBC? Why is its layout awful? I can't think of any reason. There are never more than 10 students in a line at a time. Also, its really convenient, though overpriced, way to get food on campus when you dont have time to get a fancy lunch.

Otherwise, I kind of agree to rest of your list. However, you gotta chill out dude. Just look at the good stuff.
Professors tell you to come to their office hours so they don't waste everyone's time in lecture addressing material that only you think is relevant.

There are many reasons for attendance/participation grades. One of these is to give you ""easy"" points in hard classes. Some classes require that you actually be able to talk about the things you are learning. Often, the requirement is there for freshman who would otherwise skip sections and then become irate when they fail the midterm.

Some professors do not allow their TAs to present new material in section. If you don't have questions or topics you want to review, your TA might not be allowed to talk about anything at all.

It is not our job to make sure you get the grades you want. We are paid to help you learn the material. If you have learning concerns, we can go over the material with you, give you strategies for studying, help you make mnemonics, and give you practice answering exam-type questions. If you have grade concerns, we cannot retroactively give you 100% on the midterm just because you feel like you deserve it. All we can do is advise you to study hard and do better on the final.
>I hate anyone who is different, has a good time, and anything I can blame for my lack of success. 
Wow, you're kind of an angry little dude, aren't you? College life and life in general is a lot better if you relax and learn to enjoy things instead of walking around in your own personal rage cloud being hateful towards everything that you don't understand or isn't convenient for you. 

**Tl;dr: you sound like a really miserable, judgmental person.**
The Tang Center
I hate that you can't buy beer with the money on your Cal1 card. I had like 5$ left on it and they wouldn't let me buy a 40. Fucking shit. 
I really think part of the reason people have such a low opinion of Evans is because they associate with their calculus classes. I am not saying that it's good looking, although it's grown on me. It's by no means *that* ugly.

Also fuck off~ for this point: ""People who copy your homework.""

emailing staff/administration/counselers and not getting an email back until 3 weeks later
I can assure you that my list of things I like about Cal is much longer, and that I am not constantly walking around campus filled with rage. I just thought I'd give everyone an opportunity to rant, and I wanted to share this big list my friends and I have been adding to throughout the years. Y'all need to chill! :)
I LOVE the guy who sits on a pillar and rants about the environment! He's so sarcastically witty and he actually does his research :D
shh
One thing that bothers me:

Professors/teachers putting something on the midterm that wasn't even discussed, in any of the assigned readings, or even alluded to being on the midterm. 

Fucking stupid. And all of my roommates act like that's some normal thing here. 

Excuse me, but what the fuck am I being downvoted for? This subreddit is filled with a bunch of dicks, I swear. 
Why are people so down on the OP's list? I found it pretty amusing and agreed with a lot of it.
What's wrong with professional frats?
My list:

hipsters,
hippies,
co-ops,

treehuggers,
extreme liberals,
people who take everything up their ass,

people who know nothing about sports with their fake school spirit,

People with lanyards dangling from their back/side pockets, especially guys. You look really stupid. The next guy I see does this, I'm gonna yank that shit out of their pocket and throw it in the street.
* The blue lights which we tout to prospective students as if every other university hadn't installed them in a pointless arms race to make people feel safe.
The few times I've been to the Dwinelle restrooms, I actually enjoyed reading all of the stuff written on the walls. 
I guess I've just always thought of P/NP as being for that very reason - to quickly avoid a bad grade at the last minute. A lot of colleges let you write a big 'P' on the back of your final to change the grading option.
The line for the grill blocks all of the drinks, the lines for the cashiers block all of the aisles! It's a clusterfuck!
1. I'm talking about when the information is relevant.

2. I guess I'm not a fan of ""fluff"" points - just grade me on the homeworks and tests! :P

3. I think TAs and GSIs should prepare lesson plans just like any teacher would (and most of my GSIs over the years have been fantastic!). I just hate it when GSIs expect students to ""run"" the section - that's your job!

4. Of course - I understand all of that. I just think it's funny when professors say ""you'll be fine - just do better on the final!"" in a lackadaisical ""anyone can get 100% on my final!"" sort of way. :)
...seriously what's up with this guy

>BearTransit (especially when they take over for BearWalk late at night).

BearTransit might be one of my favorite things about Berkeley. Those buses are awesome!
I love Cal and am super bummed I'm graduating so soon. I am definitely not miserable!
You sound just as miserable as OP! Taking out your aggressions at people anonymously over the Internet! People like you make r/berkeley one of the meanest subreddits to which I subscribe.
this happened to me, I emailed an advisor, and didn't get a response until 4 months later. By then, I had already gone and talked to that same advisor in person. 
Too pretentious?

I know quite a few friends who spend more than their times worth in these frats, and compared to people who have a real fucking job, they are just wasting their time.

Also, the fucking interviews. You are not Google/Goldman Sachs, stop making it too fucking formal.
I'm wondering the same thing.
Why do you have to know about sports to have school spirit?
I don't wear lanyards, but you have no business concerning yourself with something so small as to how people decide to wear their keys. Stop acting childish, grow up, and mind your own business.
[I dare you](http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/You+should+try+watching+bollywood.+I+dare+you.+I+double+_5b5fa32278d955422d1a1a092d0a8344.jpg)
those actually function more as a deterrent for crime rather than to help when you are in trouble.

Usually, if someone is threatened, they're not going to wait by one of those pillars and make a call. They're going to run away and call on a cell phone, which everyone has by now.

However, any thief that sees them will think that if they make a move, they are a quick call/alert away from authorities and could get caught. Think of them like a bike lock - any true thief is going to get past it, plain and simple. They've just deterred a lot more crime that no one ends up noticing.
>I guess I've just always thought of P/NP as being for that very reason - to quickly avoid a bad grade at the last minute.

It's to encourage people to take challenging classes without worrying about it bringing down their GPA. It's not to give you a last minute GPA loophole.

> A lot of colleges let you write a big 'P' on the back of your final to change the grading option.

And those colleges probably have inflated GPAs.
Also, there's a whole bullet point for ""alumni."" So, you hate every person who's ever graduated just because they... graduated? Are you going to hate yourself? 
I like em during the day and when they're being used as night safety shuttles. They're just awful at knowing where certain streets are when they take over for BearWalk after 2am.
Maybe. I just dislike it when people make sweeping, ignorant, arbitrarily hateful generalizations. If wishing people were more positive makes me *mean,* then so be it?
I'm in one that's nothing like that. Then again it's not like most professional ones in terms of the formality and the work required. I agree with you in that some of them cross the line when it comes to time commitment.
But if you had until the final to decide, people would likely work harder throughout the semester. The way it's set up right now, the minute you change your grading option to P/NP, it's pretty easy to simply slack off for the rest of the semester.

If there were no deadline, you could theoretically keep giving it your all until the final, and then decide. That makes more sense to me!
I'm sorry - I don't think anything I said was hateful. I'm not a hateful person. I was just trying to poke fun at some things I've found annoying over these past four years.
It would still fuck up GPAs. Imagine every non-A could be avoided. Grades would cease to function as reliable indicators of academic achievement altogether.

We might as well just get rid of grades if we're going to move the P/NP deadline out to the end of the class. If you ask me it's already too far into the semester as it is.
But all of the other rules regarding P/NP would still apply. You still couldn't take major requirements as P/NP, so grades wouldn't be obsolete like you're claiming.
Most of the classes you take are not for your major."
UGBA 10 as a freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cd9yua/ugba_10_as_a_freshman/,2019-07-14 16:38:03,"Hi! I'm an intended CS and Business major! I am pretty certain I want to take LS 25 and CS 61A, but besides that, I'm really lost. I was thinking of taking UGBA 10, but lots of people don't recommend it? Could someone explain?

Otherwise, it'd be awesome to get some advice on how to choose classes. I know EE 16A would've been great, but it clashes with LS 25 which has a really cool topic this fall! There's so many good courses out there, but they don't work because of schedule conflicts, being full, etc.

In context, here are the requirements I have to fulfill:

* Arts/Lit (fulfilled by LS 25)
* Bio (eww... )
* Philosophy and Values (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Social/Behavioral Science (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)
* International Studies (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Reading and Comp B (None of the ones that still have spots sound great and I don't like writing essays...ideas? Spring?)
* American Cultures (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)

&#x200B;

And the courses I'm considering. Thoughts on courses/teachers appreciated:

* Intro to Human Nutrition (Marc Hellerstein, Joseph L Napoli)
* Human Biological Variation (Leslea Hlusko)
* Psychology of Sleep (upper-div) (Matthew P. Walker)
* Principles of Business (Judy Hopelain, Omar Romero-hernandez, Daniel G Mulhern, John Briginshaw)
* Seminar on Social, Political, and Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine (David Malcolm Potts, Darlene D. Francis)
* Design and Activism (Greg Castillo, Achvabenzinberg Stein)

&#x200B;

But I'm conflicted because I have a lot of requirements to fulfill, and I can't do most right now, but I also don't want to take extra classes and get behind...","Just do Econ 1 or UGBA 10 so you can knock out one of the business pre reqs alongside one of the CS pre reqs. I'm guessing you passed out of Math? Olney is a great Econ Professor and the course isn't too demanding/hard but I also wouldn't take it easy and push it to the side.
UGBA 10 as a freshman is totally fine - I commented on another post about it but it’s essentially a consistently medium-load class. Exam every 3 or so weeks, different professors so different style to get used to every 3 weeks. Multiple choice exams which are fine as long as you use the past practice papers available to you. I don’t think it’s that bad but if you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

In terms of the bio breadth, you could consider MCB C61 or C62. C62 is offered in fall and is called Drugs and the Brain while C61 is in spring and is about Brain, Mind, and Behaviour. I believe both are crossovers with Psych so they’re both very interesting classes, but may be a bit heavy on the neurobiology part with diagrams and technical terms and everything that goes along with that, in case you’re not super interested in that. Lots of memorisation but not super difficult classes. I found C61 was quite interesting even though I’m not a STEM major, and Dr Presti is definitely very interested and dedicated to the topics covered. If you’d like to know more about that course, I’d be happy to discuss it in greater depth."
"Depressed About Classes, Recruiting and Life in General",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jlf51v/depressed_about_classes_recruiting_and_life_in/,2020-10-31 01:55:48,"Hi everyone, so I don’t mean to add another depressive post here but I guess I’ve been struggling for a while with stuff.

* Apathy/annoyance towards classes - as an econ major and intended DS minor, I’m taking econometrics, public economics and an ethics class, and personally, I believe econometrics has not been very accommodating with stuff in terms of how they handled the leaked midterms, the midterm submission fiasco and homework being graded on accuracy despite subpar teaching of R and all that. 
* I thought I was interested in public economics but I guess I’m not...and with regards to the ethics class, I am actually better at writing/humanities than STEM...but...I hate academic writing and that’s caused me to feel a lot of annoyance towards that class.
* Stressing about midterm scores - taken 2 midterms and no scores are back for either...pretty sure I bombed one...
* Feeling hopeful about the P/NP debacle and then realizing there’s so much misinformation about it...like whether or not there was even a vote for it, whether it was in favor, the fact that there was supposed to be an update on Friday and then there turned out not to be one...
* I know that as a student, I should stop worrying about P/NP and just assume it will not happen until they say it will, but it’d relieve some of the pressure I’m feeling
* Above all, as a junior, I think recruiting (mostly for consulting, marketing, sort of for PM) is one of my largest stressors, even more so than academics, as I want to go into industry after college - I’ve gotten interviews but have never made it past the final rounds for any, and while I know people (mostly) only post their successes on LinkedIn, I feel pressured when I see that people have gotten internships with great companies and that I haven’t.
* I hate myself for the fact that my interviewing skills are holding me back from great offers because I am pretty good at BS-ing on my resume and cover letter...I have tried mock interviewing with friends and I see some improvement, but...not enough yet I guess.
* I know that you don’t necessarily need an internship for a good full-time job (especially since I have seen friends with FAANG and IB internships **not** get return offers because of COVID) but I know it helps, and that’s where the pressure is coming from in addition to just seeing other people be more successful than I am currently doing in recruiting. 
* Another reason why I feel annoyed about my classes is because I don’t see how economics classes will help me succeed in my interviews or future job.
* Of course just being lowkey worried about how COVID-19 will impact my family and friends and potentially even myself, whether it's finances or health or god knows what.

Additionally, I have tried therapy (been to 3 different therapists before and had long-term relationships with each). 

I think some of it helped but I’ve been in therapy long enough to know that it’s not going to magically fix your life - it’s just talking to a professional about your stress for an hour and them helping you to brainstorm ways to fix your problems in your life. So because I have already been to therapy, I already know stuff that I can use to fix my life and am not sure how more therapy would exactly help as I think the issue is just I may not be trying hard enough to fix it myself. 

But it's just so hard to pick yourself up sometimes and force yourself to do shit.

At times, I’ve called the CAPS urgent services, and it was okay-ish...I know they tried their best since demand is high, and they did come up with ways for me to manage my anxiety, but it was admittedly not super helpful. 

Any advice, commiseration, or empathy would be appreciated.","I didn't do well on my midterms either. Try not to be so hard on yourself. I think part of why its so hard to pick ourselves up right now is because there's so much that is out of our control. So sure there are things that we might be able to do to make things better, but there is so much we're having to deal with, so much that we can't do. I think acknowledging that first would be a good step forward. 

We need to come to terms with everything first and then try and work our way around the issues. All our lives have been put on hold in one way or another.

Maybe try talking to classmates, slowly opening up about your experience. Form study groups and think of new ways to study.

Above all, don't bottle things up. Cry if you feel like crying, post if you feel like posting. You aren't alone.

&#x200B;

Life is hard. You keep trying because the alternative is worse. That's all there is to it. Don't compare yourself to others, but use their success as motivation. Do your best and make sure that you can say you gave it your all regardless of the outcome. Interviewing is a skill that can be learned, but you need the right feedback to get better. Good idea to practice with friends - but make sure they're giving honest feedback and not just being nice. It would be even better to somehow find an experienced manager you could practice with - maybe hit up an alumni for a coffee chat. Think of every real interview you do as necessary practice for the one interview (and eventually, dozens!) that you're going to ace. I have the social skills of a literal rock but apparently I interview well - so there's always hope."

As UC Berkeley steps into a new semester of academic exploration and social justice activism, we are deeply disappointed to know that the University of California at Berkeley is going to provide a platform for Zhang Jianmin 张建敏, the Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco to speak at the 2022 Berkeley China Summit on October 1, 2022. We are highly concerned that Zhang's presence at this well-intended summit to bring about bilateral communication and cooperation between China and the US will contribute to the whitewashing of crimes against humanity committed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). We urge you to sign this petition to urge the UC Berkeley community to boycott the Summit and stand against CCP.

The CCP, leading the Chinese government, has been notorious for serious violations of human rights, crackdowns on freedom of expression, religion, and press, and making aggressive neocolonialist advances in other countries. To be specific, throughout the years, they have committed to:

**1. Egregious violations of human rights against Tibetans and Uyghurs**  
**2. Mass political persecution and imprisonment in Hong Kong**  
**3. Mass arrests and abuses against human rights lawyers and activists in China**  
**4. Neocolonialist aggression toward other countries disguised as the “Belt and Road Initiative”**

Details can be found at the end of the letter, under Appendix.

The above are a few of the many examples of how the Chinese government has been violating human rights, limiting free speech, and imposing neocolonialist foreign expansion. Zhang Jianmin, Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco, is the representative of the tyrannical regime in the United States. 

UC Berkeley, a place where all individuals strive to uphold a just community in which discrimination and hate are not tolerated, somehow has committed to providing a venue for atrocious human rights offenders a space to spread their conspiracy to people unaware of these jarring crimes of the CCP, to pollute the freedom and civil liberties on campus and in the US, and to promote the ideals of an unjust, discriminatory, and intolerant world. His participation has brutally humiliated students and communities marginalized and oppressed by the CCP, and will undermine Berkeley both as an institution that upholds the values of democracy, justice, and academic freedom and as a space that should defend people against injustice.

Hence, we urge you to sign this petition to join us in the fight to boycott activities that falsely present China as a free and harmonious country. The business opportunities in China lay their foundation on the blood and tears of people who are wrongfully persecuted, imprisoned, and tortured to death. UC Berkeley ought not to grant human rights violators the media spectacle they desperately wanted, and instead mislead students and scholars who are unaware. 

We call for the UC Berkeley community to join us in standing up against injustice. Our demands are as follows:

**1. We urge everyone to refuse to attend the 2022 Berkeley China Summit in protest against CCP’s human rights abuses.**  
**2. We urge UC Berkeley to refuse to provide a venue for CCP members to speak on campus.**  
**3. We urge the facilitators and participators of The Berkeley China Summit to correct your mistake and join us in keeping our students and our campus safe by signing on to this call for a campus-wide boycott.**

***Appendix: What Crimes have the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Committed?***

***1. Egregious Violation of Human Rights against Tibetans and Uyghurs***   
*On August 31, 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner released the “Assessment of human rights concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the People’s Republic of China” \[8\], pointing out that the CCP arbitrarily detained Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic groups in a discriminatory manner in the name of “anti-terrorism” and combating ""extremism"", which may have resulted in committing “crimes against humanity”. Since 2017, the CCP has been illegally arresting and detaining Uyghurs, cutting off their communication channels, imposing forced labor, and even torturing them with beatings, brainwashing, and rape. These acts aimed to erase their identity and autonomy and have seen no sign of stopping.* 

*The 2021 Freedom House report listed Tibet and Syria as the least-free countries in the world. Reported abuses of human rights include intensive surveillance, restricting freedoms of religion and languages, arbitrary arrest, maltreatment in custody, and tortures \[6\]. Since 2009, 159 Tibetans have committed self-immolation in protest of the CCP’s repressive ruling \[7\]. The CCP has refused to respond to the world’s calls on returning the Tibetans to their deserved freedom and has only been tightening its grip on the autonomous region.*

***2. Mass Political Persecution and Imprisonment in Hong Kong***  
*In June 2019, Hong Kong people rose in solidarity against the CCP and its puppet Hong Kong government’s plan to pass the draconian Extradition Bill (Amendment), which will open up a channel to send political activists in Hong Kong back to the Mainland for closed and unjust trails. The people of Hong Kong took to the streets, only to be brutally suppressed by the Hong Kong Police Force, including mass arrests, unreasonable use of force, and numerous suspicious cases of suicide by protesters \[1\]. The Hong Kong government further retaliated by arbitrarily passing the Hong Kong National Security Law in 2020, destroying Hong Kong’s democracy and autonomy, and leaving acts of police brutality against democratic protestors unanswered. Within the past three years, more than 10,000 have been arrested in connection to activism and protest participation \[2\]. At least half of those arrested are under the age of 25, with the youngest being only 12. Under the National Security Law, activists are being targeted on baseless pretexts, and jailed, while others have been driven into exile \[3\].*

***3. Mass Arrests and Abuses against Human Right Lawyers and Activists in China***   
*In 2015, the “709 Crackdown” saw the arrest of around 300 Chinese activists and human rights lawyers. Having probed prison deaths, labor rights cases, and the mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners, these lawyers have faced closed-door trials and some were allegedly tortured \[5\]. As of now, all of them are incarcerated with no political rights, disbarred, or placed under severe surveillance. Some of them have already died in prison without clear accountability.*   


***4. Neocolonialist Aggression towards Other Countries Disguised as the “Belt and Road Initiative”***  
*Since 2017, President and CCP’s General Secretary Xi Jinping has pushed forward a so-called “win-win” strategy, namely “The Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), in the hope of setting up neo-colonies in vast pieces of land in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. By taking the role of a creditor, the CCP coerces other countries into building the infrastructure they do not need, and through controlling the construction corporations, the ridiculously massive projects ultimately benefit state-owned Chinese enterprises in the end. High-profile BRI projects have severely damaged many underdeveloped countries’ fragile economic systems because of overpricing and corruption and pushed many to the verge of bankruptcy, such as Sri Lanka, Khazakstan, Ethiopia, and many more.*

*In recent days, the CCP has presented growing interest in militarily annexing Taiwan, a self-governing country with the highest level of freedom and democracy in Asia. In August 2022, the CCP fired numerous missiles into the economic zones of Taiwan and Japan, unbelievably violating international law. The CCP’s aggression toward Taiwan is only the tip of the iceberg of its massive imperialist ambitions to take control of the Asia-Pacific region, and even the world.*

Isn’t open, honest, transparent, bilateral communication the best way to address these concerns? Doesn’t stopping speech just stop any potential progress?
Sadly I don't really see this working, few of the people in Berkeley (being mainly Asian-American too) can empathize with the people being oppressed by the CCP. You cannot simply boycott a whole event where it represents a country while participants probably aren't all associated with the CCP. IMO getting people to learn about the CCP is the first step and u gotta communicate to gain mainlanders' support as well. Maybe educate on the worse atrocities the CCP committed in the past decades.

Fuck China the CCP and Xi Jinping
Let people speak smh, if you don't like it, don't go, but don't act like you know best for others
If you really want to do something, how about doing something to change Berkeley into a safer place and solve the homeless problem?
The CCP represents a threat to humanity. But a boycott is just burying your head in the sand. 

The CCP sure knows Sun Tzu: ""If you know your enemy and yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every
victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy
nor yourself, you will succumb in EVERY BATTLE.

Go see what those fuckers have to say.
China watchers dumb as bricks as always. Silence Falun Gong cultist. You think the school who’s literal professor is John Yoo has a leg to stand on re human rights that’s fucking bullshit

Thanks for letting me know I’m gonna go now
I think you have noble intentions, but if your desire is to bring attention to human rights abuses and aggressive foreign policy, at least be consistent i.e. you should read up on the less publicized activities of our own government. 

We literally destroyed a country and destabilized an entire region on the pretense that Iraq had WMD's.  Guantanamo continues to quietly imprison and torture folks without trial. We still have undocumented Mexican kids who were forcefully separated from their parents and imprisoned at border camps where they have been sexually assaulted without consequence. You don’t hear much about that in the news these days, yet you still see people talk about a Uyghur genocide that didn’t happen (not that I’m suggesting their internment camps are much better, but there’s a reason media hasn’t corrected itself with the same visibility in which it accused China of genocide). China is just following their own version of the western imperialist playbook to attain geopolitical dominance in the same way US has.
Tbh I think it may not be such a bad thing to provide clarity and just knowledge overall. There's that one stupid quote about knowing thine enemy or some shit it's basically that lmao
Signed.
You think there is genocide in Uygur ethnic group. What is your evidence?    
Do you know the one-child policy doesn't apply to them and only applies to ethnic Han? Do you know they can get into Universities with a much lower score? Do you know the Uygur population increased from 3.6 million to 12 million from 1953 to 2022? I do not want to depict a rose pic for CCP, I don't agree its stupid zero covid policy. However, CCP leads an extreme poverty-stricken society, society being bullied by Westerners and Japan for centuries, to prosperity through hard work. CCP won the support of its people as a matter of fact. You want to change the regime. However, it will be a disaster for the Chinese people and the world, and most Chinese are against it.

  
I believe most of you have never been to China. Most students are open-minded, and China, particularly ethnic Han, is historical an agrarian society. They love peace. They don't want to create chaos in other countries.
?
Whoa, were none of you here for Milo? 

I only want to point out that your #2 demand is likely a non-starter. UC Berkeley is a governmental entity, and is required as such to operate within the legal constraints of the Constitution. In this case, the University counts as a public forum and cannot discriminate among guests that are sponsored by student groups, nor among those eligible groups that request event space.

As Supreme Leader Christ mentioned last time, the best response to offensive speech is more speech. To that end, I applaud you for posting and highlighting a timely conversation!
That is true in most cases when both sides listen to each other, but it does not apply to cases when it comes to autocrats. The international community has repeatedly spoken out against the Uyghur genocide and the massive arrests of human rights activists in China and Hong Kong. And what has the response from the Chinese government been?  I believe activists want open, honest, transparent, bilateral communication too but an autocratic government wouldn't give a shit. The call for a boycott is a way to raise awareness among people who are otherwise not aware of what is going on.
This attempt, even if it doesn't succeed in getting the event cancelled, is exactly ""getting people to learn about the CCP"". Look at how much educational material is in the post.

Me talking about democracy in China and then you bringing up homelessness in Berkeley is a little bit like me asking you to change a lightbulb, and you complaining about the sink leaking. Ok fine I’ll add fixing leaky sink to my to-to list, but you still haven’t fixed the lightbulb.
You can’t.
I think actions speak louder than words, and I don’t need to give a platform to a CCP official to know where the party stands when it comes to human rights, basic freedoms, and democracy. 

I’m curious whether you would, hypothetically speaking, hear Putin out and see what he has to say about the Ukraine war? Never in a million years would Berkeley invite Putin to speak at a US-Russia summit hosted on campus. And that’s the argument you’re applying to the CCP.
THIS WAS THE QUOTE I WAS THINKING OF
thank you for raising awareness about John Yoo someone who has served in many branches of government. i agree he has a very problematic history emblematic of many of the major issues with the USA.

thank you also for exercising your **freedom of speech** in the USA for criticizing him. i am glad you and your family won't be getting a knock on the door from the US government. enjoy your rights while you are here.
I don't see what's wrong with raising these points in response to a CCP linked event speaking at a local summit. Nothing these people stated is inconsistent with the atrocities the US commits. This post was made by members of the Hong Kong Affairs Association so of course they focus on issues pertaining to issues specific on that part of the geopolitical space. I am fully aware and also critical of many of the issues and abuses by the US government, but if you were boycotting a US Immigration Policy summit, I wouldn't counter by saying ""but what about China"" so hopefully you can see why your comments are unhelpful here.
Whataboutism is not helpful here. I will happily point out US issues at a US summit. We’re talking about China here so stop changing the subject
This is so riddled with inaccuracies i don’t even know where to begin. Suffice to say: I found the tankie in this thread. 

Where’s the evidence for genocide you ask? [Here](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1125932). The UN report details numerous human rights abuses. Let me remind you that genocide does not just include killing people of a specific racial or ethnic group. It also includes bodily or mental harm (re-education camps), imposing living conditions intended to cause harm (again, re-education camps), preventing birth (forced sterilization), and forcibly separating children. If you refuse to believe a UN published report then I have nothing more to say to you. 

You somehow brought in the topic of affirmative action in your argument about genocide. Not sure how to answer this complete non-sequitur other than to say it’s irrelevant. 

You somehow blame China’s poverty on Western powers and Japan while conveniently ignoring CCP’s disastrous Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward. Yes, the Western powers and Japan did cause widespread destruction and oppression, and yes, I am still waiting for accountability on their part, but let’s not discount how much CCP has shot themselves in the foot as well with their own stupid internal policies. 

To say that most Chinese are against regime change would be inaccurate. Don’t forget that Tiananmen Square happened a mere 30 years ago, and public sentiment against the regime continue to foment despite having no outlet. Just look at how much work it takes to maintain the Great Firewall. Chinese netizens routinely refer to June 4th as May 35th to circumvent censors. There is and always will be opposition to the current regime, and failure or unwillingness to acknowledge that would be a mistake.
If you won’t talk to anyone in the Chinese government, I guess you’re just trying to start a revolution in China? That’s a big ask, I think it’s better to focus on more realistic goals. Chinese officials aren’t immune from having their minds changed, it could be hard but it’s easier than overthrowing the Chinese government.
bruh, at least get your facts straight

Free speech is overrated as fuck
Whos john yoo if you dont mind me askin
>I wouldn't counter by saying ""but what about China"" so hopefully you can see why your comments are unhelpful here.

It wouldn't make sense to counter with that because we don't live on Chinese soil.  The point I'm making is that if bringing attention to human rights abuses and aggressive foreign policy is the *primary concern*, wouldn't it make more sense to apply these efforts domestically?  Even if this boycott is a 100% ""success"" and nobody shows up for the event - however unlikely that is - do you seriously think a tiny boycott across the sea would convince an authoritarian superpower to change their policy?  The officials who have the power to make those changes probably wouldn't even hear about it.  

On the other hand, bringing awareness to our own government's atrocities actually has potential for change as we have the privilege to mobilize citizens and vote for the desired change that can positively affect the people around us.  Last I checked, we have *plenty* of domestic issues to address that seem to have been forgotten or ignored - because riding the US propaganda train and pointing fingers at other countries feels good.
All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!

CCP officials who are invited to speak at the summit are not there to change their minds. They’re there to toe the party line and espouse party ideology. Ostracizing them, excluding them, and making it known to them that their words are unwelcome, would probably have a higher chance of changing their mind than letting them speak
Least out of touch redditor on r/berkeley
Same! I listened to Putin’s speech the other day declaring mobilization. You’re right, we need to know what a world-ending madman’s next moves are. 

But here’s the thing - they can give as many press conferences and televised speeches as they want, I don’t want them to speak at Berkeley and use Berkeley’s name to lend credibility to their words and ideology
Agreed absolutely
you're hilarious
Tldr: he was responsible for conjuring up legal gibberish out of thin air to justify war crimes, wiretapping, and torture during the War on Terror under the Bush administration. He’s now a professor at Berkeley
this awareness is initiated by the hong kong affairs association at berkeley , presumably with many (or majority) members from hong kong, and cosigned by many hong kong activists who, all of whom who are losing their rights to freedom of speech, promise of democracy, and losing the future of their hometowns to an authoritarian regime. they are lucky enough to find themselves at a university campus and in a country that allows them to speak up about their struggle. why do hong kong international students at berkeley have a moral obligation to prioritize US immigration policy?

if a group of russian students were protesting russian military aggression right now, i wouldn't tell them to first criticize US militarism (even though i highly oppose US militarism).

fyi, i actually am with you and am personally very critical of US imperialism, exploitative capitalism, conservative and neoliberal hypocrisy, etc. but your points on this thread, calling out hong kong students for mis-prioritizing issues, is strange.
Nice!
Seems like a not cool thing to do
I don't fault HK students for fighting for a democratic society in their home city.  But last I checked, this post is an attempt to mobilize *all* students and affiliates of berkeley.
So when people ask us for solidarity, we say no thanks because we have our own problems? They're literally asking people to sign a petition and not attend a conference, refusing to do so seems to be an even more active stance lol. I'm wondering which major human rights atrocities you're thinking of that have been solved entirely by the people being oppressed. This post is literally in the context of this specific event, and I'm sure there are numerous other posts on other issues in other contexts."

Need some advice from the lo-cals!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hku93/need_some_advice_from_the_locals/,2011-05-26 11:21:10,"Hey guys!

Heading down to UC berkeley for the summer programme. Arriving on June 20th (session C). Just wanted to ask you guys like how much do car rentals cost down there? Like I will be staying off campus. Is it worth renting a car there for 2 months? How much would it cost? What is my best solution? 

Also, if its not feasible (poor college kid =( ) to rent a car for the whole time, then what if I wanna rent a car for a week or sth. Any and all advice would be appreciated!

Cheers!

edit - Hey guys! Thanks for all the responses. Hm.. I checked out zipcar and it looks like a pretty cool service. My main reason for wanting a car I guess is to drive around during the weekends. Am visiting berkeley for 2 months and me and a couple of friends obviously wanna see as much of the US of A as possible (drives to nearby cities, attractions, etc.) We do plan to go to las vegas for a couple of weekends and such. So yup, was wondering what would be the best way to have a car for those purposes =] . Also, another main reason is that my gf might be coming down for a week long visit and I kinda wanted the freedom only for that week to drive to where-ever and do whatever. (las vegas, los angeles, the bay area etc.) Zip car kinda seems more expensive then normal rental services for anything past a daily rental. Hm...Not sure exactly what I was hoping for...Guess was hoping it was possible to rent a car from like a person who wont use it over the weekends or something. Is that normal/feasible down there?

Cheers for all the responses! Cant wait to visit!

P.S - We havent exactly decided on housing as of yet. However, I am very much inclined towards wesleyhouse or sth? Place seems pretty cool. =D","Definitely check out Zipcar if you need to drive, a rental for the whole time would definitely be expensive.

Also keep in mind parking sucks ass here
First off, welcome! Anyway, how far off campus will you be staying? Berkeley and the surrounding areas has pretty awesome public transport that gets you to campus, and far more cheaply than renting a car will cost. You'll probably need a car if you want to venture further than the East Bay, but you probably will not need one for the entire duration of your stay.

If public transport isn't your thing and you still want to rent a car, do note that parking can also be an issue. I'm not familiar with the parking situation in the summer, I know in the regular semesters it can be hard to find if you don't have a school-issued permit for the school lots.
just take the 51b. it goes any place worth going.
I grew up in Los Angeles, having a car in Berkeley may not be as practical as you think. It all depends on how close you are to campus, if your literally blocks away, parking may be a HUGE issue and you'll have access to very decent public transportation. You may want to consider getting a bike. There are many used bike shops and riding a bike around Berkeley during the summer is a WONDERFUL experience. Someone else already mentioned it, but if you really need a car, zipcar may be the way to go. 

But I am curious, why is having access to a car so important? If you really want to know rates you should loon on google maps for car rental shops and just do a search for rates during the dates you're interested in. Best of luck!
If you're planning on living that close to campus, DO NOT get a car. You're right in the middle of everything and there's nowhere to park. 

It would probably be cheaper take the train to LA/fly to Vegas than to pay for a car rental and gas. It's seriously a ten hour drive to Vegas. It's not even a nice drive, either. 
Your student ID is also a bus pass, so you can hop on any AC Transit bus for free the whole summer, including the one that takes you over the bay and into SF. Between that and the really reasonably priced BART trains, there is no reason to rent a car.
Bike and/or public transportation is all you really need. You can do both for a fraction of the price of renting a car. I live in deep Oakland and ride my bike or ride AC Transit without a car and couldn't imagine having to deal with parking in Berkeley.
For the longer trips, there are your typical car rental services like Enterprise that you can easily rent from. Also, if you're looking to explore the city or more local areas, then I would suggest using the BART unless you're really trying to go for a romantic night out or something. Taking the BART is definitely one of those must have experiences up here and it is actually pretty efficient and cheap.
I won't try to convince you not to get a car - others have done that.

If you absolutely MUST rent a car, and ZipCar / CityCarShare don't cut it, then be aware that Hertz gives a very good student rate.
From my experience parking really blows because so much of it is metered or for 1-2 hour increments, unless you have a residential pass. But parking tickets is a serious source of income for the city and if you forget about time, they'll give you a ticket...which always sucks. 
Yeah. There's really no point to have a car for such a short stay here unless you're staying really far away from campus, like outside of Berkeley.
... very slowly ...
It is such a good route, yet it is SO unreliable :(
Outside of Berkeley isn't even that far... do you know how close the campus is to Oakland? And tons of bus routes go through Oakland to Berkeley. Even barting to and from SF is only 7.30, cheaper than dealing w/a car for sure.
I was thinking anything outside of the nearby area. Some people still think 20-30 miles is still close and so they rent places in places locals would never do.

Staying within the BART area is workable as long as you don't need to get anywhere late at night after it closes."

Because it's board game cafe, not a cafe, and when they're busy, they want people there who are there for the games, not just the food or drinks. 

Whether that's a good decision or not, I dont know. But I assume it's the logic. Seems reasonable, like they're planning for high capacity and to create a certain ambiance. 

Having lots of people who are just there to, say, drink their beer or coffee and not play games would deviate from their purpose.

/u/that_pj
It doesn't sound like you'd get charged if you were getting stuff to go...
Ya wtf? What is the logic there?

I get that, but charging someone $5 extra just for going it would be weird. And why the hell am I getting downvoted?
Think of it thus way: the main event is the gaming. The food and drinks support that, but they let people drop in sometimes and buy that stuff without paying an entry fee so they can try it out, or just get something to drink or eat.

I didn't down vote you. :) 
> And why the hell am I getting downvoted?

Probably because a business is offering something new and cool to the community, and you're being reflexively negative.

If you don't like it, you can:

- Not go.

- Open a business yourself. It might be an education.

But don't carp about the price. $5 is not a lot of money to keep a business afloat around here.

Can I get free counseling/therapy on short notice (or also scheduled) without health insurance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/79nyna/can_i_get_free_counselingtherapy_on_short_notice/,2017-10-30 07:13:42,"I have no justification to my parents for why I’d be getting therapy, if they knew I was bi I’d be disowned. I’m already in a weird spot by them calling me out for a hospital bill when I was transported for slitting my wrist and my story didn’t add up monetarily, can’t risk using their insurance more. Plus, they don’t have money either and that bill already was $400 and broke the bank. 

If anyone knows some way I can get free counseling that won’t show up anywhere, please, tell me. It’s 7am right now and I type this on this throwaway account because I realize that it’s probably more likely that I kill myself in the next 24 hours than it is that I can flip flop my sleep schedule for me to wake up at 6am for an 8am 61c midterm when I sleep at 7am (hopefully) the night before, and that in this day of having to flip flop sleep, I somehow manage to catch up from being weeks behind in this class and succeed. I missed an essay due at midnight for cs195 bc I woke up at 2, stayed in bed til 5, railed adderall until my drug dependent brain was fed and distracted, ate breakfast at 6, sat in moffitt doing nothing til 11:15 and then tried to start the essay then. I then fucked around for the rest of the night and did nothing else, left moffitt at 4am, laid in bed for 3 hours thinking, and now am writing this post. 

I literally cannot work anymore, I can’t take this fucking school or the stress. I sell my adderall to afford food but then I can’t work because I don’t have my adderall. But hey I came out as bi last week, at least to the greek system here, so maybe I’ll have a shot at the “sucking dick for drug money” meme. 

I just need the stress to stop. I feel no motivation to do anything except to write, cause when I’m writing I just lose myself in the words and can get away from real feelings. All the time I did “nothing” at moffitt I was literally just writing, not writing for class, but just writing. I wrote a 20 page (6200 word) review for a show I saw earlier this month (hip hop group called brockhampton). The other day I had my friend find me two of the most meaningless lines from the most meaningless recent trap song he could find as a challenge to myself to write something absurd and then try to argue it, and I wrote a 3 chapter, 8700 word essay about the practice of analyzing music, the “truths” or accepted musical canon, and how to use literary philosophy and stuff from Kant and Freud to establish an explicit analytical framework for reviewing and analyzing music, and contrasted that with the implicit framework that is just accepted and used by all reviewers, and then finally after these chapters of preposition I finally analyzed two dumb lines to absurdity. 

The most frustrating thing about this is that I fucking missed the deadline for the essay due at midnight but then I still wrote it afterwards from 12-2 and finished it because it was about using moral philosophy and it’s components to analyze the morality of voting to do things like raising minimum wage which will make people lose their jobs and be replaced with automated solutions, and it was a really interesting paper, but late submissions weren’t accepted, so I submitted the paragraphs establishing this sort of ethical framework of analysis and then I just cut the paper before getting to any point and submitted it cause I ran out of time, then finished after, and it ended up really good, but went way over word limit. All of this is a good example of why I’m stressed and why I fucking hate this school right now — do I really learn more as a student here if I submit by 12 and not by 2? Is my paper really a failing paper if I double the word count? I understand there are limitations to how much they can grade but for people like me who can’t deal with the stress already, knowing that you have a lot to say and have to limit it to a tiny word count of 1000 at max is terrifying and kept me from even wanting to start. 

I don’t know where this love for writing is coming from because I’ve never had it before, but now that I have no will to live, all I want to do is write essays long-form. Word limits terrify me, I’m only interested in music and philosophy, CS sucks, this school sucks, and the only reason it’s not worth us all killing ourselves is because we’d hurt other people and deprive them from opportunity cost happiness, which is p ironic cause if everyone killed themselves then it’d work out anyways. 

I’m tired as shit so I rambled, sorry. The point is, I need help, desperately, and I don’t know what to do, but I’ll probably die if I don’t get it.

You've got a lot going on right now, but know that you don't have to take it on by yourself. You've got lots of options available to you and plenty of people who are willing to help.


First, I would ask that you make your way to the third floor of the Tang Center to visit [Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling). If you let the person at the desk there know that you're [currently having an emergency](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/emergency), they'll help you out.


[If, however, you feel as though you can't make it to the Tang Center, please call 911](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/prevention-education-outreach/suicide-prevention).

You can also give the [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) a call at 1-800-273-8255.

Your life matters. 


After that, know that the Tang Center offers [individual counseling](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/individual) to all students. The first five sessions are free, regardless of your insurance coverage, and students are allowed to make up to eight appointments a semester.


And when it comes to food, I might suggest checking out the [UC Berkeley Food Pantry](https://pantry.berkeley.edu/about/), located in the Student Union building. You can visit twice a month to receive food for up to 10 days.


In regards to your school work, I would consider getting in touch with your professors or GSIs and letting them know what's going on. They're people too, and if you explain what's going on, even just a bit, they'll understand. It might also be worth considering [taking a break](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/social-services/academic-adjustments-and-medical-withdrawals) from your studies. College, especially here at Berkeley, can be stressful for any number of reasons. I know that when I was going through a hard time, I found it easier to take a break from school so that I could figure out how best to take care of my own needs first.


I hope you get the help you need, and I hope you know that we're here for you if you need it.
I think Tang Center is best for emergency situations, but if that proves to be a problem for whatever reason, the engineering department has [their own personal counselor, Christine Zhou](http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising-counseling).

She's got walk-in hours, although I don't remember what they are now. If you walk through ESS into the hallway behind it, you'll see her office, and there are usually fliers with the times around it. I went to her a few times when I was at Berkeley; your mileage may vary, but it's another option open to you.

I'm at work right now, so can't comment too much - but feel free to message if you need someone to listen. Wish you the best, man. This place is stressful as hell, but I think you can get through it. :')
Every student has access to free counseling with our without SHIP.

https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/fees

> Students do not need to have purchased the Student Health Insurance Plan to see a counselor. Initial phone and in-person consultations, urgent visits, and initial counseling visits (up to 5th session) are all free. Minimal fees apply to other services.
Thank you, I appreciate the support. I’m gonna go in tomorrow, this helps a lot to hear.💞
Thank you for the kind words 💞

Other commenters said this too so I’ll check out the ability to cover my payment and if not you’re totally right, a discord server or something anonymous to vent might be the right choice, I think I only came here because I figure people here can know what it’s like to be a student here more than anywhere else, obviously. 

I super appreciate the offer to meet up, i think I’d be a little uncomfortable with that because of the precedent I’ve set for myself and everything but it’s incredibly kind of you to offer. My social life here is objectively quite fine; I’m next in line for social chair of social fraternity, and things look very fine from the surface, so I have people to talk to. Unfortunately it also makes the fact that I feel so alone something that’s hard to talk about, depression is a bitch and hard for other people to empathize with when it seems like it’s coming from nowhere. 

I emailed the professor so we’ll see how that goes. Hoping for the best. 

Also, yes, I’m considering picking up a double major in philosophy or something, just already feel like I’m pressed for time and don’t know if I necessarily want to add more to my plate. I really do feel passionate about CS, but this semester I’m not taking classes that have enjoyable work for me as I finish off all my lower divs. Hopefully it gets better!"
Please be nice to each other,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/isxuw3/please_be_nice_to_each_other/,2020-09-14 17:30:24,"As a recent alumni, the amount of vitrol that's being thrown around regarding the recent US News college rankings has been kind of surprising. The way some of you guys (and this goes for all the UC subreddits) have been talking about each other makes it seem like you're describing enemy combatants in a long and bloody war. Not only are these rankings (as many have pointed out) arbitrary, they claim to distill the complex apparatus that is a university and its student/faculty body ito a single number, which is an absurd idea.

To emphasize how silly this is, look at the US News rankings for the [best American vacations](https://travel.usnews.com/rankings/best-usa-vacations/) and the [best countries](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/overall-rankings). Would people here blindly agree that Australians should feel suddenly superior to Brits because they moved up a ranking past them this year or that everyone should visit the Grand Canyon instead of Maui because the Grand Canyon is ranked #1? Of course not! (Hopefully.) If people are able to see why it's silly to rank vacations in linear order, then they should be able to see why it's silly to rank colleges in linear order as well.

I have a good hunch that a lot of people here had been hoping that Berkeley would be ranked #1 (or UCSC be ranked above UCM, or whatever) so that they'd have an extra cohort of people to feel superior too. To which I say– please don't. If one of your goals in life is to try and find more things to be superior to other people to, then I'd suggest rapidly pivoting and finding another hobby because that is a surefire path to a life of jealousy and misery. Imagine running into some stranger (let's say, a Stanford student) who took every single opportunity to rub in that Stanford was a more selective school or that Stanford students are proven, on average, statistically superior to their UCLA and UC Berkeley counterparts. (For full disclosure, I am now a graduate student at Stanford, so feel free to pretend that I'm this character.) You'd hate that, right? What part of that would have made you like or appreciate Stanford any more– none, right? Given the chance– you'd instead want to try and put laxatives in their drinks, tar and feather them at the base of the Campanile, or (more likely) silently ignore them and make a note never to hang out with them in person again while writing off Stanford students as total dicks. I know people want to be proud of their school– but there's so many ways to be proud of the fact you went to X school (your alumni, campus, student body, school's achievements) without belittling students from Y school, or belittling Y school itself.

(Side note– I really don't think that Stanford offers much more than what Berkeley provides for its students. I'm beginning to think the two schools are basically the same, actually– *especially* in the Zoom-only online era.)

As a final note, you aren't your undergraduate university. This will become especially apparent for those of you who will later go into academia/pursue additional professional degrees, and end up bouncing around different universities as you continue your path in life. Our amazing DeNero, for example, was a Stanford undergraduate, and quite likely went to a few Big Games chanting ""Fear the Tree!"" before he saw the light and ended up at Cal. Andrew Fire, on the contrary, got his undergrad degree at Berkeley before he became renowned as a Nobel-prize winning Stanford genetics professor. Anantha P. Chandrakasan was a proud Golden Bear (he got his BS, MS, and PhD from Berkeley EECS!) before he went off and became the dean of engineering at MIT.

Now with all of that off my chest, all I wanna say now is– Go Bears!","Weirdest thing was when someone got extremely mad and then followed me for several posts, going on a downvoting spree, when I suggested that there are different cultures at Berkeley and LA, which cannot easily be captured by simple rankings.  


Crikey. Berkeley and UCLA are both good schools, and they have different strengths.  


Study on friends, no matter your university.
this could have been easily avoided if we used tier lists instead of rankings
I don’t think there’s any real tension from the us news ranking in this sub; we just like making half-hearted jokes about it, that’s all.

Weird bot...(?)"
course reviews (from a mostly humanities-based undergrad),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w89tt5/course_reviews_from_a_mostly_humanitiesbased/,2022-07-25 21:13:08,"hello, i’m quite bored at the moment so i thought i might write about all the classes i’ve taken so far and maybe it’ll be helpful for future reference.

just for some context, going into my freshman year (currently a rising sophomore) i was hoping to double major in art practice and architecture. so here’s my experiences so far :)

ENVDES 1 (intro to environmental design):
wasn’t really sure what to expect with this class. took it bc of the lower division pre-reqs for ced (college of environmental design). discussions and assignments were pretty heavy on observation drawings although they claimed that drawing skill was not necessarily being judged. lots of talk about things like “what is space? what are places?” way more theoretical than i expected. a couple of group/partner assignments. expect a lot of readings too. was quite a lot for a 3 unit class to be honest.

ART 15 (ceramics foundations)
one of my favorite classes ever. if you’re an underclass man trying to take studio classes go email the professors individually or raty (the art advisor) and they can possibly get you on the waitlist. that is how i luckily got in during my first semester. prof was super nice (emma logan) so sweet. you can tell she cared a lot about encouraging her students to grasp new skills and put creative ideas into reality. she was always willing to answer any questions and was super understanding and compassionate in general. i’d never had any experience in ceramics either but as long as you put some effort you’ll get an A.

LY C70 ? or EPS 20( earthquakes in your backyard)
forgot the actual class code, but took this for l&s physical breadth. probably one of the easiest A’s i’ve ever taken too. highly recommend if you’re looking for an easy breadth. i took this course entirely asynchronously but i feel like it would be just as easy in person. quizzes were very direct and correspondent with lectures and i learned a lot so i appreciated that class.

FILIPINO 1A & 1B (intro tagalog)
took this for fun + i needed extra units. does not feel like 5 units at all. easy A as well and i can proudly translate/speak basic sentences now lol. love the prof with my whole heart (tita joi) she is super understanding and accommodating to students’ needs. also took these classes fully online but i feel like the energy and participation would be much better in person.

PHILOS 12A (intro to logic)
took this for philosophical breadth bc i thought it would be interesting but kind of kicked my ass. to be fair, i was lacking attendance a lot so it was hard for me to catch up but everything was just generally confusing to me. very math-based and proof heavy which i was not prepared for in a philosophy class. professor (holliday) was great but i was honestly just hoping for an easy class. took it p/np and thankfully passed but there was some crazy curve on the final.

ENVDES 5 (cities & sites)
i believe this was the first year this class was offered. had two professors (castillo & hood). lectures were pretty interesting but readings were also quite heavy. they claim to take the reading load back a few notches for future classes but i have no idea how that’ll play out. no studio drawings or observations like ED1 but there was no final. your whole grade is based on pop quizzes and 2 projects which is a little scary. but the project prompts were pretty fun imo (coming from an art major). not too sure if it was just as enjoyable for people who are not a big fan of drawing.

HISTART R1B (art history r1b)
your average writing class. i feel like for the art history department the topics are super niche so it’s kind of a wild card as to which gsi you get. but i think it was a nice break from the rest of my classes. grading methods were a little questionable and they claim participation is a huge part of class but i’m a quiet person and still got an A. 

ARCH 98BC (architecture berkeley connect)
took this out of interest for the architecture major. was actually quite fun and nice to talk to to other people thinking about switching majors. got a very cool tour of wurster through the studios and even to room 1000. very helpful q&a’s from alumni, staff, directors, etc. def recommend if you’re on the fence about architecture.

hope this helped someone and my pm’s are open for any other questions :)","lol you took logic thinking it was easy

As a philosophy major, thanks for the laugh.
ENV DES 1 is a really fascinating class conceptually but it definitely isn’t worth taking unless you need it for a CED major because it’s just a huge weekly commitment and the course staff can be extremely hit or miss. Some of my interactions with the GSIs were pleasant but the lecturer (Nathan John) was frankly insufferable and made the course way harder than any intro class should be.
I love that u made this list thank you ur so generous!:)
I KNOW i was walking into a trap. had a 46 in the class at some point lol. can’t imagine being forced to take it for letter grade
Agreed - depending on the lecturer and on your GSI, ENV DES 1 can be a completely different extra every semester. 

Quality of lectures for CED undergrad can vary drastically - I felt like they keep a lot of the good faculty for mostly grad programs. ENV DES 4 typically has good faculty teaching it though - and it's nice you got to take a class with Walter Hood! He's fun
I can't talk too much shit. My dumb ass took it in the *summer*."
Co-authorship Opportunity | Quantitative Social Science Paper | Python/Pandas,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gnumg3/coauthorship_opportunity_quantitative_social/,2020-05-21 03:48:26,"# What The Research Project is About

* This is a paper based on a natural experiment, in which a group of office workers were moved between locations and had randomly assigned seating.
* Meanwhile a control group in the same organization did not move or get re-arranged during the same period.
* The paper is about the idea that some people are just 'sharers' who tend to broadcast help and advice to anyone who will listen, while others are 'seekers' who are mainly interested in finding out stuff to get their work done. Most people are neither of these, of course.
* The research literature on knowledge-sharing at work seems to have ignored these kinds of personality-based differences, even though they're probably very important for designing effective organizations; ones where information flows throughout the organization.

# What would you get if you join the project?

* Co-authorship on the paper (2nd author). Huge boost for grad school applications and a nice resume item in general. The aim is eventually to publish it in a top-tier journal in Organization Theory.
* Direct research mentorship throughout the project, intensive help/advice on all aspects of your work.
* Potential for a recommendation letter for grad school/jobs.
* If relevant: help and advice for the grad school application process (cover letters, statement of purpose, GRE, etc).
* To express interest: fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/ejoBaQiBHQXRiEzu9) and I'll reach out for an initial chat about the project :)

# Who's Running the Project?

* I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business.
* Academic website here: cummins-orgs.github.io.
* Questions about me? Feel free to message on Reddit.

# Why advertise for this role?

* I'm stretched between 6 different projects right now.
* Currently this paper is number 6, so it is on the back-burner. All the data is collected and ready to go and I already got the first draft accepted into a conference. With your help it can be resurrected in time for the deadline (late June)!
* I'm experimenting with openly advertising this opportunity since I think anyone with the right data skills can do it.

# What would you contribute?

* The contribution needed is suitable for an undergraduate with some data wrangling skills in Python/Pandas and an interest in network analysis. The whole project so far is inside of the Python ecosystem, R users need not apply ;P
* What you would do: finish and check over the data cleaning done so far; cut the data to test the main hypotheses; run network analyses and some simple statistical models; produce output suitable for inclusion in a (LaTeX) research paper. Scope to contribute to writing/theory as well, but that's not essential.
* This is not a paid role, so there's no expectation that it would be your main focus. However it does need to be mostly done by June 20th.","Interested

My (a freshman's) highly-subjective ranking of the few UCB libraries I've visited,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16vh8zw/my_a_freshmans_highlysubjective_ranking_of_the/,2023-09-29 10:08:35,"Note: This ranking is highly subjective, and they reflect my first impressions. I have not explored a lot of these libraries in much depth, so much of my opinions might be misinformed.

Note: I use ""desks"" and ""tables"" interchangeably.  I'm sorry.

Honorable Mention: Free book collection on floor 2 of the Social Sciences building: No desks/chairs, but it's a nice open space. Open when most other spots are closed, which is nice.

15. Physics/Astro Library: Big tables, and hours aren't that bad, but it doesn't have any books. It feels sad. :(

14. French Library (""Library of French Thought""): Pretty terrible hours (10-1 Mo/We, 12-4 Tu/Th), has a decent amount of books and a nontrivial amount of books that are in English (they are about France). Good big tables, though it's a really small library so not that many of them. There's some stacks that only people who are taking French 4 or higher can browse, but I don't hold that against them in this case because those would be the only folks who'd want to see those books since they're probably in difficult-to-understand French. It's in Dwinelle on floor D, so that's a big plus, though as study spaces in Dwinelle go I prefer the Common Grounds formerly-a-cafe because of actually dependable hours and capacity (the French library has very few tables).

13. Doe Library (minus the parts which have separate hours): Hours are good; closed Saturdays and opens late on Sundays though. (though this is a thing with most libraries). Pretty bad book density, so not that interesting to lurk, wide hallways and the aesthetic exacerbate this, makes it feel ""empty"" or ""soulless"" in a way. A lot of the hallways feel like the backrooms and the layout's confusing and nontrivial. There are bathrooms but they aren't that nice and they're nontrivial to find (no big blue signs saying ""restroom"" and very few maps on walls (this also makes it difficult to find other things). Even though there's signs pointing to stuff, they're few and far between, so you could easily make a wrong turn before the next sign. It took me at *least* a half-hour to find the Bancroft library for my first time. And being lost isn't that fun because there aren't just random books around you everywhere. Whoever said Dwinelle was a ""freshman maze"" hasn't been to Doe Library.  Heyns's not a bad place to study. North would be cool but they don't let us go inside to preserve its ""historic character"" (and so we can only look through the doorway). I guess we all have different priorities Note that this categorization is kinda unfair to Doe because this entry is basically ""Doe minus all the good parts"" and the good parts all come separately.

13. Moffitt: One of the best hours around (Open on Saturdays!!!), first and fifth floors are pretty nice study spaces but get packed. Lots of natural light on 4th and 5th floor. 1st floor has nice aesthetic too, (the wood-y walls are pretty!) Floors 4-5 crowded in general, lots more couches than desks and most of the stuff are in reservable rooms so imo not that easy to find study space on those floors. Why are there couches if there's no books to read on the couches? Oh, what James Moffitt would think after the book collection named after him (see 3rd floor plaque) has dwindled down to two dictionaries and a 15-or-so-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica. (I do not count the books in moffitt circ because those books have a home somewhere else, and you can't browse them from Moffitt.)

12. Bancroft: Bancroft's weird. It has a lot of cool materials but there's a big process in order to get to use them. It isn't as bad as it looks. You look at an item on the library catalogue, you sign up for the portal, and then you request it. What I hold against Bancroft is that the language it uses feels ""gatekeepy."" Users of the library should be ""researchers."" If you're making an account for the item-request portal, it asks for your purpose of research, and there is no option that says ""personal interest"" or anything of the like. Note: I asked the staff about this and they didn't seem to care if I'm an actual researcher; I think they said to lie and pick ""research paper"" for the ""purpose of research"" thing. Looks like nobody actually checks that a research paper comes out. Hope they could change that though. There's a lot of really cool historic stuff that you can request though. You can't borrow them though (they're usually rare stuff, so that's prob for good reason), and you can bring very few stuff in (which is annoying, especially if your backpack doesn't fit in the lockers and/or if you just want to browse stuff in the reading room (a collection of reference books that you don't have to request). They have immaculate bathrooms though.

11. Institute of Government Studies Library: Hours aren't that bad, reading room has quite a lot of tables, they're the small round desks though, so not as good if you have a lot of stuff to lay on the desk. Reading room has some periodicals and cool books, probably really cool to reference. Most of their stacks are closed though, they're only open when circ staff are working, which is only in the afternoons.

10. Hass Library: I haven't explored this one much, especially not the actual materials, so its ranking is kinda nebulous. It's a quite pretty space, which is nice. Hours are really good (open Sunday mornings!!), lots of tables to study. In the Hass school of business so kinda out of the way.

9. Ethnic Studies Library: Hours aren't that bad, Right next to Institute of Government Studies library but it has open stacks which you could just browse so it goes on top. Doesn't have that many trash cans though.

8. College of Environmental Design library: Pretty big library; lots of tables but they're usually all packed. Hours are decent, there's some pretty cool folios and double folios, stacks are browsable and pretty awesome as well. Library's quite pretty, it feels like there's lots of light, not sure why. Hours aren't bad, opening at 9 a.m. is nice.

7. Newspapers and Microforms room: It's a really big room, idk what's up with that, but it's kinda cool. There's rows upon rows of documents and laws and newspapers and stuff all preserved onto microfilm and you could just take them out and view them on a reader. I'm not much of a history person. If I were, this would be higher. Horrible hours though: Weekdays 1-4 p.m. 

6. Evans library: Lots of natural lighting, good hours, in Evans Hall (I spend a lot of time there; I can't really understand what's in the shelves (with a few exceptions) because they're really advanced math stuff. It's really nice being there at the carrells by the window when the sun sets and the light starts turning orange. Currently holds the physics/astro collection.

5. Morrisson Library: Pretty unique because it's a ""no laptop space,"" which I like a lot because I could actually get some reading done for once. I treat it as an electronics-free space, which makes it even better. Lots of cool fiction there, I haven't browsed it much so I'm not sure how browsable it is. Furniture's comfortable. Good for reading. Aesthetic's nice too. Hours aren't bad (opening at 10 is nice) but not that good either (closing at 4 isn't that good)

4. East Asian Library: In my opinion the prettiest library on campus. I don't understand any East Asian languages, so I'm not sure how much I'd use it, but it's a really nice space, lots of light and stuff. Lots of greenery to its north as well!

3. VLSB library: Relatively big library, spacious, lots of shelves, lots of accessible and interesting texts, quite a few tables (usually there's a spot open), a couple couches, lots of light, nice reference material near the front -- useful for a lot of things, and some of them are just interesting, like the one about cool maps. Good hours too, closes at NINE!

2. Main (Gardner) Stacks: Glorious collection of inconcievably-many books. It has the most specific stuff, there's books that are the censuses of a particular year, or the results of a particular conference, or an overview of a really niche combination of subjects, or something else entirely, and then there's the triple and double folios. Just so many awesome books everywhere. It's so fun to just lurk around and see what sort of books are around the corner! Downside: The fiction section isn't shelved in the most browser-friendly manner. It's organized in the library of congress system so it's by author's name more than genre or anything. If you want to visit on a saturday or a morning and you're not a UCB student, it's kinda annoying because you'd need to fill up the form a long time beforehand. Hours are VERY good; if they weren't good I'd be concerned. It feels like it has the soul of a hundred libraries, though a lot of the libraries which feel soulless (and bookless) have had their souls sucked into here and idk whether that's a good thing or not.

1. Earth Science and Map Library. This place is really nice to poke around in, there's drawers full of maps; all sorts, from topos to aerial photos, to road maps, to geologic maps, to bus system maps, and a lot more stuff I haven't seen yet. There's also microfilms of the Sanborn maps, which are these really detailed ""fire insurance maps"" which give you really detailed snapshots of how a city was like in the 20th century. (really detailed building maps with building purposes) The organization might be a little intimidating, but the staff are really friendly and will help you out! I just really like maps! Hours aren't that good though, 11-5 isn't ideal, and I feel like it isn't the best of a study space (in my opinion), but that's probably just because its materials are so cool!!

That was a prime study spot when I was a student
Hell yeah go EPS! 🌎
Former grad student here; graduated some time ago. This post made me feel nostalgic. However, back in my day, students had access to more spaces. Some libraries have been cannibalized for office space since I graduated. 

My favorite spot in Doe was a massive, high-ceiling reading room with lots of natural light and crazy acoustics (first floor, next to Morrison so easy to find too). Some used to call it the chamber since it could pack hundreds of students. I still see it on some Berkeley-related emails, but someone told me the space is closed to students now. Can someone confirm? Here is the picture, by the way, [https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/visit/doe](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/visit/doe)
the best place to study is actually the OCF
Bro what are you on? Doe north reading room is the most popular study spot besides moffitt. that sign is just for tour groups. And it literally is just shaped like a U,the only floors you'll really need to be on are 1 and 2. just don't bring food or drinks cause of the old books and shit you're surrounded by (and nobody wants to hear nasty ass chewing)
First: thanks! Very glad to see a student (particularly a freshperson) exploring the campus so thoroughly. Lots of insightful comments. Keep exploring, and sharing your thoughts.

Second: same question as Sean0323, wait, what! the North Reading Room at Doe is closed (???) You can only look in?

Third: some responses to some of your commentary:

\- The *Library of French Thought* was a gift to the University in World War I. The French government put together comprehensive book collections documenting the intellectual history of France and sent them abroad, in part because there was legitimate fear that Germany would overrun France and submerge / obliterate French culture. But now, well over a century after that fraught moment, it's still a good artifact of a big part of western intellectual history.

\- *Newspaper / Microfilm* room is so large (and tall) because it occupies the shell where the Main Stacks once stood. In that volume there were hundreds of thousands of books on several levels of really tight / narrow book stacks with glass block floors, that were entered from the Heyns Room. Little metal staircases everywhere, and study desks that grad students could reserve tucked in amongst the books. When the current Main Stacks were built, all the books were moved to it, and the old stacks demolished, leaving Doe with a big, hollow, core. 

Going back even further on the Main Stack history--before Doe was built, college and university libraries (and most big public libraries) had separate rooms / buildings for separate collections. Berkeley did have the Bacon Library, which was one space, but it was also thematically divided up. So people naturally thought, oh, English literature, that should have a room of its own next to the English Department offices. The design of Doe pioneered a new concept--put ALL (or almost all) of the books in one unified collection / storage area, with one staff. The alternative would have been a library building the same size, but filled with separate, self-contained, rooms each with its own specialized collection. Doe was the forerunner of huge central university libraries like this all over the United States. So your impression of the *""soul of a hundred libraries sucked in here...""* is more true than you might have imagined. (Also, many faculty, alumni, and private collectors over the past 150 years have given their private book collections to the University, and many of those books have ended up in the Main Stacks. So when you're browsing, take a look at the book plates / inscriptions on the title pages or inside front covers. You'll find ghostly pieces of literary history there.)

\- *Morrison Library:* specifically built and operated as a recreational / relaxation library for students. Not intended for studying, but as more of a restful space for students, and designed to be like the library of a big, private, home. Hence the design, comfortable chairs, couches, lamps, artwork. You should check out the monthly lunchtime poetry readings there, as well. 

\- Bancroft Library: was indeed specifically created for research purposes. And so many of the materials are so fragile--quite a lot of them are unique--that the library doesn't want people handling them directly unless there's a very specific purpose, like it's someone's handwritten journal and the researcher is writing a book on that person.  The Bancroft has some interesting sub collections--like the University Archives, which is the official repository of campus and Office of the President records. Take a look at their website sometime, for all the special collections they house--going back to Egyptian papyrus scrolls, and ancient European maps / books. Also, a lot of the things held in the Bancroft collections are stored at the Northern Regional Library (see below) so the process of calling things up and bringing them to campus does need advance notice.

*- Confusion getting around Doe / Bancroft.* Doe was built first, starting in the 1910s. It had a pretty coherent design and layout--basically a huge, hollow, square. It was built in stages, though. Bancroft built next, in the 1940s or 50s, and was attached to Doe, but operated as a separate building. The only entrance to the Bancroft Library was from the Campanile side--you couldn't go from Bancroft to Doe without going up and down obscure staircases (worse than today, I'm told). When the Bancroft was completely gutted and renovated several years ago, it was intentionally connected to Doe by that cross-corridor with the display cases in it. But the Bancroft Library access still feels obscure--you walk through that corridor, and you sort of have to know in advance that the student sitting at that desk on the south side is the face of the gateway to the Reading Room upstairs. 

I do agree it would be nice if you could go in and browse through the collections in the outer area (yearbooks, campus directories, etc) without the whole sign-in / bag-check process, though.  

Should add to your list to explore: **northern regional library** at the Richmond Field Station. You take a shuttle bus out there. A lot of campus collections have their overflow stored there. Every several years the University builds another extension to that building. It also, I think, serves the Davis and Santa Cruz campuses as well (thus, ""regional"" in the title). **Berkeley Public Library** (an impressive Central Library in Downtown Berkeley at Kittredge and Shattuck, and four branches elsewhere in the city). Anyone can get a library card there, you don't have to be a Berkeley resident. **Graduate Theological Union Library** on Ridge Road, a block north of the campus. The GTU is a consortium of most of the religious schools in Berkeley. They originally had their separate libraries, but in the 70s they agreed to build one unified library, and put all their research / reference collections there. Interesting building, and remarkable collections. Not sure about current UC student access, though, but check out their website.
There are specific libraries you can’t get in as a freshman (like the law library), that said, best of luck
Update for everyone: the north reading room is very much open to students
The Philosophy Library is great.
Ranking Doe so low is a travesty 😔😔
Kresge was the goated library, I'm sad I won't get to visit it for another couple of years
i will not tolerate this moffitt slander smh
yeah classics art history is sadly grad only, I went in there this morning and they treated me like some undergrad plebeian who couldn’t comprehend classics ( I just wanted a place to study)
also how do you get to the maps library I legit can’t find it
Definitely check out the music library. It’s a very nice vibe inside. And I used the chemistry library a lot — felt productive in there.
I need to go to more libraries 🫣
There's a sign at every doorway to it that says something along the lines of ""Visitors, please just watch from the doorway"" or something like that. Always see a couple folks studying in there though so I'm guessing it's not really enforced

The one in the picture is the north reading room. Above Morrison. From reading the other comments it is still open to students for studying, but visitors looking around the Library are apparently asked not to go in and bother the users.
>the library doesn't want people handling them directly unless there's a very specific purpose

hmm that's interesting. The staff over there seemed like they wanted people to look at materials there if they so interested them, or at least that's what they seemed like to me. (because tbf they could've shut me down at any point, but they didn't and seemed to encourage it). They did bring out a lot of materials to make sure the book stays intact though.

&#x200B;

What do you mean by this?

>Newspaper / Microfilm room is so large (and tall) because it occupies the shell where the Main Stacks once stood. In that volume there were hundreds of thousands of books on several levels of really tight / narrow book stacks with glass block floors, that were entered from the Heyns Room

Whoa, that's really cool! I didn't realize so many books would fit into such a (comparatively) small space! 

&#x200B;

>You should check out the monthly lunchtime poetry readings there, as well.

I didn't realize this was a thing! I'll check it out if it aligns with my timing! Why has Morrisson become a no-laptop-space? Is there a story behind that?

&#x200B;

Every several years the University builds another extension to that building. It also, I think, serves the Davis and Santa Cruz campuses as well (thus, ""regional"" in the title). 

The Bear Transit's RFS line's been discontinued, so now it's a transfer to the 71 and then a 0.9 minute walk. I still should make the trek out AT LEAST a few times; it seems like a really cool place and its holdings seem VAST. Is it like Bancroft where you need to make a reservation in advance to look at any of their materials? 

&#x200B;

>Berkeley Public Library (an impressive Central Library in Downtown Berkeley at Kittredge and Shattuck, and four branches elsewhere in the city). 

I need to pay a visit! Public libraries are really awesome! I went to the main Oakland library a month or so ago and there was a big history section and they had these huge books of maps (I think they were ""Sanborn maps"" or something) which had super-detailed renditions of Oakland in the time when the maps were created, which was something I found really cool.

&#x200B;

Additional question: Are any of the other Dwinelle libraries besides the French one open to undergrads/have hours when we could visit?
>like the law library

Wait really? I thought that was an open library :(
Glad to hear it!
I'll be sure to take a look when it opens!
This is probably the case. I ranked it minus the sub-rooms which have actual hours, so that was a bit unfair against it, since the sub-rooms are the parts that have the most ""soul"" out of them. 

I still feel like Doe feels ""empty."" A lot of the hallways feel wide and like a museum except without any exhibits, which feels weird. And the other non-wide hallways (like the one outside the newspaper-microform room). I feel like stair positioning might be what makes navigating the place feel unintuitive. I'll be sure to take a look at North though, see if that changes my mind.

So you could see how a lot of this comes from my subjective opinions.

You should make your own ranking!! I'd love to see your opinions on these places!
And I will not tolerate Moffitt having couches but no books to read them on; very few desks that'd be a study space that aren't in reservable rooms (except floor 1, floor 1's good study space; lots of desks)

On a more serious note, I feel like the main reason I don't like moffitt is because I've not yet needed what it's good at (group-study, and whatever the main parts of 4 and 5 are for (I honestly don't know, maybe on-ground study space, studying that doesn't involve writing stuff? idk, there's prob something or else not that many folks would use moffitt)). Another thing I like about moffitt is that they loan laptop chargers, which is something I needed once.

You should make your own ranking, O red-shouldered hawk! I'd love to see what priorities you have!
It’s weird when you have a class in there and they treat you like you are some fuckwit rando who’s not allowed to be there. Like can I pls just get to my section? 🥲
It's in the ground floor of  McCone Hall.  If you enter by the sabertooth tiger statue, just go straight ahead, past the elevator and you're there.  
If you enter on the upper entry level (floor 1), take the elevator or stairs down to the ground floor.
You should!
That sign is for tourists to not go in and disturb students studying as the library is open to the public. You can definitely go in and study there, you’re not a visitor.
Quick answers. 

**Morrison Library** was specifically built and operated so it wouldn't be a ""study library"".  People are supposed to go in there and read recreationally, or relax, or just enjoy themselves, not spread out class materials and study. I assume the ban on laptops is probably the latest iteration of that policy. 

I actually haven't been to the Richmond regional library for a while, so I don't know what their reading policies are. Check their website, though, it should say. Probably they do appreciate an inquiry in advance so they can get things ready.

**Bookplates.** So, since the 1700s at least--especially back when when printed books were rare / expensive--many people would personalize them with a bookplate. Which is basically a paper card with the name of the owner, and often something like a drawing or a motto or favorite saying. Many became very elaborate. These would be glued inside the front cover of the book, so it could always be identified as belonging to that person's collection. A personalized bookplate would have the owner's name printed as part of the design. But you could also buy generic bookplates with an empty box or space to write in your name.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex\_Libris\_(bookplate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Libris_(bookplate))

When people died, or gave their libraries away, the bookplates would typically remain in the books since they were glued in place. A lot of personal libraries were given to UC by alumni, rich donors, or faculty so scattered throughout the library collections you'll find books with bookplates. So I was just suggesting that if you're looking at an older book in the Stacks, or elsewhere, also look at the inside front cover and see if it has a bookplate that would give a clue as to where it came from.  The UC Library itself also once used to use bookplates with the UC seal: See: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Book\_plate,\_University\_of\_California,\_MDCCCLXVIII\_%281868%29,\_FIAT\_LUX,\_Ex\_Libris,\_BHL23731638\_%28cropped%29.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Book_plate,_University_of_California,_MDCCCLXVIII_%281868%29,_FIAT_LUX,_Ex_Libris,_BHL23731638_%28cropped%29.jpg)

Bookplates often include the Latin phrase, ""Ex Libris"", meaning *""from the library of...""* or *""a book belonging to...""*

Having bookplates also helped if you loaned someone a book and they ""forgot"" to return it. The bookplate would be evidence that it was your book when you visited their home and found it. :-) 

On the Bancroft yes, definitely the staff want people to use the materials. But since so many of the items are fragile or one of a kind, they do have a lot of rules for use on some things (cotton gloves, etc.). I didn't mean to say they didn't want people to research there, they do, but they are hyper focused on everything being preserved.

I don't know about other Dwinelle libraries, unfortunately.
Yeah I did what you’re doing rn during freshman year, and although I will not spoil anything, it’s good to know before hand prior to walking from one end of the camps to another.
found it, thanks friend
>you’re not a visitor

What am I, if not a visitor everywhere I go?
>That sign is for tourists to not go in and disturb students studying as the library is open to the public. 

This is weird. I visited the North Reading room recently and it had a decently-big part of the Doe Reference collection, which contains the USA statute (or something like that, some many-volume books of laws) and a lot of US censuses, which are government information. UCB's library system is a Federal Depository library, which I'm assuming means that the texts *must* be available to the general public in some capacity (this assumption is based on the thing on their website that says ""Note: While unaccompanied minors are not allowed in the MAIN Stacks, arrangements will be made for persons under age 18 to access the U.S. documents collection."" so I feel like they take it seriously).

What is going on with this apparent conflict?
How do you like it?
Yay, glad to help!
You are part of the campus community, my friend, be it Student, Faculty or Staff member, rather than a visitor.  Use the Doe North Reading Room at will!
That sign is just a politely worded request to not disturb the students studying. I don’t think it’s enforced at all and if you are going into to actually browse the collection, I don’t think anyone would have a problem. I imagine it’s because the room is very echoey with the high ceilings and if there were crowds of tourists coming in and taking photos, it’d be unusable as an actual library.

That being said, the general public can also just get a library card for a small fee and have access to all of UC Berkeley’s collection (including libraries like Main Stacks that are normally closed to the public) and even check out books.
wonderful. a bit small and not the greatest study spot but I love the books
Are you doing the same quest of trying to visit as many libraries as possible?
absolutely
Glad there's another one! Do you know anything about whether any of the other Dwinelle libraries are accessible or whether they're department/grad only?

or do they just have atrocious hours?
The dwinelle libraries have always been a mystery to me, I always just assumed they were faculty offices. Is there like an actual library in dwinelle? I looked once but couldn’t find anything
late response but the french library has open hours

and someone let me into the slavic library and showed me around once because I was staring into the window at the map (they use a card catalogue!)"

P/NP EE16B for grad school?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jroq31/pnp_ee16b_for_grad_school/,2020-11-10 09:02:34,"Would it be bad for me to P/NP EE16B for grad school? I want to get a master's, but definitely not in electrical engineering, but maybe CS.","A strong linear algebra background is important however you could do classes like EE 127 and trump it. Shouldn't be too bad given that it's a lower div but it'd be much better if you asked admissions directly. Tbh what matters more for CS grad school is research/teaching, your grades have less weightage compared to that. As long as its one class and you do well (atleast B+/A-) you should be fine. The typical IQR for top grad schools is I think 3.4-3.6. Perhaps a little different. Ciao.
If you are so afraid of pnping classes, I would recommend just letter grades everything
there is absolutely no way the IQR for top cs grad schools is that low
I've taken Math 110/Math 221, is that good enough?
CS grad schools are less ""grade-based"" than law school/med school. I havent looked up these numbers but this is what I've heard from PhDs and I take their word for it, the average GPA for masters is 3.5, PhD is usually 3.6. Its difficult to find grad school stats anyhow. The key factor is research. The major GPA is often that low because a lot of the applicants go on to take difficult grad courses or advanced upper divs early on.  Anyhow, this is quite variant due to the fact that GPAs don't have that high a weightage. But you can always expect the average for a top 30 to be between 3.5-3.7
Damn, you serious? Thats more than good enough lol. EE 16B aint shid compared to that. Also, how difficult is it to get into a grad math class as an undergrad? I'm interested in Math 221 after 128B
Top cs grad programs are ridiculously competitive these days. Yes, research is a lot more important than grades, but 

1) I’d imagine at those margins, having the full package matters.

2) you need a pretty high gpa to research with strong faculty at cal. (And researching with someone who a) publishes a lot and b) whose rec letter holds a lot of weight definitely matters. 

3) because you don’t really need grad school to make a living in cs, I’d imagine grad school self-selects for people who are “good at school.” Most of those people probably have high GPAs. 

Anecdotally, everyone I know who’s serious about grad school has at least a 3.7, most are at 3.9+.
Pretty easy actually, depends on the class. You have to fill out a google form released by the math department, and sometimes you’ll need to email a prof for permission, but a fair amount don’t require it. Usually if it’s for permission, they just wanna make sure you have the pre reqs or can do the class, as well as space constraints.
Alright I just took a look at the website [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~jrs/apply.html#:\~:text=A%3A%20About%209%25%20of%20applicants,best%2C%20most%20intellectually%20exciting%20students](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/apply.html#:~:text=A%3A%20About%209%25%20of%20applicants,best%2C%20most%20intellectually%20exciting%20students).

I severely misread it oh gosh. It says few are below 3.7 so I guess thats the 25th percentile. Sorry about that. I misread it as few below and few above
I was honestly quite skeptical when I heard about that IQR, and I completely agree with your points.  I do know cases of people having 3.4-3.5 and getting in.  I'd love to provide a source for my stats but this is coming from other PhDs. I also do remember looking at a Berk CS professor's website and I was directed to the ""Interested MS applicant"" section. I remember him mentioning the same IQR, 3.4-3.7. I can't quite recall who. Anyhow, it's always good to have 3.7+ in my opinion and this is just to encourage strong applicants with lower GPAs. I'll definitely try and scrape a little bit for a reliable source if I can find one :)
Thats quite interesting, thanks!!"

I pray that no ones misses the final. However, in a class that big, it is almost inevitable that someone is going to miss it (especially when the class is only a unit and is not a requirement).

Grades are not looking hot as I finished the last of the CS lower div reqs and it comes out to be B's in half of them and a P in another one (because I would have gotten like C otherwise). Actually my only A is in 61B. I'm worried because like the admissions committee is gonna be like ""if you can't even perform above a 3.5 in lower divs then what chance do you have anywhere else?"" Honestly I think I don't even have a chance for Berkeley's 5th year's masters anymore, but what about other good CS grad schools?","Honestly, most CS masters programs are cash cows and not very useful for undergrads with a strong background. If you're set on a masters, however, Columbia/NYU/other schools (for CS) are not very competitive for someone coming from Berkeley CS.
Georgia tech OMSCS is always an option. Doesn't say online on the degree and you graduate with the in-person masters people (on the same stage on the same day with them). Take a look at some of the lectures (some are public) and see if it meets your standards.
It will be fine for a Masters program as if you're doing reasonably for GPA on the whole. Most Masters care more about taking your money and churning, so you'll have no problem getting into some if that's your goal.  


Might be a problem if you wanted to go for a PhD or something, but even then you could get into some if you aren't incredibly picky. And that's actually the cheaper way, since you'll get funded for a PhD program, rather than having to pay. Drop out after getting your Masters.
Yup. Get good recommendation letters. They honestly matter more than grades if you have a leader in your field.
I think these days Cal’s 5th year master pay lots of attention to your research experience, at least this is what my professor told me. 

And from my personal experience this is the case for most Ph.D programs. Not saying grades don’t matter but they definitely mean less than your rec letter and research experience.

For master program it depends. Some are pure cash cow programs like other said. I don’t think these are that valuable for someone with a Cal CS degree honestly, especially for job hunting.

Some are more like a prep program for Ph.D. It’s similar to Ph.D in the sense that your research experience and rec letter matter more.

In general grades do matter, but they won’t seal your fate, especially if you can get strong rec letter and research experience. Try steadily improve your grade while putting in more effort into finding research opportunities.
This is very true. My coworker went to SJSU for CS, graduated with a 3.2 GPA and was able to get into USC for MSCS. Not just CS, but a lot of masters programs are cash cows for the school. For example, MIDS is a major cash cow for Berkeley.
I've talked to a couple 5th year EECS masters and you literally need to have a professor sponsor you/take you on for research and generally you've done undergrad research with them I think."
How would classes required for declaring be affected by the rumored PNP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fl060b/how_would_classes_required_for_declaring_be/,2020-03-18 17:07:23,"Majors like CS, Econ, etc require a certain gpa to declare their majors so how would this PNP policy affect those people? Would it count for the current class they are taking and have future / past classes count for the overall gpa for declaring? 

For example, someone taking 61B and have gotten an atleast a B+ in 61A. If they PNP’d 61B, would their grades in 61A and 70 be the sole factors for declaring? Or people taking 61b and 70 at the same time. Would 61A be the decider? It would only be fair since it seems difficult for people to keep a 3.3 in their major requirement course and this seems like an extenuating circumstance that would allow for this.","I don't think they are going to make it mandatory because there's too many people opposed to it. There's a whole petition and stuff, but an equal number of people are opposed to mandatory pnp. 

Plus while it might work with other schools, because of impacted majors, it would be too complicated and unfair here IMO.
I think the ability to let people choose just say 61A and 61B as the deciding factor if they're taking CS70 right now is sort of acceptable because no one (reasonably) could have predicted this was going to happen and so the courses people are taking now are ones they expected they could handle under normal circumstances. Given that most people intend to (and in fact do) pass all their courses, this really had no way of being abused.

I think the harm of letting """"unqualified"""" (with heavy air-quotes) people into a major is far less than blocking people who would otherwise have made it if not for the ridiculous circumstances we have right now.
What I mean is that if we PNP one class, should the declaration be decided on the other classes? This would benefit some people should they choose it as it definitely reduces declaration stress greatly which seems reasonable given the circumstances. Of course they can choose to take the courses for a grade if they need a higher grade to declare.
an option to retake (the class or just exams idk) might be good imo. The department might not be in favor of letting """"unqualified"""" people in—the EECS chair said that too many CS majors is a big challenge for the department atm and they are actively trying to find fair ways to reduce the growth.
imo that's unfair to the people who took 70 in the past, but there really is no fair option. personally, i think the best option is to keep letter grading, but make it more lenient (allow for more hw drops or clobbering or something idk cs70 course policies)
Two likely scenarios:
1) declaration GPA would be based off all pre-reqs taken for a letter grade
2) declaration GPA includes the P/NP pre-req class(es) and use a C- (lowest possible P) in the GPA calculation
Scenario 2 won't happen. L&S CS for example, a C- (1.7) in any of the 3 lower divs would make it physically impossible to declare, even if you earned a 4.0 in the other two (would average out to 3.23, when you need a 3.3), 

I think the likely scenarios are either they simply don't consider the P/NP'd class in declaration GPA requirement, or they allow the option to take it graded, or it shows as P/NP on the transcript but the student's actual letter grade is kept internally to use for GPA calculations.
those are unfair to people who are taking their strongest class right now (if you're forced to PNP)
I wonder if they could bring CS61C back into the mix to deal with this situation. 

Hypothetical:
If you are currently above 3.3 w/ 2 classes: you’re in. 

If you’re going to be able to reach 3.3 with class you’re currently in: you can opt for a letter grade to get it done with.

If you’re taking last requirement PNP and you’re not currently above 3.3: allow 61C to be counted as third class in calculating GPA?

edit: realize this wouldn’t work for people taking two of the three prereqs simultaneously
Doesn't this equally apply to people who are taking their weaker class right now and need to opt out of P/NP because of post grad applications? This is a situation none of us can foresee. Nothing can be totally fair."

## **Context**

The new 2017 grading guidelines from [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad):

> The undergraduate study curriculum committee suggests that there should be some uniformity in grading in fairness to our students, and we propose the following guidelines, which were ratified at the faculty meeting of March 11, 1976, and updated in 1989 and 2017.  These guidelines were chosen to be consistent with current grading practices.
> 
> 1. A typical GPA for a lower division course will fall in the range 2.8 - 3.3, depending on the course and the students who enroll.  For example, a GPA of 3.0 would result from 35% A's, 45% B's, 13% C's, and 7% D's and F's. Introductory courses specifically designed for a broad audience may fall outside of this range.
> 
> 2. A typical GPA for an upper division course will fall in the range 3.0 - 3.5, depending on the course and the students who enroll. For example, a GPA of 3.2 would result from 45% A's, 40% B's, 10% C's, and 5% D's and F's. Courses with selective enrollment may fall outside of this range.

The old 1989 grading guidelines from [http://web.archive.org/web/20160304030337/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/ugrad.grading.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20160304030337/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/ugrad.grading.shtml):

> A typical GPA for courses in the lower division is 2.7. This GPA would result, for example, from 17% A's, 50% B's, 20% C's, 10% D's, and 3% F's. A class whose GPA falls outside the range 2.5 - 2.9 should be considered atypical. (A Typical GPA for basic prerequisite lower division CS courses (CS 40, CS 41) is 2.5, with GPA's outside the range 2.3 - 2.7 considered atypical.)

## **Elad Alon's Answer**

[EECS Professor Elad Alon](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/elad.html) replied:

> I don't happen to recall the exact numbers from the previous policy, but the numbers quoted in the original post sound about right.  The reason for the change in the average target was largely driven by more accurately reflecting actual practice, and the wider range of grades than in the past was also to reflect actual variability across courses/populations, as well as to allow flexibility as our degree programs become more or less selective.

What's the difference between a D&F?
C --> you passed under P/NP, and you did not fail under grade-point

D --> you no-passed under P/NP, and you did not fail under grade-point

F --> you no-passed under P/NP, and you failed under grade-point

edit: basically, F is the only failing grade, but D and F are both no-passing grades"
