What's with all the free space on Thursday and Friday??? Oski would be absolutely disappointed, and you'll bring shame to your family for generations.
easy! maybe add a weekend job for extra cash?
I thought you wanna have lunch with me :/
Dude is speed running college ðŸ’€
Never know there are 7am classes
Holy shit how many units is this
certainly there's a Friday PM seminar you can fit in there...
too many empty spots
No weekend classes? I hope you are doing an internship or fellowship too.
Only if you're ok with graduating later smh my head
Youâ€™re slacking off on Friday evenings.  Surely there must be a Chem 1a or EECS 16x class you could have taken with a Friday evening lab.
you forgot to  schedule time for crying
Itâ€™s enough to train a LLM
lil bro is taking math 202B and math 105 at the same time
Where are the extracurriculars? Need to join at least 5 clubs, one per day of the week
Too much free time, maybe get a job? ðŸ¤”
Rookie number
When I was at Berkeley I actually became Evanâ€™s hall. So like step it up
Too much free time Tu/Th mornings.
Looks like youâ€™ve got a bunch of lines of smarties
You forgot to add Yogurt Park to 6pm Friday.
Only one lab that goes to 10pm? Weak sauce.
There is no way you wonâ€™t have conflicting final exam times
I'm assuming your weekends are free, pls add some online classes to it
YOLO
Glad you got your r5b in
Seems a little light, maybe you should try applying yourself lol
add a few decals to cover the gaps after 9 and 10
That ChicanX studies class is gonna be tough
lol this is edited right?
where is cs70?
bro's gonna levitate to class
Itâ€™s Scandinavian so they are probably practicing daylight saving /s
itâ€™s alright I have seen people took 105 AFTER taking 202B
CS70 --> EECS 126"
