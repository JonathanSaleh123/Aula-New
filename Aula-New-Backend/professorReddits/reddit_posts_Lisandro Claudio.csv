SEASIAN 167 â€“ Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wq0j8g/seasian_167_thoughts/,2022-08-16 10:41:09,Has anyone taken SEASIAN 167 or any course with Professor Lisandro Claudio? Would love to hear your thoughts and if you recommend taking the course?,"I don't recommend taking any courses with Lisandro Claudio, he has been enabling violence against those opposing the current Filipino government under the guise of fighting communism (this is called red-tagging). There is an organization in Berkeley that actively opposes the fascist government, and one of its members that came back to the Philippines to visit family was attacked and injured by local enforcement and framed him to be a part of NPA, a supposedly ""terrorist"" organization in the Philippines. 

I know this is a lot of information, but tl;dr don't take him in any class because he enables violence."
