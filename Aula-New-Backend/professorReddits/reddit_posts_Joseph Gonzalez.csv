What's with all the free space on Thursday and Friday??? Oski would be absolutely disappointed, and you'll bring shame to your family for generations.
easy! maybe add a weekend job for extra cash?
I thought you wanna have lunch with me :/
Dude is speed running college ðŸ’€
Never know there are 7am classes
Holy shit how many units is this
certainly there's a Friday PM seminar you can fit in there...
too many empty spots
No weekend classes? I hope you are doing an internship or fellowship too.
Only if you're ok with graduating later smh my head
Youâ€™re slacking off on Friday evenings.  Surely there must be a Chem 1a or EECS 16x class you could have taken with a Friday evening lab.
you forgot to  schedule time for crying
Itâ€™s enough to train a LLM
lil bro is taking math 202B and math 105 at the same time
Where are the extracurriculars? Need to join at least 5 clubs, one per day of the week
Too much free time, maybe get a job? ðŸ¤”
Rookie number
When I was at Berkeley I actually became Evanâ€™s hall. So like step it up
Too much free time Tu/Th mornings.
Looks like youâ€™ve got a bunch of lines of smarties
You forgot to add Yogurt Park to 6pm Friday.
Only one lab that goes to 10pm? Weak sauce.
There is no way you wonâ€™t have conflicting final exam times
I'm assuming your weekends are free, pls add some online classes to it
YOLO
Glad you got your r5b in
Seems a little light, maybe you should try applying yourself lol
add a few decals to cover the gaps after 9 and 10
That ChicanX studies class is gonna be tough
lol this is edited right?
where is cs70?
bro's gonna levitate to class
Itâ€™s Scandinavian so they are probably practicing daylight saving /s
itâ€™s alright I have seen people took 105 AFTER taking 202B
CS70 --> EECS 126"
Data 100 + CS 61B or Data 100 + CS 70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g77anh/data_100_cs_61b_or_data_100_cs_70/,2020-04-24 05:12:27,"Hi, I'm wondering if it is better to take Data 100 with CS 61B this fall, or with CS 70 in spring. I will be in my sophomore year and am trying to declare CS so I need to do well in both 61B and 70, but I want to take Data 100 in either of the two semesters. 

As far as professors go, its Anthony Joseph in the fall, and Joseph Gonzalez in spring. Any help would be greatly appreciated!","Idk about the professors, but from a declaring standpoint, taking 61b + data 100 might be best. cs 70 is usually really hard for people so iâ€™d recommend having a pretty (chill) schedule when you take 70 so you can really focus on it and make sure you get the grade you need in order to declare.
It really is up to other classes and your desire to code I guess. Like with CS61B and Data 100, you are going to be coding a lot and that could be difficult because sometimes, you work 4 hours on a project and get nowhere. And CS61B and Data 100 work can stack up. But CS70 has no coding and it is learning a lot of math so it doesn't really fit like a CS class in that sense. 

Regardless, you can sign up for CS61B and Data 100 in the fall and if you feel like it is too much, then you can drop Data 100 and go take it in the spring. I think Data 100 will feel much easier after the rigorous coding you do in CS61B so that might be something to consider.
Makes sense! Just that I figured it's also important to get an A- or higher in 61b since that would really help in declaring and we'll have Hug, not Hilfinger. I've heard that makes that A- significantly harder to achieve.
Is taking CS 70 + 5-unit language class + easy breadth better or taking CS 70 over the summer (with nothing else) better?
Yeah i think that makes sense!
5 unit language courses are surprisingly low workload compared to some techs."
Data 100 Professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6aarz/data_100_professor/,2020-04-22 14:54:19,Anyone know anything about Anthony D Joseph? He's apparently the professor for Data 100 for fall but I can't find anything about him.,"He's a systems guy that has taught CS 162 in the past. https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/joseph.html   
There's a chance that Joey Gonzalez teaches Data 100 again though.
\+1 I'm also taking Data 100 in the Fall and was just looking up ratemyprofessor lol
[deleted]
are they generally considered good or bad professors?
I was only able to find his name from a different college :/. Not sure if thatâ€™s him, but didnâ€™t seem to have good reviews..
You should be able to enroll under Data C100 (https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-fall-data-c100-001-lec-001)
I personally thought Gonzalez was good and Joseph was alright. You can view their teaching ratings as well.

Yeah enrollment isn't under the CS version anymore. The class is cross listed as cs c100, stat c100 and data c100. You can only enroll through data."
