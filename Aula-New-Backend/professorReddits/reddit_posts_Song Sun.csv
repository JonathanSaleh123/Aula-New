Math 140 with Song Sun or Math 141 with Borislav Mladenov?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/175rhq8/math_140_with_song_sun_or_math_141_with_borislav/,2023-10-11 15:54:37,I don't have too much of a preference on one over the other. Does anyone have any experience with any of these professors?,"Mladenov‚Äôs assignments are hard as shit
how hard"
Song Sun,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/he67g9/song_sun/,2020-06-22 19:28:58,"I plan on taking math 1a this fall, and I will either have Professor Bamler or Professor Sun. Prof Bamler seems ok-decent according to ratemyprof, but I cant get much info on Sun as he is pretty new. Anyone have any info on Prof Sun?","who did you decide to go with?
Im not sure which one to pick either. Im looking at the grade distributions for each and Sun's are heavy on strictly A B and C while Bamler is all over the place..
I decided to go with Sun as it didn‚Äôt conflict with other classes i wanted to take"
Song Sun or Richard Bamler for Math 1A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hc6rym/song_sun_or_richard_bamler_for_math_1a/,2020-06-19 12:11:02,"If anyone's taken math 1A or any other class with Prof. Song Sun, how are his lectures? His math 1A section has a really convenient time for me in the fall, and my other option is Prof. Richard Bamler.","Did you pick one? I'm leaning Song Sun but the only review on rate my professors says hes bad. Bamler is apparently super picky and hurts small errors so idk.

I think I'm gonna go with Bamler, he's got more positive reviews and I can make the timing work"
Advice to my fellow students: do the things,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16l5faz,2023-09-17 09:39:40,"Those things you‚Äôre thinking about doing but second-guessing because you‚Äôre ‚Äújust here for school‚Äù, just do them. 

I made an impulse decision this week to buy a secondhand ticket for Ed Sheeran last night after seeing the concert on Seatgeek for MONTHS but not being sure (got my nosebleed ticket pretty cheap and had card reward points from the last few years that paid for it), and it turned out to be one of the best choices I‚Äôve ever made. 

I felt weird going alone, not knowing any of the songs on the new album very well, and every other reason under the sun for thinking ‚Äúmaybe not‚Äù. But I had the money and the time and a good concert truly heals the soul, so I went and don‚Äôt regret it for a second. 10/10 no notes, so fun! 

You‚Äôre only young once. Don‚Äôt talk yourself out of doing things you‚Äôll enjoy and you have the privilege or means to experience. The excuses will be there tomorrow still but you don‚Äôt want to miss out on the memories if you can help it. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Love,
A wallflower and ‚Äúmature student‚Äù who got tired of the FOMO and decided to say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and have meaningful experiences in my last year.","Instructions not clear. did cocaine in the 1st floor of Moffitt
I started doing these types of things my first year, really fun. Though I have ran out of money quiet often üòÇ
This seems a lot like something that an intern in the marketing department of Seatgeek would write
this was LITERALLY ME LAST NIGHT - impulse-bought tickets despite not being the biggest Ed fan, after being on the fence for two weeks

no motherfucking regrets. photograph and bloodstream were so good. woof 

cheers to you and me ü´∂
Damn it‚Äôs like everyone in their mothers went to this event. While I stayed home play league
After having gone to one concert up through high school, I went to seven shows my first two months at Berkeley (Erasure, U2/Public Enemy/Sugarcubes, and a bunch of shows I can‚Äôt remember) sometimes I went with floor/dorm friends, sometimes I went alone. But if you can‚Äôt find someone to go with you - still go (assuming finances and safety)! Some of my favorite concert experiences have been by myself - Radiohead and Superchunk in Tokyo, CHVRCHES in SF, Letters to Cleo at Slim‚Äôs etc etc
When I grow up, I want to be like you

That concert was so fun!!
So what you‚Äôre saying is I should go to Disneyworld for my birthday the week after next even tho it‚Äôs on a Monday got it
What is this
As an old Bear, this is the best advice.  Cal is more than hitting the books.  You are in the middle of an area teeming with great adventures often with little or no cost and affordable mass transportation.   Don‚Äôt be afraid to explore S.F. activities and Oakland sites and events.  Cal taught me to take those leaps of faith into the unknown.  You‚Äôll have a ‚Äúlife / work‚Äù balance, make friends and be a more interesting person.
Fun!!!!
Lowkey wanna go to a concert but worried abt sensory overload
OP, how was the sound quality? I went to Karol G at Levi‚Äôs last month and the audio quality was dog shit. Was actually pretty bummed because it was a stark difference from the audio at The Weeknd‚Äôs show last year at Levi‚Äôs.
""Advice to my fellow students: do the things"" and its just an ed sheeran concert pic LMAOOO
How do I know about such events in the future?
I knew you had commented this before I even read the username. Hope you had fun with your zoom zoom powder üíÄ
1st floor overrated, 2nd floor is where the action is at
lmfaooo
Yeah, I‚Äôm trying to toe the line between living frugally and never leaving my house this year ü•≤
they can feel free to hire me on at this point but it was unintentional üòÇ
Truly was not expecting bloodstream to hit that hard. The graphics made it just fire omg
There were like 70,000 ppl there so basically yeah. Stadium the size of my hometown üò≠

I hope you had fun playing league!
I saw SYML alone and will be seeing Hozier next month the same way. I traveled Europe alone at 19 but NOW I‚Äôm self-conscious? Lol. I felt like I reconnected with that part of myself last night that just goes on adventures. I‚Äôm looking forward to more now. :)
You‚Äôre gonna have to be more specific, friendo
Won‚Äôt find out til you try. Wear earplugs for hearing protection
There‚Äôs all kinds of concerts. Stadium concerts are usually huge starts who can fill it so they go all out on everything.

You could try a smaller venue or a smaller artist if you‚Äôve never been before.
I was up in the nosebleeds and the audio in my videos sounds like he‚Äôs five feet from me rather than a full city block away. It was ass for the openers but I think they adjusted it before Ed came out bc it was honestly phenomenal‚Äîlike surprisingly so‚Äîfor the whole actual show.
The advice is to get out of your comfort zone, whatever that means for you. For me, it meant going solo to a concert. For you maybe it‚Äôs trying cocaine. What do you want from me lmao
Subscribing to your favorite artists/comedians so you get emails if they‚Äôre coming to your city, joining Fb groups for the area, checking eventbrite for local things going on, and I guess just being in touch with friends who can share if things are going on they think you‚Äôd be interested
Hell yeah I made people int, rage quit, and cried.
Is Hozier performing next month? Where ?
true, do you know where I can get fent from berkeley?
Pls be that friend to us. Just like send PSAs out üôè
Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on October 27. That one wasn‚Äôt an impulse decision and I got the ticket months ago, so I can‚Äôt say what prices are doing now

Math 1A Best Professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hf8vaf/math_1a_best_professor/,2020-06-24 13:33:04,I will be taking math 1A in the fall and have the choice of 2 professors: Richard Bamler and Song Sun.

Talaska or Bamler?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hc6une/talaska_or_bamler/,2020-06-19 12:15:08,"Talaska Math 10A or Bamler 1A (I think I saw Song Sun too)? I took calc bc this year and did alright in the class although it was pretty hard for me. I'm also aiming for IB major major/prehealth and potentially some other double/minor in biz or ds although things may change once I actually see what everything is like. I'm planning on Chem 1A and probably Film R1A this semester as well.

&#x200B;

THANKS!","Don‚Äôt know anything about Bamler but if you‚Äôre taking on a purely prof basis (not class differences) avoid talaska at all costs. You‚Äôre welcome. Unless you really like math in which case you may be ok with her
I heard bamler is tough in grading exams
Oof have you had her? I've only heard negative things about her lmao
Second that. Took math 53 with her and it was one of the worst experiences ever. Very inflexible, exams are way harder than what's taught in class/ HW, and workload is fairly high too (webwork + written HW + 2 quizzes a week)
ahhh harder than 10A?
Yes and I‚Äôd say most things you‚Äôve heard are true. She‚Äôs not a bad person but pretty inflexible as a prof. So if you can choose between the two...
Not sure. My roommate had bamler for 1A in fall 2018 and she said so many points are docked off for small errors. I had Paulin and he was very generous about partial credit lol. Don‚Äôt know anything about talaska.
damn I really wish Paulin were teaching it this semester aha"
2016 Commencement speaker and this sub,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3pkway/2016_commencement_speaker_and_this_sub/,2015-10-20 19:20:32,"Some of you guys might not think that we actually want Fieri as our speaker and there are a few who don't like all the fieri on this sub. I'd beg to differ. I, for one, love Guy Fieri. He is the embodiment of what every man, woman, or child should strive to be. He is absolutely stoked every minute of every hour of every day, unable to feel any negative emotion. His bombastic euphoria allows him to even brave the shittiest of Friday's appetizers with a grand smile on his face, utilizing unnecessary adjectives like ""killer"" or ""kickin"" or perhaps even ""poppalicious"" whilst doing so. He sees adventure everywhere, from the bland realms of Food Network to the prospect of a Friday's in Toledo, Ohio. He is the man who embodies every Smash Mouth song ever written, even going as far as to look like the lead singer of Smash Mouth. He is the essence of every Capri Sun commercial you've ever seen. He is Guy Fieri, the fall-off-the-bone messiah.","THANK MR FIERIüôèüç¥üôèüç¥üôèüç¥üôèüç¥üôèüç¥ gooD meMes and 4.0süç¥ thank üç¥ mr fieri güôèüôèood memesüôèüôèand 4.üôè0süôèüôèüôè good memesüç¥and 4.0s üç¥üç¥if i doot∆Ωa“Ø thank fieri man üçú eecs eecs eecs eecsüçú good memes n 4.0s good memes (chorus: eecs eecs) mMMMM·é∑–úüçú üôèüôèüôèeeEeeeeEeeeeecSüôèüôèüôèüôèüçúüôèüç¥üç¥üç¥üôèüôèthank mr fieri

Back to Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/195i2l4/back_to_berkeley/,2024-01-12 22:57:43,"Back to Berkeley

I.

&#x200B;

Rain lashed against the dorm window, a relentless tattoo blurring the California sunshine into a hazy memory. Inside, Jack hunched over a wobbly wooden desk, the stale air thick with the smell of books and unwashed laundry. His fingertips grazed the bottom of a flimsy paper cup, the once-steaming dark roast now a bitter chill mocking his loneliness. He craved more than caffeine, more than the sterile white walls that amplified his solitude. He yearned for the fire crackle of a New England hearth, the sting of snow on his cheeks, the warmth of connection, even if it was just a memory.

&#x200B;

Then, a splash of defiance against the rain-washed grey, a flash of blue sliced through the monotony. Nestled among piles of notes and forgotten books, a package pulsed with an otherworldly gleam. The elegant script danced on the cardboard, a forgotten blizzard whispering her name. Hope flickered in Jack's chest, a fragile flame battling the storm outside and the emptiness within.

&#x200B;

With trembling fingers, he tore open the package, the wind howling its approval as the aroma of brine and butter punched through the stale dorm air. Inside, nestled in ice packs, lay the ghost of a Boston blizzard: a feast of scarlet lobster and creamy chowder, sent with a mischievous wink from across the miles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

II.

&#x200B;

The New England blizzard howled its icy symphony outside, painting the quaint Cambridge cafe windows with swirling white strokes. Inside, warmth pulsed like a defiant heartbeat, fueled by steaming mugs and the embers of a newfound connection. Jack, pen hovering over a blank page, felt the familiar chill of writer's block gnawing at his creative spirit. He sighed, frustration a frosty breath on his tongue.

&#x200B;

Then, a voice, seasoned with years of unraveling the universe's mysteries, cut through the cafe's murmur. ""Still wrestling with elusive ideas, dear boy? Or has inspiration finally flown west for the warmer embrace of California sun?""

&#x200B;

Jack's head snapped up to find Professor Eleanor, his father's old colleague and a whirlwind of silver hair and sharp wit, peering over his worn notebook. Memories flooded back‚Äîshared jokes whispered over string theory diagrams, hushed debates about dark matter fueled by chocolate croissants, the way her eyes danced with the same playful glint when discussing black holes as when reciting Milton.

&#x200B;

A bittersweet smile, like the warmth of a forgotten dream, settled on Jack's face. ""Professor Eleanor, what equation led you outside the hallowed halls? Is there a cosmic conundrum brewing in these city streets?""""

&#x200B;

Her chuckle, a familiar melody through the years, held a touch of wistful understanding. ""Even mathematicians, and aspiring poets for that matter, need escapes from the tyranny of formulas, dear boy. Though I must confess, I wasn't expecting to find a wandering verse weaver grappling with cosmic conundrums in this particular haven.""

&#x200B;

Their conversation, a graceful waltz between equations and metaphors like the old days, flowed around them. He spoke of his struggles to weave physics into his verses, the frustration of translating the language of science into the rhythm of poetry. She, in turn, painted a picture of his father beyond the theorems, the way he saw sonnets in superstrings and haiku in Higgs bosons, the twinkle in his eyes when discussing the Big Bang as if it were a celestial symphony.

&#x200B;

But in the quiet spaces between words, a shadow lingered. The loss of Jack's father, still echoed in the halls of academia and the depths of his heart. Eleanor, his father's confidante and mentor, had witnessed Jack's struggle, the guilt and grief woven into his ambition to forge his own path.

&#x200B;

""He'd be proud,"" she said softly, her hand resting on his. ""He might have teased you about the lack of numbers in your poems, but he'd see the fire in your words, the same fire that ignited his equations.""

&#x200B;

Her words, like a gentle hand on a sore spot, brought tears to Jack's eyes. A moment of connection, a bridge between generations and passions. In that snow-drenched haven, they weren't just an old colleague of daddy and a struggling writer, but two souls bound by a shared love for a brilliant mathematician, their encounter a spark of hope and healing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

III.

&#x200B;

But now, a bittersweet note hung in the air. Jack's plane to Berkeley awaited, beckoning him back to studies and life on the Left Coast. He hugged Professor Eleanor farewell, a shared understanding in their eyes.

&#x200B;

""Keep weaving your celestial sonnets, Jack,"" she said, her voice laced with gentle encouragement. ""Berkeley may be miles away, but the universe we share sings the same song, wherever we are.""

&#x200B;

Jack nodded ever so slightly. ""And who knows,"" he said, eyes gleaming with newfound resolve, ""perhaps someday, those sonnets will find their way back to Cambridge, a melody for a snowy haven.""

&#x200B;

The blizzard continued its mournful symphony outside, casting a chill against the cafe's warmth. Jack stared at the clock, his heart leaden with the weight of parting. Professor Eleanor, sensing his sorrow, squeezed his hand. ""Wish we could share that lobster roll at our usual spot,"" she sighed, her eyes mirroring the snow's melancholic swirl. ""But tomorrow steals you back to California.""

&#x200B;

A smile, tinged with sadness, touched Jack's lips. ""Maybe next time,"" he said, hoping the words held a whisper of truth.

&#x200B;

A mischievous glint sparked in Eleanor's eyes as she chuckled. ""Next time it is,"" she promised. ""And until then, you'll have a taste of New England on your doorstep. I know just the place‚Äîthe best damn mail-order lobster and chowder this side of the Atlantic.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Wait, he didn't do his laundry after Finals but before he went home for break? That's when you're *supposed* to do the laundry; once a year. 

He left it unwashed in his closed up dorm room all during the break? No wonder he's despondent!

Jack Mehoff, at it again
Congrats or sorry that happened
That's the end but also the beginning.
Thanks!
Unfortunately no :-)  Thanks for reading, love your squirrel pastas!
Always love to see amazing writing!
Thanks!  The squirrels pretty much just write themselves. :-)

Good fortune with your continued writing. 

You know, there's a long history of campus fiction that loosely goes under the heading of ""college novels"".  Generally (but not always) they follow the life of one student (usually a male, usually a freshman) through one academic year, with all the travails, excitements, consternation, distractions, and triumphs students would typically encounter at a particular campus in a particular era. Most of them were written by alumni, and some are excellent literature, not just genre writing.

Four of the best set at Berkeley are:

*For the Blue and Gold,* Joy Lichtenstein (who would later be the head librarian for the city of San Francisco.). Set in the late 1890s/early 1900s, following the life of one initially innocent freshman. Probably the first such novel featuring Cal, although there were short fiction stories about students written before it.

*The Western Shore*, Clarkson Crane. Set in the 1920s at Cal. Crane was an alumnus living in Paris when he wrote it. Regarded as an excellent ""Lost Generation"" novel, and with some dark themes ahead of its time--it follows the lives of several Cal students, faculty, and alumni.  Few, if any, of them have happy or conventional lives. If there's one book I'd recommend reading in this genre, it's this one.

*Stacy Towers*, Robert K.K. Walter. 1963. Set at a fictional state university campus roughly modeled on Berkeley in the 50s/early 60s. Like *The Western Shore*, a large cast of characters including African-American students trying to make their way in a largely white campus, and liberal professors / administrators struggling against the political forces of the right-wing McCarthy era.   

*Trading Places*, David Lodge. Set in the late 1960s at a fictionalized Berkeley called ""Euphoria State"" (which is across the Bay from the ""Silver Span Bridge""), as well as a fictionalized red brick campus in the English industrial Midlands. A brashly American Berkeley professor and a stereotypical ""English professor"", literally ""trade places"" (including jobs, teaching roles, campus offices and...um....some other things) for a year in a faculty exchange program. Very humorous and well written. Lodge was a English professor who did visit / teach at Berkeley for a while, so he was writing from personal experience. Lodge followed up with two other novels with some of the same characters, so sometimes they're packaged as his ""campus trilogy"". 

Jack London (who briefly studied at Cal, also wrote a futurist dystopian novella set in part at Berkeley, called *The Scarlet Plague*. Spoiler; virtually everyone dies. You can find it online, on Google Books, I think. It's in the public domain.
Amazing info!!! Thanks I will follow up on this"
