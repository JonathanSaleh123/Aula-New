Was wondering if you had taken the class, and is it taught in python or R? Thanks!
Do you mean I can get in this course?
It was sheer snark. I'm not proud of it. I'm not funny, but I made myself laugh with this thought, then I proceeded to type it out and post it. And now that we're here the only way I could back myself out of being an ass would be to say something like

**'I answered the question in the binary sense; yes there's a chance to enroll in INDENG142 as a DS major.'**

Which is the case. There were some seats reserved for Data Science students, like 25 I think. **Also tho, if you are DS you need 7 or more terms in attendance for these seats.** They're taken now. But if the waitlist has space and you can add it, there's still a chance. SEE: [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-fall-indeng-142-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-fall-indeng-142-001-lec-001)

Now whether there's a chance to get in off the waitlist-no clue. And that's where the snark came from. Instead of just sharing the info above, and admitting that I don't know the chances now, but generally the waitlist stuff depends on Prof/Dept, *I said yes (as in, yes in theory there's some chance).*

Hope you get in dear u/Jealous-Chicken-9714"
