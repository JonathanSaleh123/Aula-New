POL SCI Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hjmqjf/pol_sci_questions/,2020-07-01 17:26:52,"What's up with PS 3 and programming with R or Jupyter? Is Andrew Little the only prof who does this? Would you recommend taking STAT 33A (Intro to Programming in R, 1 unit class) to prepare?

Any other stats experience needed? I took AP Stats and enjoyed it.

Also, did y'all only take the 2 required lower divs or more of them?

How's Gurowitz for PS 5?","[deleted]
I took it with Andrew Little without a stats or programming background and at the time, I found the course somewhat difficult. I had to make the extra effort to study more strategically and attend office hours and I got an A. Prof Little wasn’t the best at explaining why things worked the way they did, which was the challenging part about the class for me (since I had no stats exp). But then, I took a stats class two semesters after I took PS3 and then everything clicked. 

If you remember things from AP stats, Im sure this will help! But def not necessary. I also took Stat33A after PS3 and what you learn in Stat33A is not really the same. Stat33A is more about the basic functions and aspects of R Programming and less about how to apply it to statistical concepts. PS3 is more so about the latter and how to say, run a regression on R. But you don’t need to take Stat33A to prepare for PS3 since there’s not much overlap at least in my experience.
Lmao, thanks!
Thanks for all the detail!"
It’s not your fault if you’re a lonely man,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cxg2ty/its_not_your_fault_if_youre_a_lonely_man/,2024-05-21 12:13:21,"**Intro:**

I just saw a post here about a lonely guy and his struggles in dating.

When I read it, the frustration, sadness, and despair were palpable. But since [63% of young men are single](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/08/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans/), [and half of male university students are virgins](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sex-and-Relationships-Among-Students-Summary-Report.pdf), I can understand why this poster wasn’t happy. 

The majority of men are lonely. 

While I cannot solve this very real societal phenomenon, I will try to put things into perspective.

After all, trite as it may sound, life is truly about much more than dating. We’ll talk about this later on.

Before we begin, I would like to sincerely dedicate this post to all of those people who carry a void in their hearts every day.

I truly hope that reading the following will bring you at least a little peace of mind.

***

This is something that you need to tell yourself every single day. Life coaches and toxic PUAs like Andrew Tate [are telling you to run game on 5 women every day](https://www.aol.com/murky-online-world-andrew-tate-065208828.html), but I'm telling you to tell yourself this 5 times a day:

**It's not your fault.**

This should be said and emphasized a lot more. I want you guys to completely digest this idea. It is important to keep reminding yourself of this truth. Once you truly understand this, you will have a much more peaceful mindset.

The situation you are in was *forced upon you*.

[Genetic determinism is anathema to most people](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/01/science/effects-of-beauty-found-to-run-surprisingly-deep.html?pagewanted=1). You will always see the fortunate, the lucky people [try to take credit for their living situations](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-role-of-luck-in-life-success-is-far-greater-than-we-realized/), but they won't acknowledge the opportunities they were given.

I want you to understand something: when people tell you ""you can do it, you can do anything,"" they are not saying it for your benefit. They are saying it to gaslight you and feel better about themselves. It implies that if you fail, it was because of something you did wrong.

""You could've done it, but you didn't, so it's your fault.""

Don't let people gaslight you.

You look at a guy like Jeremy Meeks, scum of the earth. This guy is the personification of luck. The guy made the wrong choices and decisions at every step of the way, and he still made it as a [multimillionaire top model](https://sfist.com/2017/01/03/hot_felon_jeremy_meeks_now_has_big/), all because of his looks.

He comes from a [broken family](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5644925/Jeremy-Meeks-father-jail-33-years-murder-young-mother.html), he's a [criminal, robber, gangster, beat an underage kid to near death](https://hollywoodlife.com/2014/06/21/jeremy-meeks-2002-arrest-beating/), [drug dealer](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/weird/hot-felon-in-court-asks-for-public-defender/77-271067739), [weapons charges](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hot-felon-jeremy-meeks-gets-two-years-prison-gun-rap-n302041), you fucking name it. Yet, women are worshiping him, [literally worshiping him](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/women-offer-to-pay-bail-for-handsome-convict-why-society/).

I ask you this: how many mistakes is too many? 10? 20? 50?

When you are good-looking, [no amount is too many.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6762156/) [Anything is forgivable](https://www.insider.com/cameron-herrin-tiktok-viral-videos-prison-free-too-cute-2021-8).

You look at a guy like Hunter Biden, [drug addict](https://time.com/5952773/hunter-biden-memoir-beautiful-things/) and [porn actor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/marjorie-taylor-greene-hunter-biden-photos/). Still, he's a [board member of a nine-figure international investment firm](https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2023/03/09/hunter-bidens-mine-truth). All because of his dad. All because he was lucky enough to be born into the Biden family.

You look at Elon Musk, richest guy on earth. He in turn comes from a dirty rich family that [makes bank with him off of the backs of literal child slaves](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-children-trfn/tesla-apple-among-firms-accused-of-aiding-child-labor-in-africa-idUSKBN1YK24F/). [His 80-year-old father made a child with his 30-year-old stepdaughter.](https://www.mamamia.com.au/errol-musk/) Think about it, this guy was fucking 50 years old when he adopted that child.

These are **morally bankrupt** people, and yet you see the lives they are living.

You look at a guy like Bill Gates, [whose classmates' parents literally bought a computer room](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-gates-at-home/) for his high school during a time when even top U.S. universities didn't have computer rooms. Bill got to spend unlimited time with the latest and greatest computers as a child in the 1960s.

I am not saying Bill is dumb. Of course, you also need brains, but [even intelligence is luck](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270739/).

It's brutal how lucky you have to be in life. Not only do [you need the smarts](https://docs.iza.org/dp8235.pdf), but you need to be born in the [right time and location](https://news.byu.edu/news/study-hockey-players-born-october-through-december-score-more-and-are-paid-more) into the [right family](https://magadhmahilacollege.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Advantages-of-Nuclear-Family.pdf). You think a smart kid who was born in a war-torn third-world country stands any chance?

Never.

Fucking never.

You gotta be lucky in this life. The most important factor governing success in life is luck. [Looks will directly influence how you are treated by others](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-2909.111.2.304) [from the day you were born](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264380105), before you could even remember. Your **[neurotypicality, face, race, and height](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/s/2ZGaGrF5V2)** are paramount when it comes to how society will treat you (I have mountains of data at the above link, **read it** to see just how important these genetic factors are). This in turn shapes your personality.

[Your intelligence](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf), the [opportunities you were born into](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6296851/), [your gender](https://mitili.mit.edu/sites/default/files/project-documents/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.07-Terrier.pdf); they are all important.

Even in the job market, [just your gender influences your chances majorly](https://ifunny.co/picture/sent-100-applications-as-a-man-and-a-woman-it-BbmtYyFB8).

Everything in life comes down to luck.

""Anything is possible, you can do anything.""

No, you cannot do anything you want to in life, and it's not your fault. Genetic determinism and luck rule every aspect of your life.

**You did nothing wrong.**

So don't let anybody gaslight you.

Instead, don't be a free agent in life. Let the blackpill guide you.","I will just say...
You don't need to date to be happy. You don't need to be the richest person to be happy. I'm not saying those things don't help and I'm not saying folks don't have it hard these days, but the incel-like mindset of ""I'm not genetically predisposed to success in dating and so I can't be happy"" is only going to hurt you and others who believe it.
when did this become an incel subreddit
This post really resonates with me. You might really like this maybe?

Not reading all that congratulations or sorry that happened
Why is dating the key to happiness? Yes, it is very difficult for most men to date - some more than others - but lack of a romantic partner does not automatically make one lonely. What about friends? Why not try to make fulfilling platonic connections with those around you? 

A relationship is not the end-all, be-all of happiness. I am single and I have been incredibly happy just spending time with my friends and focusing on what I love. I actually was a lot lonelier when I was in a relationship (that admittedly was a bad one) because it held me back from being myself and making more social connections. Now that I am single and not actively looking for a partner I am probably the happiest u have ever been.

If you feel like you need a romantic partner to be happy and not lonely, that in itself is the issue, not the lack of a partner. You need to look within yourself and figure out why that is (perhaps you are not confident, and need the external validation to feel attractive). Once you gain self esteem and confidence from within, romantic relationships won’t be as important anymore. I personally think that anyone who needs (not wants, but needs) a relationship to be happy should not be in one. 

News flash: if you’re deeply unhappy and lonely when you’re not in a relationship, getting a partner will not magically fix that. It needs to come from within. Take control of your own life and improve what you can, rather than blaming fate. Confidence is attractive, desperately needing a partner is not. Get to a point in life where you are truly happy with yourself, and happy being single, and you likely will have a lot more success in all aspects of life, not just dating. But yeah, make more friends and foster those bonds, and work on yourself rather than blaming luck and circumstances out of your control.
Bro just discovered white privilege, sexism, generational wealth, capitalism, social inequity and discrimination. Yes…these are problems, but the way you’ve approached and framed these issues is skewed. You’re almost there but not quite. There are certainly problems with how our world is unfair. And the examples you drew upon, such as Trump and Biden - reflect generations of colonialism, white privilege and so on. These are systems of oppression that you can further educate yourself upon if you’re interested, rather than try to draw off-kiltered links to lookism or other incel ideology.
Sounds like a skill issue.
Wow dude. Huge victim mentality. I have so much to say to this post but don't know where to start. 

As a child of immigrants who's done ok-well-very well

I'll tell you, opportunity matters but even more so, willpower and hustle , commitment, sacrifice, discipline , willingness to learn, grow , develop. 

I happen to know people from 3rd world countries who in America became very well off. 

Also when it comes to women,  well that's another story but I feel for you and your outlook. 

Yes. There is a lot of ppl who have much more opportunity and luck , Ive known such people but I've also seen people who come from nothing make something great of themselves. It's not easy though. It's very hard and most people don't want to make the sacrifices or put in the work.

Nah, I'm making it or its gonna be a D1 crashout. I refuse to live the life that my parents and grandparents lived.
It is time to trans maxx brother. Out short height is advantageous. Wahmen get whatever pick of the litter they want; chads run to me now. DM me when you're ready to do what is necessary. Don't be a free agent in life, take it by the reigns.
Knowing it wasn’t my fault *did* make me happier as someone with profound autism.

It wasn’t my fault that I almost got fired from my job because I was uncontrollably stimming. Knowing that I was not doing anything wrong allowed me to self-advocate, keep my job, and even get promoted.

I do not encourage unhappiness or any emotion at all, to be honest. People have different things going on in their lives, and if they feel some kind of way about their situation, that’s valid.
Ad hominem always wins against empirical data.
omg when wasnt it... its so fun to tap in every now and then and see tho
Cap
That's fair and your experience and emotions are valid! Life sucks and things are made harder by things out of our control. 
What I wanted to get at was more that while we can draw comfort from that, your post seems to lead to the conclusion that every aspect of our lives is out of our control and if you don't get lucky then that's it. There's some truth to that, but it infers and absolutism that is not true and is, in my eyes, dangerous. If nothing we do matters to how our life ends up then...what then? 
I get it, but there's more than one way of looking at it and again, predicating happiness on dating and money and good looks is...again, harmful to people.
Your write up helped. Thank you!
It's so funny how the reason and intelligence Berkeley is supposed to be known for go out the window as soon as someone makes an uncomfortable point. No counter arguments. Just insults, downvotes, and vague insistences that acknowledging this truth is ""dangerous."" I didn't want to believe this about the world for a long time but no one can argue against it convincingly. They can just make clear that they don't like it and will try to socially ostracize anyone who points out the elephant in the room.
I agree.
Here’s a counter argument. Evidence increasingly shows that epigenetics and microbiome have a significant role in a person’s health, sometimes even more than their actual genes. These are factors that change as you live your life, and they can also get passed on with your genes and your lifestyle with your newborn baby. So no, not everything is determined from the moment you’re born. 

Your family and country are the main influence in your formative years so you might feel like you’ll always just be a shadow of that. This is what the “you can do anything” cliche is meant to address: it’s not a literal statement, but a mindset that is necessary in order to have the determination and perseverance that, given enough time to build up luck, can actually bring lasting change into your life. Most people who think that end up failing eventually. But not a single person who succeeded thought that they couldn’t do it from the get go. Only the people who trust in their own abilities will ever see the fruits of their labor. 

I am sorry that the cards were stacked against you. But this is a chance to prove that you are not defined by that, and that you don’t need what society says you need for success to be happy. Reject the role that society put you in and seek to be the best person you can be, and you will stop regretting your decisions.
Why is it ""dangerous?"" Because people might stop complying with the game if they realize how stacked against them the deck really is? Because we might have to admit how profoundly unfair our social structures are and either change them or come to terms with being an awful society? It sounds like it's ""dangerous"" in the same way a priest 400 years ago would consider atheism ""dangerous."" It'll shake up the social order and disrupt the smooth functioning of a system that fundamentally relies on a deluded populace.
More ""dangerous"" in the same way nihilism is dangerous. It's not good for you. While there are certain things that people can accept and it's good for them, promoting the idea that life is all a game a chance isn't good for anyone. 

Don't get me wrong - I'm all for changing the way the world is, but believing that it can change is antithetical to the belief that idea that it's completely predetermined.
Well I'm not a complete determinist but I'm probably pretty close. I think we have the capacity to alter social conditions over time but I think within a certain timeframe and the cultural milieu that comes with it, it's generally very hard to escape being determined by a combination of nature and that particular social environment. Largely because even if an individual becomes aware of certain contingencies or arbitrary norms, it won't affect how others treat and perceive them. I think if anything can help increase flexibility at a given moment, it's having more individuals who are keenly aware of how deterministic our existence is on a moment-to-moment basis. Somewhat paradoxically, the collective consciousness that emerges from that is about the only thing with the power to actually shift the non-genetic structures that determine our lives deliberately rather than just allowing existing processes and forces to cause drifts over time."
"Background on the strike, why I'm on strike, and why you should be too",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yy57d9/background_on_the_strike_why_im_on_strike_and_why/,2022-11-17 15:38:00,"Hi folks! I'm Liam, a member of CS 170 course staff.

We are currently in the midst of the largest academic strike in US History – as many of you have likely heard by now, over 48,000 academic workers are currently on strike. As of today, bargaining teams from all four academic bargaining units are attempting to negotiate with the University, and this small window of time will prove to be a crucial moment that must be capitalized on. The contract we decide on will govern us for years to come.

**Why you should strike/picket/support your staff:**

Students:

We are fighting for funding, specifically a more livable compensation for our teachers and a dedicated increase in EECS staffing from the UC. This will lead to a better learning experience for you as students, giving you advantages such as:

\- shorter OH queues

\- more small group tutoring

\- with more staff, you will be able to get into the classes you want to take

In addition to this, the students who are most vulnerable are those who were not privileged enough to receive extra academic preparation beforehand; students with less experience often have a difficult time in computer science, especially here at Berkeley, and it frequently results in them being turned away from it. This manifests itself in the following ways:

\- students are expected to do exceptionally well in our massively sized and difficult lower divs, yet are left to drown, lacking adequate course support

\- if students cannot pass the GPA requirement, they cannot even enroll in CS classes

\- non-majors, e.g. CS-cluster applied math majors, are not allowed to enroll in CS upper-divs period

\- the poor compensation and long hours make the (u)GSI position much less attractive to those who have to pay for school themselves(they could engage in private tutoring instead, or some other job that pays market rate), reducing the diversity in course staff and limiting access to these important jobs(which can be a stepping stone for an academic career) for underrepresented students

It is not hard to see that it is those students who are the least groomed-beforehand for CS (i.e. underprivileged students, the backbone of our diversity) that end up suffering the most; *if the University of California wants to continue to lay claim to its storied diversity, it must deal with the fact that it can only do so by diverting funding to the aspects of the school that actually serve to constitute and nurture this diversity.*

**Background on the strike for EECS:**

EECS has the largest population of academic workers on campus. Teaching quality has suffered. The way we've adapted is by resorting to more ""scalable"" options that aren't very productive for your learning, or for our assessment of your learning. We have created mass auto-graders to check your code instead of having a TA present to help you go line-by-line; the latter is how it should be, especially at the greatest public university in the country. We've resorted to multiple choice and short answer questions, discouraging creativity and stripping away from students the ability to explain why they chose what they chose –  we've increasingly taken away the human aspect of teaching, the aspect of teaching that leaves permanent, endlessly inspirational impressions on students. Personalized feedback and guided assistance is the most effective way to learn. Without this, we might as well all go on coursera to learn from Andrew Ng and search up practice problems on our own and grade them on our own – keep in mind how much you’re paying to be here. Is it so much to ask that courses be adequately staffed, in a non-exploitative manner? Because we cannot afford to hire more TAs, the quality of teaching in our department has really suffered. I’m sure many of you can attest to this.

In addition, lower division courses often have to rely on unpaid labor to adequately support students. Since they don't have enough money to hire more tutors and TAs, they often will rely on Academic Intern labor just to serve the course. I was both an AI and a volunteer for computer science mentors; Computer Science Mentors (CSM), a volunteering club, is also heavily sought after for assistance in the lower divisions. *To put it bluntly, the University of California is relying on unpaid volunteers in order to provide only the most basic academic infrastructure for their students*. It would be hard to call this anything but abhorrent and exploitative, and it has the stark consequence that the more vulnerable students who cannot afford to provide unpaid labor cannot get the experience they need in order to be competitive for a paid position; again, we claim to be committed to diversity here.

**Why I'm on strike:**

This is my 4th time on course staff.

OH queues are ridiculous. For example, the course I'm currently serving has 2-3 people staffing an office hours that regularly draws 30+ students, each of whom is different and deserves their own individualized assistance. This is all that we can afford. The homework in my class is hard, and more likely than not, each person needs a lot more time than the mere 10 minutes we allot to each student to understand the material. But there are more people in the queue, and unfortunately we just have to move on to the next person before adequate assistance can be given.

Here’s some simple math: in each block of one hour, each staff member can talk to 6 students on average. Since we have 2-3 staff, that means 12-18 students get help in an hour. There are 30 students and people are continually coming into OH for help. We simply cannot reach everyone in a timely manner. *I have friends that are discouraged from coming into office hours due to what is regularly a 2-3 hour long queue.*

I was a student in an upper division EECS class last year. I was at office hours once with 20+ students. There was one TA, who was there for one hour. Nonetheless, when that TA left, most of us were left no better off than we were before OH started. There were simply not enough people to staff that OH.

What would we do with more money? Staff OH properly. Hire more tutors for group tutoring! My course (CS 170) is difficult and people would benefit massively from small group tutoring, such that we can go through the algorithms and strategies together, and provide personalized feedback. We could afford to hire more people to read through your code and suggest best practices – who doesn’t want this? We could get rid of the rubrics for design docs that make it hard for you to really learn. We could make exams that actually test your knowledge, in a manner that’s far more equitable and far more thought-provoking than a small fill-in box, or bubble-in circle.

The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring. This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. *This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.*

**There's another, arguably more important side to it:**

GSIs, ASEs, and lecturers are heavily overworked and underpaid. Due to a lack of staff, we often have to take up extra work – we have to choose between our students and our own personal well-being. I've been forced to choose between a break in between my discussion and my office hours after a long day of work, or helping my students. This is tortuous because every single one of us feels a genuine, human obligation to our students. There are so many great things about teaching, and the university expects us to quietly bear the unnecessary hardships (overwork, underpay) just so we can do what we love. We as an academic community deserve to work with dignity – we should not be told to keep our heads down and suck it up. It is a job.

Lecturers often have to cover for the lack of funding and it hurts them immensely, not to mention the fact that it just isn’t fair. For GSIs in particular: GSIs are rent-burdened, overworked, and especially underpaid. They are people like anybody else, and should not have to be living paycheck to paycheck, if they’re even managing that. They deserve a living wage, especially here in the bay where everything is just unthinkably expensive.

**What you as a student can do:**

\- Show support for your staff on Ed. Tell them you support them. Heart their strike posts on Ed, it means a lot

\- Make a post on Ed encouraging TAs who are on strike to keep striking, ans TAs who aren’t on strike yet to start striking

\- Show up to the picket line. Visibility is super important in a strike.

\- [Sign the community support petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/uaw-undergraduate-letter-of-support?source=direct_link&).

\- Tell your friends who are indifferent about the strike why they should support the strike, and engage in proactive dialogues wrt the strike among your acquaintances.

**For those of you that feel that you have a duty to your students:**

Students are currently suffering, have been suffering, and will continue to face the consequences of understaffed courses until something changes. My heart sinks when I hear that my students are discouraged from coming into office hours because of 3-hour queues; I know, we all know that students greatly need more individualized support. Without any change, we will not be able to provide that which we know our students need. They deserve a better education than they are currently being provided, and in my opinion, fulfilling your duty to them means going on strike and picketing until UC can meet our demands. Only then will we be able to serve our students in the manner in which they should be served, as students at the #1 public university in the country.

**GSIs who are still going into work:**

\- You are likely overworked and underpaid.

\- There is little job security. For some PhD students, every semester is a new struggle to find funding, since not every PI has enough GSR funds, and GSI appointments are semester-by-semester

\- The quality of the education here will skyrocket with more funding. We will not have to resort to autograders and multiple choice questions – this means a more fulfilling, and more importantly less soulless, teaching experience.

EECS especially has had to deal with the brunt of the UC's unfair labor practices. Classes are universally understaffed, students cannot enroll in classes that they want or even need to take, lecturers and TAs are heavily overworked, and there is little job security for researchers and academic employees alike.

**Why we need to be out on the picket line:**

*Withholding labor is only half the battle.*

Picketing is so important because it gives us the visibility that is needed to make real change at the university-wide level. This visibility goes very far in showing the University how much power we, as the academic workers at the school, hold. We do a large majority of the work in the EECS department and the University must be made to understand how crucial we are as academic workers to the everyday-functioning of the school. No academic workers means no UC Berkeley. If we just sat at home and did nothing, the university would not care or notice. By making a lot of noise, it is unambiguously shown how many of us there are, and how much we are willing to do to be treated only fairly.

Plus! Picketing is fun! There is music, dancing, food, and all of your friends there along with you. You meet new people from different departments. You connect with others who are each there for their own reason. *These are valuable connections – anybody who’s friends with a grad student knows that it’s a great thing to have.*

**We are making history out there. There have been, there are, and there always will be many who would like to see the University of California made into a docile, lifeless machine – in the words of Mario Savio we must throw our bodies upon the gears, or we risk being enveloped eternally within them. See you on the picket line.**

Thank you for putting this together! Very well written :)
Bingo!!!! this guy gets it.  Good job.
I’m all for the strike, but looking at the goals I don’t see how higher paid GSIs is going to increase funding for more GSI’s and improved undergrad experience. It might make it worse if budgets are already set for a number of departments no?
This!! We all need to be vocal for change to happen on a large scale 💪

This post needs to be displayed at every picket line. Thanks for such a thoughtful, well written post that captures all of the reasons that many of us grad students are striking 👍

Genuine question here. I understand why it's necessary but sadly I don't know much about the financial situation of UC and I'm just wondering how the university is going to pay more once they reach an agreement with the union? Do they have a lot of extra money that they are spending on nonessential matters now (exceedingly high wages for administrators, buying random expensive things that only a few people use) or are they going to have to get the money from somewhere else (raising tuition, more funding from state gov, reallocating fund from sports or research)? If they are spending the money unwisely then they definitely need to use those money to pay our academic workers better. If they don't, does that mean researchers and atheletes will have less funding or we students have to pay a higher tuition?
OP post
I’m kinda confused on the budget for this, if salaries are increased and staffing is increased, where is the money coming from, higher tuition?
Quick question: Is my math here right? [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi_gsi_pay_gap_is_gsi_pay_really_only_16hour/)

I've been trying to understand the whole deal. Like I think right now UGSIs make $34/hour and GSIs make $16/hour. Is that right? And if the union wins that goes to $66/hour for UGSIs and $30 an hour for GSIs? 

I really hope you can get more money, especially for GSIs, but still honestly a little conflicted about the proposed UGSI pay if I'm understanding correctly. Like I can justify it that UGSIs can land really good internships, but if I'm just totally off base that'd also be good to know.
See hundreds of CS, EECS, DS and more students out on picket lines and supporting each other makes me so proud!   


The myth that engineers do not care and are uninvolved is clearly wrong!
I don't think the issue with CS is entirely due to low pay/benefits. CS is definitely overcrowded and deserve a larger share of the university budget overall, because it takes on a disproportionately higher teaching load.

What strike would do is put pressure to cut cost, which is already there. That's why CS is admitting fewer students and dropping graduation requirements right now.
The best way to support your GSIs is to post on Ed!  Make it known that you support them!
This is a really helpful post, thank you. I have a question about the $54,000/yr salary number. My understanding that is for 20 hrs/wk work. How can anyone expect to survive working only part-time? I know I am missing something so that is why I am asking, but it is unreasonable to me that people think they can take a part-time Job and that will support them. 

For examples, The literary workers in New York City are also striking right now. Many of them make around $40k/yr, have graduated from college, work full time and have to live in NYC.
This post is SO GOOD
I remember back when grad school was about school, and being a student was being a student...

...if someone referred to me as an ""Academic Worker"" I would be offended. I'm here to learn, and discover truth! I'm not here for a job. If I wanted a job, I'd have gone into industry.
Thank you Liam!!
Don’t forget defunding UC police.  You’re also on strike to defund UC police.
Fight for 66! ($66/hr and tuition reimbursement for uGSIs)
How would the strike lead to shorter office hours wait times? Higher wages would probably mean they hire fewer people right? That’s very simple microeconomics.
Stop harassing undergrads.
no on is gonna read this god damn book you just posted
I don’t go here. But what happens to your grades and Assignments? Is there concern over that or no?
Why don’t TAs just quit?

Everyplace is hiring.
Not exactly. In fact there are no discussions being held and (I believe) no OH being held either. As for Ed, the amount of support is nowhere near normal levels. Since Homework 12 is optional, I would assume most people have elected to focus their efforts elsewhere.
How does this reconcile with Justin scabbing?
I had the same question as well, as an alum who hasn't kept up with the situation. I had to re-read the post, but the OP does address it in the bottom of ""Why I'm on strike."" I take this to mean they're asking for an increase in headcount, and that puts pressure on departments / the school for higher hiring budgets? 

>**The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring.** This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.
Two separate demands at the bargaining table. Higher pay, as well as increased staffing. Also, happier GSI makes for better teaching in my opinion.
They're two separate demands. Yeah it does sound counterproductive at first to ask for more money AND more GSI positions, but honestly EECS is small compared to the entire UC system so even the higher cost per GSI is going to be irrelevant in the bigger picture.  Like increasing everyone's wages is going to cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year, so a small number of extra positions in one department at one campus is not a big deal, esp. if they resolve the UGSI / GSI pay gap issue (assuming it exists and I did my math right).
I’m honestly not optimistic about future CS undergrad exp. Waiting two hours for a 10 minute uGSI session (who barely knows the topic better than you do) does more than dissuading you from seeking help: it trains your ability to do independent work to the point where seeking help is not even a part of your mind when you enter upper div courses. The current revealed gap already seems unfulfillable, and just imagine how many hidden gaps we are missing here…
I think the additional hiring is for TAs, tutors, etc. not faculty.
This will come from UC central funding, not the department. UC has the money.
My worry is that if the university is forced to both pay more and hire more they just won’t offer classes every semester to balance it out
Very OP
Couple things to clear up. In reality they are working full time. They are working as research assistants, as well as student instructors. They teach, do their own research, help their professor with research, and have their own classes on top of that. They are not working 20 hours. They are working much more (Teaching + research). Next, there is a cap on how much they can work. They cannot get above 20 hours of pay. They are also in school for 5-7 years. Are we really to expect them to live paycheck to paycheck for that long? They are productive instructors and researchers/academics and deserve to make a living wage. They quite literally make this school function. I am glad the librarians are striking. The bay area is quite expensive as well. Grad students have also graduated from college. We want this to be setting a benchmark for academic salary and hopefully other schools/organizations will follow suit for fair pay.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs.

If Berkeley wants to remain competitive as a top grad school, it needs top talent. To obtain top talent, it needs to get as close as it can to what other schools can offer. If top graduate students stop coming here, Berkeley very quickly devolves into a teaching school. Without good GSRs to do the ""grunt"" work for them, PIs would be less productive. Without good GSIs that can alleviate the effort of teaching, faculty would have more work teaching, and be less productive. Faculty choose to remain at Berkeley, despite the lower pay, because of the human capital: other faculty and high quality graduate students.

So it is ok for you to think that Berkeley shouldn't pay grad students for ""part time work"", just understand that it would just lead to destroying grad programs here and improving grad programs elsewhere.

From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge. Knowledge creates technology, which has massive spillovers/positive externalities. Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.
why does this subreddit has so much astroturfing

there honestly needs to be a limit on karma/account age before you can comment or post outside of the main Q&A megathread
Fuck off, and stop posting in bad faith about the most obscure corner of the proposal that 99% of people don't care about.
come back to reality
Context: This is for 20 hour GSI/head TA. This amounts to 54k a year, which is calculated based on the cost of living in the bay, as well as to make sure GSIs are not rent burdened, which is defined as spending more than 30% of income on rent.  This is the GSIs primary income. They are capped at 20 hours. They cannot get paid for more than that. For all their research and teaching, 54k what they should receive.
Holy fuck uGSIs are asking for A LOT more than what grad students get paid if true.
Ok, if you want to make more money than what a google internship pays, better become a C++ cow and work for Citadel.
Two separate demands. One for higher wages. The other specifically for increased EECS staffing. The increased staffing will lead to shorter OH wait times.
I personally haven't seen this behavior on my own picket line, but I personally have experienced jeering from some other picketers while walking to the library when I took a shift off. I really hope this isn't the norm for most picket lines, and I don't think it is. I'll make sure to talk to the people on my picket line for sure and some of the union leaders about this issue!
Fucker Carlson strikes again
Ah gotcha is this an eecs specific point?
Question for you, realistically what is the chance that both demands got fufilled? I wholeheartedly wish that can happen. I can definately see that EECS enrollment is impacted by short staffing and budget cut, and there have been lectures asking for more budget to the department as well. Hiring 50% more will improve undergrads experience, but bring this up under a post that advocate for GSIs higher pay is confusing as these demand conflits with each other.

It's not librarians. It is people at HarperCollins - literary workers in the publishing industry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html)

Well, I really want to support the strike so need to keep learning and will continue to do my best in that. Right now it seems you have lots of options, including coming back to school to get advanced degrees. Are they not allowed to work outside of the university? People like me worked 3 jobs just to be able to go to college and get my undergraduate degree. After college we worked 2 or sometimes 3 jobs to be able to afford to live where we live, had roommates and ate at happy hours. I am not unsympathetic, sincerely trying to understand but at the moment it doesn't sound like slave labor to me.
I'd be really interested in the net cost differences between Cal and similarly ranked programs because for instate undergrad there is a huge difference in cost vs. similarly ranked (mostly private) schools. Is that not the case for grad school?

And do note, I don't think Berkeley should not pay their part-time grad workers, but in my ignorance, I don't think $54k/yr is gawd awful pay. Median income in Alameda County is $45,882. Thank you for taking the time to give more food for thought. I appreciate it and do hope working conditions improve and a fair wage is worked out.
It's not obscure and it's abhorrent. Get the union to take it off so we can stop getting distracted by it. People DO care about it and it worries people that the union would be so stupid. What other stupid things might they do in the name of caring for their workers. For better or worse, members need to keep their leadership straight!
I’m just stating what the union is asking for / what the strike is all about
Devil's Advocate question. Why is it expected that GSIs be able to earn a living wage off of a 20 hour position? Both undergraduate and professional schools expect you to have negative net income, with the assumption future salary more than outweighs the costs.
Why would it be for 20 hours? My understanding is that you guys often put in 40 hours of work per week, so why not put in for reclassification as 40-hour per week full-time employees with the same salary? That is what I presumed was being advocated for this whole time, as it makes the most sense.
You have to keep in mind that the UC relies on the legal fiction that grad students only work 20 hours per week.
Unless things have changed since my day, uGSIs with 10 hour appointments make bank (well over $50/hour) thanks to the fee waivers.
So shorter office hours for EECS and longer for other classes?
That would really help the perception of the strike I believe.
Yes this is EECS specific but, to my understanding, it is the first time the UC has ever allowed bargaining over staffing for any department so this is a step in the right direction for everyone else
Sounds like it
The raise would bankrupt the department, but the union is saying the university should fund the increased staff levels AND the raises. The union site says the total cost of the whole thing is only 3% of the UC budget.
It’s super common for PhD students to be restricted from having any other jobs or if generous be limited to say 10 hrs/wk. For masters students it can be different, but PhD students are limited to the salary the UC and their department set for typically 5-7 years of their 20s and/or 30s.
You're missing the main point: grad students are not like undergrads. They're not like students at all, except for the first year or two of the program. PhD students in particular are expected to work extreme hours on their research, with teaching being something they fit in as they can. This research is not generally some self-directed thing for the educational benefit of the student. It is actual directed work necessary to maintain the universities standing, and continue to bring grant funds in. 

When I was a PhD student, my advisor made it very clear that he expected 60 hours of work a week. The fact that this is recorded as a 'part-time' 20 hours a week job is just a legal fiction that allows the University to avoid labor laws. GSRs and GSIs are direct employees of the university, and they are absolutely expected to work more than full time for that employer, regardless of what is put on paper to avoid paying benefits.
I think the point is we don't want grad students workers to have to work 2 or 3 full time jobs to survive. Again, they don't have much time on their hands after doing their own research, helping their professor with research, taking classes, studying for qualifying exams, as well as running EECS classes. I'd say they barely have enough time to do all that I just listed. Given that, finding outside work isn't that feasible in my opinion. For more perspective on understanding this, talk to some grad students and hear them out directly. I personally can only say what I've heard grad students tell me, but I'm sure if you talk to some yourself, you'll find some answers.
Nobody is getting 54k a year today. Mine is 30, many programs pay 24.

What do you mean by net cost? Tuition is funded by the departments.
It's about a lot more. You are focusing on literally the most controversial sounding piece of the proposal. UGSIs aren't that common across the whole system and you are trying to shoot down the whole strike because some relatively tiny group of people is going to make $66/hour under the current proposal (which is subject to change). You are totally ignoring the other 47000 people going on strike. See [https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/](https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/), like people literally cant afford to be grad students at Berkeley despite working 40 hours or more per week.
As a grad student I struggle with this question all the time and I don’t have a good answer. Because we do get tuition covered as part of our compensation package. One issue is that if we can’t afford to live here we will just go somewhere else where pay does have better correlation to cost of living. Another argument is that we should actually restructure graduate education as whole since PhD programs in other countries are considered jobs. 
If someone has a better answer I would love to see it! Because I support a lot of these initiatives and would love to get paid more but can make sense of UC’s “logic”
Because graduate students after the first year or two are basically working full time for the university for its benefit. At the beginning I think they all take classes, but eventually they're either in a lab 40 hours per week or they're teaching 20 hours a week and doing 20+ hours of research. 

I don't know much about professional schools, but I assume that students in them are mostly taking classes and doing assignments, rather than providing 40+ hours of valuable labor to their school.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs.

So it is ok for you to think that Berkeley shouldn't pay grad students for ""part time work"", just understand that it would just lead to destroying grad programs here and improving grad programs elsewhere.

From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are *producers* of knowledge instead of *consumers* of knowledge. Knowledge creates technology, which has massive spillovers/positive externalities. Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.
What I'm saying is, according to what the union proposed on the salary adjustment, uGSI will get much more than grad students if the union won(66 vs \~30). So the pay gap between undergrads and grads will look even worse if you are implying grad students typically works more than 20 hrs.
Here's the thing. The UC budget is almost entirely salaries. The budget is also siloed, the medical centers/hospitals operate under a separate budget then the teaching parts.

What the union is proposing is firing/layoffs for probably 5% of the non hospital people (5% of the salaries, really) and taking that money and using it to up the pay of the people on strike.

It's not a bad idea, but it's just hard to imagine the university actually doing it 

I mean Elon musk just cut 50% of Twitter and that seems to be still functioning. So maybe the UC could do something similar.
So how is being able to get a PhD not a privilege? Who gets to go to school that long and not have to save money in order to do it? Doesn't getting a PhD generally increase your earning potential? I am not saying that I don't value education and in fact, I value education for the sake of it, but I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system. Which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing but perhaps someone should say that instead of saying they are rent-deprived.
Sooo, what I am hearing from you is that these employers (advisors, etc) are massively breaking the employment laws in California. It is interesting to me you would strike before reporting these horrendous breaches. Has that route ever been taken?
Will do. No one is suggesting 2-3 full time jobs, part-time jobs. Its sounding pretty privileged to me. I will keep asking and learning...
Nope. The most controversial is the defunding, deactivating of any police allowed on campus.
Wait, in what countries? Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc, and it's not like that up north...
So in some programs, the grant research directly tied to the dissertation, but sometimes the paid research might be different from the research for dissertation. Since 12 credit hours of research for a degree is separate from the 20 paid hours. 

Yes I support the strike and the initiatives being bargained for! I am not trying to undermine it with this. I just think the big picture of grad students as students instead of workers needs to shift at the university level across academia in general and thats a much bigger task.
>From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition.

Honestly, I'm really skeptical of this argument.  Competitive industries do not have labor strikes -- pay disputes are resolved by workers switching companies and not accepting offers at underpaying ones.   I'm guessing UC does not actually see that effect or they would have already been incentivized to act.

>From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge.

I think this is a more relevant argument to my question. It does seem to be a systemic problem though (UC if anything is put at a competitive disadvantage paying so much above market); I guess you need to start somewhere though. GL.
We are also advocating for 20 hour GSIs to be compensated at 54k yearly as well.
Ah, I missed the 'u'. Personally, I've always felt that it doesn't make sense to have undergrads receive the TA stipends with fee coverage, but I guess the department does need TAs. It does seem like a bit of a disservice to the other undergrads, though...

But yea, $66/hr plus fee waiver is kind of nonsensical for undergrads.
Sure it’s a privilege. For me personally, I didn’t feel like I could do it until I worked for a few years after undergrad and had some savings to fall back on because the pay is so low. It really depends on the field and career track as to whether it increases earning potential. For me, I’ll make the same or slightly more (will take a long time to make up for these years if ever), but I hope it’ll bring me a livable wage doing something more intellectually challenging than my previous track. Those who end up as adjuncts within academia, a path academia created for PhDs, may be on a worse salary trajectory than without a PhD. 

However, the UC has a stated goal of promoting diversity and inclusion within higher education. Right now, the pay is a huge barrier to that goal. Lower income students are less likely to get there in the first place, and they’re also much more likely to drop out due to financial hardship bc their stipend doesn’t cover the cost of living. After you graduate you’re encouraged to then go make low pay/minimal benefits for additional years as a postdoc in the hopes of landing one of the few coveted tenure track roles. Anecdotally, it’s obvious to me that a lot of students in my program get frequent/monthly parental support to supplement their income, which means their families are in a relatively comfortable situation. If the UC is serious about bringing a broader range of people into academia, pay needs to be higher. Otherwise, it’s just talk and academia will continue to be a place dominated by people with wealthy and/or professor parents.
>I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system.

They ARE trying to change the system, they see the current system as exploitative and unfair, and there are merits to that argument (see OPs post).  It varies department by department,  research lab by research lab, and class by class on whether it actually is exploitative, and if so, how much.

Some grad students have to be a GSI most every semester because they don't have any GSR funding, yet are still expected to do research.  If the research is advancing the status of their lab and furthering efforts of research grants (rather than themselves), that strikes me as quite exploitative.  If they are doing independent research on an esoteric topic that no one is willing to fund, the question is why should that be supported by taxpayers or tuition or.... ?  (Where else is the money coming from?)

Grad students who are primarily paid as GSRs, and whose GRS appointments from their PI's grants/funding are bumped to 100% in the summer months (this is allowed and happens in some engineering departments), and who have reasonable career paths in and outside of academia after graduation... These people probably deserve a raise too (hello inflation!), but they don't seem exploited.  There is zero recognition by the union that there IS training going on beyond just first year classes.  Grad students are generally much much less productive researchers than post-docs.

GSI's who are working more than 20 hours a week average on instruction tasks should immediately raise this to the instructor and more staff should be hired - this is not OK and is exploitative.  Extreme expectations on research time for GSRs is also not OK.

The demand for fully subsidized childcare really gets to me, even though I generally support subsidized childcare.  There are programs for low income people to get childcare grants and these should be expanded / easier to access / less waiting.  But there is no special reason a grad student (who could be married to a high paid tech worker) deserves free childcare more than a retail employee, and no reason UC should be responsible for implementing this huge social benefit (that democrats tried and failed to pass).

A sizable wage increase and some other things, I support 100%.  Not to ""both sides..."" this, but.... there is a side to it beyond the reddit narrative.  
(edit, typo)
You'd think so, but nope! The UC has explicit exemption from many of the employment laws that apply to all other employers. Neat, huh?
Graduate student positions are created as half-time appointments to enable students to spend the other 50% of their time on independent research. To encourage this, many graduate students are contractually prohibited from taking a second job  during the 20 hours/wk that we not compensated for. We are stuck in a position where we are only compensated half time, but not allowed to seek outside employment. This is what is causing a lot of the disconnect between public-facing UC messaging and graduate student demands. There is no way they will give us full-time appointments, so we have to push for higher compensation for what is on paper a half-time appointment but is in reality an all-consuming job.
The 50% threshold is actually because it’s a requirement for international students to be on student visas, not because PhD students are expected to work only those hours
>Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc,

Where are you getting this?
Most PhD programs in Europe pay very well with less teaching load, actually.
Interesting! Hmm, yeah if someone is getting funded by a grant from the government or however that works, it does seem complicated if all of the sudden they are twice as expensive.
If you are skeptical, go around a group of grad students and ask them where they had offers from and why they chose Berkeley.   


Competitive industries most certainly have strikes, but even if you assume that they don't, there are several reasons why grad school acceptance is not a perfectly competitive market, most importantly the fact that it is something that you can only choose once and switching costs are incredibly high. Your argument is basically ""I won't take a 100 dollar bill from the floor, since if it was real, someone else would already have taken it"".   


UC did not see the effect because grad students just accepted it quietly. Several departments pay an extra stipend to try to compete with other schools, but since the majority of pay comes from GSI/GSR appointments it was not enough.
Apparently few other ppl in the comments and them are referring to this post, and it's literally 66/hr vs half the amount for GSI instead of same pay.

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/
This is THE best post on this I've seen. Thank you. Helps so much!  And for the record, I did state that changing the system is not necessarily a bad thing but I was just looking for someone to say that instead of complaining that people can't pay their rent. Thank you again.
I'd heard the Regents are an entity unto themselves and somehow incredibly powerful. Maybe this strike should be the beginning a tearing that corruption down.
Exactly! It’s complex accounting. In stem especially we are often paid out of fellowships or grants, with GSI positions filling in gaps where needed. These grants are often funded by government, and the university takes a cut of the grant for admin costs while another portion goes to the student and student’s fees. As a result the university doesn’t pay much for GSRs at all but reaps the benefits of the work being done. So when it’s sold to us as educational experience and a degree, instead of a paid job, it’s a little bs. I imagine there are logistics that would go into how grants would have to be allocated to cover these costs without just having to ask for more money in grants, if the university continues to take a large percentage of them, but that is research I’ll get into another day.

The GSI budget comes from the university/dept and so that is a whole issue that I rely on the union for because I have less experience on that front."
Don't forget to say hi to your professors or one day it may too late. R.I.P.

Next to passing on what they taught you to others, living on in your memory and appreciation is about the best they (or any of us) could hope for.  But yes, it's wonderful to appreciate them while they are still around to say ""hey"" too.
Had him in a freshman seminar a year before he passed. He was awesome. Even though I kept falling asleep in class because my sleep schedule was fucked up. He was super nice and always tried his best to make class fun and interesting. RIP
