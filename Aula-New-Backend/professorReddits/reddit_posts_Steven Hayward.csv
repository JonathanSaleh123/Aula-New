Climate Change Denier Steven Hayward Now Teaching At UC Berkeley. And I Am In His Class.,https://skepticsrebuttal.com/2017/01/28/climate-change-denier-steven-hayward-now-teaching-at-uc-berkeley-and-i-am-in-his-class/,2017-01-28 16:15:21,,"I would love to hear his reasoning, in fact all of cnr would love to hear his reasoning
He should take some classes here. Much like evolution, nearly everyone who denies it doesn't actually know what it is/how it works.
Disgusting. Climate change deniers are anti-science and extremely dangerous to the world when put in positions of power. It was already bad that we have one as president. Now we have one educating students with falsehoods or alternative facts.
Bring it up.  Every day.
How you going to deny the climate? Nobody can do that. This man would be the worst weather man on television. The school would be better off hiring my best bud Harry to teach a class. Harry lives everyday by the climate, so he would be a good source. I on the other hand dont worry about the climate because one day a solar flare is gonna fry all our ipads, and cell phones.

These people don't deserve a platform to explain their alternative science. Gives them the impression that their argument had any weight to begin with.

And yet it seems to be the best response to bad speech is better speech.

There is nothing more anti science than the suppression of dissent, no matter how certain its falsehood.

Lol. We've come a long way from Berkeley's famous free speech movement, haven't we.

Freedom within the constraint of causing no harm = freedom

Freedom within the constraint of causing no offence = no freedom.

The irony is that this resistance to professorial authority has become its own new authority, but one which will broach no dissent.
>alternative science
Tldr it was cold so cc doesn't exist.
Most of the blog is amateur hour 
So should UC Berkeley start having creationists teach biology classes.  Just to be *fair* and all?

Even though everyone is entitled free speech - this does not mean they are entitled to an audience, and UC Berkeley is giving him that.  It would be different if we were just talking about a difference of opinion, but at this point people denying climate change are either willfully ignorant or lying - both of which are perfectly fine criteria to disqualify someone from teaching at a university.
Reprimanding someone for their idiocy is not suppression of dissent.  If anything, it's amplification of dissent for the purposes of rebuttal.
I'm going to suppress your stupid opinion by blocking you.

Free speech? *Mutilated*.

Flawless victory.

It's not about offending with climate change.  It's just being plain wrong.  It's not a matter of opinion.  ""Incompetent people shouldn't be teaching"" - has nothing to do with ""Free Speech"".
> So should UC Berkeley start having creationists teach biology classes. Just to be fair and all?

Well, Boalt does have [John Yoo](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/john-yoo/) on staff, currently teaching a course in [advanced Constitutional Law](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/courses/coursePage.php?cID=18407). This is the same gentleman who wrote that there was [precedent for enhanced interrogation](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/international/24MEMO-GUIDE.html), or torture as most of us laypeople know it. 
Your point about creationists teaching biology would be valid if he were teaching a class on climatology, but he's teaching political science.

In any case, [this](https://www.desmogblog.com/steven-f-hayward) is apparently a quote from him:
>“The planet is warming. Human beings are playing a substantial role in that warming. How large that warming is going to be and how we ought to respond to it is still an open question.”

which doesn't appear to make him a ""denier"". I've never heard about this guy before, but at first glance it seems to me that OP has blown this way out of proportion. 
Dissent should be shadow banned? What more could a tyrant want?
Isn't that what I said? Go ahead. Reprimand your lecturer. Ask him questions. Challenge his authority.
Oh, that's interesting. Does that work?
While I agree with that sentiment, I think this issue goes beyond that. Denial of something like climate change speaks volumes of his academic character, regardless of whether or not he is familiar with the field. If he understands the concept and chooses to deny it, then his adamance in rejecting the notion of climate change demonstrates how he obstinately clings to beliefs that have literally no backing. If he adheres to his beliefs (including those unrelated to his area of expertise) by rejecting truth and accepting (usually money-based) falsehoods, then he shouldn't be an academic. On the other hand, if he doesn't know enough about climate change, then he shouldn't be voicing his beliefs on it, since he (I'm 99.9% sure) has no idea what he's talking about. In this case, his denial also portrays his incompetency. If you don't know something, admit it and leave it to the professionals, or learn more and become a professional.
Have you read Mill's ""On Liberty""? Sorry for asking.

Anyway, he gives a long series of examples from history where what was then taken to be certainly false is nite believed to be true. I'm sure you could think of a few.

He also argues that truth will be better illuminated if false ideas are allowed to state their case the better to be shown to be false in comparison with the true ones.

Your analogy with creationism seems to me false.

Anyway, it turns out he's not even teaching this stuff. He is teaching law.
Yeah, reading more about this, I'm inclined to agree.  It would be different if he were going off on rants about the subject constantly, but this seems like a bit of a witch-hunt instead.
 [ content removed by poster ]
Sure, it's always possible that our analysis of climate change is wrong.  But it is *definitely* wrong to argue that the current overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is anything but ""climate change is a man-made phenomenon"".

But anyways, I do agree, that if he isn't teaching this stuff, then it shouldn't be a problem.  If he's interrupting his lecture to go on off-topic and factually incorrect rants, then we have a problem.
I see your point. However, I offer a counterpoint of my own! :)  
What he says on his personal blog depicts what kind of person he is. For example, if he were to spout extremely bigoted remarks on his blog, it would be a reflection of his character. Despite his expertise and insight in another field, I think it is more than fair to scorn his appointment as an academic at an institution such as this.
But that was Mill's point. The overwhelming consensus had been wrong, by our present lights. Even they cannot be relied upon.

The light of truth may arise from a small voice much reviled and derided, yet capable of delivering great riches in the fullness of time.

There really is no greater danger to knowledge than relying on convention. 

Science does not proceed by acceptance of convention.

Are you afraid that if he goes off piste in his lectures the vulnerable minds of students will be corrupted. How persuasive his false ideas must be. What dark power they possess.

Are the students so far from the inviolable status of your understanding that you must be the arbiter of truth on their behalf?

Herein lies grave danger. I believe it to be the first faltering step on the short road to the gulags.

    
I think you're missing my point.  It's one thing for the overwhelming consensus to be wrong.  But it's another thing (a lie, in fact) to deny that an overwhelming consensus exists - which is what most (all?) mainstream climate change denies do.  Maybe he's presenting an elaborate data-based argument in his law class...but somehow I doubt it.  Heck claims of his climate-change denial are probably overblown in this article anyways, rendering this all a moot point.

It'd be one thing if he was an actual climate scientist, railing against the convention, standing before his students and saying ""look, most scientists believe X but I believe Y and here's why"" -> insert argument based on data here.  I'd be in support of that just fine - presuming the data analysis made sense and wasn't, like, the incoherent ramblings of a madman (different approaches are ok, but there has to be *some* quality control).  
> It'd be one thing if he was an actual climate scientist, railing against the convention, standing before his students and saying ""look, most scientists believe X but I believe Y and here's why"" -> insert argument based on data here. 

This is the line which Lindzen (MIT) and Friis-Christensen (Copenhagen) take, who argue (in inexact terms) that the models which predict a feedback loop fail to accurately account for greater levels of cloud formation, which would increase global albedo (how much light is is reflected off of the planet, due to whiteness). Their idea is that you will experience a rise in global temperatures (bad), but that after a relatively short period of time temperatures will stabilize (good). 

As far as I know, these guys are the only two heavyweight academics in the field who are still skeptics, although I did see a paper which came out of Tel-Aviv last year which made a confusing argument about the long term (on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years) impact of our position in the spiral arm of the galaxy and global temperature.

I'm not saying that this is your position, but I have seen a sentiment expressed on campus, even by professors like Kurt Spreyer (he's a very nice guy, but mistaken on this) that even experts disagreeing with other experts should not be given a platform to speak, let alone teach. I disagree with this strongly. Even if they are wrong, you really want smart, qualified experts who disagree with the consensus to exist in the field to continue error checking established theories, just in case something important was actually missed.

Obviously people speaking as if they were experts in fields which they are not experts... ლ(ó﹏òლ)"
Berkeley Professor and Trump Supporter Steven Hayward: Calling The Race Too Soon,https://skepticsrebuttal.com/2017/01/31/steven-hayward-calling-the-race-too-soon/,2017-01-31 00:41:08,,"[deleted]
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/the-democrats-real-turnout-problem.html

Republican Turnout grew while Democratic turnout stagnated.  No enthusiasm for Hillary meant DEMOCRATS DID NOT TURN OUT TO VOTE.  Historically the majority of Americans identify as Democrats, but democrats have a harder time getting their voters to the polls.  

A single electoral vote in states like wyoming, montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota represent far fewer people than in other states due to these states getting 3 mandatory electoral votes and having such a small population.  These states also have lower levels of education than the majority of the country and in particular states like California, New York, Massachussets, Maryland, Colorado, and Connecticut, The most educated states that all voted Democrat."
Steven Hayward Refuses To Condemn Anti Transgender Speech By Milo Yiannopolous - The Skeptic's Rebuttal,https://skepticsrebuttal.com/2017/02/02/steven-hayward-refuses-condemn-anti-transgender-speech-milo-yiannopolous/,2017-02-02 17:06:30,,"Wow.. What a dogshit article. The author doesn't even provide examples of Milo's""anti-trans hate speech.""
The author strikes me as a bitter, easily triggered child that can't tolerate disagreement. If the Professor doesn't give a shit an edgy teenager was offended by a gay attention whore, edgy teenagers could leave him alone. 
I hope Trump sends the military after ""anti-fascist"" domestic terrorists and Berkeley's fat fuck of a mayor.
I kind of read the whole thing as: ""Say what I want you to say and say it exactly how I want you to say it, and say it right now, or else I'll write you up in my blog as a bigot."""
"Daily Cal Senior Editorial Board on conservative scholar Steven Hayward: ""Just because people have the constitutional right to say what they want doesn't mean they should. ... [he'll] reinforce many students' preconceived notions of conservatives as out-of-touch, old-fashioned, bigoted white men.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/09/06/steven-haywards-faults-wont-fly-campus/,2016-09-06 20:31:24,,"Saying they don't want students to be able to hear him just comes off as babying to me. If you're at Cal, you're an adult, and you either can already form your own opinions or ought to take the opportunity to learn how to. Even if it's about issues or arguments you may find uncomfortable.

Also, it seems like the editors are aware the man wants to take the opportunity to get as much exposure as possible, yet they're still taking the bait by writing about him. The only point they manage to get across is that their jimmies are rustled, which seems to be exactly what he wants.
It's funny that even in a university which prides itself on diversity of various kinds - racial, cultural, religious, etc. - the one type of diversity which is consistently not tolerated and shunned is intellectual diversity. Or in other words, the only kind that really matters at all. Absolutely pathetic from the Senior Editorial Board. 
It's not a preconceived notion. Rather, it's an impression that I've built up over years of observation of bigots who identify as conservative. The fact that Drumpf is the choice of conservatives for POTUS is all you need to understand conservatism. It's toxic and has no place on this progressive campus.

If you think ""intellectual diversity"" includes racism, bigotry, and misogyny, you may be a conservative."
"Conservative professor Steven Hayward: ""Where did today’s crusaders for social justice acquire their perceptions of injustice? Considered candidly, it would have to trace back to the dead white guys who founded the liberal tradition, like Locke and Kant, who are typically rubbished or unread today.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/09/30/conservative-thought-necessary-campus-growth/,2016-10-02 20:37:42,,"Woah that's racist /s

What, does he think ""liberals"" are going to suddenly denounce what he believes to be the foundation of their philosophy because the philosphers where white?
People do read Locke, at least in high school government and I'm sure in some RC courses.

No one reads Kant because he is completely incomprehensible. Even to philosophy majors, his main ideas are consistently misunderstood, and sure, some of it is because his ideas are complex and revolutionary, but a good amount of it is because his writing is terrible. Even something easier than The Critique of Pure Reason's synthetic a priori like his categorical imperative is almost always misinterpreted by readers. But here's one of Kant's interesting and accessible concepts: perpetual peace, guidelines for establishing permanent peace in an area: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_peace.

This is the same reason most feminists haven't Judith Butler, but they have read (for example) bell hooks or even de Beauvoir.
Those white guys founded the liberal tradition, not the ""you can't racist to white people and manspreading is a central issue"" tradition.
It's not completely unlikely, with the most vocal people on the social justice circuit sounding at least a bit similar to this.
>de Beauvoir

You're giving them too much credit."
