UC Berkeley PhD Alumna and former Professor Carolyn R. Bertozzi wins Nobel Prize in Chemistry,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2022/press-release/,2022-10-05 02:59:17,,"HELL FUCKIN YWAH GO CAROLYN

GO BEARS
My favorite trivia bit about Prof. Bertozzi (from her Wikipedia) ""while an undergraduate, she played in various bands. Her most notable one was Bored of Education, which included *future Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello*.""
Hell yeah, Prof. Bertozzi! I took her class. She was a fantastic lecturer.

Some people like to say the best researchers make the shittiest teachers, but I beg to differ. I took classes with Prof. Bertozzi and Prof. Schekman, and they really were some of the best profs I had as an MCB student. I learned a lot, I understood the material, and the stuff I learn stuck with me.

For all the hardship and challenges, these are the rewards of being here at Berkeley. You get to study under the best of the best.
That’s amazing. More than anything I’m glad this year’s Nobel in Chemistry didn’t go to a team of biologists.
GO BEARS!
GO BEARS LETS FUCKIN GOOOO
Holy shit that’s badass
[Tom shouted her out on twitter.](https://twitter.com/tmorello/status/1577694126610337795?s=20&t=01YZ0_QGfIw735AYlyn3dg) and Prof Bertozzi responded with [some photos](https://twitter.com/CarolynBertozzi/status/1577751356198162432?s=20&t=01YZ0_QGfIw735AYlyn3dg)"

Big loss for our bio dept.
Damn, that's very unfortunate. She's basically one of the legends alongside Doudna and others. 
She and Doudna are definite Nobel candidates. 
Agreed, either for the next one or soon after. There are whole labs devoted to CRISPR right now so it's definitely the game changer that the committee looks for in candidates. 

Thankfully they've also brought on a ton of new faculty in the last 2-ish years from some great places so hopefully Bertozzi's move to Stanford can be healed, even if just a little."
