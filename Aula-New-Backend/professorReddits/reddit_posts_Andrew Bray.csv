How is Andrew Bray for stat 20?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/o5k3de/how_is_andrew_bray_for_stat_20/,2021-06-22 03:43:23,"Hi!

I haven't found many recent reviews and I'm a bit worried about taking the class with my other courses. Thanks!","He’s a deadset legend.
Had him for data 100, he was amazing! Very helpful and approachable during OH. He also remade the lectures halfway through the semester since students were tired of watching stuff from previous semesters
He taught data 100 this past sem. 10/10 he’s so cool
Thanks all of you guys! :)
is there a lot of r programming in his stats 20 class?"
Someone I know closely says that Stat20 final in the fall semester was way different from the quizzes and classwork. taking stat 20 this sem with Prof. Andrew Bray any advice on good books/ coursework ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18oth49/someone_i_know_closely_says_that_stat20_final_in/,2023-12-22 16:42:53,,"Go on the class website stat20.org and save the pages before they get wiped for next semester, don’t worry about understanding everything to the detail just try to get a head start on the vocabulary and code so it doesn’t surprise you. The site also includes resources I think
I agree with this. To OP: on every webpage for the homework readings do Ctrl + P (command + P for mac users) and select Save as PDF for the printer option."
Stat 20 professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wkikwq/stat_20_professor/,2022-08-09 16:56:02,"Can anyone recommend a professor for Stat20 for this fall? For fall there is Iain Carmichael, Shobhana Murali Stoyanov, Jeremy Sanchez, and Andrew Bray (waitlist tho).

I'm currently enrolled for Stoyanov but I saw some comments from ratemyprofessor and trying to get some opinions from others. I'm an intended econ major so I hope to meet the gpa requirement to declare this semester :,)","Jeremy Sanchez was my GSI last semester and Andrew Bray was my prof last semester. Both of them are really nice and helpful, I would say Jeremy is really new so I’m not sure how he would teach in a big lecture class but if u attend his office hours and ask questions you should be fine with him!
Andrew Bay all the way!
i had stoyanov (asynch) and her exams were in-person and we were allowed 4 pg cheat sheets. her coursework is decently doable but her lecturing is not the best. class is curved as well so you should be fine if u can score above avg and take the time to review concepts wo being lecture dependent.
Andrew Bray for sure! If this isn't too late, I had him for Stat 20 and had an absolutely amazing time in his class."
