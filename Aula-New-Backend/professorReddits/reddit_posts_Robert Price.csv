Robert Reich column on Berkeley vs. Big Soda,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/berkeley-vs-big-soda_b_5786028.html,2014-09-10 18:13:04,,"Muh Freedom
The proposal doesn't make healthier options at the store any cheaper.  And the tax doesn't go to public water fountains.  The tax isn't slated for anything in particular.  There is a committee which will hold meetings to decide how the revenue will be spent.  The Berkeley committee system is sluggish, and wrought with political cronyism.  

The wording is odd: ""sweeteners used to sweeten such drinks, but exempting: (1) sweeteners...""  

The long form of the proposal mentions that natural fruit juices sweetened with sugar are exempt.  But the ballot question only says 100% juice is exempt, making it seem like juices sweetened with sugar are not exempt.  
A similar tax failed to pass in Richmond last election. The ABA advertised heavily about how bad it was for local business, and I think that had a major influence on the voting outcome. This article is pretty dramatic though.
I think governments have an obligation to taxpayers to influence society away from behaviors that burden everyone else. Use the tax money to educate people to avoid high sugar diets and also support the costs that type II diabetics and the obese place on the economy. People can continue drinking that crap all they want, but now they have to pay their share of the price everyone else had to pay.
Jesus Christ this is such horseshit. ""Big soda""? Give me a fucking break.
Of course companies that sell soda are upset about this. Why shouldn't they be? All they want is to sell a product to consenting adults who want to enjoy a coke...why the fuck does the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to legislate peoples' health choices?

Sometimes I really hate this city. Soda is unhealthy, I know, but people should have the right to make their own goddamn choices without some fucking bureaucrat deciding what's right for them. I can't believe that the city of Berkeley thinks it has a right to charge fucking adults for making their own choices regarding beverages. This is such a waste of the city government's time.

And why the fuck would any rational person compare the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda (if such a right even exists) to the fight for free speech? What the fuck is Robert Reich smoking? Does he really think these two things are comparable?

Sorry for all the cursing, I'm pretty drunk and fucking pissed off.
I think its great if this passes. Soda's making people unhealthy. Since we  subsidize HFCS production, a tax on sugar later on seems like a logical step to equalize prices. 
>There is a committee which will hold meetings to decide how the revenue will be spent.

Actually it's not even as good as that. The committee will make general spending recommendations but if they try to direct the actual tax amount (in a 1:1 ratio or anything close) they'll run afoul of the law since taxes for specific purposes require a 2/3 majority vote.

So how much of the money raised by the tax will end up funding health programs for kids or whatever is anybody's guess.
>Use the tax money to educate people to avoid high sugar diets and also support the costs that type II diabetics and the obese place on the economy.

They can't.

All the money raised by Measure D goes directly into the General Fund. Setting up a special fund like that would have required a 2/3 vote.

This tax is also so vaguely written that it includes things virtually all sports drinks, coconut water, almond milk, etc. Basically almost any liquid drink that has added sugar in it, even if it's very small amounts.
It's not a a soda ban; it's a soda tax.  Cigarette companies also want to sell a product to consenting adults.  Is it bad to tax cigarettes and donate the money to lung cancer research?  Is it wrong to tax luxury goods and redistribute the taxes to less wealthy people?  It depends on the role you think the government should have in society.  But if cigarettes are  taxed, people in Berkeley will buy less soda and will be healthier because of it.  
> the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to legislate peoples' health choices

The city of Berkeley is not some outside entity imposing arbitrary rules on the helpless population. This measure was put on the ballot by collecting sufficient signatures from the residents of Berkeley, and now the people get to vote on it. It's called democracy.

>people should have the right to make their own goddamn choices without some fucking bureaucrat deciding what's right for them.

They can still choose to drink as much soda as they want. And this law hasn't been made up by some bureaucrat.

>the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda

That's not what's happening.

Obesity and diabetes are already at epidemic levels, and we have a responsibility to prevent the next generation from suffering the same fate. If this law means that 5% fewer children develop diabetes at a young age, then I think it's worth the extra $0.12 per can that the distributors will be paying for distributing these drinks to them.
> And why the fuck would any rational person compare the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda (if such a right even exists) to the fight for free speech?

If anything, the opposite would apply: Freedom of speech is analogous to freedom of consumption.
""legislate peoples health choices"" ?! It's just a tax and isn't a high one. You can chug all the soda you want.

I do think Bloomberg's ban on 16oz soda or whatever was pretty stupid for the reasons you outline.

> And why the fuck would any rational person compare the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda (if such a right even exists) to the fight for free speech?

Because they both happened in Berkeley. Reich says it's not as dramatic, so calm down. And he makes a link at the end between this and Citizens United.
RIP /u/throwawayheyheyneigh's freedom. 
What we should do is stop subsidizing HFCS.
People can enjoy soda as part of a healthy diet. Cigarettes are not the same.
>It's not a a soda ban; it's a soda tax.

But the purpose is to prevent people from buying soda. I never said it was a ban.

> Cigarette companies also want to sell a product to consenting adults. Is it bad to tax cigarettes and donate the money to lung cancer research?

In my opinion? Yes. The state has no right to tell people not to engage in unhealthy habits.
>The city of Berkeley is not some outside entity imposing arbitrary rules on the helpless population. This measure was put on the ballot by collecting sufficient signatures from the residents of Berkeley, and now the people get to vote on it. It's called democracy.

Why does the fact that it was passed democratically have to do with anything? Does majority support have any bearing on whether something is ethically questionable? Why do the people have Berkeley have a right to charge me for making my own health choices?

>That's not what's happening.

It *is* what's happening. The only way this measure can work as intended is if some nonzero number of soda purchases that would have happened don't happen. Each of those potential purchases is a person that would have enjoyed a soda that no longer will. The majority is butting into the lives of grown-ass adults and saying ""You're not responsible enough to make your own choices, so we're going to make them for you.""
But the whole purpose is to prevent people from buying soda. Why does the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to do this? They explicitly say that the purpose is to make people healthier by making them less likely to buy soda, same as cigarettes.
The city of Berkeley doesn't have control over federal crop subsidies though. They do have control over local tax initiatives. 

Since you're for the discontinuation of HFCS subsidies, then you are necessarily ok with an increased price of soda. In which case, this local tax seems to do the trick.
This point is spot on. Cigarettes and Soda are in completely different leagues in terms of health hazard. Those who support this tax... would you be okay with taxing individuals who do not work out? If not, why not?
edit: grammar
I'm not arguing the point, because I honestly don't have an opinion one way or the other, but what if the health of the people affects the state? If the state has to support people who have bad health due to, say, smoking, does the state have the right to regulate/legislate smoking?
I don't think anyone expects this to cause soda sales to drop to zero.  They'll probably drop, but that's the point, isn't it?
> But the purpose is to prevent people from buying soda

prevent?  let's try...  ""reduce the amount"" 

> The state has no right to tell people not to engage in unhealthy habits.

This IS up for debate, but you have to realize that the arguments have little do with 'rights.'   It's much more about a public health issue.  For example, we ban smoking in bars/restaurant because it creates risk and costs for others.   The goal is not to stop individuals from expressing rights to be (un)healthy, but to reduce the amount of tax money we need to spend on public health. 

A healthier population means less money spent on health care means overall quality of life.   

>  Why do the people have Berkeley have a right to charge me for making my own health choices?

Because you are more likely to be a burden on the system if you are obese and have diabetes, which was ultimately preventable in the first place. 

When you get that electric wheelchair because your joints get decimated by your obesity, you can be glad that .12c you paid for your coke cans helped pay for the curb cuts that allows you to get your wheel chair up on to the side walk. 


>Why does the fact that it was passed democratically have to do with anything?

Because you claimed that this was ""some bureaucrat"" telling you what to do. It's not.

>Why do the people have Berkeley have a right to charge me for making my own health choices?

They aren't charging you. The tax is to be paid by distributors. 

More importantly, the price of soda is already effectively set by the government through massive subsidies to corn farmers. So why get so upset if some people disagree with what that price should be set at? If you think the government has no business manipulating prices of goods, then all those subsidies have to be taken away, and the cost of the soda would go up by a lot more than $0.01 per ounce.
> But the whole purpose is to prevent people from buying soda.

No it's not.

> They explicitly say that the purpose is to make people healthier by making them less likely to buy soda, same as cigarettes.

Yes exactly, you got it right!

> Why does the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to do this? 

Um, the constitution of California?
>The city of Berkeley doesn't have control over federal crop subsidies though.

Sure, but if they really gave a shit they could issue a proclamation condemning the subsidies and banning products containing HFCS from vending machines in city buildings or something.

Berkeley has made the National news with some of the city proclamations in the past. Not sure why they wouldn't make one about this issue if they really cared about health rather than just getting more tax money.
I don't even know where to start with this poor reasoning.

> The city of Berkeley doesn't have control over federal crop subsidies though. They do have control over local tax initiatives.

What the city of Berkeley has control over is irrelevant to my comment. I'm looking at things from an overall perspective, as a party to city, state, federal, and other municipal governments. If folks are really concerned with the health effects and consumption rates of soda, and they really cared about a lasting solution to the problem rather than a band-aid over a broken knee (assuming the problem is analogous to that, which I'm not convinced it is), they'd first and foremost take issue with the massive HFCS subsidies that get handed out like... well, HFCS-composed candy.

> Since you're for the discontinuation of HFCS subsidies, then you are necessarily ok with an increased price of soda. In which case, this local tax seems to do the trick.

A higher soda cost from a lack of HFCS subsidies is not the same as a higher soda cost from arbitrary taxation by a local government. That government money can and should be spent elsewhere. The price increase will be an organic, not artificial, function of the market, as opposed to a similarly artificial raise in price aimed at combating ""Big Soda"" and raising money for the city of Berkeley's general fund.


This is more of an argument against state health intervention, I think. 
There have been studies that show that public healthcare costs decrease due to smoking because people who die earlier need so much less end of life care. If anything we should be subsidizing smokers for saving us money. 
Where did I say it would drop to zero?
But a lot of people drink soda and don't get obese or become diabetic.

If the problem is obesity and diabetes, why not just tax obesity and diabetes? 


>Because you claimed that this was ""some bureaucrat"" telling you what to do. It's not.

A bureaucrat formulated the tax, Berkeley residents passed it.

>They aren't charging you. The tax is to be paid by distributors.

...and then passed on to consumers. Do you really think distributors wil take the hit themselves?

>More importantly, the price of soda is already effectively set by the government through massive subsidies to corn farmers. 

And it shouldn't be. Kill the subsidies and excise taxes and let consumers make their own decisions based on what things actually cost to produce. I'm completely fine with the price of soda going up by ending subsidies that promote inefficiencies in the soda market. The only reason these subsidies still exist is because of the political clout the corn lobby has.
> No it's not.

Then what's the point?

>What the city of Berkeley has control over is irrelevant to my comment. 

Then your comment was irrelevant to the topic at hand, wasn't it? This topic is solely about the City of Berkeley, their policies, and the scope of their influence. So your offhand comment about federal subsidies belongs here why--you either mistakenly posted in this topic instead of another, or you were using your comment to critique local policy.

>If folks are really concerned with the health effects and consumption rates of soda, and they really cared about a lasting solution to the problem rather than a band-aid over a broken knee (assuming the problem is analogous to that, which I'm not convinced it is), they'd first and foremost take issue with the massive HFCS subsidies that get handed out like... well, HFCS-composed candy.

Again, local municipalities don't have control over federal subsidies. All of this is just bluster. You can't say, ""If you can't do everything, then do nothing."" That's an impossible tactic. If Berkeley was putting up a tax on candy, you'd probably say the same thing, but replace ""HFCS-composed candy"" with ""HFCS-composed soda"".

This policy is EXACTLY what you're asking for: Local government combating massive national subsidies of sugar by taxing the manufacturers of products full of cheap, subsidized sugar. This is a reasonable, local start toward addressing to that problem using the power that local government holds.

>A higher soda cost from a lack of HFCS subsidies is not the same as a higher soda cost from arbitrary taxation by a local government. **That government money can and should be spent elsewhere.**

That's not how subsidies or government spending works. 

Anyway, Berkeley is in a position where it feels it must use local tax policy to counteract national tax policy and subsidization. 

Again (third time now): The City of Berkeley has no way to directly combat federal subsidies or the market pricing of the items created through those subsidies. However, Berkeley still has health problems (same as everywhere else) due to the diet that these subsidies promote. The City decided to try to do something within its control to combat that fact: Increase the cost of manufacturers of one of the subsidized foods to more accurately reflect what it should cost, at least if they want to do business in Berkeley. The tax money will be used to help the City of Berkeley, and you, as a resident, are able to much more easily have influence over how the city spends its money than how the nation spends your money. You can vote on local ordinances (including this one), participate in city council meetings (I think there is one next week), and even run in local elections.

You can disagree, but you aren't offering any feasible local alternative to what is seen as a problem. Hell, maybe you don't think this is a problem: Fine, go and campaign about that! But taking the position that this is the 'wrong' way for *Berkeley* to address this problem while not offering an alternative local solution is pointless.

I'd also take issue with the use of 'arbitrary'. This tax isn't arbitrary in the least: It's targeted specifically at soda because of the effects that soda has. There are, of course, other 'bad things' in the world. But it's intellectually dishonest to say that something is arbitrary because it chooses to focus on one problem rather than another. If you think there are other things to focus on, then it is fully within your power to do some research, get some signatures, and make a change. Sitting back and complaining that people aren't doing the right thing because they could be doing something else is just lazy.
That is surprising! I wonder if they also considered people dying younger losing the state money by not being productive/paying taxes.
Implying that we should be using government power to knowingly and actively work against the public health, and increase cancer and lung disease rates. You do know that there is more to good governance than saving money, don't you?
>But the purpose is to prevent people from buying soda. I never said it was a ban.

I'd argue that it's not ""preventing people from buying soda"".  It's just discouraging them from doing so.
1) It's a statistical argument

2) It's about PREVENTION
So the people of Berkeley, who have no control over the federal government's corn subsidies, are trying to undo some of the harm caused by those subsidies by exercising what power they have locally. I can't see why anyone would get so worked up over that. 
Are you that drunk? Read the next sentence. Where I quote you.
> Then your comment was irrelevant to the topic at hand, wasn't it? This topic is solely about the City of Berkeley, their policies, and the scope of their influence. So your offhand comment about federal subsidies belongs here why--you either mistakenly posted in this topic instead of another, or you were using your comment to critique local policy.

Are you being willfully obtuse? The comment was directly related to what we're talking about. Let me see if I understand you, though. So because we're talking about, e.g., what to do about pollution on the local level, we can't talk about it with respect to national policies? I'm not sure that someone who commented on national policies in that situation would be making an ""irrelevant"" comment. 

> Again, local municipalities don't have control over federal subsidies. 

Thanks for the clarification!

> All of this is just bluster. You can't say, ""If you can't do everything, then do nothing."" 

Where did I say that? I was putting forward the idea that there *might* be better solutions to the problems created by soda consumption (again, if there even *are* problems directly correlated with soda consumption, and I'd ask you to show me some direct correlations, but I suspect that'd be asking too much of you) and by HFCS subsidies than an arbitrary tax that *goes into the general fund.*

> This policy is EXACTLY what you're asking for: Local government combating massive national subsidies of sugar by taxing the manufacturers of products full of cheap, subsidized sugar. This is a reasonable, local start toward addressing to that problem using the power that local government holds.

Huh? When did I ask for, or demonstrate support for, anything like that? Again, I'm not convinced (one way or the other!) that ""Big Soda"" is, per se, a problem. And even if it decisively were, we'd still be faced with the huge (and to my mind unasked, especially by folks like you) question of the legitimacy of any ""sin tax"" whatsoever. You seem to take the legitimacy of such a thing to be a given; please correct me if I'm wrong about that.

> That's not how subsidies or government spending works.

I hear a claim but not an argument there. How is that not how government spending, at least for subsidies, works? Whatever form they come in, the government can choose to stop granting or to reduce subsidies. But they're copping to the highly lucrative HFCS-related industries. Taxing something downstream only is *not* a solution. It is, at best, a register of protest, and a dubious one at that, given that the money garnered by the measure won't even be allocated into programs dedicated to, e.g., recreation or nutrition education. If you support this measure, as you seem to, you might at least admit that it hardly looks genuine of the city to prop up ""unhealthiness"" as a reason for this tax and then contribute none of that money towards doing anything else about it.

> Anyway, Berkeley is in a position where it feels it must use local tax policy to counteract national tax policy and subsidization.

You haven't said *one thing* about how will effectively, in practice, ""counteract[s] national tax policy and subsidization,"" other than make some products slightly less available to some consumers by means of taxing distributors. The money will, again, go into the city's general fund. It will accumulate a sizable sum for the city on the backs of distributors who distribute a product

> Again (third time now): The City of Berkeley has no way to directly combat federal subsidies or the market pricing of the items created through those subsidies. 

True. But that's not a positive argument for the means advocated by Measure D.

> However, Berkeley still has health problems (same as everywhere else) due to the diet that these subsidies promote. 

Give me one study that shows a) how the health problems you're referring to, which I don't deny, are directly linked overwhelmingly to the consumption of HFCS or ""sweetened beverages"" and/or b) that show that taxing sweetened beverages as Measure D proposes will actually have any effect at all on rectifying these problems, even within Berkeley city limits (barring, of course, people who voted for it feeling good about themselves for having ""done something,"" as you put it).

> I'd also take issue with the use of 'arbitrary'. This tax isn't arbitrary in the least: It's targeted specifically at soda because of the effects that soda has. 

Re: effects, see above. And it's not arbitrary, you say? Why start with soda? Are you going to impose an extra tax on potato chips, too? What about candy bars? And fast food? Or what about wine or liquor (already taxed, I know, but so is soda!), which the middle-upper class by a vast majority consumes and which is not provably significantly better or worse for you than soda? What about video games? That's a pretty good industry, and it would be good if people got off their couches and got outside! What if we taxed people for buying Reddit Gold, since it's not so healthy for them to be spending so much time on that website, anyway?

> There are, of course, other 'bad things' in the world. But it's intellectually dishonest to say that something is arbitrary because it chooses to focus on one problem rather than another. If you think there are other things to focus on, then it is fully within your power to do some research, get some signatures, and make a change. Sitting back and complaining that people aren't doing the right thing because they could be doing something else is just lazy.

You're awfully smug for somebody who, like me, is also behind a keyboard talking about the issues. It's massively fallacious to say that a proposal is in and of itself ""bad"" in some sense because the person advocating it isn't actively pursuing it. And it's not lazy to lodge a complaint that the current course of action isn't the best--and, not only that it *isn't the best,* but that it has demonstrable negative consequences! Those being, in this case, the notion that a) such taxation is a solution to larger-scale government problems (it isn't), b) ""sin taxes"" are OK (dubious at best, but perhaps acceptable if you're as pious a liberal as many in Berkeley are), and c) the money goes into the general fund without any additional oversight (not acceptable--unless you think it is acceptable, in which case, you and I live on different planets). What's lazy is misrepresenting, oversimplifying, and willfully misunderstanding someone's argument to support a prejudged conclusion.

An additional point re: my request for knockdown empirical evidence of a causal correlation between the rise in consumption of HFCS and the rise in ill health effects overall. You might want to take a look at the Wikipedia page on the matter (which itself shows just how readily available information is about what the city seems to be treating as an open-and-shut case):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup_and_health#Obesity_and_metabolic_syndrome
I know. My comment was intentionally absurd, but I think it's just as absurd to pass an idiotic tax like this that attacks a broad and frankly illogical category of items that we have no evidence are harmful.

Mountain Dew, coconut water, Gatoraid and organic soymilk would all be taxed the same under Measure D.

I can understand why we might want to tax one, or even two, of those items as part of an anti-obesity crusade. But taxing organic soymilk? How is that going to help people be less obese or make healthier decisions? 
If they were concerned about fighting corn subsidies (which I've never heard a proponent of this measure say is the case), then a tax on soda alone is way too specific. Corn syrup is in like everything now. 

I'd be completely fine with a tax on corn-derived products that is specifically designed to combat the effects of corn subsidies (including analysis to determine what the effect of these subsidies is in order to combat them with a tax of equal magnitude in the other direction). But that's not what this is.
I may be drunk but I'm making more sense than you. 

How are they going to regulate people's health if not by preventing people from buying soda? 
Here's a link from the Harvard School of Public Health specifically citing studies about the health effects of soda: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/soft-drinks-and-disease/

The City of Berkeley notes that soda consumption is demonstrably a harm to public health. They believe that the manufacturers of that harm ought to be taxed to sell that harmful thing to people. Therefore, they have proposed an additional tax on the manufacturers to sell the substance in Berkeley.

I don't know whether this will ""solve"" the problem, but I see the reasoning and don't haven't heard of a better local alternative. 

All that you added to the conversation is that ""we"" should 'stop subsidizing HFCS'. That's beside the point (and now in another post you're saying that HFCS may not be harmful after all, yet you're calling *me* out for being obtuse, despite you being the one in the weeds on this one). My original comment was: You think ""we"" should do something, but since Berkeley cannot do that thing, they are doing as close to that as possible by raising the price of being in the soda business *in Berkeley* since their gripe is with soda specifically and their jurisdiction is Berkeley specifically.

Now you're going down another rabbit hole about OTHER things that could alternatively be taxed, why things should or shouldn't be taxed, ad hominens about living in Berkeley, and questioning how Berkeley spends its money when there are council meetings literally every week that you can attend or read about which go into detail about city spending, and give citizens an opportunity to contribute to that discussion. All of this is a huge red herring from the actual discussion of whether Berkeley is doing what it can against a problem that it sees--and whether your offhanded comment was at all relevant. 

If you have alternate ways for Berkeley to try to address the problem of the availability of soda at prices which are deceptively low (low enough to promote soda consumption, which is harmful to health, over other beverage choices which wouldn't have the same adverse effects), then please present them.

Otherwise it's just tangential ranting. You can bring up as many arguments as you want to levy against *me*, but I only said that Berkeley cannot do what you thought should be done (again, for posterity, ""stop subsidizing HFCS""), and that they engaged in the alternative, which would seemingly make sense to you (removing subsidies has the effect of raising prices, which is essentially what the result of Berkeley's tax is). Now you want to debate about the whole issue and drag the kitchen sink into it because you've found that your original position wasn't substantive.

But whatever, we disagree on this. I don't feel like marching down the field with someone who keeps moving the goalposts (beginning your argument with 'something else should be done' and then continuing it with 'maybe nothing should be done, who knows').

You're the one who brought up HFCS subsidies, remember? I am talking about sugar, and specifically soda, as is Berkeley. 

Are you just arguing to argue? Are you going to go and downvote your original comment stating that ""What we should do is stop subsidizing HFCS""?

That's what measure D is. Corn subsidies obviously keep the price of junk food artificially low. The effect is over-consumption of such foods.

[OK, here's the National Institutes of Health with that exact analysis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247588/)

>a tax of equal magnitude in the other direction

Then you're against measure D because it is much too low a tax?

""Regulate"" again implies something like the Bloomberg ban, which isn't what is proposed at all. Research shows even small additional taxes change behavior, but that doesn't mean it's an infringement of freedom. Of course the price of products change the choices you make but it isn't forcing a choice. No one is prevented.
This will be my last post in reply to this, because we both have better things to do.

> You're the one who brought up HFCS subsidies, remember? I am talking about sugar, and specifically soda, as is Berkeley.

Here's a quote about Measure D from an analysis released by the office of the city attorney (my italics):

> Added-calorie sweeteners would include any edible product that is perceived as sweet and adds calories, and is used to make sugar-sweetened beverages, including but not limited to sucrose, fructose, glucose, other sugars, and *high fructose corn syrup.*

So no, it's *not* just about sugar. It hardly even seems to be mainly about sugar, although proponents of the measure use that language colloquially. You keep pointing out that my original comment was about HFCS, as if they're unrelated. No, they're not unrelated, either in fact or as far as the city of Berkeley is concerned—it's conclusive. And if your argument is going to be that we should tax sugary things for the sake of their being sugary, again, why start with soda? You say this is a “rabbit hole” but haven’t produced a single argument why it’s not a reasonable worry to lodge against the measure. 

> You think ""we"" should do something, but since Berkeley cannot do that thing, they are doing as close to that as possible by raising the price of being in the soda business in Berkeley since their gripe is with soda specifically and their jurisdiction is Berkeley specifically.

Are you really so dense as to think that the tax won’t just be passed on to consumers, either by businesses themselves or by distributors? (Or, perhaps, to small businesses *qua* consumers of distributors’ products?) In case so, let me try to persuade you otherwise: the tax will be passed on to consumers. It won’t solve any problem. It will bring added-calorie sweeteners (in your lexicon, “sugar”) to the forefront of the local conversation for about a month or so, and then it will fall into the background and be forgotten. It will line the pockets of the city with a nice chunk of change in the meantime and will do *absolutely nothing* to change consumption habits.

> Now you're going down another rabbit hole about OTHER things that could alternatively be taxed, why things should or shouldn't be taxed, ad hominens about living in Berkeley, and questioning how Berkeley spends its money when there are council meetings literally every week that you can attend or read about which go into detail about city spending, and give citizens an opportunity to contribute to that discussion. All of this is a huge red herring from the actual discussion of whether Berkeley is doing what it can against a problem that it sees--and whether your offhanded comment was at all relevant.

I stand by the ad hominems about living in Berkeley; they hold inductively in my experience. Nonetheless they’re not part of the substance of my argument itself, and your dragging them in here to make it look as though they are is a cheap move on your part and further reveals how little you’ve addressed my substantive claims. And re: the Berkeley city council being open, give me a break! Do you think that “reading about” or even attending those council meetings will give citizens a genuine, leverage-able way to “contribute to the discussion” (that’s cute, but I want some hard rules about how that money is spent)? For anyone who knows anything about how Berkeley’s city government actually behaves, that's even more idealistic than my idea that we *can* do something about federal-level HFCS subsidizes.

> If you have alternate ways for Berkeley to try to address the problem of the availability of soda at prices which are deceptively low (low enough to promote soda consumption, which is harmful to health, over other beverage choices which wouldn't have the same adverse effects), then please present them.

Ah, yes, the lovely tu quoque. First of all, whether or not I or anyone else can provide a positive alternative to Measure D has, again, absolutely no bearing on the measure’s legitimacy. This whole time, you’ve taken for granted, and miraculously *continue* to take for granted, this idea that soda is this Big Bad Beverage which is “harmful to health” (it’s certainly not nutritious, but is it comparable to smoking?), and about which something should be done. The purpose of the studies I gestured towards—did you glance at that Wikipedia page?—was to point out that there’s strong empirical evidence that HFCS and added-calorie sweeteners in general are bogeymen: they aren’t healthy in and of themselves, of course, but they *haven’t been and are not currently shown to be* the sole or even a major cause of increased obesity. If you do support sin taxes, I figure you’re at least obliged to have good reasons and good science behind you; you seem to have neither, and you haven’t shown me otherwise. Indeed you’ve noted, laughably, that the City of Berkeley “notes that soda consumption is demonstrably a harm to public health.” So the proponents of a soda tax that would increase their funds are claiming that soda is bad and should be taxed? You don’t say! 

Beyond this you seem to think that Measure D (a sin tax for some vague purposes perhaps related to deterrence of consumption, but with absolutely no empirical evidence that taxation will result in any significant decreased consumption or increased health, and with absolutely no plan to dedicate that money to, e.g., health education) counts as “doing something” in the relevant respect. Granted (here’s an ad hominem, so hold onto your pants!) this seems to be the preferred Berkeleyan method of “doing something,” as far as the city is concerned (that and besides mandating that free weed be given to low income residents by dispensaries), I don’t see any reason to think, nor have you given me any reason to think, that this will do *anything* about the effects of soda consumption. 

> Otherwise it's just tangential ranting. You can bring up as many arguments as you want to levy against me, but I only said that Berkeley cannot do what you thought should be done (again, for posterity, ""stop subsidizing HFCS""), and that they engaged in the alternative, which would seemingly make sense to you (removing subsidies has the effect of raising prices, which is essentially what the result of Berkeley's tax is).

You ended up saying a lot more than that, but OK. And no, as I explained previously, a price raise from a tax is not the same as a possible or even likely price raise that results in the market when the subsidies are cut.

> Now you want to debate about the whole issue and drag the kitchen sink into it because you've found that your original position wasn't substantive. But whatever, we disagree on this. I don't feel like marching down the field with someone who keeps moving the goalposts (beginning your argument with 'something else should be done' and then continuing it with 'maybe nothing should be done, who knows').

This is the most curious thing of all. The original claim was both a proposal and a criticism of Measure D’s justification. Moreover, it was substantive: it involves the sense that instead of imposing a sin tax that will be passed onto consumers and then promptly ignored (though used for some nice extra cash by the city), it might be better for the city to a) invest in nutrition education, which I’d suspect would itself have more effect on reducing consumption than any tax, b) get involved in the state-level conversation about which subsidies get forked over to Big Ag (a *huge* entity in California, so we don't even need to bring federal into this), and c) get other city governments and counties on board with the campaign and to commit to increased nutrition and health education programs themselves.

My (empirically supported) claim that HFCS is not itself the sole cause of our society’s unhealthiness (one “sole cause” would be heightened calorie consumption in general, not merely HFCS consumption) is totally compatible with the claim that we should stop subsidizing HFCS. If anything, what looks completely bizarre to me is, again, your conviction that Measure D will be effective in anything but a technical way and that the logic behind supporting it is fairly open-and-shut. It’s not. I would at least expect you to acknowledge that complexity but you’ve clung steadfast to this syllogism:

* A) Soda is a/the main cause of ill health effects
* B) Taxing soda locally will help reduce ill health effects (either now or later)
* [Possible additional premise C) There’s nothing else we can do [B]]
* Conclusion: We should tax soda locally.

Here's a similarly silly syllogism (I like how that sounds!):

* A) Misbehavior by financial professionals has been a/the main cause of economic instability in the past few years
* B) Taxing financial professionals will help prevent or repair economic instability (either now or later)
* C) We can't do anything about this on the federal level
* D) We should do something about this on the local level [C]
* Conclusion: We should tax financial professionals (*qua* financial professionals) who live in Berkeley.

There are problems with each of the premises in both cases, but I’ve done everything I possibly can to point them out to you.

>That's what measure D is. Corn subsidies obviously keep the price of junk food artificially low. The effect is over-consumption of such foods.

This measure has nothing to do with food. I don't know how you can say the purpose of this measure is to combat corn subsidies when 99% of products with corn material in them are not being targeted, and when products that *don't* have corn in them (soft drinks with actual sugar) *are* being targeted. 

Either the people who designed this measure are idiots, or the corn subsidy argument was tacked on later in order to attract voters. Either way, I'm not buying it.

>""Regulate"" again implies something like the Bloomberg ban, which isn't what is purposed at all. Research shows even small additional taxes change behavior

How on earth can you say that ""changing behavior"" is not a form of regulation? Are you serious?
Are you actually quoting the measure, which says:

> including but not limited to sucrose, fructose, glucose, other sugars, and high fructose corn syrup.

Then saying, in all seriousness:

>So no, it's not just about sugar.

All of those things are both literally and scientifically *sugars*. 

Sucrose: Table sugar.

Fructose: Fruit sugar.

Glucose: Simple sugar.

High fructose corn syrup: Glucose-fructose combination (see above how those are both sugars).

Other sugars: Self explanatory.

Your statement is provably false. And it's a great example of how this entire conversation has went. From you first bringing up HFCS and the fact that we should stop subsidizing it (to which I said, 'well, Berkeley can't do that, but they can impact prices through taxes...'), to then pointing to me and saying that my argument about HFCS is flawed because HFCS isn't bad after all...but I never made anything close to that claim in the first place (HFCS in the conversation was *your doing*). This whole thing is just silly.

You keep calling me dense, while you're simultaneously obfuscating the original point that you made and are making intellectually dishonest (or just uninformed) arguments to rope me into something I wasn't originally discussing. I mean, come on, you're actually being condescending about my use of the term *sugar* to describe...*sugar*? Really?

I'm sure you're just mad on the internet right now, but this is just a dumb argument where we're talking around each other.
>This measure has nothing to do with food.

That's just nitpicking. One could reasonably include junk beverages in what I referred to as ""junk food."" The vast majority of sweetened beverages are sweetened with corn syrup, so the subsidies are definitely relevant. That's not the only argument for this measure, but it certainly is a supporting argument.

> 99% of products with corn material in them are not being targeted

So you're saying the measure doesn't go far enough? I think it's prudent to take on one challenge at a time. First we reduce consumption of sweetened beverages, then we can take on other types of junk food.

>Either the people who designed this measure are idiots, or the corn subsidy argument was tacked on later in order to attract voters.

Neither. The corn syrup subsidy argument is just one of many. Take the time to read the links I sent you, and you'll find there are a lot of intelligent arguments for this tax from people who definitely aren't idiots.
Well ok if you consider every tax to be a ""regulation"" then it is a ""regulation.""
If you need to change the definition of regulation in order to justify passing a regulation...maybe it's time to reconsider.

Taxes - *especially* taxes aimed at changing behavior - are absolutely regulations. I don't know how any sane person could say otherwise.
Well just to me it's quite a bit different to ban an action than it is just to make it more expensive. What would you call the former?
Both are forms of regulation. 
Well I'll look forward to my income regulation refund this year."
