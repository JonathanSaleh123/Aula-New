Open Team In Dynasty Baseball League (Again),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3cvs25/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league_again/,2015-07-10 21:41:28,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. I've posted previously about a different team that was open, and a recent Berkeley grad wound up taking it. I'd love to meet more Berkeley students (maybe who are still attending, though I'm not picky) who are into baseball.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward.

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete).

Here's the team. It's in definite need a rebuild, but there are several awesome core pieces (Cole, Wacha, Trout, Abreu) to build around or trade away for a haul depending on your strategy:
