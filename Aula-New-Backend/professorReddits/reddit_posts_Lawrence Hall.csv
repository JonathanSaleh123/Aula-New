I also found it funny during the scene where Strauss questioned who held him back from his appointment to the Cabinet and his aide tells him it was this ""up and coming senator from Massachusetts"" and when he enquired about the name the latter replied ""John F. Kennedy"". It felt like Nolan included that namedrop so moviegoers would be like ""ooooooooooh it's that guy""
Me three
Yeah, I think a normal person would just answer, ‚ÄúSenator Kennedy.‚Äù MAYBE identify them by state too but not ‚Äúan up and coming senator‚Äù. There‚Äôs only 100 senators.
And the Kennedy family was already prominent so in the unlikely event Strauss had needed who JFK was explained to him at the time it would've been some version of ""Joe Kennedy's son broke ranks..."" not ""some up and coming senator named Kennedy from MA.""
lol this is based.
I believe he even said ‚Äútrying to make a name for himself‚Äù like come on"

Morning is good because you have the sun behind you, lighting up the view. Also tends to be less hazy. 

Of course this is provided you choose a non-foggy day. 
LOL, did you mean [this photo](http://www.elenazhukova.com/educational)? That was slightly intentional. I saw the viewpoint and I was like I RECOGNIZE THIS SCENE and so I tinkered around with Lightroom to get it somewhat like that.

I use a Canon Rebel T2i. This was shot with my 50 mm f/1.8 prime lens.

Settings, which I'm grabbing from Lightroom lol:

- f/18
- 1/50 sec for horizontal; 1/80 sec for vertical
- ISO 100

Yes, I used Lightroom 5.6, along with some presets. 
:o You're going to feature my photos? I'm really honored. Thank you so much! o_o
[deleted]
I've got that lens too. It's a prime lens, so you can't change the focal length, i.e. zoom. 50mm is near the same as the max focal length on the stock T2i lens. In exchange for not being able to zoom, however, the aperture is wider and the lens is capable of letting in more light, allowing for less noisy/crisper shots in lower light (and also sexier [bokeh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh)). Moreover, it's a really affordable lens (assuming letrainfalldown is talking about the same [Nifty Fifty](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU) Canon lens that I have.
/u/jeffster888 pretty much already covered everything I was going to say. It is indeed the ""Nifty Fifty"" and it's a lens I decided was a great value after doing a lot of research into it.

I don't actually own the stock lens. Somehow my camera body didn't come with it. The lens I normally use is a Canon 18-135 mm lens (pretty sure it's [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-18-135mm-3-5-5-6-Standard-Digital/dp/B002NEGTT2)), and it's great because it has a huge range of zoom. IMO it far surpasses the stock lens. :P I only got my 50mm one pretty recently but I absolutely love shallow depth of field so I'm still playing around and learning how to work with it.

IMO, lens is more important than the body (as long as your body is at least decent) because you can do a lot more with different lens than you can with a different body. Also, lens are interchangeable, which makes them really handy in different situations. You definitely should consider some other lens. The stock one I've heard is decent (never personally used it though as I don't own one), but if you want to get a little deeper, definitely look for other lens. I highly recommend both lenses I have. :)

>In [photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography), __bokeh__ (Originally /Ààbo äk…õ/,  /Ààbo äke…™/ ___BOH__-kay* ‚Äî also sometimes pronounced as /Ààbo äk…ô/ ___BOH__-k…ô*,  Japanese:¬†[boke]) is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image produced by a lens.    Bokeh has been defined as ""the way the lens renders out-of-focus points of light"".  Differences in [lens aberrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration) and [aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture) shape cause some [lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_lens) designs to blur the image in a way that is pleasing to the eye, while others produce blurring that is unpleasant or distracting‚Äî""good"" and ""bad"" bokeh, respectively.  Bokeh occurs for parts of the scene that lie outside the [depth of field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field). Photographers sometimes deliberately use a [shallow focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_focus) technique to create images with prominent out-of-focus regions.

It will! Canon DSLRs have been using the EF-S lens mount for a good while. And yes, I would recommend it for someone starting out (like me), for the excellent quality:price ratio. I don't think there are many other quality lenses you can buy at this price.
The 18-135mm lens has a wide range. It's a really good all-purpose lens that's good for just about everything from macro to landscape to portraits to candids. I nicknamed mine ""the stalker lens"" because of how much zoom it has. I shot [this photo](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/131/2/1/rcsa_conference_0190_edited_by_letrainfalldown-d4zf0kj.jpg) a few years back aiming straight down to the Campanile Esplanade from the top of the Campanile's platform on the 7th floor. 

It's decent in everything and is all around a good lens - but it doesn't particularly *excel* in anything besides being good in general.

On the other hand, the Nifty Fifty can't zoom at all, but it has a *much* shallower depth of field. My 18-135mm lens can only go up to about f/5.6 (occasionally smaller values, but not very often) - but my nifty fifty can go up to f/1.8, which means it's got *much* more bokeh and more fading in and fading out of sharpness. 

I've also heard it's great as a portrait lens, and I wanted to get into doing more portraits. 

It's a little out hard to point out the differences (especially since I haven't used this lens for very long yet), but 

- [here's one with the 50mm](http://i.imgur.com/ZWma0lq.jpg) - f/1.8
- [here's another](http://i.imgur.com/UEPfhZp.jpg) - f/1.8
- [here's one with the 18-135mm](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/o/2014/080/5/d/5d76500a5179fa7422bcb9a003990d39.jpg) - f/8
- [here's another](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/o/2014/133/2/b/2b51dc46b7708b069d4858330fd64853.jpg) - too  lazy to find this one

The difference isn't super obvious, but the ones from the prime have slightly shallower depth of field than the ones from the telephoto. That was the main selling point for me. :P Now that I look at it, /u/jeffster888 was right and the bokeh does come out nicer on the 50mm. :P

And you're welcome! I love talking about photography. :D

super-late edit;; wow I spelled ""excel"" wrong.
[deleted]
The stock lens would obviously be a lot more capable if you're out and about, and need to have the flexibility of a range of focal distances, whereas the 50mm would be better for shots where you have the time and space to carefully frame a shot. Also, the 50mm has a much wider aperture, which really, really helps in low light.
[deleted]
I'm really amused that this thread convinced you to get a new lens, just like that :P"

Yeah‚Äì Nobel Prize ceremonies are almost always held in Sweden (except for the Peace which is held in Norway), barring some extraordinary circumstance (like a world war). Maybe ""dubious"" is probably not the best word to use‚Äì but the situation that led to the ceremony being held in Wheeler Hall was definitely not ideal.
From what I understand they only updated its infrastructure, by adding a new Air Conditioning system, and some new electrical cables. Plus they changed all the chairs. The building itself, and auditorium however should look identical!
cop a feel eh
Very cool fact, that Berkeley has the distinguished, not dubious honor of holding a Nobel ceremony.
***Dubious***
>used ironically in phrases like **dubious honor** and **dubious distinction** to describe something bad or undesirable as if it were an honor or achievement

For example: in April of 2020, Stanford University had the dubious distinction of being the only major research university to publish a study which claimed that the novel coronavirus was more widespread and less lethal than we feared, and that public health restrictions were too strict.

Why?
I can't believe we missed that, do you know how many and what kind? Thank you!
<3
We'll have to check them out! Do you know which type of machines they are?
I know, right? There's an entire swath of the western campus that's just BARE except for VLSB.
Haha nah, it was just some fun thing we decided to do for a class.
We must have missed it, thanks for that! I'll check it out!
Omg thank you!! I aim to please.
Haha we would have added those but I couldn't get into the building on the Sunday I checked.
Thanks, we must have missed them - I'll check them out!
Yeah, formatting this thing is tough, though... It works better printed, where you can physically work with it!
Oh cool, I'll find them! Thank you!
LMAO if I had time for that, that'd be SO cool.
""Deep in the bowels of the Hearst Mining Building, where the only ones brave enough to venture are materials science graduate students, the air chokes with the fine dust of tested materials and the musty odor of an isolated prison of academia. But where lab meets hallway, at the rear of the building, dozens of feet below the noisy footsteps of unaware undergrads, stand two silent sentinels, staring ahead with stored snacks and chilled beverages: vending machines, eternally stocked, awaiting the call of any bold enough to brave the atmosphere and seek satisfaction from their inventory...""
Oh shoot, really? We'll have to check it out! Do you know which floor?
Hope this keeps you from long minutes searching for a quick bite!
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 1,473,111,994 comments, and only 280,328 of them were in alphabetical order.
I unfortunately do not have access to the file we made this on, and I have graduated - maybe another student can carry the torch forward and complete it!
there's a drink machine and snack machine just downstairs. there's also a drink and snack machine in the basement of zellerbach hall.

edit: the drink machine in wheeler has pepsi products and various juices (it's the style that catches drinks in the mechanical basket), the drink machine in zellerbach is pepsi products and aquafina (doesn't have the mechanical basket).
There used to be a drink vending machine, but it was removed this past winter break. The one still remaining has a selection of snacks.
i really want to do this lol
Thank you - appreciate it! I'll update the map if I can!
What snacks tho? Lol I didn‚Äôt know about those
Got it - thanks!!
pretty standard stuff, a couple styles of chips, I think zellerbach might have seaweed crisps and some other ""healthier"" snack choices, and then plenty of candy/cookies/licorice options"

Berkeley is actually beautiful?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ac2hqh/berkeley_is_actually_beautiful/,2024-01-26 20:35:19,Walked around for a class today and we went to Rose Garden and it's actually kind of amazing. My view of Berkeley has just been the campus but there is so much more history here. ,"a year after i graduated, i took a walk around campus and suddenly realized that damn, it's actually really pretty here. amazing what not wanting to die constantly can do to your perception of things.

there's also a hidden waterfall in codornices park (across from the rose garden). the botanical garden is also beautiful, if a bit out of the way, and it's free for students.
Yes! You've got to also see Indian Rock (which is also close to the Rose Garden) if you have not. Just strolling around the pretty neighborhoods around Northside is such a vibe too.
Definitely a great destination. 

There's an inexpensive book, *41 Berkeley Walking Tours*, that you can find at several local bookstores. All the walks are neighborhood based, and self-guided. Each walk lists // maps maybe 25-30 different buildings / sites in a particular neighborhood and gives a bit about their history / architecture.

Another good walk if you head south is to go down Benvenue from Dwight Way, and walk all the way to Alcatraz Avenue--it's probably about a mile, on level ground. Benvenue is one block west of College Avenue, has almost no traffic, and is one of the prettiest, most architecturally beautiful, and tranquil streets in Berkeley. Once you reach Alcatraz you can turn back on College and stop in the Elmwood District which has a bunch of restaurants, an ice cream place, and Berkeley's last movie theater. 

Bonus, if you look down Alcatraz Avenue you'll see it perfectly frames a view of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay; name mystery solved!
wait until it's cherry blossom season!!
Go up to the Lawrence Hall of Science and catch the views of the Bay
North side has so many insane views! I've run and walked all over many parts of North Berkeley - it's incredible!
I live on the Northside, beauty confirmed. Bonus vista: have you been up on the big hill overlooking campus yet?

BAMPFA admission is free with Cal ID and is always a cool way to spend a couple of hours. 

Some haircut spots around town offer discounts to students, just be sure to ask. 


In addition to the ones already mentioned, [Student Advantage](http://www.studentadvantage.com/content/?id=2033) offers various discounts to UC Berkeley students. And more locally, [Safeway Community Markets](https://www.safewaycommunitymarkets.com/seed) offers discounts to students.

Both programs require that you sign up in advance before you become eligible for benefits.
Students can get tickets to the SF Symphony for $20 in literally any seat in the house.  The catch is they don't release student tickets until a few days before the concerts, but there's almost always open seats and a lot of times there's really good open seats.

AC Transit 67 goes to Tilden Park if memory serves. Also if you can get away during the week, the beautiful and peaceful [Blake Garden](https://blakegarden.ced.berkeley.edu/) is a short walk from Arlington Blvd. on the AC 7 bus. Open M-F only though.

BART after 9PM. It‚Äôs such a great meditation spot that I see many people end up living and sleeping there permanently for the rest of their lives.
East dead end of Dwight Way leads into Claremont Canyon. You might be able to find a secluded spot.
The rose garden is nice if you put on sun glasses no one will bother you. The Berkeley Marina is amazing too, bus will take you all the way there.
The 67 will get you within a few blocks of Tilden, close to the Berkeley/Kensington border. If you'd like to get closer to the lake in Tilden, take the 65. (67 used to literally go into Tilden near the lake, does not anymore)"

We each get assigned a region and point our telescopes appropriately.  Then bus-loads of kids and other tourists come up and look through our scopes and we answer questions.  Pretty kick-ass stuff.  Especially because it's free.  I know getting to the mountains from Berkeley is a pain in the ass but it's well worth the trip.  I've taken hundreds of photos of Jupiter, saturn, mars, etc with my telescope and it's just a cheap-$250 one.  Some of these guys bring out there multi-thousand dollar scopes and holy cow can you stare God in the eye.
I say grab a group of friends and trek up to the big C. 
Astro c10 is going to be offered during spring 2013. if you don't want to take it (and I highly recommend the class) go to a few of the classes (not the first day, it's always packed) to figure out the dates for the star parties. Or just ask the prof/GSIs after class, he/they are very accommodating and would love to help out even if you're not technically in the class
That sounds amazing. I might try to go, but you're right, it is a pain.

You probably won't have much of an idea since you live in Sacramento, but do you know any good places to do some stargazing here in Berkeley, even if it by myself?

And can you recommend a good telescope that is cheap? I don't want to invest too much yet, but I've been thinking of getting one.
The problem with that is that it is too bright up there!  you want to be away from the city lights to get the best views."

check with people in the coops they are the only ones who know
To be honest, coop parties are generally dirtier, more cramped and within a smaller group of people. What you get is less like a party and more like a kickback style. And as a result, only the people living there normally know when they are and who to know to get in.

Wurster, 9th floor. You can't get into the studios but the balcony is open to the public. You can see SF, Bay Bridge, Golden Gate... everything. Has one of the best views on campus since you can't see Wurster.
You can get a really good view from the math lounge, 1015 Evans.
The Lawrence Hall of Science has a spectacular view.
On weekdays during business hours you can take an elevator to the top of the Campanile, which has a good view. 
There is a really tall tower in the center of campus.  It's even free to go up to the top.  Do so.

There are really tall hills on campus.  They are free to climb.  Do so.
The road you're talking about is specifically Campanile Way. It's at the heart of campus.
beautiful view of the city from the Clark Kerr track, as well as from the bench at the top of Panoramic Way 
Soon this view will be gone with the construction of new housing slated for downtown Berkeley. Go see it while it's still visible!
I second this
http://www.ktvu.com/news/18-apartment-building-approved-in-berkeley-where-high-rise-will-block-views-of-campanile-way
Depends on the time of year and the time of day. I feel like in the fall and in march & april you get a lot more clear days, and also closer to mid-day.
But you can still see Evans unfortunately. 
This is the best view of it from campus, other than the east side of Memorial Stadium.
And a [whale sculpture](https://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/visit/exhibits/touch_climb_crawl/pheena_whale)!

I might as well. Hopefully it'll be clear.
If the power‚Äôs out on Friday, a trip to the [Chabot Observatory](https://chabotspace.org/visit/observatories/) would be pretty cool, although the moon‚Äôs pretty bright right now. Still awesome place to visit to look through their large refractor.

I wonder what crazy stuff Berkeley is making now.
Does anyone mind pointing out which ones are the people mentioned in the title? I am curious !
My grandmother met him! She worked in the chemistry department around the end of his career here. She got to work with Glenn Seaborg as well
Did Oppenheimer teach any undergraduate physics courses during time at Cal?

I‚Äôm curious as my late father was an engineering major at Berkeley from 1932 to 1936. I thumbed thru his Cal yearbook (1936) but no mention or pics of Oppenheimer.

Just wondering could Oppenheimer have taught freshman physics?
Whereabouts is it? You can also find the room where they used a cyclotron to discover Plutonium on the upper floor of Lewis Hall. There's a small plaque commemorating it.
Why have I never visited! Is this even advertise in LeConte?
Where is old Le Conte Hall?
[deleted]
This is a loose guess, but i want to say Oppenheimer is the tall dude in the middle and Lawrence is the older guy in the white apron (w/glasses but no hat). I could be wrong but i know I‚Äôve seen pics before, even if i wasn‚Äôt playing close attention.

Edit: looks like i‚Äôm 0 for 2. Thanks for playing y‚Äôall.
That‚Äôs neat, I‚Äôll check it out if I‚Äôm back for the fall. Oppenheimer‚Äôs office is on the 3rd floor of Old LeConte on the rear corridor if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
Do you know when they made this known? I must have walked past it many times 20 years ago banging my head off the wall with upper div physics homework sets and had no idea. To be fair I would was probably too stressed out to notice the plaque even if it was there.
@diamondketo It‚Äôs a surprisingly well kept secret by the department lol. @beastmodecowboy The LeConte you enter from the Campanille side is actually LeConte extension. The original building is accessed from the entrance on Oppenheimer way (the lane between Tan Kah Kee hall and Campbell hall that ends in the Hearst mining circle). Only the staircase at this entrance will take you to the offices in Old LeConte  Alternatively, you can go to the top floor of LeConte extension and take the connecting corridor to Old LeConte opposite the Physics and Astronomy library. This will take you straight to the 3rd floor of Old LeConte. Old LeConte was renovated after the extension was built so it actually looks newer inside.
>doubt 

I go to Berkeley currently and don't really see hippies
What about the guy smoking the pipe on top with the blown up black hair? He resembles Oppenheimer more, and he was extremely known for smoking
Not sure about Oppenheimer, but Ernest Lawrence is sitting bottom row just left of center, with his leg crossed over, and to the right (his left) of the guy with the apron
I don't, unfortunately. Although, to my eyes, one of the plaques did not exactly look very new. I think there might be a grad student lounge up on the same floor or something, and maybe an office or two. Other than that, it's really out of the way and the corridor is dark and dingy. The door is locked and impossible to see into, too.
Oppenheimer is indeed up top with a pipe in his mouth. A true signature.
I misread your post. I was talking about LeConte but I probably banged my head off the wall in Lewis at some point too!"

the rose garden on northside is pretty :). so is the park connected to it! it's a nice walk but a little hilly to get there.
Since there are some comedians on this site, Campanile is good if and when it is open but it isn‚Äôt open at night, watching the sunset from various places (the parking lot by Lawrence Hall of Science is called the Vista Parking lot) is good.  People‚Äôs Park is bad, unless you wanted to see a large homeless camp.  

A lot of what people ordinarily might do at night in Berkeley is pretty dead now thanks to Covid.
big C. genuinely one of the best views in the bay area, especially at night.

This is an excellent idea
ah yes nothing quite like taking a stroll thru the park at night with a first timer to experience what its like getting robbed or assaulted ...
Oh absolutely.  I don't think MSRI is open right now but OP, the MSRI (mathematical sciences research institute) at the top of the hill has amazing views and is usually open for you to walk around.
It would become a construction site soon last I check. Aren't they building some tall ass dorms there?

Most of the stuff is still closed unfortunately. The botanical garden is open today but its a 40 minute hike as the bus is not running today. You can always chill at the glade.
On campus, follow Strawberry creek and use the footbridges. Visit all of the fountains on campus and spend a little bench time beside each. I like Sproul Plaza and lower sproul plaza too. College Ave and Telegraph Ave for shops and people watching south side. Gourmet Ghetto for dinner on the north side.

cheeseboard or sliver. Also many boba shops have opened up!
Haas is one of the nicest parts of campus!
Campanile, memorial glade, vlsb, north side (nicest part of campus IMO), BAMPFA, Lawrence hall parking lot, panoramic hills, memorial stadium, Greek theatre... and anything else that‚Äôs meaningful and has good memories for you!
Blondie's is still here, they've just changed their name to Abe's
Yes to the BAMPFA! Totally different from the old building, and the cafe is really good. The smaller museums and collections all over campus are lovely: whatever is on display in Doe, the current exhibition at the Hearst is really fun and accessible, even the Magnes has fascinating stuff on right now. The picnic at the Botanical Garden on a clear day for that gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The new student union is also worth seeing as an alum.

If your daughter isn‚Äôt super STEM- or Haas-focused, the tour might be a little overwhelming. (I just did a tour with my daughter and about 50% seemed to be CS and engineering admissions stats...) A tour highlighting your favorite places would be lovely, or hopping on the intro of the official tour and peeling off as you please.

Outside of Berkeley's movie theatres, here are some great spots that my friends and I have never had a bad experience with.

- [The Lawrence Hall of Science](http://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/) - You can usually catch the bus to and from here (alternatively, you can hike up or down as well). A great spot if you and your date have an interest in science and technology. Free for Cal Students.

- [UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens](http://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu/) - Like the Lawrence Hall this place can be reached through campus shuttles. It's a beautiful place to explore if you're interested in a talking/walking date. Free for Cal Students.

- [Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archives](http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/) - Pretty easy to get to since it's right in downtown Berkeley. A great rotating art collection and some interesting film screenings. Free admission and discounts on films.

- [Victory Point Cafe](http://www.victorypointcafe.com/) - In North Berkeley on Shattuck, for $10 for you and your date you can hang out here and play from their collection of 800+ board and card games. Games are a great way to deal with first-date jitters or a good solution to general awkwardness early on in the relationship.

- [Dorothy Bolte Park](https://foursquare.com/v/dorothy-bolte-park/4b5dfd37f964a520cd7729e3) - A bit of a hike up Grizzly Peak but that makes the place pretty quiet and intimate. A good option for a picnic and it offers a great view of the Bay Area along with the sunset.

- [The Berkeley Rose Garden](http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/contentdisplay.aspx?id=12048) - Across from [Codornices](http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/Parks_Rec_Waterfront/Trees_Parks/Parks__Cordornices_Park.aspx) park. This is a lovely little venue that's a great spot to end a date or hold a dinner date. A popular combination is picking up a pizza from the [Cheese Board](http://cheeseboardcollective.coop/pizza) downtown and taking it up here to watch the sunset. Come about an hour early for a good spot.

- [Ashby Flea Market](http://www.berkeleyfleamarket.com/home.html) - There's usually a lot of interesting stuff for sale so it can be a fun activity to go around looking and finding deals. This is honestly a much better option if you plan to fold in a visit to the [Thai Temple](https://www.yelp.com/biz/wat-mongkolratanaram-berkeley) for their fantastic Sunday Thai brunch.

Hope this helps!

Museums (SFMOMA, De Young, Asian Art Museum), Golden Gate Park and everything in it (California Academy of Sciences, Conservatory of Flowers), Sutro Baths, walking around various neighborhoods (Chinatown, financial district, etc.), Plentea/Boba Guys, tourist watching at Fisherman's Wharf, etc.

The Berkeley Marina and the parks surrounding it are a nice place to go for a walk, although it's a long ride on the 51B to get there. Also Berkeley has a lot of cute coffeeshops! My favorites are Sacks, Philz, Cafe Blue Door and Caffe Mediterraneum.

"Cal's $143 million new Shyh Wang Hall ‚Äî built to house supercomputers capable of handling as many as 2 quadrillion calculations per second each and named after professor Wang ‚Äî resembles a mainframe computer itself.

You can read the full article through [this Google Program](https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/40543?hl=en) by [searching for the article's title on Google and clicking on the article](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hulking+UC+Berkeley+computer+lab+sits+awkwardly+in+neighborhood).

Here is the full article:

> In an odd way, UC Berkeley‚Äôs new Shyh Wang Hall ‚Äî built to house supercomputers capable of handling as many as 2 quadrillion calculations per second each, whatever that means ‚Äî resembles a mainframe computer itself. It‚Äôs a sleek metal cube that‚Äôs hard to disguise, smooth in front with odd connections coming out the back.

> The difference is that this four-story chunk of metal and glass isn‚Äôt tucked into a corner of a basement or control room. It‚Äôs attached to a hillside above the UC Berkeley campus ‚Äî yet another Bay Area example of how research and medical buildings, no matter how innovative they might be inside, are increasingly awkward neighbors as our region grows more dense.

> In and of itself, the $143 million structure dedicated in November is designed to be operated with machine-like efficiency, pairing form and function in surprisingly sustainable ways.

> The new building is named for Wang, a Cal professor who did pioneering work in semiconductor research before his death in 1992, and sits inside the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a 202-acre enclave managed by the Department of Energy.

> The top two floors are office and meeting spaces for researchers in applied mathematics, computer science and high-speed computing and networking. The level below contains the drama: the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, which makes its hardware available to 6,000 or so researchers around the country when they want to run their most demanding computer simulations.

> **Utilizing ridgeline**

> As for the bottom ‚Äúfloor,‚Äù it‚Äôs not really a floor so much as a 30-foot-tall space pressed against the steep ridgeline with solid walls on the north and south and a screen of open horizontal grills facing west.

> Taking advantage of the ridgeline might be the most innovative feature of this building designed by the San Francisco office of Perkins + Will. The west edge allows fog and cool air to come in from the bay ‚Äî a largely passive system for heating and cooling that includes large screened cuts through the concrete floor of the computer level so that air can be sucked upward and filtered to allow the outside air to circulate more efficiently.

> **Blunt visual impact**

> Given the machines humming inside at all hours, the complex is still an energy hog: One look at the 30-inch-diameter cooling water pipes emerge from the south edge of Wang Hall into four induced draft cooling towers is all the visual proof you need. But with such features as the ventilation system, and smart-looking perforated sunscreens that slice from the exterior of the office floors, the goal at Wang Hall is to use 60 percent less energy than conventional mechanical systems would.

> ‚ÄúIt was an absolute design requirement that this building perform as well as possible,‚Äù said John Long, the Perkins + Will principal overseeing the project. The design team also included the structural engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti and Dynamic Isolation Systems to collaborate on such challenges as the need to ride out a 7.5 temblor on the nearby Hayward Fault.

> Early schemes by the architects set the office floors perpendicular to the levels below, to reduce the visual bulk from afar. But space on the hillside already is so cramped that the office portion would have needed to climb several extra stories. So instead we have a thick bar that is 384 feet long and 85 feet tall.

> The visual impact is as blunt as it sounds. Fortunately, the architects‚Äô desire for white metal panels was nixed by the lab. They‚Äôre a dusty green meant to blend with the hillside‚Äôs eucalyptus trees ‚Äî a hue that helps lessen the shock value from afar, though the hulk remains daunting when viewed on the approach to Lawrence Berkeley from Cyclotron Road.

> This is a variation of the awkward shove of UC Berkeley lab buildings against downtown Berkeley. Or UCSF‚Äôs Mission Bay campus. Or every suburban hospital that rebuilds at a scale the neighbors have never seen. State-of-the-art code requirements plus user expectations equal boxes that often seem to land with a thud.

> Wang Hall shows more care, with details like the office floors‚Äô crisp sunshades and the tight metal grill vents cloaking the oversize lower floors. But there was no review of the project by UC Berkeley, since Lawrence Berkeley is autonomous. Nor does the city of Berkeley have anything beyond a courtesy say, since state-owned land is off-limits to local approvals. Once the client is happy and has money, the construction crews get to work.

> Wang Hall is more sensitive to its surroundings than Lawrence Berkeley‚Äôs older crude, squat boxes. But like them, there‚Äôs no avoiding it from nearby neighborhoods ‚Äî and with each new addition to the crowd, the crowd is harder to miss.
That was my first reaction too.  Seems like clickbait.
u/skwm's criticism seems pretty legitimate in the context of the full article.  Basically, the author keeps talking about the different groups that collaborated on the project, the unique design requirements they seem to have done a good job taking into account, and then concludes by complaining that it's aesthetic is too ""blunt""."
Key places to see on casual campus tour?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5u276x/key_places_to_see_on_casual_campus_tour/,2017-02-14 11:02:39,"I have some relatives coming from out of town on Saturday, and I want to give them a casual tour of cool/important places on campus. I wouldn't want to join a tour group because of a language barrier and some members are elderly and wouldn't be able to walk too much.

So far, I'm thinking Sproul Hall/Sather Gate and the top of the Campanile, but I'm not sure where else. Thanks!","Show 'em the T-Rex in VSLB
Drive them up to Lawrence Hall for some amazing panoramic views.

That one reading room right inside the old library building is pretty impressive.
The woods and strawberry Creek towards Northside is nice
Berkeley Botanical Gardens!  Amazing nature and view of campus.  Also I really like walking around the top of the football stadium and seeing the entire view of the bay area.
I think it's worth going up Grizzly Peak to the higher pullouts.

Just be aware that it's very likely that someone will toke up next to your family at either location.  "
What is a good date idea for someone under 21?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2dddlr/what_is_a_good_date_idea_for_someone_under_21/,2014-08-12 13:54:29,"I'm kind of new to the area.

Take her to the big c and show her your big c. 

No but seriously you can't go wrong with the big c, bring a picnic or something
If you have a car, pick up some dinner (or pack a picnic) and drive up to Grizzly Peak Rd. There is a great lookout by Claremont Rd/Fish Ranch that gives you fantastic bay views. Eat on the hood of your car.  
Actual dates I've been on:

- [Lawrence Hall of Science](http://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/static/scienceview/scienceview.berkeley.edu/html/view/index.php) - and surrounding overlooks
- Botanical Gardens
- Gregoire's
- Au Coquelet

Other places I might recommend:

- Condornices Park
- Ici's
- Berkeley Rose Garden
- Tilden Park/Little Farm (farm animals!)

Will add to this when I think of more things.
Drive over to Sausalito and walk around. Have coffee and soak up the views with the tourists. Same for Tiburon. Dinner, cafe, drinks (all ages), sunshine down by the sea. Plenty to explore on foot. Lots of cool hikes nearby. Bring a sweater in case the fog comes in. 

Also by car, drive up to Sonoma town square. Lots of history, plenty of great food, gorgeous surroundings, nice weather, great food, and a relaxed atmosphere. You don't have to drink wine to thoroughly enjoy it. 

All of those places can get a little crowded on summer weekends, especially Sausalito. Enjoy!
I highly recommend:

Taking a ride on the steam trains in Tilden Park.  http://www.redwoodvalleyrailway.com/5101.html

Picnic & kite flying at Cesar Chavez Park - you can get a $13 diamond kite from Games of Berkeley.

Bowling at the Albany Bowl - the weekend late bowling is fun, make sure to reserve a lane. 
http://www.thealbanybowl.com/

On the other side of the bay, rent bikes at Pier 39, take the ferry to Tiburon and have lunch at Sam's Anchor cafe.

Visiting Berkeley! Any tips on accommodation and sightseeing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n2rl1o/visiting_berkeley_any_tips_on_accommodation_and/,2021-05-01 14:10:35,"Hey guys and gals!

I'm from Sri Lanka, and I plan to visit Berkeley in September for Porter Robinson's Second Sky concert in Cesar Chavez Park. I'll be there for 3 days as I'm on a tight budget and accommodation is pricy. I'll be AirBnb'ing, so if y'all have any cheaper alternatives, let me know :).

I'll have one day, hopefully two, to check out the sights and also meet a friend who's driving up from Pasadena. Is there anything that I could check out? Anything from Museums to hiking trails, I'm up for it! 

I know this is a long ways ahead, but I like to plan ahead and keep an idea of a plan around so I can prioritize. The cheaper the activities/locations the better! 

Also idk what to look out for and what not to look out for, so please do let me know on what to avoid! This is my first trip to the Americas, so I'm not quite sure what to expect. 

Thanks!

P.S: I'll be vaccinated and authorized for travel by my arrival date. I already have vaccination appointments coming up later this month.","I would recommend going up to the Lawrence hall of science, there are some great views of the whole bay and nice little hiking trails. Currently the museum is closed, I think, but its fun to check out when it's open. Similar to the Lawrence Hall of Science, with more hiking opportunities is the Chabot Space and Science Center. The berkeley marina is also a nice spot. 

Food wise, there are a lot of options near campus. If you have money, La Note is a nice fancy place to get brunch.

If you just want to walk around, Telegraph has cool stuff, but it's also pretty crowded idk. Shattuck has a lot of cool stores near campus too. Downtown Berkeley is great overall within a 3 block radius of campus. The further out you go, the fewer options you get. Civic center park might look nice on google maps, but be aware that it's generally got a sizable homeless population, if that is something that makes you uncomfortable.
>I'll be AirBnb'ing, so if y'all have any cheaper alternatives, let me know :).

you can try the [YMCA](https://ymcaeastbay.org/specialty-locations/berkeley-y-hotel/our-accommodations) 

>hiking trails

Big C or tilden park. 

>museusm.

there are a few in berk like Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. but the big ones are all in SF (~30 min subway ride from berk) 

>Also idk what to look out for and what not to look out for, so please do let me know on what to avoid! This is my first trip to the Americas, so I'm not quite sure what to expect.

general street smarts: be aware of your surroundings, don't have headphones on in an unfamiliar area, don't leave your stuff out to have it stolen. there aren't *too* many pickpockets in the bay area.
There was a pretty good post a month or two ago about things berkeley students should do during their time at Berkeley - many also apply to site seeing, though you obviously want have time for all of them.

https://reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/m82tov/i_made_a_list_of_the_21_things_you_need_to_do_and/
General help is here:

[https://visit.berkeley.edu/](https://visit.berkeley.edu/)

I'd recommend the Lawrence Hall of Science for the tour and the views.  On campus there are some gotta-sees like Sather Gate and the Campanile, but my personal favorite is here (the library and the archive):

[https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/bancroft-library/mark-twain-papers/visiting-the-archive](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/bancroft-library/mark-twain-papers/visiting-the-archive)

Restaurants just don't get any better than Chez Panisse.

[https://www.chezpanisse.com/1/](https://www.chezpanisse.com/1/)

Lastly, you gotta get to SF because, well, the GG bridge is there, and it's only 30 min on BART.
If this is your first time in the US I'd definitely spend at least one meal eating Mexican food. I like La Mission for burritos, moles, and they have good breakfast too, or Comal if you want to stay downtown and have something fancy, tho that's less traditional.

Lots of great hiking in the regional parks, agree on picking a spot with good views. I also suggest hitting Redwood Regional Park in Oakland to see some redwoods close by. Steam trail has the redwoods and you can loop up to West ridge on a variety of paths.

I also like Museum of California in Oakland if you have time, a mix of natural history and local art.
hike up to the Big C and find the various swings up in the hills, free and unique
Fun, unique, and usually cheap things to do in Berkeley? I'd recommend checking out [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/berkeley-california/places) from some fun options in Berkeley.
By September the Lawrence Hall May be open again. It is beautiful and I agree worthwhile. And from there you could head up east to Tilden park area. 

Also by September students will be back en route force so unless undergraduates are your thing I might stay away from the Telegraph/ Campus area. They‚Äôll still be settling in and it‚Äôs bound to still be a shit show. 

Having said that there‚Äôs also BAMFA which will open come May - oops it is May. :). 

No matter what you do or where you stay: Do Not leave anything visible in the car. Ever. Crime isn‚Äôt horrible but opportunists are everywhere
Thank you! The homeless don't make me uncomfortable, but they won't jump me will they? I wouldn't mind walking through the park if it's safe :)
Thank you for recommending the Y! They are cheaper by about $20, which is a lot in my currency so that's a lot of savings for me. 

I was wondering what the Big C is till I googled it and found out it was an actual art installation of the letter C lol. Will definitely check it out!
Thank you! I majored in Science and visiting the Hall of Science seems quite up my alley.

&#x200B;

> Chez Panisse 

Added to my list, thanks! 

&#x200B;

> SF because, well, the GG bridge is there, and it's only 30 min on BART. 

Definitely, and I assume BART is the local train? Sorry the only public transport over here are busses.
>   at least one meal eating Mexican food 

Added to my list, thanks! The only ""Mexican"" I've had here is our Taco Bell and it's not very good. 

&#x200B;

> I also suggest hitting Redwood Regional Park in Oakland 

Holy shit, isn't that where the Forest Moon of Endor was shot for Star Wars? Definitely on my list, thanks! Is there an entry fee or cost to hike through here?

&#x200B;

> I also like Museum of California in Oakland if you have time, a mix of natural history and local art. 

Thank you, I'll be visiting the Redwood Regional Park so hopefully I'll have a few hours here too.
Lol ‚ÄúMoe‚Äôs Books‚Äù, some random playground, and some other boring doo doo. That list isn‚Äôt very good
Thank you! I'll be using public transport mostly, due to my restricted budget. So no cars and everything will be left in my room except for my phone.
I've never been jumped by a homeless person. You just have to be aware, some people are creeps, some people have mental illness, but it's no different than any other city I imagine. When in doubt just don't engage
>I was wondering what the Big C is till I googled it and found out it was an actual art installation of the letter C lol. Will definitely check it out!

we're real creative around these parts. the big C itself isn't that super exciting (especially if you're not affiliated with the uni) but you get views like [this](https://i2.wp.com/www.dailycal.org/assets/uploads/2021/02/cute_daniela-cervantes_file.jpg?ssl=1&w=900)
BART stands for Bay Area Rapid Transit.  It's the official name for our urban subway / trolley network.  It covers a very wide region, basically the whole SF Bay area.  Here is a link with a route diagram:  https://www.bart.gov/system-map
The diagram does not really tell the story; imagine the SF Bay in the middle of all those lines.  
BART is linked to most local transit systems, particularly in SF.  SF has a city-wide system called SF MUNI METRO, and it in turn links into the famous old fashioned SF trolley cars. Here is that system map: https://www.sfmta.com/maps/muni-metro-map
There are four major stations (look for the little BART symbol) where the systems have common stations.  It's very similar to Europe if you have been there.  Your English is very good, I am sure you will have no problems getting directions if you get lost.  As others have said, hang onto your bags and electronics in particular, there are a few ""flash grabbers"", unfortunately, like everywhere else in the world.

Edit: It seems Lawrence Hall is closed for now, but may be open by the time you come.  Same for the Campus.  If you decide to visit SF, you will want to ""do"" the GG Bridge, and of course the trolley cars, and you have to eat some crab at Fishermans wharf.  I'd also recommend the DeYoung Museum https://deyoung.famsf.org/ the California Academy of Sciences https://calacademy.org/reopening  Good luck and welcome!
The Endor scenes are indeed in a Redwood forest, however those were shot further north in a more rural area (like 5 hours away). These redwoods won't be quite as big but since you have limited time, these are the closest and without long drives or entrance hassle. If you park at the Skyline Gate Staging Area, entrance and parking are free. 

Also, if you'd like afterwards, you can drive down to Lake Merritt area, grab some tacos or burritos from the Tacos Mi Ranchos truck and eat it by the lake. The Museum of California is there if you want, or also some chill bars and such if you're 21+ (eg. Mad Oak). 

Note, do not leave anything visible in your car when parked anywhere in the bay area. It's basically safe everywhere (with common sense) in the daytime, but snatch and grab of purses/backpacks out of cars is super common.
Hey just saw that you won't have a car, I thought you would since your friend from LA has one. That does make getting around a lot more difficult. You could Bart to Fruitvale and take a bus up to the redwoods, but it will turn a 20 minute drive into 2 hour public transit journey, too much hassle.

It's possible that by September they will start offering Lyft Lines / UberPool again, where you pay a cheaper price to carpool in an Uber/Lyft with a stranger, that might be worth doing when you're here. It's currently not available because of Covid. 

You can definitely take Bart between downtown Berkeley and downtown Oakland / Lake Merritt no problem though, since those are on the train line it is still fairly fast.
There‚Äôs all sorts of rent a bikes around town. Sadly the public transit isn‚Äôt the greatest in a lot of neighborhoods. 

I thought maybe you would be with car b/c of your friend meeting you from SoCal. 

There is a bus that goes to Lawerence Hall though and as you probably already know down to Cesar Chavez Park. That‚Äôll be a lovely day for you both. And probably still very warm (warm for us)"
Good sites to run to..,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qar2t/good_sites_to_run_to/,2012-02-28 19:27:07,"I want a good picture of the city/bay or even the waters. Been to marina. Thinking about La Loma Park?

Also, how do I get onto the Fire Trail? I'm always confused about that. 

Grizzly Peak seems amazing but don't know how to get there ","If you want to explore the Firetrails/Euclid/Grizzly Peak/Tilden and beyond with a group of other runners, I recommend Cal Running Club. We meet at Kroeber Fountain, Mondays through Fridays @ 5pm Berkeley time (and 9am on Sundays for long runs!) 
Lawrence Hall of Science probably has the single best view from the parking lot. It's runnable, if you're not a pussy. The entire ridge up there has trails. Start at foothill and just go uphill, you'll get to the top eventually.

The Rose Garden in North Berkeley has a wide open view of the bay, in addition to a bunch of roses. Run north along Euclid until you see it on your left. There's also a nice wooded area on the right.

As you follow the road up past the stadium towards Lawrence Livermore, there's a foot trail just before the Botanical Gardens with a ton of amazing views. It's also amazing for running, though a bit cold from all the trees and water around.

Alternatively, just climb a building on the west edge of campus. Barker is open access and has a nice view from the alcoves.
haha you all seem to be intense/good at running...I think I've passed by you all waiting whenever I am running back from the Claremont Canyon Trail to the RSF. 
I'll definitely keep this in mind though. Just scared that I'm gonna be left behind D:
Don't be fooled, we're actually pretty friendly - and we take all comers, regardless of ability. Generally there will be a few designated people ""leading"" the run for a given day who do their best to make sure that no one gets lost or left behind. And even if you're not as keen on the running side of things, we also throw some epic potlucks (because in truth we secretly moonlight as a food club :)"
Curious: do you Cal students get out into other areas of Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gtc6l/curious_do_you_cal_students_get_out_into_other/,2013-06-21 12:54:52,"Hey, hi.
I'm subscribed to this sub, even though I'm not a Berkeley student. I've lived in Berkeley for 10 years, and just sort of enjoy seeing what you all are up to. 

I'm just curious how many of you get out and do stuff around Berkeley- do you head to the Marina? Have you been to the Albany Bulb? Or the neat beach made out of old crockery pieces dumped there in the early 1900s, up a bit north? Do you go hang out at the beach in Emeryville when it's nice? Do you go shopping on 4th street, or wander on Solano avenue? Tilden Park? Indian Rock Park to watch the sunset?

Or are you pretty campus-centric due to no car, no time, etc? I'm just curious. There seems to be a pretty big separation between ""town"" and ""campus"" aside from those bits of downtown right next to campus, and Telegraph of course. 

I'm always up for playing townie tour guide, if anyone would be interested in a trip to the Bulb and the crockery beach or something and doesn't have a car. :)

Me: 31, a chick, friendly, chill, into the artsy bits of Burning Man but not a hippie, always looking to meet interesting people. ","foothill is an exotic trip for me
I graduated a few years ago and was able to explore all that you mentioned + Rose Garden, Botanical Garden, Greek Theatre,  Lawrence Hall of Science, West Berkeley, Elmwood District (home to my favorite restaurant Trattoria la Siciliana and Ici of course), Gourmet Ghetto, parts of Oakland, Alameda, SF, and San Jose/Cupertino, and much much more. I'm back in SoCal now and really miss the Bay. Berkeley is such a special city; hopefully I'll be able to go back for a few more years. I think what got me to explore so much during my time at Cal were three things: a love for good food (and its abundance in the area), a car, and a girlfriend with similar interests!

I indeed do know of people who stay near campus for all four years and end up with the opinion that Berkeley is boring and has crappy food. This just makes me really, really sad.
I've been to the Fire Trails, Indian Rock Park, Urban Ore, Tilden, the Marina, Gourmet Ghetto, and Cordonices, but these have all been sort of ""landmark"" trips for me, that I likely won't make more than a couple of times. My experience of the western US is pretty much the square mile bounded by Shattuck, Dwight, Ridge, and the lab, and then anything visible from BART to the airports. 


I'd say the campus-centrism is caused by not having a car (there are breaks when I have oodles of time and still don't go places) combined with friends living in a ring around campus, which makes trips away from campus super long for at least somebody, combined with very limited bus service unless one makes the walk downtown, in which case it's just as easy to BART to San Francisco as it is to bus to Tilden.


Another factor, however, is that many of us don't hear about these places early enough. What are some other fun places to go in Berkeley that I didn't mention?


I'd definitely appreciate a tour from a resident!


I live in Southside pretty close to people's park. I am able to do all the shopping I need between my house and campus. There are also a ton of great study and hangout spots in between as well. Because of this, I pretty much never need to go outside of the general route that is between my place and school.

In my entire time at Berkeley (just graduated), I have only been to the Marina once and that was because I accidentally stayed too long on the 51B Bus...I promptly left. haha
My boyfriend and I have a car so we've made a point to get out as much as we can during our last 4 years here (just graduated!). I've kayaked at the Marina, walked around the Albany Bulb, gone to Emeryville for the occasional Ikea meal/drinks at Honor Bar & Kitchen, gone over to 4th Street for Bette's and Vik's, Solano for La Farine, Tilden Park for the Little Farm and reading by Lake Anza, etc! We also love going to SF, and crossing the bridge over to have day trips to Napa, Healdsburg, Pt Reyes, etc. My biggest advice to incoming students would be to EXPLORE! This area has so much to offer.
Good on you!  Resident here.  I know a few Berkeley grads who graduated only to regret not exploring Berkeley while they had the chance.  Most of the students I've chatted up spend all their time studying or hanging out on/near campus.

The community outside campus is interesting, and there are so many wonderful places to explore around here.  Tilden is amazing--I swam in the lake on my last birthday.

I'd add one thing to your list:  the Sake tour at Takara USA on 4th street.  Also Vik's.

I have always wanted to, but all of my friends are very campus centric...they won't wander past a ten minute walk of campus or their apartment. 
I can't really go anywhere that isn't accessible by transit, but I do try to explore other neighborhoods of Berkeley: the Marina, Northside/Hills, Albany Hill/Bulb, and 4th Street. 
I looooove Tilden Park. I have been trying to find those steam trains but it is hard since the 65 only goes so far :( 
i think the berkeley rose garden (which is different from the botanical garden) is a great place to watch the sunset. that and there's a huge 40-ft slide in the park nextdoor. the marina is actually a poor place for watersports: very high waves around sunset, and makes for a bumpy ride for sailing and kayaking. my motion sickness was not amused. the f bus to and from emeryville is not reliable, and the shops there are very expensive. solano shops aren't any more or less quirky than shattuck shops, but at least the 18 bus is somewhat reliable. i've gotten lost in tilden park before, and it was quite serene... which reminds me, lake anza is beautiful around this time of year. el cerrito has plenty of fun activities, like rock climing, yoga, and it has many shops, so it's a convenient place for just chilling or shopping for stuff.
Towny here too, I'm often surprised at how close to campus people stay.  This really is an amazing town (especially food-wise) and to limit yourself to shattuck square and telegraph seems like a crime.
I've been here for two years so far and it sounds like I guess I've been to quite a few places. o.o (I live on South Side, btw, with no car.)

- Walk around the Berkeley Marina for a ESPM field trip
- Regular trips down to the animal shelter for volunteering - basically not far from the Marina, I think
- Rose Garden and Codornices Park - I LOVE THE CEMENT SLIDE
- Botanical Garden for ESPM & Bio
- Lawrence Hall of Science for ESPM... (lol I see a trend here)
- Tilden Park's Little Farm for a Pre-Vet Club trip ‚ù§
- To Zachary's, Fenton's, Ici's, and some sushi place on college
- To Whole Foods, Safeway (both), and Trader Joe's for grocery shopping
- To both North and Southside Asian ghetto
- To the Off the Grid (food trucks) back when they were all the way up past Safeway on Shattuck - and I walked there from Unit 1 with some friends
- I dated a guy for a month who had a car, so we went quite a few places - down to Emeryville for a movie and window-shopping, to In & Out with his friends, up the mountain past Lawrence Hall of Science for seeing the lights at night and then the car broke down at the Lawrence Hall of Science parking lot at like midnight on my birthday (haha), etc.

A large majority of these were by bus rides with friends.  

I guess I should spend my next 2-3 years finding more places to go. I'll keep in mind the suggestions made here. :3
I don't go out every weekend, but I have biked to the Richmond Marina via the Bay trail. I've also biked up to Lake Anza and the Little Farm, but I only went that far because my boyfriend pushed me beyond my limit (I'm not in the best shape of my life). Another time we biked from Berkeley to Emeryville. We've also walked the fire trails up to the Lawrence Hall of Science, which was incredibly fun despite not bringing water bottles. I've been to San Francisco three or four times, all of which I either took the bus or Bart. 
When I'm not doing any of this stuff, however, I'm usually in my room browsing reddit.
Watching the sunset at Indian Rock Park was one of the most romantic things I ever did in Berkeley! lol, only went once though... shame
Tilden Park is the shit. Amazing views of the entire bay.
I've been wanting to go to Tilden Park for a couple of years but haven't had a chance yet. Is there a bus that goes there from the campus area? I don't have a car or bike.
I know this will sound sad but for my first two years in college, I never went further away from Shattuck Avenue, Gayley, Hearst and Dwight. Once I left the dorms I stopped being as sheltered but the times I did venture out was mostly out to Oakland. 
I go all over... love seeing the rest of the east bay, esp. oakland and albany. beautiful places, great restaurants, very unique and admirable aesthetics, such a great experience.... also im one of the lucky few who has a car. 

it's just really nice to get away from all the other students once in a while... the campus can be such a bubble


East Oakland.
As another Berkeley resident, I was a little disappointed when I found out /r/Berkeley was for the UC, especially when I found out they don't get out much and just want to talk about UC policies and not awesome things to do in Berkeley/ the Bay Area
Definitely limited by lack of car. 
The other places I mentioned-- Albany Bulb is nice. The Pt Isabel Dog Park and open space is lovely, as well-- lots of dogs, if you're into that, but it's also just a lovely bayside walk and a park. There's a cafe there too. 

There's also a damned good BBQ joint called Looney's on MLK. 

And the Asian Mall (Pacific East, I think?) is really rad. Good food there. 
I agree. I go down there occasionally for a change, and I'm like...hmm, this is nice, but it's not BERKELEY to me! :)
Thanks for sharing. Yeah, biking up to Tilden is hard! Good job. I live in North Berkeley in the flats, and when I was training for longer bike rides I'd start up TOWARDS Tilden and see how far I could get up into the hills before crying like a little bitch. :)
I'm pretty sure either the 65 or 67(forget which one) goes to tilden on the weekends.  I suggest trying to get a bike, in Berkeley you can get just about anywhere within 15 minutes from downtown area except like Grizzly Peak or something.
There definitely is, but I think it starts from near the north side of campus. 

Check Google Maps - I arrived late the day I was going (so my friends had already left) so I relied on just Google Maps to get there myself and got there just fine. (Note that the stops to Little Farm and the actual park are several bus stops apart, though.)
I have made it without a car to almost every single spot mentioned in this thread, and many more besides.  Walking and public transit can get you pretty much everywhere, although a bike is also awesome.  Very very few things do you need a car for.
there's these things you all have free passes for called the bus, look into it.
Well, I do love shattuck square (again, the FOOD!), but I really don't like telegraph to be honest.  Too many of those midwest train hopping kids harassing you for bud or money.  I think the only time I go is further down for some Bakesale Betty's.
Boyfriend here, if you are in berkeley and bike a fair amount going up to tilden and circling the reservoir out back is a must the scenery is gorgeousness to the max compared to the coast or anything back down ....
I looked into a bus once and I saw a few people sitting, but I'm still on campus. What did I do wrong?!"
