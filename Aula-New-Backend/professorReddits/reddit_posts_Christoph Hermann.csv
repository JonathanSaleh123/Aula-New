Should I take History 160 or Econ 115?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/do0dvx/should_i_take_history_160_or_econ_115/,2019-10-27 15:46:02,"I can take either class for polecon and I could use some advice. Brad DeLong is teaching 115 next semester. Should I avoid him by taking History 160? 160 is being taught by Christoph Hermann, who usually teaches in the sociology department I think.",Have only had Hermann in sociology courses (took his economic sociology and sociology of work courses) and it was fine.
