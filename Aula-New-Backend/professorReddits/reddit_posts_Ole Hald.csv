Anyone enrolled in Math 151?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k32sil/anyone_enrolled_in_math_151/,2020-11-28 20:14:35,"Is anyone here enrolled in Ole Hald’s Math 151?  I’ve been trying to reach Ole for weeks via email with no response, and all my advisor did was send him another email lol. I’d really appreciate a Zoom link to his office hours if anyone’s got it, or some other way of contacting him.  Thanks!","Taking Math 151 rn and 152 next semester. Funny thing, Hald doesn't use Zoom at all; he's just been recording his lectures and writing notes beforehand. Even his office hours are just him on email and answering questions when we ask him for questions.  


From my classmates, I've heard that he's pretty responsive during the set lecture hour (MWF 10-11) and his 'office hours' (MWF 11-12), so try sending an email during those times.
Wow, that’s crazy, I figured all professors were at least doing Zoom office hours.  I’ll definitely try during the class time, thanks!
how was math 151?"
