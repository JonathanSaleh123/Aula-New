"Maz Jobrani, an Iranian American standup comic, actor and UC Berkeley alumnus, will deliver the 2017 Commencement Address",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/03/20/commencement-speaker-2017/,2017-03-20 10:26:25,,"This is pretty amazing that they have a speaker already booked. Seems super early given previous history on how the selection process usually goes.  

Also, this seems like a REALLY underwhelming choice. Hadn't even heard of this man before today. Seems almost like a ""Winter commencement"" speaker. Even Bill Maher seemed like a more prolific ""political"" choice if the committee was going to go down this route again.
who dis
I know him as a comedian. Really funny guy. Although, not sure what he's done outside of comedy to warrant a commencement speech.
The people have spoken, and they demand to be taken to flavortown. How long will their voices be ignored?
That's an odd way of spelling ""Guy Fieri.""
Whenever I read his last name i read it as Jabroni... we got a Jabroni for a commencement speaker
Steve Wozniak in 2013, Nancy Pelosi in 2014, Marc Benioff in 2015, Sheryl Sandberg in 2016 and . . . who's this dude?

Nothing against him but I feel like spring general commencement for a university like Cal deserves someone more recognizable at the very least.
Well, this is disappointing. We only have graduation, and of all the names on the list, why him? No offense to him. I'm sure he's a great person, but this is very underwhelming.

Especially considering MCB commencement replaced Jennifer Doudna with one of my professors.

tbh, I don't even know who this guy is, and I voted for Obama or Zuckerberg. Was this guy even on the list
[deleted]
Who the fuck is this guy? Did the committee to find a speaker just get really lazy this year or something?

At least people have heard of Guy Fieri.
I'm baffled by the people saying they've never heard of Maz Jobrani:

**From Wikipedia**


Jobrani has since made appearances on shows like The Colbert Report, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Talkshow with Spike Feresten, ""Whitney"", and regularly performs at top comedy clubs (in California and New York) such as The Comedy Store. He made an appearance as a dental patient on an episode of Still Standing, in the pilot episodes of Better Off Ted, The Knights of Prosperity, on an episode of Cedric the Entertainer Presents, on an episode of Malcolm in the Middle as Robber#2 and on an episode of The West Wing as a Saudi prince. He also made an appearance in 13 Going on 30. He has toured with the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. He provided the voice of Ahmed Farahnakian in the audiobook version of World War Z. Jobrani has written a movie with a friend called Jimmy Vestvood: Amerikan Hero.[8]

Jobrani makes occasional appearances on NPR's news quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! and American Public Media's Wits. He appeared on episode 118, October 28, 2010 of WTF with Marc Maron. Additionally, Jobrani co-hosts his own podcast on the All Things Comedy podcasting network with fellow comedians Al Madrigal and Chris Spencer. Titled Minivan Men, the podcast chronicles the lives and experiences of the three hosts with particular focus on fatherhood.

He played Jafar in the 2015 musical fantasy television film Descendants.
I grew up listening to ""Wait Wait"" while mowing the lawn. Looking forward to this! 
I am concerned that after petitioning against Bill Maher, booing off Peter Thiel and riots against Milo, many well-known public figures may not be too keen on coming to Berkeley.
Welp, judging from the comments in this thread, it would seem that a good number of Cal students don't listen to NPR, or at the very least ""Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!""
I see a lot of people hating on this dude because he's low profile. I understand the argument that UCB is well-known and deserves a recognized speaker and I also think that the commencement speaker shouldn't have to be famous, a celebrity, or even well-known. There are many individuals who have contributed tremendously that aren't so well known that would make great speakers.

He is only invited because 

a) He is a Cal alum. 

b) His iranian heritage makes him relevant in the current political climate.

I am underwhelmed too, but being a comedian/writer, I feel like he would give a good speech.
I'd heard of him on Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, but that's about it. This is a safe choice, all things considered, and I wouldn't be surprised if choices going forward are more lower-profile since they're less likely to cause protest.

and at least he's an alum

Pretty much my feelings.  Marc Benioff was probably the worst of those four, but at least he had a large profile. 
This guy's more likely to actually speak to experiences you will appreciate, understand, and actually to be positive instead of being self-aggrandizing, which happens more often than not.
Who is giving the MCB one if Doudna isn't?
Hey, you could have had the Salesforce CEO talking about how much he loves ""gays"" like we did in '15. At least this guy will be funny and have something to say to Berkeley beyond ""My life is great and I am great"" 
You kids today.

My class got a skier who didn't even finish college as commencement speaker. Ugh.
i mean on the other side of the coin... as a recent grad who lives a few hours away i'm definitely coming into town that weekend to hear his speech. seems like it would be really interesting, and at least he'll be a compelling speaker who actually KNOWS how to give a speech unlike benioff/pelosi/wozniak
Yeah, because killing it at the laugh shack is the bar we should measure people by to get commencement speakers. I bet Sheryl Sandberg would have gotten boo'd off. 
People are saying they've never heard of him because they've never heard of him.  The Wikipedia you just quoted basically says that he had a handful of night show appearances, a few one-episode guest appearances in some moderately successful TV-shows, does standup at comedy clubs, and a motley collection of miscellaneous appearances.  That's hardly an A-list star; it's not even a B-list star.

I don't want to shit on the guy, he doesn't deserve that, I don't have any issue with him.  He may wind up making a great speech.  But past commencement speakers have been titans of industry, top political leaders, technology revolutionaries, etc.  I don't think he really matches up to that.
> ...on an episode of Malcolm in the Middle as Robber#2...

The latter half of the first paragraph is just a list of his TV appearances as an extra. He's literally a D-lister. People may have seen or heard him in media once or twice, but there are literally tens of thousands of people who would fit that criteria.
Jobrani's awesome!  Those complaining abou him seem to not have a clue.
trolllllollololo
> This is so progressive! The last four commencement speakers have all been white. We need more Iranian role models, not useless rich white people! Berkeley deserves credit for taking a step in the positive direction of cultural diversity.

Is /u/kmbabau the same user as /u/kmbabua? Both spout off nonsense.
Wow, I somehow missed that episode of Wait Wait Don't Tell Me (huge NPR fan!).

I think if anything, this seems like MORE of a political choice than choosing to be more low profile.  He's a man (after looking up his work and some interviews) that seems to focus a lot on his heritage and immigration in his sketches, making him quite a topical choice in the current political climate.  However, that's just my initial reaction.  Even I was skeptical of Bill Maher's speech (and I'm a decent fan of his work) and it worked out well in the end. I just find it a little disheartening that we can't seem to find relatively big-profile neutral speakers. For example, have we reached out to someone like John Cho (actor)?
Actually iirc, wozniak's speech wasn't great either. I love the guy but he isn't exactly charismatic. Sandberg was the only good one, which is why they might have gone with a guy whose job is to speak on stage.
Is that all you want in a speaker? Benioff's speech was shit. The guy was a blowhard who talked about how great he and his company are for 30 mins, had absolutely no interesting perspective to offer. It felt like an extended ad for silicon valley, as if we needed that. I would take this guy over Benioff in a heartbeat.

Yes, and if you compare that résumé to that of other comedians like Louis C.K. and Joe Rogan - it's completely on par with that. What is a comedian supposed to do, be the lead actor in 5 hit summer blockbusters before they should be commonly known? My point was only that this guy is legit, not that everyone *should* know about him. I was just expressing honest surprise at how people were up-in-arms about this guy being a no-name comedian. 

No, this is a troll impersonating a troll
From what I can recall, he's something of a regular on Wait Wait.  Maybe if you heard his voice?
I swear he's a regular panelist on WWDTM
I think just about any high-profile speaker would have some reason to get protested.
Why would you want the guy from Harold and Kumar to speak? If UCI can get Obama surely we can get someone​who isn't a no name and isn't famous for being in a stoner movie.
> Marc Benioff was probably the worst of those four, but at least he had a large profile.

I repeat what I said. His speech was by far the worst, but we don't know how a speech will turn out until they present the day-of.  Many people had gripes about Sheryl Sandberg being Benioff 2.0 and look how that ended up. I'm stating that just based purely on the pick alone, this seems like a low reach.
Pelosi was terrible also in '14.  It was a political campaign speech and the only thing she seemed to know about Cal was that the 'Free Speech Movement' happened here.

Having an actual alumnus returning to give a speech is what commencements were designed for.

 (If you cannot land the sitting president of the United States, which used to be a regular thing at Cal, prior to the Free Speech Movement.  That said, the current occupant of said office would probably ignore our location simply because we have too many words in those things they call books in our libraries.)
I LOVE Robert Tijian. I'd be more excited about him than Doudna. Sure Doudna has more name recognition, but Tijian is a much better speaker. 
The guy fieri thing is a meme so there's no real substantive point to be made there in either direction.

>isn't that what berkleee tumblereenas are drooling over?

If you think ""berkleee tumblereenas"" are who should be deciding who should decide who to have at graduation, we have some deep disagreements. This is graduation, which is largely about the family about who are graduating anyway, which is not when I want to hear a half hour long speech about the problems about trump and his views on immigration, or whatever else he wants to criticize about our society.

>I just think its kinda fucked that a bunch of people here are judging a dude that they know nothing about.

This isn't some guy we're judging off the street, he is the person whose giving the speech, people are absolutely right to judge him in this context. The fact that no one other than maybe the .1% of people who follow him on npr or whatever is already great grounds to judge him negatively for this job. No is saying he should stop doing his comedy or whatever, people are judging him in the context of him as the speaker.
What are you talking about? He is nowhere close to being as well known as Louis CK or Joe Rogan. He has 100k followers on twitter while Joe Rogan has almost 3 million. 

Not that they would make good candidates for commencement speakers either. Maybe Seinfeld.

I wouldn't want Louis CK or Joe Rogan doing the speech either, this is UC Berkeley graduation not the laugh factory. He might not be a no name in the comedy world, but he is the broader world.
Now that is progressive
Oh, as in he's a regular guest/participant?? Not the special guest that is usually a celebrity or special interview? TIL.

EDIT: After listening to an interview, yup, that voice is definitely recognizable.  
John Cho has done a lot more beyond Harold and Kumar, specifically and most notably his work in the Star Trek movies. I'm mostly just throwing a name out there where we could have other people beyond comedians.
Sheryl Sandberg's speech was nothing great either... She went on and in about her loss. I get that she lost her husband, but that's not what you talk.about when you're celebrating young people entering a new chapter of their lives.

She made it all about herself.
agreed
He's great, but he's my current professor. I was kind of excited for Doudna who I've never had. 
[deleted]
> She made it all about herself.

Steve Jobs' commencement speech at Stanford was about three stories from his life. And that is arguably the best speech given in the history of commencement speeches.
> She made it all about herself.

Do you happen to know the reason why commencement speakers exist? It's to impart their wisdom, life experiences, trials and tribulations onto the graduating class to go forth with perspective from someone who most would consider to be ""successful.""  Go try and find a commencement speech that doesn't involve discussing themselves, their experiences and their own lives. They don't exist because they aren't interesting or insightful.  Sheryl Sandberg's speech was quite well-written in all regards because she opened up about a personal aspect of her life that she hadn't previously publicly disclosed to try and discuss the life lessons she learned. 

I don't know what you want from a commencement speaker, but Sandberg's speech was a pretty good one.  
Are you in 110? He lectured 5 times, he was more of a guest speaker than a legit professor for the class. I would switch my majors and graduate this semester just to see him talk again.

I had Doudna for the first 1/3 of Bio 1A, and she would have been my worst Bio professor at Berkeley except for the fact that she was DOUDNA. 
>I get the feeling that just because he's a comedian or that I mentioned that he has social/political emphases in his talks that you believe he's going to focus on those things during his commencement speech.

You're the one who says that him talking about that kind of message somehow qualifies him to be a speaker here, and I don't see literally anything else that he's done that could otherwise do so.

""This isn't some guy we're judging off the street"" refers to we're not judging him as a random person, he's only being judged as he's apparently speaking at graduation. The expectation of someone off the street is that you don't know who they are, that is not the same for graduation speaker.

Don't act that someone everyone not on this sub is really into the comedy scene or NPR, and we're all just missing out, because you know that isn't true. And don't play like you don't know that the expectation at graduations it is a big deal who gives the speech, and there is a big expectation that they be well known and accomplished because people want to know what they have to say. Having someone no one knows to do the speech like this is out of the norm, feel free to look at [Harvard's speakers](http://www.harvard.edu/on-campus/commencement/commencement-day-speakers) or any other top school.

The message is important, but what do people want? They want to hear from influential people who they admire, and clearly that was not delivered upon.
Yeah, 110."
