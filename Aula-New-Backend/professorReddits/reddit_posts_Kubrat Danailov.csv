Here’s the list of 110 GSIs:

Matthew McCauley (mccauley@math.berkeley.edu),
Kubrat Danailov (danailov@berkeley.edu),
Max I Wimberley (maximilya@berkeley.edu),
Zirui Zhou (zirui_zhou@berkeley.edu)","Jonathan G is super based.
McCauley is fantastic! I've also heard good things about Wimberley. Kubrat is... not the best.
what does it mean to be “super based”?
any info on zirui?
What’s your experience with Kubrat?
~~pH > 7~~ super good
Sadly I have never met him/heard about him.
Zirui is pretty caring and willing to help. And she gives hard quizzes in sections.

What that mean
""hello"" in a version of pig-latin"
