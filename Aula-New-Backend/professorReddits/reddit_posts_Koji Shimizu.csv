Math 104,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mt4j4b/math_104/,2021-04-17 19:39:50,Which professor would y'all recommend for math 104: Professor Ryan Hass or Koji Shimizu?,"Take Ryan Hass. I'm with Koji right now and it is *awful*. He refuses to explain things in office hours, and his tests are brutal on another level (even compared to other 104 sections). On top of that, he doesn't drop any midterms or hw, so mess up even a little bit and you're screwed. He grades generously but in a really inconsistent fashion. Avoid the stress and just enroll with Hass, it'll be better I *promise you*.

On a more personal note, Koji has been very tone deaf when addressing students stuggling with mental health during the pandemic. He literally responded to a crying student by telling them to eat chocolate.
Hass is a great guy. Never had him as a prof (time conflicts) but had the pleasure to speak with him and just a super chill guy."
Which math professor would you recommmend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6cbeq/which_math_professor_would_you_recommmend/,2020-04-22 16:53:00,"I haven't taken any uppers for math yet but I'm hearing so many bad things about a lot of profs :k. The classes I'm thinking of are 104(taught by Ian L Charlesworth,Sebastian Eterovic,Koji Shimizu), 110(taught by Zvezdelina Stankova), 113(taught by Semen Artamonov), and 128A(Olga Holtz) Thanks in advance :)","Art for 113 is really good imo, sometimes his lectures and instruction are unclear, but he is a massive chiller and cares that you do well. Fair and all that, I have no exp with the other sorry
I took math 113 with Koji Shimizu and it went pretty well. He is very happy to interact with students and answer questions. I will warn though he does have an accent (I did not find it hard to understand but hey you do you).

I took math 110 with Zvezda and I have been traumatized. I would say the class content is fair but she tends to be rather intimidating. Some people really like her, some people still have nightmares about saying ""dobro utro."" She also has an accent but it is pretty mild (again, you do you). Learning about Bulgaria was cool I guess.

As for the difficulty of classes (from easiest to hardest based on my sad grades): Math 128A, Math 110, Math 104, Math 113.
Holtz I’ve heard is very good for 128A.
Aight, thanks a lot!
Wow is 128A easier than 110? I had not expected that since I always thought 128 is terrible
Got it thanks :)
oof sorry for slow reply. I don't think 128A is easier than 110. However, I did get a higher grade in 128A than math 110. I don't know how that happened but such is life. I took 128A later so perhaps my more developed skills helped.
I see, thanks a lot :))))"
Math 104 instructors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jf2zvn/math_104_instructors/,2020-10-20 18:05:24,"Sup everyone, Im looking for a good professor for real analysis next semester, but there are a lot of choices:

Mariusz Wodzicki

Yu-Wei Fan
	
Koji Shimizu 

Peng Zhou

Dmitry Vaintrob

Ian Charlesworth

Which one should I go with?","Definitely not Wodzicki. Heard good things about Yu-Wei Fan. One of my friends who took it with Shimizu said it was the worst thing he’d ever done
I’m taking it with Vaintrob rn. He’s a good guy but his lectures are not great, they’re all over the place and he is constantly making errors and correcting himself. It seems like he doesn’t prep for the lessons at all and his notation is totally inconsistent. He has also taken over a month to grade our midterms in a class of 25
Really?  Everyone I know absolutely loves Shimizu.
Ahh maybe you’re right. Math 104 is just ass no matter who you’re taking it with, I’m in it rn"
Lovejoy 113 syllabus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j3eg7e/lovejoy_113_syllabus/,2020-10-01 11:37:26,"Hi everyone, just wondering if anyone who's taken Math 113 with Jeremy Lovejoy has a copy of his syllabus, as he doesn't post them on his Berkeley page. I've heard he's pretty good and I'd just like to see how he structures his class/what the pace is. If anyone's currently in his class, how does he deal w/lectures & exams while remote? Thanks ahead of time and go bears! 

P.S. I'm also taking 104 in Spring, what teachers are good? Currently only Koji Shimizu is listed, who I've heard good things about, along with Ryan Hass.","in the class right now, here's the syllabus:

[https://math.berkeley.edu/\~lovejoy/Math113F20](https://math.berkeley.edu/~lovejoy/Math113F20)

I will say though his lectures aren't anything amazing imo, they're definitely not bad but I've eventually resorted to external resources because his lectures don't bring much new insight. the class in entirely asynchronous and we get 24 hours for exams though, which is kinda nice.
Ryan Hass is the best, great lectures and really nice guy who makes himself available for OH and emails. 

Summer discussions were kinda awkward but I think most zoom classes are like that.
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it!"
