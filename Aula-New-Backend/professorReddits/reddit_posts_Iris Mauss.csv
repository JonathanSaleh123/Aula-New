Social Psychology (Brian Powers),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ko534b/social_psychology_brian_powers/,2020-12-31 20:37:53,"What are y’all’s experiences with this class/professor; did you actually learn? I’m currently choosing between this, Education 140 with Glynda Hull, and Psych 160 with Iris Mauss (if its open still).","I took edua140ac last fall. It required 30 + volunteer time, 8 field notes and one final paper. The grade was lenient but needed to spend so much time on it.
I just took it this past semester, pretty chill. I never attended lecture and got A- on both major papers.
took psych 160 w iris mauss and it was really chill; for tests they would release study guides for what exact topics were in scope. however you will need to read the textbook in addition to lecture. if you end up taking the class I have the e version of the textbook."
