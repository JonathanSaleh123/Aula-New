Rhetoric 20 Winnie wong midterm,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xfjgaz/rhetoric_20_winnie_wong_midterm/,2022-09-15 23:15:23,"This class is going to make me have a break down and it‚Äôs week 4. I‚Äôm studying for her midterm and i don‚Äôt even know what i don‚Äôt know. The readings are DENSE AS FUCK, i barely understand them. Her lectures have a strict ‚Äúno recording or photos‚Äù policy yet she doesn‚Äôt post slides and moves through slides and concepts to write everything down. Students who‚Äôve taken her class in the past, any advice on how to approach the midterm? What should I know? Or advice on how to pass this class with an A or B?","[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Geugz7pK6ZS60\_5-n-ySBSLLDBcB2QJnzBNQEU9sJMY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Geugz7pK6ZS60_5-n-ySBSLLDBcB2QJnzBNQEU9sJMY/edit?usp=sharing)

Thank you so much!!!
Thank you!!! Real af üôèüèΩ
Im a rhetoric major and have taken 152 AC, 121, 103A, 116, and some others. Rhetoric 20 is my least favorite. I love my major, i find all my classes so interesting and amazing but if you can try to take another class that isn‚Äôt 20, i would recommend it!"
