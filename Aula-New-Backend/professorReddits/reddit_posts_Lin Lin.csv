SOCIOL 167 with Edwin K Lin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1buxipp/sociol_167_with_edwin_k_lin/,2024-04-03 09:48:20,Has anyone taken this course? Seems pretty interesting. Would love some input on grading/workload/exams from any previous or current students.,"sociology major or not, everyone should take a course with lin. awesome professor, really easy to understand his lectures and extremely approachable as well
Great course, really loved it! You get to do lots of creative assignments too and he’s a good lecturer
he changed the course of my academic interests! this was my favorite class at cal by far, highly recommend!!
I'm not a sociology major and the prerequisites say that I should have taken either 1, 3, or 3ac or get instructor consent. I haven't taken any of those or reached out to the prof before but I would like to take it for media studies. Can I still enroll?
Awesome - the course seems really interesting! How was the grading and workload?
super easy workload, felt more like a 3 unit class than a 4 unit class (though may be biased since i enjoyed all the readings). the grading is very lenient, there are two quizzes that are really straightforward and the essays aren't bad at all! people in the class are really helpful also!
this is super helpful; thank you!"

Math 54 with Lin Lin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6j2b1t/math_54_with_lin_lin/,2017-06-23 09:31:21,"Not many reviews of Lin anywhere, wondering if anyone has any experience in being in his 54 or even any other class of.","I took 54 with Lin Lin last fall. He has a bit of an accent, but it's not too bad at all. I thought he was a pretty straightforward lecturer, and he posts all his lecture notes online. I wasn't ever surprised by anything on his midterms or finals. I managed to get a B+ only going to discussion and reading the book, so if you're diligent about going to class I'm sure you'll do fine.
I had Lin Lin for 54 last fall. I felt like his lectures were pretty good for the most part, even though I couldn't wake up in time for most of them. The exams were pretty good, questions weren't anything that I wasn't expecting and it ended up having a decent curve. Lin Lin covered surprisingly little, though, it seems, especially out of the diffeq side
Between Nadler and Lin, would you strongly recommend one over the other or is either a good option?
Thank you!
Some of my friends took 54 with Nadler at the same time, and more or less the only difference was that Nadler's class covered more material than we did in Lin's lectures. Pick whichever one suits your schedule better, they're both good professors.
Thank you so much!
I must say - at the end of 54 is where things usually get difficult (differential equation part). In Lin's Fall 2016 class we barely skimmed the surface of DEs, so our final wasn't too hard in that respect. That said, the DE part isn't really conceptually difficult, and he probably will learn from his mistakes from last fall and cover more (or not, idk). To be honest, 54 is a class that you can just learn from the textbook, so it is pretty professor independent unless you get a professor who curves to a C (or doesn't curve)."

Are you worried about not passing the class or just final? 
not passing the class, what's the likelihood that there will be a curve?
I'm pretty sure grades will be scaled according to what percentage of students Lin wants to get an A, B, C, etc.

So I'm pretty sure there's a high chance there's a curve -- how much it will help you will be determined by the overall raw grade distribution, though."

Lin Algebra and CS70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/iaogvq/lin_algebra_and_cs70/,2020-08-16 00:44:50,How much linear algebra knowledge is needed for cs70? because i currently know nothing,"nothing lol don't let the course staff fool you with their bullshit
pretty much only basic matrix manipulations for markov chains. for calculus, you should know  how to calculate derivatives, integrals, and integral by parts
I know there was some extra linalg in Sp20, but I just finished over summer and there was only basic matrix operations for Markov chains for linear algebra.
just finished summer cs70. you need to know row reduction for polynomials and, as others have mentioned, basic matrix manipulations (e.g. matrix multiplication) for markov chains. knowledge of eigenvalues might help with understanding markov chains but imo not necessary. I didn't take linear algebra before cs70 either, watched the series on linear from 3Blue1Brown and skimmed through some EE16A notes, and did well in the class, so you should be fine! Take a look at HW0 on the cs70 website if you want; there are two sections on linear algebra and calculus.
also how much calculus as well lol
Okay thanks a lot.
Not a lot for summer 2020. Just needa know basic differentiation and integration techniques. The hardest calculus of wot you’d encounter would prob be integration by parts.
There is a minor amount of multivariable calculus as well, for continuous probability. However it is fairly trivial and can be self-learned quickly since the areas of integration you work with in 70 are always fairly simple.
Additionally and optionally (meaning not totally required), surface-Level basic definitions understanding of Calculus 2 Convergence, Divergence, Taylor Series, and similar stuff is good to understand some stuff in the notes of CS 70 Probability"

there's no linalg in CS70
When I took it there wasn’t any but you do need to know how to work (very basically) with matrices at the very end of the semester because Markov chains uses state matrices and whatnot. It’s not emphasized at all though. Although sahai always stresses mathematical maturity so he might emphasize linear algebra in proofs somehow?
The first hw has a matrices problem and it caught me off guard ://
what the fuck

that wasn't there when I took the class (SP18)

then again i didn't take it with sahai

I meant I have already taken 16A and 70. I will be doing 127, 61b, and 170 along with this though.
Ohhhhh shoot I can’t read. Out of these four I’d say 110 is definitely on the easier end. Also that’s quite a few techs, if it gets stressful do understand that you can always  drop some classes :)
tbh 110 will probably be your easiest class. (61b has a nicer grade distribution but is a pain workload-wise.)"
Questions about Sociol C167 with Edwin Lin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6pb6qw/questions_about_sociol_c167_with_edwin_lin/,2017-07-24 13:34:51,"I'm registered for Sociol C167 and I was wondering how rigorous is the course. I'm taking a total of 15 units including this class, but based on the syllabi I found online (fall 2015 and spring 2016) it seems doable. What do you think? What advice do you have about succeeding in the class? Do you know of any resources that I can access now so I can get a head start with the readings and possibly papers? Does anyone have the Fall 2016 syllabus? 

Thanks","I took this class. I think I did four readings. I went to class about half the time. Passed with an A. It depends I guess if you're a sociology major, but most students find this class to be somewhat interesting, but mostly easy. The only thing he is strict about is deadlines. Do your papers, turn them in on time, and make a decent effort. You'll do fine. 
I honestly have no idea, I most likely did MLA everything, but I would ask Lin. 
I didn't take it with Lin, but the class was pretty easy and relatively low effort. Really interesting topics though
I took Soc C167 with Lin and it was a VERY easy class. There's one two page paper, a short answer take-home midterm, a ten-page project, and an eight-page take-home final. These four writing assignments are your entire grade in the class. I went to half the lectures and only read the readings that were relevant to the questions asked on the exams and writing assignments and I got an A. I even BS-ed the ethnography project and still got a 100% on it. This is all in light of the fact that I am a poor writer. If you choose to take this class, there is no need to be worried about grades whatsoever. Also, form a google doc for the exams (which he lets you do) and use the quizlet for finding concise explanations of the theory. As long as you put in a little effort for each assignment, you can easily get an A.
Awesome. Thanks for the response. Do you still have the reading material, notes, or any other useful information for this class? 
I might. I don't have notes for sure but I may have some of the power points and some readings. I'll take a look, can you pm me your edu email? 
did you do the virtual communities paper with MLA format heading and ASA citations?

I’ve done calc 3, DE, lin alg, however I’m curious if these classes will be intensive for a freshman.","If you love math then go for it, there are many that took math upper divs freshman year so it is feasible if you are smart and motivated. Make sure to be very familiar with analysis before math 126 though, you probably already are, but if there is any doubt, i would wait to take 126 later.
Consider h104 if you'll already know analysis going in. You should be able to take 222a/b sophomore year.
If you’ve read multiple good undergraduate textbooks and can do the exercises in those textbooks you should be good. You can also look at the textbooks for the class and skim it / try the problems.
Every year, there’s always a couple of 15 year olds (or younger) geniuses who matriculate to Berkeley who are Math majors.  So no worries, if you’re ready, you’re ready.

Who would you take?","If neither of them have good ratings, why not attend both of their lectures for the first week or so and decide which has the better teaching style for you?
I recommend taking the class with the understanding that you will learn only from the textbook. With that in mind, choose the professor with the kindest tests.
I'm taking it with Srivastava personally but I got stuck with an 8 AM discussion RIP :(
Don't know about these other professors but can confirm Gu sucks. Lectures would be more clear if he just did them in Chinese.
Doesn't matter. Try to take the supplemental class if they offer it. If Bon-Soon is still around, you will likely get an A in that class if you put in the effort. He's the best math teacher I've had at Berkeley, not sure if he's still around though..
I've heard many good things about Srivastava's teaching. Also I've met him and he's a really nice guy as well as insightful and good at explaining things.
Lin is a little hard to understand. Srivastava taught Math 55 this past semester and I heard good things about him.
Anyone have any experience with Vojta (H54)?
Sahai, EE 16A
Didn't know you could do this but I'll probably try it out.
So basically I should go into it assuming that I will learn almost everything from the textbook... because the professors are all bad?
What do you think of Srivastava? (if you're currently in his class)
Homework instructions unclear. Accidentally learned Chinese.
Can you explain the supplemental class more?
I had Vojta for H113 last semester. He is a bit dry and mostly follows the book, and he may seem unapproachable or boring. But he is very clear, has excellent and organized boardwork, and gives fair tests. He promptly posts all the homework material and exam information online. Also, his curve was nicer than I expected.

Maybe you can go to the first few classes and see if you like his teaching style.
Not because professors are bad, but learning math from a lecture is like trying to learn to swim from youtube videos. 
I mean that's not the worst takeaway
I believe they labeled it as Math 98 - Adjunct (like most other supplemental classes). There is typically very limited space in the class, I think we had about 20-25 for a full size Math 54 class.

Bon-Soon is a legend. The guy absolutely lives math, yes lives. He has an uncanny ability to make the material fun and understandable despite his corny jokes. We had practice midterms and tests to go along with our class. By the midway point of the semester, I had stopped going to actual lecture and just went to 98 with Bon-Soon.

Just checked and he has since moved on.. to UCLA of all places. Either way, look to take the adjunct class if possible. Easier to learn in a smaller environment than the massive Dwinelle classes."

Total units: 15 .","don't take 1B just do 56 or 54
I would do 54 over 56 just because it is recognized in the system by more majors and you don’t need to appeal for a code/seat which can cost you getting into upperdiv classes. Probably not an issue if u don’t plan on taking more than 3 techs a semester as then u can j phase1 everything
take math 56 or 54 instead but looks good otherwise
Don’t take 1B because:
1. You’ve already gotten a good score in BC, and if you don’t need to, it’s a waste of a class.
2. It’s possible that you don’t get a good grade in it - many exam questions are all or nothing points, so with BC you can get a 5 on the exam and points for questions with some partial credit on free response, that doesn’t exist here
3. Regardless of if you want to do industry or grad school, in computing linear algebra is king in basically every application. The most calculus you will use is taking an integral here or there. The content in lin alg and calculus is also extremely removed from each other.

I would highly recommend you take either a fun class, the lower division class for the data science domain emphasis you want to do, or lin alg
I had nearly the same schedule as you (R5A instead of B), and also had the opportunity to skip 1B but took it instead. It was an easy A+, but honestly my time would’ve been spent better taking 53, 54 or 56, all of which were required for my major(s). Don’t repeat my mistake, you can brush up on calc BC content over the next two months and go straight for linear algebra. It’s not that big of a jump, and wasting a semester on intro calc is not worth it.
dont take 1b just do 54 or 56
Take cs88 instead of 61a, counts and it is better for ppl with less experience
This is actually a fairly light schedule, good for freshmen 1st Sem, especially if you have programming experience. I recommend 56 over 1B. If you REALLY like calculus, take 53 later instead
regardless of math 54 or 56, don't do math 1B if you don't have to. if you're unsure about your math skills for your first semester, you can always do another breadth instead to just get acclimated to college life. maybe self-study some of the math 54/56 content on the side if you like. there's no need to rush.
Isn’t math 54 also considered a weed out? I’d be hesitant taking 2 weed outs (61A) all in my first semester haha
Tysm, this helps out a lot!!
thanks for the insight! Will take into consideration
as I surfed through the sub, i realized this was also big topic of debate. I looked into it and I think I want to pursue 61a, amongst other reasons, I do believe the notion that it prepares you better for 61b. Maybe not in terms of concept but rather the framework of problem solving developed in 61a. Also, if I ever want to try and transfer into CS (🤞) I can atleast attempt to do so. But who knows, I might come across another COMPELLING argument for CS 88
How come not taking 1B seems to be the STRONG general consensus? I’m not against it or anything but ig I just don’t understand why not?  Is it mostly because it’d be a waste of time?
no you aren’t gonna get weeded out… math 54 has a higher grade distribution than math 1b but i think paulin is teaching 56
Your choice. 88 preps you for 61b just fine imo, and you can still declare cs with 88 (idk if they changed that but that’s how I switched to cs)
I’m personally on the side for taking Math 1B. 
I came to Cal after getting a 5 on AP calc BC exam, and choose to enroll in math 53 my first semester. Although I thought I was strong in math, I could not keep up with the pace of math 53. I ended up dropping it and retaking Math 1B where I got an A+. Math 1B gave me a strong, Berkeley-level foundation which let me get an A in both Math 53 and math 54 the following semester. 

Two pros to retaking 1B are:
-a GPA boost since you’ll probably be very prepared from your previous calculus experience 
-set a strong foundation for the following classes 

One small rebuttal however is that linear algebra is not very dependent on calculus at all. I’d argue you could take math 54 / 56 without knowing calc whatsoever (aside from Differential equations in 54 I suppose).

My situation was more unique in that I needed the calculus foundation in Math 1B to do well in multivariable calculus in Math 53.

The decision is yours of course, I just wanted to give you a perspective from a Math 1B repeater. 

Good luck!
Okok, both 54 and 56 are titled linear alg so is there a difference between the two? If not, I’ll prolly go with whichever one Paulin teaching since I heard he’s a  favorite
Oh ok! Will fasho look into it more
thanks for the insightful input! Will take into consideration
read the name of the courses again it does not have the same title
i actually highly recommend CS 61a. although its harder than CS 88, the course does an amazing job of teaching the concepts. Its probably my favorite class and this class will set you up well for future coding related classes.
👍 appreciate the infoo
you might want to study a little during the summer for 61a tho
Welp. I’ve just been told Math 56 already full since phase 1 for continuing students is wayyy before phase 1 for new freshman😵‍💫😵‍💫 will probably have to try and snag it for Spring. Regardless, still thanks for the info
for sure for sure"
"Product Management Community for students (APM roles, internships, etc.) - Product Haven",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16ksjxb/product_management_community_for_students_apm/,2023-09-16 22:37:02,"Hi recently I have been prepping for upcoming APM and pm internship roles for 2024, but found there weren't specific undergrad / new grad communities and resources for PM like SWE so I built [one](https://join.slack.com/t/producthaven/shared_invite/zt-2372k5b9j-zrjkorceeGO41Ywm43BwlA).

There are some incredible resources and tools online (ex: Cracking the PM Interview, Decode and Conquer, Exponent, Lewis Lin's Slack) and even some awesome clubs on campus like Product Space, but there aren't any public communities where students specifically can schedule mocks together, get application updates, and personalized APM support. 

I oftentimes found that most communities (ex: Mind the Product and Lewis Lin's Slack) were filled with later stage PMs who weren't as helpful for specific student roles and timelines. While I would still recommend joining them, I think having a personal student community would be very useful! Even here on reddit, most of the APM posts are out dated and highly fragmented. 

I was honestly inspired by my roommate who has used some incredible SWE discord servers (shoutout cscareers.dev) and wanted to make something similar. If you think this would be helpful I would appreciate if you join and let other people know the link is [here](https://join.slack.com/t/producthaven/shared_invite/zt-2372k5b9j-zrjkorceeGO41Ywm43BwlA)",I hope it’s not too late to join but the invite link is expired
Math 54 midterm 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f2eqko/math_54_midterm_1/,2020-02-11 12:48:13,I have my first 54 midterm for Lin lin tommorow and I’ve been kind of behind because of studying for 61a which was yesterday. any tips or advice on the midterm or studying for 54?,"1. Know your definitions. If I recall, Lin Lin's midterm covers up through section 2.1, and those sections are packed with definitions. Span, linear (in)dependence, linear combinations, etc etc. 

2. Similar to #1, know how all of the concepts *fit together*. Know how linear (in)dependence, span, matrix pivots, existence and uniqueness of solutions to the matrix equation, etc fit together. 

3. Know the computational techniques. Most of them are pretty basic (relative to the rest of the course), but they are important. 

4. Practice those T/F questions because they are challenging. 

5. Do Lin Lin's practice exams. They are *supposedly* very similar to his actual exams.

Source: SLC tutor for Math 54
3blue1brown's linear algebra playlist on youtube is a pretty good way to solidify the fundamentals
Do the assigned hw and understand your mistakes and redo the incorrect problems until you don't get them wrong. If time isn't a problem, take all the practice exams you can and do the same thing with the problems on there. This is just for studying in general. If the exam is tomorrow, you'll have to memorize, although that's a pretty bad strategy for math in general."
Math 91 difficulty?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/x0j8nv/math_91_difficulty/,2022-08-29 01:15:17,"Alternatively how is stat89a?

I’m somewhat familiar with lin algebra but not sure if it’s up to par with Berkeley standards. Was gonna take 54 next semester (alongside d100) but I noticed 91 being offered this semester. Will it be doable with stat134, cogsci131, and datac104 (also in geog3ac which I may drop)?

Hoping to fulfill lin alg req for data sci/data 100","I would recommend 91. 

Source: took h54, 89a, and sat in on the first lecture of 91 out of curiosity.

89a is a fantastic course imho, I really, really dig the course! but I’d recommend it with at least 61a, maybe data8, and some linalg exposure. 89a *touches* things that are also in cs70 and eecs127. The programming part of stat 89a is really awesome, and overlaps with stuff you see in data100 and info159."
Math 110 Prep,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uvk9qp/math_110_prep/,2022-05-22 14:07:50,"Having taken 54 this Spring semester, what would be the best course of action for preparing for upper div lin alg? Any tips would be appreciated.","Depends. I think when I took 110 (it was in Fall 2020 with Jenny Harrison) we mostly focused on category theory, functors, commutative diagrams- all that jazz. I truly didn't understand tensors till I self studied them for research and ML. But I think a regular 110 semester would be slightly advanced 54 + tensors (people below can correct me)
So I would really recommend reading up or understanding tensors and tensor operations. Otherwise, if you understood 54 well enough, you're good!
[deleted]
Does anyone know how Gomez is as a prof?
If you got an A or A+ in Math 54, you are probably ready for this class. The major hurdle is making sure you can do basic set-theory proofs and basic linearity proofs. The class is difficult across every prof, but the exams end up being a cake walk for people with good fundamentals (matrix algebra, understanding the duality between a matrix and a LT on a finite vector space).

If you got B+ or lower in Math 54 you will NEED to address those shortcomings before proceeding. Math 54 is basically 110 lite, and the most important chapter to study from 54 is chapter 4 from Lay.
ready Axler
I had no tensors. Only thing different from 54 was Jordan normal, spectral theorem, IPS. Lense was different though
Sounds like h110
[deleted]
hopefully you know the material in 3b1b playlist after 54 already….
Would like to know this also
Thank you so much! I will do this, skim Axler and make sure to watch his videos
Wow that's interesting cause we had those in math 54 xD. I guess it also depends on what the instructor chooses to cover.
It was!
Yeah I remember she wanted many of us to take 191 after that. I was like no thank you 😅
Haha, very well but it’ll serve as a nice refresher
we did not cover category theory, functors, communicative diagrams, or probably any of what you covered

From the DS website:

Linear Algebra:

We accept linear algebra without differential equations from California community colleges in all cases where the course is included in a Math 54 articulation agreement. Linear algebra courses from non-California community colleges may be considered by individual petition.

So I think you should be fine.  You will want to talk to DS advising anyways just to make sure.

I'll start: 

**[Meredith Fowlie](https://are.berkeley.edu/users/meredith-fowlie)** leads some of the best lectures I've ever attended. She's fantastic at explaining complicated concepts, she's extraordinarily engaging, and she's really open to students asking questions and asking for help. She's also absolutely brilliant, has published some of my favorite papers about environmental economics, and her office hours are incredibly informative and helpful. 

**[Daniel Kammen](https://erg.berkeley.edu/people/kammen-daniel-m/)** is possibly the most knowledgeable person in the energy sector with whom I've ever shared a lecture hall. His Energy and Society course may be my favorite class that I've ever taken, and I still use some of his toolkits as reference points. He's also incredibly humble and approachable, especially considering his insanely impressive career trajectory, and somehow managed to find time after class to talk to anyone who wanted to chat about energy. 

**[Abigail Martin](https://www.abigailnmartin.com/)** has had an incalculable impact on the way I view environmental problems and energy transitions. She's one of the first professors I've ever learned from who approaches environmental economics with such a heavy emphasis on sociological consequences rather than traditional economic impacts, which is super refreshing. Her lectures are super compact, and she manages to pack a ton of information into a short amount of time without being monotonous or boring. I admittedly am only a few weeks into her class, but she's an absolute badass and I love learning from her. 

Who are some of your favorite professors, and what did you love about them and their classes?","Paulin. Best lower-div math professor by far
Seth Lunine in Geography department. He teaches a couple AC courses called Bay Area as well as another class called California. My favorite class he teaches is a Friday class called Urban Field Study where you spend the day exploring various locations throughout the Bay Area such as numerous trips to Oakland and San Francsico. Highly recommend as a final semester course to anyone looking to fill in some final units.
Philip Geissler, quite possibly the best chemistry professor.
[deleted]
Edwin Lin the GOAT 🗣️🗣️
Wodzicki. Never met a professor who cares as much about students’ development as him. What other professor would be willing to spend 6 hours after class talking to the class—math, life advice, stories, etc.

He approaches teaching as mentorship rather than covering textbooks. Don’t understand why people say to avoid him. His class has been the best class I’ve taken at Cal and it’s not even remotely close—it’s the only class where you’ll find things not found in a textbook.

edit: more information to clear up the ridiculous amount of misconceptions surrounding his teaching, he *requests* non-graduate courses for the opportunity to mentor budding mathematicians. Additionally, he constantly reinforces the fact that no one aside for prodigies (and maybe not even them) learn the content in lectures alone. He constantly talks about how he struggled with abstraction as well, about how he would get lost in lectures. This puts to rest the unhealthy misconceptions and misgivings that people have in mathematics about “mathematical talent” since he was reading university texts in middle school and so might be called a “prodigy.” His philosophy is that lectures are for supplementing—teaching to think, providing intuition, and encouraging students (so he handled what content is covered in a very organic manner). The current lecture model where you go through chapters is a remains of the days where books were so expensive that students could not afford them. He’s trying to prepare you to think *deeply and originally* about mathematics, not to learn certain concepts in a black box.

&#x200B;

The man gives everything he has to *teaching* and he expects the same in return.  That is precisely the reason why he gets negative reviews. In this world of polite distance, it may make people uncomfortable. For others, the class alone is worth the cost of admission into Cal.
Not a professor, but Ryan Hass is probably the best math teacher I've had at Berkeley.
Austin Hedemann is one of the best parts of the physics dept here
\+ 1 on Fowlie. Incredible professor and so caring. [Richard Allen](https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/richard-allen) in EPS is also wonderful; great course, and he is an awesome lecturer.
Josh Hug and Zvezda Stankova. One taught me patience, one taught me pain..
Prof Ryan Edwards for Economics!!
Shusterman explains concepts well and is really easy to ask for help. She genuinely cares about her students!
1. [Mathew DeJong](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/dejong). Very nice man. Very good at explaining stuff. Encourages discussion in class. Runs a very nice class with a smooth organization. 

2. [Evan Variano](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/variano). Literally the nicest, most compassionate prof I’ve ever had. He brought jelly beans and his dog to class often. Very nice and funny and prepares you well for the FE exam. 

3. [Adda Athanasopoulos-Zekkos](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/adda_zekkos). Super nice. Loves how she hand graded the homework’s and handed them back. Really nice to see a prof super passionate about the class. 

4. [Tracy Becker](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/tcbecker). Honestly Becker may be my favorite prof at uc Berkeley. Nicest woman ever. Great at explaining stuff. Amazing at literally everything. I loved her class
Ula Taylor. so knowledgeable and passionate about AA studies. AA 116 is one of the best classes i’ve taken throughout college
from a bio student perspective.

Mary Kelsey from Sociology is always the best on my list.

also John Kuriyan (mcb) and Leslea Hlusko (ib) but both are not at cal anymore
JIM CAMBEL. ECONOMICS
Y'all, if you could say something nice to your favorite professors the next time you see them, I bet they'd love to hear it. I work at Berkeley and passed along just a handful of the compliments here with a note that they've made a positive impact.   
Some of the responses from your favorite professors:   
""Wow and thanks. I feel like this person must be talking about someone else. Way too kind. It is incredibly nice to hear this.""   
""Thank you so much! That made my day!""   
""Thank you for sharing this. Indeed, I'm grateful for the affirmation - one never knows if lectures are landing well this early in the semester. So nice to hear.""   
""Why, thank you! It's a great feeling to be noticed for doing good work.""   
""Thank you for sending that to me. I have been fortunate to have many wonderful students.""  


Thank you all for contributing to this positive thread!
Trevor Murphy in the AGRS department. I took his class on Greco-Roman magic and it was clear that he was having just as much fun teaching about magic as we were to learn about it. He teaches in a very classic lecture style.
Ani Adhikari! I had the great fortune of taking Data 8 and Stat 134 with her, and she's just one of the best lecturers in the Stats dept. - let alone in the university.
Darren Zook. Politics of South East Asia. Super nice guy very funny and charismatic. Super interesting class and relatively easy as well.
It’s still early in the semester, but professor Jim Campbell is amazing! I love going to his lectures. He makes the material very approachable. Last semester I really liked Jeremy Sanchez, and Harvey Dong is legend!
John DeNero is the best. Julien Lafortune was pretty great too, as was Ryan S Lundell-Creagh. Oh James Campbell was great too.
James Sethian is by far the best professor I had. I feel like I learned more in that one semester of Math 53 than I did in all my previous math classes combined. Plus, his lectures were incredibly interesting and fun, most of the time I forgot it was an 8 am because I wasn’t falling asleep.
[Jay Keasling](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/keasling) (ChemE/CBE); I was actually in his first class as a prof in 1993 and I thought he was terrible. Turns out, that was probably me and not him.  I ended up having him for ChemE/CBE 162 Control Systems. I never really had a prof explain and teach a complicated subject so well. 

It's now been 30 years later, and even though I mainly work in software, the control theory I learned seems to pop up all the time. For comparison, I also took the general engineering grad level version at Stanford, and the instruction competency was night and day.

And a shout out to [prof Clark's](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/clark) kinetics class (cbe142)
Can’t spell Hawkins without a W
Dr. Christine Palmer American Studies department absolutely brilliant
Professor Fish in Poli Sci, along with Gurowitz. Great, knowledgeable, and approachable.
Rosenzweig. He teaches ugba 192 edible education they were very inspiring and knowledgeable, always invited very interesting and influential guest speakers every week. 

Huntsinger. She teaches espm 186 Grassland Ecology. Shes super nice, very accommodating and presents very valuable information, definitely an expert in her field and the class was very well organized and informative.

So many others, Brashares, Carlson, Chapela, Stephens, Lightfoot
Since this is a sub for the city of Berkeley as well, I’m gonna add Linda MacAllister at Berkeley City College!! She’s been teaching sociology for over 20 years and her academic focus is on death! Cal tried to hire her multiple times but MacAllister rejected them bc she’s for the people. Genuinely, an incredible teacher and academic that I feel so lucky to take classes with. I’m dual enrolled just to keep taking classes from MacAllister bc there is a true love for sociology without all the bullshit of bureaucracy and elitism around it!!
Robin ball! She was the nicest and made a relatively intro class exciting for everyone that was involved. Loved her passion
Edwin Lin and John Kaiser from sociology
Christopher Lowman, Josh Hug, Kurt Spreyer
Prof Whitney was a great CogSci professor. And he’s also an excellent department head. 

Prof Filippenko teaches one of the most interesting classes in the most engaging way. He seems like a super cool person too.

Prof Hinshaw is excellent and an absolute legend. It feels like an honor learning from him.

Prof Steven Piantadosi seems like a really nice guy and his future is bright in research. 

Prof Mikiko Siva is super super nice. One of the easiest classes I took at Cal, but it was fun.

Also RIP Prof Andrew Packard 😔
Karthik Shekhar was an amazing professor in the Chemical Engineering department
JOSH HUG!!
Dylan Sailor from the classics department is probably the best professor I had as an MCB/Data major. He handled the transition to remote classroom gracefully right when the pandemic started. I had him for Classics 34 and he was so good that I took him again for Classics 35. Great storyteller and really draws you into the Greek epics/tragedy. I think he has been teaching ancient Greek language or something recently, but if he’s ever teaching poetry I would HIGHLY recommend — a STEM student who greatly underestimated the possibility of being interested in poetry.
Kent Puckett in the English Dept. Amazing lectures, kind and gracious with student interactions, creates interesting assignments with no busywork, plus he is funny. My favorite class at Cal.
Matthew Walker for psychology of sleep. Super nice dude, incredibly interesting and useful subject presented in an extremely easy to digest manner. Fucking loved every minute of that class.
My guy paul pierson in poli sci. Guy absolutely understands how the country works and can explain it like im 5.
Carol Clover, my undergrad film thesis advisor and easily one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever had the privilege to take classes and learn from.
Timothy Clarke in the philosophy department!
Dr Khalilah Beal Uribe is the best math professor that I’ve ever met! She always make sure that students are engaged in the class and her test is fair. A great teacher whose aim is making students understand math but not making students failing in math.
Hilfinger
Max Auffhamer (environmental econ) - overall such a cool dude, and a great prof
Vivek Subramanian - I took 3 semiconductor device physics courses from him. He was my favorite lecturer. He moved to Switzerland a few years ago.

Also loved Dan Garcia. I almost failed 61C but I learned so much I never cared what grade I got.

Professor Lihua Zhang for Chinese! Amazing professor and so, so passionate about what she's doing — her love of teaching and languages is contagious!
Pauli Li! His enthusiasm and passion!! Switched to Cogsci after taking his class. Sadly, he doesn’t teach anymore. :(
Prof Alex Filipenko!!!!! 

One of the most passionate and engaging professors at Cal. Seriously, you will not regret attending one of his lectures of Astro C10. 

Words cannot express his incredible ability to teach. Made me feel like I could actually DO astrophysics, and do it well. My major is the farthest thing from it (environmental studies). :)

&#x200B;

Tip: Go to Wheeler on halloween. He dresses up as a ""black hole"" and ""emits gamma ray bursts"" (AKA throw candy at the audience). Not to miss!!
Also, Dr. Crystal Chang is a literal icon and we stan. She rocks and I LOVE the way she engages the class in her lectures. Truly and intelligent and excellent professor, extremely approachable and makes time for her students. Loves walking and talking with students after class about lecture content (shout out poltical economy 101 !!)

SRIVASTAVA??? HE GOATED AS WELL
I took California my first semester at cal years ago and it was one of my favorite classes I ever took. Seth is amazing.
I took his Urban Experience class a couple years back. Great professor and a super cool guy in general!!
Rest in peace for real.
i still have videos of him singing is chemistry songs with his guitar in my camera roll. truly the best professor i’ve ever had.
YES I scrolled down to comment about him but it’s so cool to see someone already did. I loved his class.
YESSSSSS delay was amazing in Fall 2020, he hand made all the lectures and was sooo good at explaining them
He truly is!
Taking him for the first time now and he’s great!
Could u recommend a class taught by Wodzicki? For context, I’m taking math 110 and math 113 atm
100% agree! His grading is a little stricter than others but he is also easily one of the best lecturers I've ever had
He is the best! Always so passionate in teaching. I remember he held extra office hours in a cafe in downtown Berkeley before exams. What a dedicated prof!

Edit: this was pre-pandemic
Taking 61B with hug right now but let me say.. i took stankova’s math 10A and i’ve never had an experience quite like that one. definitely one of the ways to inaugurate yourself into berkeley lol
Honestly I really liked taking 53 with Stankova.
I’m with both right now and this is accurate. Soooooo very accurate. Especially for the latter.
I love her!
THE. BEST
So awesome that you did this!! The professors are excellent :,)
love Prof Campbell, he changed my mind about microecon with his 100a class!
DeNero is great. Was super glad I got to take his Data100 course
Aaaaaaaaaanouncements
I agree, and I took his classes over 25 years ago.  I still remember him climbing the chalkboards to connect concepts on different boards.  His classes were so engaging and entertaining.
Fish is a HOT take. He’s super smart but I couldn’t stand his lectures or his personality. Agree on Gurowitz though, I took three classes with her and learned a ton
I saw her at the picket line during the strike multiple times. Based and a great lecturer.
i love both of these profs <3

[deleted]
His classes are some of the best classes I’ve ever taken, and then you find out he designs most of the coursework for physics LDs too behind the scenes — and most of the trouble with those was the professors anyway.
I took Russian Poli Sci and it was great. Since he did his Phd in Russia, super interesting!

Econ 100B Without Any Economics Background,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zoldrj/econ_100b_without_any_economics_background/,2022-12-17 16:42:30,"Next semester I'm planning to take econ 100b with quite literally no economics background (except for high school). Right now I'm enrolled in the class because I think it will be a double whammy with the upper div technical req and my social behavioral req for l&s. I'm now thinking my schedule will be very high workload if I have to catch up with any econ (for reference, I'm also taking cs182, cs161, and DataC104 next sem). Is this death? Should I just take a lower div econ class instead? If it adds to anything I'm familiar with Lin Alg, Calc, and Stats from the upper division classes I've taken so far. Any help is appreciated!","Don’t take 100B with your current schedule
This is absolutely death. Econ 100B is notoriously one of the most difficult Econ classes (Econ 140/141 is the worst). That topped with CS and Data science classes is a kiss of death.
I’m an intended Econ major who has taken a bunch of Econ lower divis classes, and I just finished 100B. The class kicked my ass. It was the most difficult Econ class I’ve taken so far. (I’ve also have taken stats and up to calculus 3). It was a bunch of formulas that had to be memorized and applied to various economic situations. Plus the derivations. Those made me want to cry when I first encountered them. I learned a lot and ended the semester strong, but it seriously made me question my major at first. If you love math and application of formulas, maybe it won’t be as bad, but I would recommend taking at least one lower divis Econ course first.
I did 101b with no prior Econ experience and it was chill
Why would you choose to take an upper division class (and one that is a core requirement for several majors at that) without any prior background? If it's just for breadth and an upper div tech req't, choose something else, especially something that won't have everyone enrolled competing for a high grade to get in to a competitive major....
duly noted. Is there a light econ class I can take, or should I just keep it at the 3 classes I currently have? I want to take an econ class, but yeah admittingly the schedule does look pretty hard.
Econ 140 was pretty chill this semester with Ryan Edwards
if i've only taken ap econ in high school (5's), would you say that taking 100b is doable?
econ 1
Glad to hear! A few semesters ago it was pretty rough. I have a friend who took it last semester and agreed it was really rough, too.
Yah I think it really depends on the prof"
Should I try to take CS 189 Spring Semester freshman year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c53psv/should_i_try_to_take_cs_189_spring_semester/,2024-04-15 18:28:27,"I'm going to be entering Cal this fall as an EECS major. Since CS 189 is important for getting roles in ML labs at Berkeley and a prereq for a lot of other ML classes (CS 182, CS 285, CS 280) that I'd like to take at some point, I'd like to take it as soon as reasonably possible. I've heard it's easier in the Spring Semester, so I'm considering trying to take it either Freshman or Sophomore spring semester. Ideally, I'd like to take it Freshman Spring because I'd want to be able to start doing some research and/or ML internships sophomore year. However, I know this would probably be a pain since most people say CS189 is crazy hard.

If I wanted to do this, what courses should I take fall semester before taking CS189? On Berkeleytime it lists Math 53, Math 54, and CS 70 as the prereqs, but I've also heard that Berkeley doesn't really enforce prereqs too much and that people have taken CS189 without all 3 of these, and that it's more important to know the general concepts (which you can sometimes pick up from other classes). I've considered just doing Math 53, Math 54, and CS 70 my first semester, but that seems like a very weird first semester lineup and I'd guess that it'd be better to do some of the other lower div CS courses like 61A.

For context, I got a 5 on the Calc BC exam (so should be able to skip Math 1AB) and I have experience with ML from HS. I did Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera (I don't think it exists anymore tho cause he just has a ML Specialization there now) and Ng's Deep Learning Specialization (technically I didn't finish the last 1/3 of course 5 because school, but I watched the videos and I feel comfortable with those topics), and I've also done projects/ECs/internships doing ML stuff with TF, Torch, and JAX. My junior year CS course also covered ML, but it was mostly the basics. I don't know how well most of this would translate to CS 189 though (and to be clear, I'm not expecting to do well in the class just because I have some past ML experience, I'm expecting it to be incredibly hard based on what everyone else has said and that it probably uses more advanced math than I currently know). I also have English AP credit (5 on AP Lang) so I'm pretty sure I can just skip R&C A and do R&C B next year (don't need to worry about fitting in R&C A this year, at least I think so). I'm also trying to graduate in 3 years and do a 3+1 master's (mainly to start working earlier, and also to save money cause OOS is murder), which is part of the reason why I'm trynna do CS 189 so early (I want to start doing research early so I'll be set up well to apply for the masters). I could end up just doing the normal 4 years, but I'm planning for 3 years because if I can graduate in 3 years then great, but if it ends up being too much I can just drop a few courses and graduate in 4 years (at least that's how I'm thinking about it). 

Do you think I should work towards taking CS 189 spring 2025, or should I wait to do it later? If you think it would be doable to do CS 189 in spring 2025, what courses would you recommend for my fall semester?

If there's also anything else I'm forgetting to consider (other requirements and what not) please let me know, I've only just started planning everything out so I'm bound it miss something.

PS: I'm pretty jet-lagged rn so sorry if this sounds like it was written by a crazy person who skins live chimpanzees","Yeah do it lol it’ll really help everyone else’s curve /s

Maybe take a CS class at Berkeley before making such plans lmao
I don't think you will be able to enroll CS189 in freshman. There is probably a long waitlist
I think 189 isn’t super important in order to do ML work, if you have done ML projects before u should be able to get a role in some ML lab with some basic networking. I joined a lab first semester just by reaching out to grad students, they are happy to help if you have experience with projects
Yeah it would be a breeze, make sure to take it with 162 and 170
Doesn’t hurt to try, you can always drop if it’s too much, and dropping it Freshman year is chill cause you can always try again
If you're not regents or DSP or at least a junior your odds of enrolling are slim, classes full up really fast especially desirable ones. 

That said if you can enroll sure go for it.
Before the high demand policy it used to work like this:

Summer: 61A + 70, then Fall: 61B + eecs126 + math 54, then Spring: eecs 127 + cs189 + math 110  
Then your sophmore year you can take stat210a/b stat c205a/b cs285, cs182, cs288, cs c281a/b
The course materials are public, so I recommend going through the lecture notes and homeworks over the summer: [189sp23](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s23/) [189sp24](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s24/). If you feel comfortable with the material, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't take it as soon as possible.

You can find any course webpages [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes-eecs.html) (in case you also wanted to look ahead at cs61a or cs70).
I doubt that you can’t even get in as a non senior
How is your linear algebra and probability skills? Honestly just google cs189, click hw2 and see if you can complete it, should be the best indicator if you’re ready for the class or not
You should first learn about how registration works at Berkeley before venturing into this.  

Spring CS 189 with our esteemed and now famous Professor Shewchuk is one of the most in-demand classes on campus, and unless you have priority registration, you won’t get in as a freshman.  Possibly not as a sophomore either.
bros actually cracked af
I’m definitely planning on cold emailing some profs (heard Abbeel and Levine take a lot of undergrads) and grad students.
I don’t know, wouldn’t that be a kind of light semester? I wanna have easy coursework but I still want a little bit of challenge. /s
Would I need to have done the pre reqs to be able to do that? And if I want to get a feel for the class, would you recommend just auditing it fall semester?
How can you take courses over the summer before your freshman year starts? I didn’t know that was a thing
wtf I know someone who had pretty much the exact schedule like this
Lin Alg experience isn’t great, I’d probably need to take a Lin alg class fall semester or do the khan academy lin alg course
Would you recommend just doing it in fall sophomore year then (assuming the fall one is less in demand)?
lmao abbeel wants tons of A+’s in classes
It might have change, but usually you don't need the pre reqs. I think auditing it in the Fall doesn't hurt. Really just depends how much time you have.
freshman edge/summer bridge. should be able to opt in to either of those programs through calcentral
It's just a small circle here at berkeley.
Make sure when you take linear you dont just learn how to do it but also learn the intuition behind it. Suggest u watch 3blue1brown videos before you take linear so when you do take it, it makes more sense.
Only if you’re cracked in probability and linear algebra. And throw in MVC too I suppose.
Thank you, I’ll probably try that then."
Math Course to take after AP Calc BC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uwfop4/math_course_to_take_after_ap_calc_bc/,2022-05-23 18:37:32,Thoughts on taking MATH W54 (lin alg/diff eqns) this summer? How hard is this course and how much time will be spent (hrs/week to get an A) if I have not taking Multivar yet.,"Linear algebra is not related to calculus. So if you’re good at math and picking up new things you could spend like 5-10 hours a week. If you’re bad at math you could spend 40. Difficulty is really based on your math ability and work ethic. 

Math w53 was an absolute breeze for me over the summer and only had a final and weekly hws and quizzes. I would bet summer 54 would be easier than in the semester since you just focus on a single subject
Did you do ww53 with Scanlon last summer? is it alright if I ask you a few questions?"

like I literally had to look up how to get the expected value of normal distribution / continuous random variable, or the density function of normal distribution, or was stuck for a long time bc I didn't even know about erf for eg. I've already taken CS 70, and when I took it at least over one summer, I'm pretty I never dealt with these.

I'm more ok with LinAlg I guess, but still need to brush up on these topics.

I'm taking data 140 rn and it does kinda help with the more probabilities/statistics-related parts, but I'm quite scared that despite meeting the prereqs (EE16AB / CS70 etc) I might not actually be adequately prepared. Should I drop the course, or stay on?","I’m taking it too, and I’m struggling with HW2 but I think that I would have been struggling way way more without Data 140. You might wanna wait until you’re done with Data 140 because if you pay any attention at all, a lot of the probability stuff will start coming to you instinctively - that being said, HW2 is a weeder after all and idk how the rest of the class is going to proceed. Also, I feel like a lot of the ideas in this class are building off what I learned in Data 100 so you could look into that if you decide to hold off on this one. My personal demon in this class is vector calculus lol
Drop
Talk to course staff
I'd say that if you struggled to compute the expected value of random variables, then the course will be very hard moving forward.

HW2 is meant as a weeder in that it should take a lot of time to complete, but you should already know most, if not all, the concepts tested on the homework when you come into the class.
I've already taken data 100...
hmm I think it's moreso the Gaussian random variables specifically that I had trouble with rather than the general expected values of random variable -- would that still be a problem? I'm trying to catch up to to the Gaussian part rn.
Oh that's probably fine then. Just make sure you know the pdf of Gaussian RV and some of its properties.
oh okay, thanks for the insight.

could you also let me know what probabilities concepts this course covers/expects you to know coming in? 

I used to hear that this course focuses more on LinAlg but how important is probability in this course?
The most important probability concepts you should know are conditional probability, conditional expectation, random vectors, and basically everything to do with Gaussians.

Probability is pretty important in this course, and in ML in general."

Sociol 127 w/ Edwin Lin
Sociol 169C w/ Edwin Lin
Spanish 135 w/ Nasser Meerkhan

I’m obviously not planning on taking them all but I wanted to gauge the work load to decide. Thank you!","Preface: I've never taken any of those classes, so take this comment with a grain of salt. 

In my opinion, the best thing that you can do to get ahead is to take the break to relax and destress. Play some video games, read a book, try a psychadelic or two....whatever suits you. 

Trying to ""get ahead"" over the break will just leave you burnt out when the semester starts.
I took 135 with Meerkhan.
Stay on top of the readings with him...don’t slack...review your Spanish grammar over break (especially formal essay writing vocab and grammar) since that affects your grade more than you think...generally it’s a chill class though compared to some other classes I’ve taken
Hey! Recently graduated from Berkeley (Fall 2019). For context, I took SOCIOL 169C (Cross Cultural Communications) for Fall 2019 (A) for three units so I can attest to the character of Professor Lin and the workload of the specific class for a three-unit student. There are a little more assignments for that class if you are taking it for 4 units.

In regards to the workload of 169C, there really isn't much that you're graded on. In fact, I don't think I've batted an eye at the readings until the final paper came around (I only used three sources for that paper and just skimmed them). At the beginning weeks of class, you will do your proposal for a cultural sub group project. The class, in my opinion, is centered around the project for you have two assignments based on that project: a headstart for your final paper aptly named ""Deep Description of Cultural Sub Group"" (4-5 pages, double spaced)and the final paper for the project. (8-10 pages, double spaced).

There is also a cultural self-analysis paper (4-5 pages, double spaced) in the early stages of the class. As long as you start on the papers a week to a week and a half before they're due, you'll be solid. 

Everything else such as participation, a group presentation, and a presentation within a small group during the latter weeks of class is pretty easy to get. Just be sure to engage with your peers and professor and you'll be fine on that front.

Professor Lin is pretty chill. Very talkative but tries his best to get the class engaged with others and with him.

**TL:DR 169C is a pretty easy class provided that you get a headstart on the papers and be engaged with your peers and professors. Lin is a nice guy, you'll find him cool.** 

PS: I suggest you don't get ahead during break because burning out before the beginning of the semester is pretty bad. Don't know about the other classes and the other one that you may potentially take with Lin (SOCIOL 127) but I wish you the best of luck.  


Feel free to PM with questions! Go Bears!

Would stats134, math54, cogsci131, and datasci104 be doable if i have some lin alg exp but not much stats/probability exp (was planning to focus on 134 this sem)? Or should I just stick with my current schedule and take 54 and data 100 together?","I took neither, but I heard math 54 and stats 134 are both difficult.
I mean, it’s definitely doable. Stat 134 is conceptually very unintuitive, in my experience, but if you stay on schedule you should be alright. 54 varies in difficulty depending on professor, but if you have some linear algebra experience it shouldn’t be too challenging.

Our professor emailed yesterday stating that she is still in the dark regarding when she will be able to submit grades, as despite the strike being over, the terms of the return to work agreement have not been communicated to professors, and she doesn't know when readers will return to grade our work. 

She is unable to grade our work and says the university administration has not provided any guidance as to the next steps. 

I'm wondering how many other students out there have not received grades in this very frustrating situation. The University Administration really needs to provide immediate guidance as to when we will receive grades. UNACCEPTABLE!","Math 54 gave part of the students their grades, and we haven’t heard anything about an extension or anything.
I am still waiting for one more
Still waiting on grades for one class.
I'm still waiting for one, zero communication. Strike or no strike, this is inexcusable. We all had to deal with the inconveniences of the strike. Two of my professor's did the grading by themselves just fine, one of them was the Dean of Berkeley Law who had to write a whole new exam out of multiple choice questions, and he was able to do that AND get them graded well within the due date. My other professor read 200 10 page hand written essays by herself in about 3-4 days, but she's a total rock star. The last professor needs to get their act together and submit grades already!
I'm still waiting for a grade for my FILM 20, and it's really making me anxious. I know I did terrible on the final and the midterm. I keep checking my email and calcentral. Every time I do, the more anxious I get
sociol 150 still needs to grade half the assignments left…. laugh out loud
Still waiting on a grade for a class that didn’t have any GSIs
Still waiting on one class but grades for assignments have been slowly trickling in.
I'm still waiting for one satisfactory credit. That was for an internship I completed over the summer lmao.
Ya, I’m a reader and want to finish grading assignments, but there has been no communication from the university about how to go back to work and what getting paid to finish work past our appointment date looks like. The university can’t legally require ASE’s to continue to work past their appointment date, which for most readers, was the 31st of December. The prof I’ve been working for doesn’t know anything about how we can go about grading and finishing things up, and none of our readers know either. It’s super frustrating. We def aren’t holding grades out of spite, we just aren’t willing to work for free and do not expect the university to pay us unless it is very clear, in writing, that we will get paid for working past our contracted date.
Waiting for one class: NST 10 or NUSCTX 10. Weirdest thing is we're only missing midterm 3 and final exam grades even though they were both MCQ scantron exams...
Waiting on ESPM50AC
Still don’t know if I passed a class which is a prereq for nearly all my spring classes. If I passed, great, but if I knew I failed then at least I could drop those classes and get a spot on a waitlist in alternate courses. As it is I’m kind of screwed.

It’s been almost a month since the final with zero communication from the professor. They turned off Edstem because students kept asking about grading timelines (lol).
It’s absurd that we are waiting this long considering how much they charge us for tuition, among other things.
GSIs still enjoying their vacation

Waiting on MCELLBI 136 (physio)… profs sent out an update email on the 1st saying that they were still grading individual assignments :/

(I was also in SOC130AC)
Still waiting on Physics 8B
I'm still missing 1 (have the other 3), but it's because of prof's medical emergency apparently. They gave a Jan 31 goal now for that class.
NUT 10 still not posted 🤦‍♂️ it’s just a scantron
To all in this thread: I am working on an article about students not getting their fall grades back and how it is impacting them. If your professors have yet to post grades for last semester, would anyone be willing to discuss their experience/thought on this issue? Thank you!
Has your Prof communicated when the rest of the students will receive their grade?
Did you guys received 'RD' (Review Pending) for grade on calcentral? Since my class had the same situation
What class and have you received any communication regarding when you will receive your grade or what the process will be?
That course sounds interesting. What about it did you find difficult, if I may ask?
Our final grade has already been posted on calcentral
This all makes total sense! I never believed readers/GSIs were holding grades out of spite, my post is more to address our collective disappointment in how the UC administration has handled this. It appears many academic workers and faculty are confused about next steps because of terrible communication from the administration. I hope they are busy today planning next steps.
Exactly it’s so frustrating, I feel like they are waiting for the GSIs and the gsis are not coming back
Such a bummer! I hope it's resolved soon so you can plan your spring schedule accordingly.
agreed!
This is fine, but UC administration should have come up with more realistic grade deadlines and best practices for how professors can submit grades with no one to grade assignments. I'm appalled at the lack of communication.
I 100% support the strike and blame the UC for corporate greed. I am pleased with the result of the strike. I also blame the UC for extending the grading deadline, and not sending out communication once that deadline was unachievable. $15k per year in tuition and they don't even respect student communication enough to give a realistic deadline and explain when we can expect our grades.
Looks like it's going to be a while! :(
Hi! I got my grades, but just wanted to confirm my professor said she couldn’t offer any letters of recommendation this semester. So that impacts students who may have counted on that.
Lol no that would be too nice
Nope
AMERSTD C171, we received a note that graduating students would receive grades first then the rest would be graded. But this was before finals. We have had no communication since then or since the strike has ended. I did notice someone has been grading on bCourses but a day later those grades were hidden again.
FILM 20 is focusing on Film theory (along w/ other mediums), and I've never really studied film theory before until I took this class. I went to office hours and everything but I was having trouble really understanding and memorizing the theories (because I really don't have the best memory)
whaat no way, sociol 150 with john kaiser?? for fall 2022? i just checked again rn and it’s not up
Agreed, very frustrating.... especially as more time passes and still nothing
This lack of communication is absolutely par for the course for Berkeley
As a grad student, this is so, so valid. For what it’s worth, we’ve had little communication on our end either. No one has asked me to grade anything. I assume the professors did it, but I don’t know for sure.
Yeah, I gathered. It was a huge class. It’s def gonna take some time.
I have Sergonova btw, I think Lin Lin’s students are still waiting too
So you still had GRD on calcentral correct?
Wait, that’s weird because my grade is submitted on calcentral. The funny thing is that I still have many ungraded assignments on canvas. Idk at this point
Thank for your reply! I was wondering what it was like on the GSI side. What department are you in? I' m truly hoping the UC puts out a message tomorrow!
Seconding this as a GSI..

The professor I worked with didn’t grade anything during the strike.. not even the small assignments. They fully expected us to be back to do all the grading..
Yep, I’m in Lin’s class and still waiting
I have EPN, but others have GRD
wtf really? yeah my grades on canvas aren’t updated but i don’t have a final grade on cal central either… are you a graduating in spring 2023 maybe?
I’m in a small bio department (not MCB) so that might change things. I think we only had like 10 GSIs in our department this semester, and I think the professors did most of the grading. 

That said, I doubt they will release a statement of any sort. UC has shown a remarkable lack of leadership or care with the strike thus far, and I don’t think they’ll start taking action now. I’m sorry this is happening to you: your best recourse is to both email the instructor of record to get your grades. I’d also suggest that, even though it probably won’t get you your grade faster, you send a complaint to campus & UC leadership. The more pressure you put on the high ranks, the more it shows the value of grad student labor and it helps us all avoid this in the future.
I just graduated this past winter
Thanks for this advice! I wanted to send a complaint to UC leadership regarding this, but wasn't sure who to send it to. Any suggestions?
ohh congrats!! i think professors were given a list of students to prioritize for the purposes of graduating, fin aid, etc. so thats why you have it already

Incoming freshman math credit,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cri3k9/incoming_freshman_math_credit/,2024-05-13 20:03:50,"Hey everyone,

I finished calc AB in my sophomore year of high school. My high school's system lets you jump from calc ab to multivariable calculus and linear algebra. I finished multivariable calculus and linear algebra. I never actually took the BC exam. I took the AB exam and got a 5. Is it possible for me to not have to take Calc 1B or would I have to go back and take it?","You’d have to take it.  You can look into CBE if you want to.
They go by AP exams to waive your college courses, not what you took at high school. Besides, each college has their own math requirements. To give you another data point, took AP calculus BC exam. Still has to take Calculus 1B per Haas’s requirements.
Depends on your major. If you are in COE then you would have to take 1B even if you took lin alg and mvc already. If you're MCB, they will take it for your math req. Also, just to confirm, the classes were done at a college right?"
EE 16A and EE 16B and/or Math 54 for EECS,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/azwi05/ee_16a_and_ee_16b_andor_math_54_for_eecs/,2019-03-11 10:59:28,Title. Finished Math 54 equivalent at a community college but it's been more than a year since then. Is the Lin Alg in EE 16A and 16B good enough to replace Math 54 for upper div classes that need lin alg (ML and optimization) or should I take Math 54 as well.,"Having chosen 54 over 16a, I would probably recommend doing it the other way around. Mainly because:

A. It’s awkward to have to self study circuits and then jump into 16B.

B. Lower division math at this school isn’t very great. I left math 54 feeling dissatisfied because linear algebra didn’t really seem to piece together for me. Not to mention the diffEqs portion of the course is CRAP.

C. If you want to have a better understand of linear algebra, I would recommend taking 110. 110 goes at a slow pace, but it is very thorough and the concepts will sink in very deep.

So really there is no point in taking 54 as there is a much much better alternative already."

just want to echo this comment.  you should leave it and talk with someone who can see the system from the backend (for example, an adviser in the math dept, yes).  students often try to do this sort of stuff online and find themselves not enrolled in the class at all - weird that it left you in both.  you might find by a day or two from now the system has reconciled and you're only in one.

Sucks, but if you're persistent you'll find something relevant to your interests.

Sorry - I realize the above was a bit harsh. In general you'll be rewarded for persisting through lots of rejections and failures. You lose when you stop trying (although quitting is not necessarily a failure). There are lots of DS case studies and examples around the internet nowadays and honestly you just need to take the relevant classes, learn the relevant technologies, and then shoot your shot for internships/research positions. No clubs required.
Often times clubs will look for applicants who are a better social fit. Sometimes you may also be too qualified/they think you wouldn't benefit.
Hey! I’m a part of Exec at DSS, and I’m really sorry to hear about that. Here’s a message that one of the directors of Acadev had for you (I’m relaying it because he’s not on Reddit)-

Hello OP, my name is Marlon and I'm one of the Directors of Academic Development overseeing General Member recruitment at DSS. I'm really sorry to hear about your experience with applying for DSS :(( Your qualifications are indeed very impressive, but our General Membership program (unlike our Consulting and Social Good teams) is a beginner-level program aimed at educating students without much familiarity in data science (as described on our website and in our infosession).

Please don't feel discouraged! As much as we would have liked to accept everybody, we received a record number of GM applications this semester and simply don't have enough mentors to accommodate more advanced students. We sincerely apologize for any misconceptions we may have caused. On our end, we will make the distinction between General Membership and Committee Membership more clear for future applicants. If you have any questions or concerns, or if there's anything that I or anyone at DSS can help you with, please email us at dss.berkeley@gmail.com
Apply next semester, it was competitive this semester
I feel like it's always competitive. I also got rejected and have been rejected from other consulting clubs. In their email, they always say apply next semester but how will next semester be any different than this semester. There will still be a large number of applicants and the club might even have less spots available than this semester. I applied twice to a consulting club once and got rejected twice. And you'd think you'd have a higher chance but with all the smart people in Cal, it's still the same.

I'm a senior and I was able to get an internship without being in a  club. So tbh, clubs don't really matter. I think applying to Data Science Discovery would be helpful if you are looking to work on a project."
What do you guys think about the change in EECS16A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/19aa0l8/what_do_you_guys_think_about_the_change_in_eecs16a/,2024-01-18 20:01:17,"Professor Babak said that this semester EECS16A is going to be drastically different to past semesters and the course will be more 'mathy' overall. To the people enrolled, what do you think about that?

Do you think this means the course will be harder? Do u think it might be a better choice to drop it this semester and take it next semester just to avoid being part of a transitional section?  (i'm an EECS freshman)","Babak speaks, I listen
More mathy = more bettery.

A lot of courses outside of 16A and 16B that ""require"" them, place great emphasis on understanding the basics of lin alg. 16A and 16B requires a loose understanding of the lin alg, but you can get by with only knowing when to apply formulas and just take the L on the proof questions to still do well.
As someone who finished the 16 series last semester, one of my sort of unmet desires for the series was for it to be more mathy and less up in the air applied nonsense that didn't seem to teach anything tangible. I'm unsure whether this change will actually end up helping with that or not, all of you who are taking it will have to keep us posted, but it'd be nice to see it actually do that.
I would have liked it being more mathematically rigorous. For me, the class felt like trying to build intuition on air (i.e without any foundation). Math is a great platform to ground a subject and inform connections.
More math = better course
In my mind the point of these classes is for circuits and preparing eecs major for upper div hardware stuff but I guess most people including the professors think differently. It doesn't help that 90% of eecs majors are just in it for the cs part anyways. They should just require 54 again or have a systems class as a pre req to a dedicated circuits class imo cause the 16 series has been a dumpster fire even since before it switched from ""ee"" to ""eecs"""

Thoughts on taking 4 techs during Spring 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kzyfs6/thoughts_on_taking_4_techs_during_spring_2021/,2021-01-18 08:51:57,"I’m planning on taking:
- CS 61B
- Data 100
- EEP C118 (Intro Applied Econometrics) 
- Stat 89A (Lin Alg for DS) 

Any tips on managing this type of courseload or if I should even pursue it? 

I really enjoyed Data 8 but struggled quite a bit in CS 61A (I took it over a year ago although). 

I’m totally okay with taking most/all of these classes P/NP. I just don’t know what I’m getting myself into. Would appreciate any tips/comments!","i took 61b, data 100, math 113 + a language class (solid amount of hw between every class meeting) several semesters ago and it was ok. i ended up doing p/np for 61b. i don’t know about the courseloads for your classes specifically but it was doable for me. definitely was busy though
Since you have PNP as an option, it's very doable. Generally, I advise against 4 technicals if you're trying to get all As. I would avoid PNPing 61B since taking it for a grade pushes you to really engage with the projects. I would also avoid PNPing 89A since lin alg is pretty important for DS. 

D100 is also important, but if you were really stretched I'd PNP this. I would PNP 118 100% since it's nonmajor.
update: took data 100, eep c118, stat 89a, math 1b. was brutal. first half grinded. gave up 2nd half. passed all but stat 89a. worth it = yes.
Number 1 tip, don’t do it
the Hug version of 61B and Data 100 are more medium load classes, so you’ll probably be ok.  From what I understand Stat 89A is slightly watered down from Math 54 although it serves a different purpose.
Ok. So. I’m new to cal. My first semester was fall 2020. I took 4 tech classes last fall. E7, E40, data 8, and ce c30. And it was hard. Really hard. So I would recommend not doing this. Enjoy yourself man. No need to put yourself through all that stress. Also be careful about P/np classes. Idk. Just seems risky to do. For l&s p/np all your classes for both fall and spring automatically qualifies you for academic probation.
A little tough but possible if you've done 3-4 techs before
Haha - any number 2 tips? Would you recommend just dropping stat 89a/eep c118? Taking them all P/NP?
Depends what you want to get out of the class. Be careful with the “it’s PNP so it will be easy” logic. It might be worth paying more attention and actually trying to engage with the class deeply than writing it off just because you don’t have to worry about GPA.
Yeah - that’s absolutely fair. My goal is def. to learn as much as possible. I’m a junior that just decided to swap into DS so this semester is to really get me on track to still graduate on time. I’d still be doing 3-4 classes each semester but they’d be much more technical."

Math 113 prereqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k4zeab/math_113_prereqs/,2020-12-01 17:44:48,Is it possible to do well in Math 113 having only taken EECS 16A as far as linear algebra experience goes? I've also taken and done well in CS 70 so I think I'm prepared for proof writing and advanced mathematical thinking in general. Just worried about my lack of lin alg experience.,"If you did well in 16A or at least feel confident with the linear algebra, it should be okay.  Math 113 doesn't actually require linear algebra per se, it just requires you to have the mindset one learns when they take linear algebra.  I think it's best if you're familiar with how to properly define what a vector space and what a linear transformation are, I'm not sure whether 16A does this or just sticks with column vectors and matrices.
Sure, I walked into it with just math 55 and did fine. Proof skills from CS70 are more than enough, since everything is built from first principles.
You need some linear algebra background to understand general/special linear subgroups which is a topic commonly covered in 113 although there's no guarantee of this being covered as the syllabus varies from section to section. Having knowledge of fields is also useful if your section covers rings and ideals
this is true, but it's usually a pretty small topic that you could pick up quickly from being familiar with matrix multiplication and inverses.  i took 110 before 113 so it's tough for me to judge whether certain examples could get confusing."
How important is EE 16A/B to being a CS major?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gigezy/how_important_is_ee_16ab_to_being_a_cs_major/,2020-05-12 10:55:15,"Currently taking 16a but feeling pretty lost right now (mainly in circuits, doing okay in lin alg) and I imagine that I'll be struggling even more when I eventually take 16b.

Is a solid foundation in these two classes necessary for CS upper divs? Because, if so, I'm going to have a lot of self studying to do.","linear algebra is very important to being a CS major. the rest of the stuff in 16ab is not.
It depends on what being ""a CS major"" means to you. 16AB aren't that important for most CS upper divs; the linear algebra and intuition you pick up is definitely valuable, but there is a high probability that nothing else from the courses will show up. If you want to end up in SWE or related roles, don't stress about these classes: they won't matter much.

If you're more interested in things such as math, optimization, robotics, how things ""work,"" connecting software to hardware, etc., then you'd veer into EE and EECS courses, at which point 16AB become more important. For instance, the material in 16AB introduces topics in EE 105 (circuits), 106AB (robotics), 120 (signals), c128 (feedback control), and 127 (optimization). The practice you get in lab helps with design/lab courses like EECS 149 (embedded systems) / EE 192 (mechatronic design lab). CS majors can do a lot more than just SWE (e.g. computer architecture, embedded systems, robotics, computer vision, ML), so 16AB do help somewhat with those other topics.

Circuits are niche and very isolated in the upper divs (i.e. you'll only ever see them in very specific EE/EECS upper divs) so don't worry about them too much.

Personally, I liked 16B a lot more than 16A (IMO there's less handwaving, fewer topics that don't make sense without prior knowledge, you drop the ""learn what's necessary as you go"" mentality, and things are driven by math/theory/engineering rather than very specific applications).
Not important. Also this is a hot take but I personally found 16b better because the circuitry stuff is de-emphasised and it’s more algorithmic math.
As others have mentioned, it depends on what you're interested in. Robotics and ML will use more of the stuff in the 16 series than, say, 170 or 162 will.

You can rest assured, however, that the EE people have figured out how bad 16AB are, and will be reteaching them in upperdivs before moving on to new material.

Thanks!,"not a pure math class, but me c180 (engineering analysis w/ the finite element method) fulfills a quant rec and is an amazing class. if you're interested things like using gaussian quadrature, various algorithms, shape functions, etc to develop and solve mathematical models of engineering problems, you should definitely check it out. it's kind of like c85 + math 54 + crack, and it's probably the most useful class i've taken at berkeley
Hi, this post is a little late lol but I feel like you're in the same position I was a while ago so I thought I'd give my thoughts. I'm a junior studying engineering and applied math so I have some experiences at this crossroad.

If you're focused on the more analytical side of ME I'd recommend:

1) ME 185. This is my favorite class I've taken at Cal. If you're interested at all in fluids and solids (like me), then this will give you a foundation for higher level courses like elasticity, advanced fluids, tensor calculus, etc. It singlehandedly made me change my major and career path. If you liked 106 and C85, this class will amaze you like it did me.

2) ME 175. I'm currently in the class and Professor O'Reilly (who teaches it often) is phenomenal. It's basically ME 104 but souped up with curvilinear coordinates and advanced mechanics techniques. Coupled with 185, you'll be set for any advanced mechanics/dynamics courses at the graduate level.

3) Math 104. If you're interested in graduate school, then taking this class is pretty key. Nothing will transfer one-to-one to mechanical engineering concepts but it gives you the ability to understand concepts as a mathematician does, which is helpful when getting into theoretical aspects of ME. It also if foundational for other upper div math courses like ME 123, 126, 185, etc and shows admissions officers that you can handle mathematical rigor.

4) ME C180/280A. I haven't taken either of these yet, but from what I've heard, they cover aspects of finite element analysis broadly. C180 is moreso focused on use of the program, and industry tools, while 280A gets into the nitty-gritty of FEA and at one point I believe you design your own program.

That's what comes to my head right now. You can pm me if you want more info or want to talk about mathematical engineering concepts - cheers!
Thanks so much!"

1. nothing about the cs declaration process is confirmed right now. It seems scary but I’m extremely optimistic that all people who are qualified will have a chance to make it into cs. There’s no way they apply unfair policies retroactively. Also, even if they do create an unfair policy, data science is genuinely an excellent major. Only reason it gets shit at Berkeley is because it tends to be a backup. At any other school in the nation and in industry, DS is a highly respected and sought-after major. Your life and career in CS does not depend on a major anyway.

2. Berkeley undergraduate CS education is genuinely excellent. There is a reason we are ranked #1 for undergrad CS. We have insane opportunities, and our classes teach skills and concepts at a depth you don’t see many other places. 61a, 70, etc teach us to think very analytically, and that’s extremely important long-term. Look at UCLA cs curriculum, for example. Much of their intro classes revolve around memorizing syntax. The expectations are significantly lower, and I thus think they are getting a relatively worse education (even tho UCLA is still a great program). We may be underfunded right now, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that we are receiving a high quality education.

3. Please stop with the removing eecs 16b as a requirement. For one, it’s not happening. No EECS faculty supports this, and for good reason. I 100% agree that the concepts learned in 16b are foundational to any engineering education. If you combine cs with robotics, machine learning, computer architecture, etc., 16b concepts will pop up everywhere. (Not to mention that Lin alg is super important too) Yeah, it’s a hard class, often poorly run, with a fuck ton of work, and should probably be 5 units, but the content is good and necessary.


Everyone has a right to be angry and critique issues: that’s how we promote necessary and important change. But at some point, we waste energy being angry and worrying. There’s no need to threaten lawsuits or do other impulsive things. EECS faculty tend to be on our side and advocating for us; have a little faith things will work out. And if they don’t, let’s have a measured and coherent (and not impulsive and angry) response. Everyone’s on the same side here; don’t vilify the people trying to help you.","Fair take. Counterpoint: if you're an undergrad, be loud as shit. Annoy the administration. That's the only way your opinion will even begin to matter to anyone.
> Please stop with the removing eecs 16b as a requirement. For one, it’s not happening. No EECS faculty supports this

well, #3 aged interestingly.
Popular opinion everywhere but here
As an English major who had declaring policy changed recently, they will let you declare using previous rules if you were registered before the change.
agree on 1 & 2, but not so much on 3.
r/agedlikemilk
ok 16b course staff
For everyone, consider (Applied) Math or Statistics

They open up very similar career and research trajectories, and use many of the same skills. You will find the homework’s and such are much less demanding as well.

There are a total of 9 undergraduate CS (not EECS) upper divs listed atm for fall 2022, in the school that is #1 in the US (tied with …). Its not inly an issue for people declaring, we just don’t have all the stuff thats been provided for so many years.
Number 3 is gonna be pretty funny in about a week

Edit: wow actually only about an hour
Lmao I happen to major in the backups fields like econ and data science, but because I genuinely like them over CS and Business. It is interesting how Econ and Data Science are considered backups in Berkeley, but they are both ranked #1 in the nation by USNews.
Unpopular opinion: Actually fund departments correctly so that there is no economic bottleneck for computer science that feeds into the economy and helps create wage inflation due to lack of programmers.
1 - Sure nothing is confirmed but the trajectory is set as of right now. It’s fine to be optimistic but as of right now it’s just optimism. There are a lot of people on this subreddit who are in denial of the situation (and say things like “I’m sure there’s no way they’ll go through with it” as if they know the ins and outs of the department). 

Also, just because data science is an option right now and a great major doesn’t mean people shouldn’t be upset that they are being told they might need to switch. No one is talking shit about data science, it’s just people feel rightly cheated they might have to switch out of something they worked hard for.

2 - Being underfunded absolutely takes away from having a quality education. Sure things might be better for those CS majors who are able to remain in the major, but that comes at the cost of those who might get kicked out. Also just because we have it good here doesn’t mean we aren’t allowed to complain or have fears about the program.

3 - This is just not true. EECS faculty do support removing it to cut costs of nothing else. Removing the 16B requirement is a debate that has been going on in the faculty for a while now.

I agree that people should try to chill, but I am very sympathetic to everyone who is concerned. There are lots of very valid reasons to be concerned right now, and I am very sad and frustrated that the course I took to CS (discovering after I came to Berkeley) is likely to be cut for future students.
[deleted]
yeah, it might be working too

in 61a Piazza, Professor Fox's instructor answer told us that this protested policy is considered ""the most extreme"" and faculty are trying to avoid it, but again she reminds us there's still a possibility of it happening
bro WHAT they were actually right?? this sucks for people taking it but future students will be so much better off
Generally this is the case but the plan is for the department to just restrict 70 enrollment and purge anyone who didn't apply as a CS major from the class. This is a de facto way to cut enrollment, not a de jure one like you are talking about.
As a physics major who had a declaring policy change, they applied the change retroactively, making a class I had previously taken not count, and made me take a different class before I could declare.
Tbh I think the course staff would be ok with it: less depressed students and more ppl who actually want to learn the material.
[deleted]
I mean L and S CS does indeed not have EE in it's name, don't think most people care about the EE part of being called EECS. Tbh 16B is just not that well taught or fun, esp the linear algebra, regardless of the material itself.
can i ask if they are cutting enrollment and restricting switching majors, are they making a merit based system for priority enrollment? or not going to allow non COE and L&S ppl into eecs or cs? or just not gonna allow even COE to EECS?
L&S is major blind so putting cs has not impact
as cindy mentioned, a lot of hiring and appointments are still being confirmed -- the number of upper divs is low because we're uniquely low on faculty right now, and will go up as more faculty joins in the coming weeks
Booo that’s lame.
Booooo that’s so annoying! I guess I’m grateful to be a word nerd and not STEM. I’m sorry that happened I would be so mad!
Major in Pure Math here. Aside from the core courses of Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Linear Algebra, and Abstract Algebra, I took Probability (stats), second course in Algebra, Mathematical Logic, and Differential Topology.

In general, less work than other classes but conceptually harder.

How Hard is Math 110?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/he426u/how_hard_is_math_110/,2020-06-22 17:12:48,"I finished taking Physics 89 (phys version of Math 54) with Hedeman this spring and did pretty well; the class had a lot of computation, but the linear algebra half had a good amount of proofs (more than I've seen in other lin. al. intro classes).
I just started taking Math 110 summer and I'm hearing a lot of horror stories and people saying Math 55/CS 70 should have been taken previously.
Any consensus as to whether I'll be fine or should worry?","I took MATH 110 last semester after taking PHYSICS 89 and COMPSCI 70 previous semester.

I can say that COMPSCI 70 helps you draw out clear proofs (such as induction, etc.) which will come very important to MATH 110. 

But I'm sure you should be okay just having the lin alg exposure from PHYSICS 89 and pick up some of the proof techniques as you find places for enforcement as the course goes.
It's the easiest class ever.
Any tips?
Either look at the lecture notes on CS70 regarding various proof techniques or just try to write down proofs on the Linear Algebra Done Right textbook multiple times to get a better feel for these things as they might not have covered those in PHYSICS 89. 

MATH 110 essentially comes down to modified regurgitation of proofs found in the textbook - so if you memorize and learn these techniques by rewriting the proofs until you fully understand the logic behind why these steps are complete can greatly help you get close to full mark on some of the proof questions on the exam!

Good luck!
Awesome, thanks
Specific to the 70 resources, I found that the techniques covered in the first 3-4 of the 70 notes online (up to induction) were what was needed for 110- especially propositional logic and the concept of a contrapositive. Obviously practice during 110 will help cement those concepts, but if you have some spare time before the course starts, read through those online notes!
I've been reading through them and they're very helpful; thanks for the recommendation"
Math course suggestions for cs+physics major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ommfor/math_course_suggestions_for_csphysics_major/,2021-07-18 01:11:29,"Since phase 2 is coming, I wanted to ask for some beautiful/useful math upper divs for a physics + cs double major to take. Since I don't really have anymore formal math prereqs to fulfill, I'm not sure if it's worth taking all the math major upper div reqs. I do plan to take 113 and 104 in the fall and spring, but I think I might skip on 110 and 128a (unless someone convince me otherwise-- I liked math 54 a lot but I see a lot of lin alg in my classes that I'm not sure if 110 is a must-take). I also just want to hear about interesting ones other than the core upper divs.

I would appreciate any course recommendations, thank you in advance!","I definitely think math 110 is worth taking or at the very least, you should take a course that introduces you to more proof-based, formal linear algebra. I would recommend Math 110, but you can also take a more applied upper div linear algebra course like EECS 127. Linear algebra is going to show up in upper div cs and physics courses in some way no matter what area you are interested in. Technically, you will be fine not taking math 110 or EECS 127, but if you take either course (or both), you will be able to learn the upper div cs/physics material at a much deeper level. Depending on your interests, some other math courses that might be worth considering are math 126 (partial differential equations), math 123 (ordinary differential equations), and EE 120/123 or math 118 (Fourier Analysis,  Wavelets, and Signal Processing). Also, definitely take a probability course (EECS 126, stat 140, or stat 134). 

As for math 128A, I think the concepts are very important for anyone interested in applied areas of research (physics, engineering, etc.). That being said, the course was just constant busy work. It was just lots of drawn out calculations over and over and over again. The material was interesting, but the way it’s taught at Berkeley, made me hate it. I’m sure there are some who loved that course, but ughhh I wish I had just self-taught myself the material….since I would probably enjoy the concepts more if I had.
Math 110 is a must-take in my opinion. Abstract linear algebra is one of the most useful things you can learn for both physics and CS. 113 is pretty important for physics and CS, but it isn't necessarily a ""must-take"" depending on what you want to do. If you like cryptography, for example, 113 would be extremely useful. 104 isn't useless as it will improve your general understanding of functions (e.g. what assumptions are you making when you do some derivation), but it is much less important than 110 and 113 in my opinion. I would honestly suggest taking 185 over 104 (it lists 104 as a prereq but it isn't actually necessary), as branches and contour integration are useful in certain physics disciplines. However, like 104 it isn't a necessary class and its uses are more specific than 110 and 113.

If you are ever going to do numerical work (which you probably will), 128A covers very important material. However, the class is slow and tedious, and its not too difficult to learn what you need to know on your own. Also, many important numerical algorithms are part of widely-used coding libraries, so even without 128A knowledge you can easily get by.

For non-core math classes, it is probably better to wait and see which subfields you are most interested in. If you want to get more into relativity, for example, math 140 is the way to go. It is worth noting, however, that once you take enough proof-based math and gained ""mathematical maturity,"" you can stop taking full math classes and instead learn the specific parts you need on your own. You don't have to do this, of course, but often the topics you want to learn are a series of graduate courses away and involve learning a lot of material mathematicians are interested in, but you might not be. Also, your courses in physics and CS will cover some of the math you need as well, and taking more math might end up replacing electives you find more interesting.
As others have said, abstract linear algebra like 110 is a must-have in my opinion. If you feel like you won't get much out of it, you could try H110, which would be quite a ride.

Besides that, I can share some of my own biases w.r.t. being a CS major.  I honestly wouldn't spend time on the core upper divs unless you plan to major in Math since I don't think they are really as interesting as the electives. If you find Logic interesting then I highly recommend Math 136 or Math 125A. I think 136 is a little more bang-for-your-buck since the first half of 125A (Sentential Logic) is kinda boring, but the end gets cool as you talk about the Metamathematics. 136 is all about Computability and if you have time at the end you cover Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem(s) in some detail. As a Math + CompSci major whose always had some interest in Logic and had some exposure to Computability in CS 70, this course was definitely my favorite that I've taken and I cannot wait to see more Recursion Theory. Besides these, if you still like Logic, you can check out Math 135, which is eye-opening for any Math major and is my second favorite course at Cal so far. This would feel like more of the Countability unit in CS 70 and VERY axiomatic (I mean, you are essentially developing a basis for all of math!)

On the more applied side of things, I second the comment about 128A because I see it as useful for any CS major, but not sure it's a class most people ""enjoy."" You can also check out Math 116, which is being taught by the same instructor I had last Fall- this is an S tier class and perfect for CS majors who want to do some pure math/abstract algebra. It was wonderfully prepared and every assignment was super deep. MY EECS friends found this class to be a blast.

I can't comment about the topology courses because I haven't taken any yet (next sem!) but I would bet they are pretty solid. Almost all of my pure math friends in MUSA claim 142 to be a must-take and I hear great reviews about 141/143. 140 seems more like vector calculus from 53, but that's still pretty interesting imo. Sorry for the long reply! Haha
Thank you for such a detailed response! What are your thoughts/experience on topology courses (I think those are the math 140s)? Also omg you're a triple major that is so cool, do you mind me asking how many techs you average per semester haha
It depends on what your interested in. I really liked differential geometry  and I found it to be helpful for my interests. I also took 202A which depending on the professor gives an intro to general topology. I didn’t take algebraic or differential topology though, so can’t help ya there. 

I’m technically triple majoring, but I plan to drop the physics major (and just minor in physics). Next semester is my last semester and I want to prioritize taking courses that align with my interests/goals rather than finish up the physics major. 

I generally take 3 techs a semester. I’ve taken 4 techs once and I managed to survive, but I do not recommend it. I also always take summer courses. I generally take one tech course in the Summer along with some sort of research or internship experience. Generally, I spend all of late May and early June, working through the Summer course…that way I can prioritize interning/research.
If you want to do qft, string theory, or general relativity you will need to know a lot of geometry/topology for certain aspects. It really depends what your interests and goals are"
EECS127 or Math110,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n06yaj/eecs127_or_math110/,2021-04-27 21:33:19,"I'm basically looking to strengthen my understanding of linear algebra before I eventually take 189. For people in 127, what do you think about the prof? Should I take Math 110 instead or is taking 127 more important for 189? Thanks","I would argue it's better to think of 110 as a soft prereq for 127, which is itself a soft prereq for 189. 110 is worth taking if you feel like the 16 series was super confusing.
I think 110 is taught much, much better but I tried taking 189 with 110 only and found it really difficult. El ghaoui is not a good prof imo, but the material in 127 will be taught in a way that is more applicable to 189 from what I've heard - some of the problems on the homeworks are even straight from 127 (at least early hw's)
thx! how did you find 110 in terms of workload and would you say that it somewhat helped for 189? i might take the class regardless since I still feel pretty weak on linear algebra despite taking 16a and 16b. in that case, would you recommend self-studying 127 instead? again, thx for the help!
how is 110 in terms of difficulty/workload compared to CS classes?
Workload was reasonable, not super heavy but definitely not light either. It helped somewhat with the Lin alg but definitely not as much as 127 would have; it focused more on the theoretical aspects which 189 doesn't use as much. 16ab definitely suck for Lin alg so i feel you there, but 127 would probably help enough with that too i think. idk how self study able it is since i haven't taken it so idk about that, sorry :/
Less difficult, about the same workload as a medium workload CS class. Probably on par with cs170 with difficulty (if not a bit easier) and slightly more work than it but it's less conceptually difficult, more grindy work"

If yes, I recommend sticking to 61A and EE16A first semester to understand the rigor of EECS courses here. If you feel comfortable, take 61B and 70 the following semester.
Difficult but doable, depending your background. Try it out and drop if it's too rough.

Ee16a is 2/3 linear algebra and 1/3 circuits. If you've done lin alg before it should be a very easy class, it's not particularly hard even without any lin alg experience. 70 difficulty varies widely by person but I thought it was in the same tier of hardness as 61a."

Missing ee16a midterm from flu,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/au1lgb/missing_ee16a_midterm_from_flu/,2019-02-23 15:32:27,"I emailed the head gsi, and I could replace the grade from the final portion with a doctors note. I'm worried that the final part of lin alg (module 1 and 3) is going to be harder than the midterm. Is the final usually harder than midterm 1? ","Usually the final exam’s portion of module 1,3 seem to be harder. It’s mostly due to the learned materials being integrated together.

A question on the final assumes that you know all the materials for the semester, so you won’t get compartmentalized questions where it’s easy to see what concept/technique they want you to use.

Also, the final doesn’t put too much emphasis on module 1 materials, so if you miss even a couple parts you might end up worse off (since basically you’re being double counted for module 1,3 stuff in the final)

My advice is to take time to go through past finals rigorously! They try to have novel questions, but almost always the problems are some slight variations of past problems!

Sorry to hear about your flu! Remember to take good care of yourself
if you remember the syllabus, your lowest midterm can be replaced with a portion of your final if you qualify for clobbering. You should double check the syllabus
I'd recommend you to just struggle through the midterm. Failing it won't be any worse than not taking it with regards to the clobber if you do poorly. 

The final is usually significantly harder than the midterms, and since they never release averages or distributions or anything, I'm inclined to believe they clobber by raw score instead of by performance relative to the class (which is very unfair honestly). They never tell you anything other than your final letter grade though, so no one knows exactly how they clobber lol. I could be totally wrong. 

Studying while sick definitely sucks, but I'd recommend you try your best. Good luck!

I'm currently taking Math 54 with Lin and did really bad on both the midterms (D average). Should I drop? Wait till final? Any advice?,"Well barring some unusual circumstances I don't think you can drop anymore, we're well past the deadline (although I thought I heard about some new policy that gives you one late drop in your Berkeley career, not sure).  If you don't need this course for your major you can change to pass/fail until Friday. You may still fail, but then it at least won't affect your GPA. 

Someone else can chime in but if you do need this course to count for a letter grade, at this point I think you only have two choices. 

1) Study your ass off for the final which may give you a good enough final score to pull your grade up to a C. Make sure you're doing any homeworks or other credit you can. Talk to the professor about the final and your grade, there may be some leniency to at least help you pass if you do well on the final. Historically, I've had math classes that offered to use the final to clobber one (and in one case *both*) of the midterms. If that's the case, then you can use a good grade on the final to also replace one of your midterm grades, which would help a ton.  You might even wind up with an A. 

2) Give up on Math 54, focus on your other classes, and allow yourself to fail. You can then retake Math 54 next semester and hopefully do better. Both the original failure and the new grade will show on your transcript, but only the new (passing) grade will be factored into your GPA.

OP can drop:

Effective this semester, Fall 2017, L&S has changed their policy for requests to make late changes to student schedules. Students are now allowed to request for late changes (adds/drops/change units in variable courses/grading options) once in their entire career at Berkeley. Studen

1) Students are now allowed to request for late changes (adds/drops/change units in variable courses/grading options) once in their entire career at Berkeley. 

2) Students can request up to 2 changes

Basically, if this is your first request, this will be granted. However, you should plan carefully because since this is only allowed once in your undergrad career, future requests will not be reviewed. (Previous exceptions granted does not affect your possibilities to do late drops this semester, everyone starts fresh.) 
Unironically this. Although you don't have to be so dramatic. I think they have to write the note as long as you say that, like you can have a straight face and be puffin on a cigar when you say it.
Yup that was the thing I was thinking about, I couldn't find it when I went to look though.

I don't think they specified what happens if you drop below the unit minimum after doing a late drop though.  If OP doesn't have enough units, it may wind up affecting their financial aid.  Something to ask an adviser about.
I don't have any financial aid but I would go under the minimum unit count. Does Cal offer some kind of 1 time exception?
I'm not sure. You should probably go ask the advisors since this is a new policy.

Concurrent enrollment at community college during the semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hazhps/concurrent_enrollment_at_community_college_during/,2020-06-17 13:31:17,"Is it possible to take a community college class while still being enrolled full time at Berkeley? I wanted to do Lin alg/diff EQ class at CC to satisfy Math 54 since everything is going to be online anyway during the fall semester. Is this possible or do you have to take everything at Berkeley only?

Thanks!

I'm an incoming freshman in case that affects anything.","You would need to fill out the concurrent enrollment form and have it approved by a college advisor (eg L&S) before you can take the class.  You also need to have a valid reason why you are taking the class elsewhere.  Valid reasons includes time conflict, or the class is not offered at Berkeley during that semester.

If you don’t want to go thru this approval hassle, I would take it this summer or the following summer.  Approval is not needed in the summers."
Math 110 while taking EE16B?

I'm going to take EE16A and 53 this semester and 16B and Math 110 in spring. However it seems like 110 states lin alg as prereq (which 16A + 16B is needed to satisfy). But I am scared that pushing 110 off to next fall and having a semester without a math course is going to weaken my math knowledge. Anyone have any idea or advices on what to do?","Just 16A is probably fine, 110 is a rather self-contained course
Just 16A doesn't really cover all of linear algebra ... you would probably need 16B as well to get a good enough background for the class (unless you feel confident enough to  self-learn whatever parts you would have learned in 16B before the spring semester starts)
110 isn’t helpful at all for 16B. Especially if you use Axler for 110"
Taking CS88 and Data 100 Concurrently,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ekynha/taking_cs88_and_data_100_concurrently/,2020-01-06 11:11:24,"I'm enrolled in both cs88 and data 100 right now, and I was wondering if that's advisable? I've gotten conflicting reports about whether doing cs88 before data 100 is even that helpful. For context, I took data 8 last semester and took lin alg at UCSB (I'm a transfer). Would really appreciate any advice, thank you!","imo 88 isn't that useful especially if you already have some python experience. 100 isn't too programming or linalg heavy and they do a decent job of teaching you important concepts from scratch (at least with hug this sem)
I took data 100 and stat 140 last semester and it was fine if you kept up with lecture. The material is very much a continuation of Data 8 and you learn more about visualization and learning tools such as pandas, scikitearn, and matplotlib, and get some (but not a lot) of the math background to some of the models. The coding in Data 100 is pretty free form so I think if you just make an effort to have enough time to finish your assignments you'll be fine.

 I haven't taken CS 88 but I have taken CS 61A, and I think that while the material somewhat overlaps, it would probably be better to take them both together to just get more Python practice. I have heard that CS 88 is a lot of work however, and again, if you have enough time to do the work I think you'll be fine."

Ways to remind yourself of this through the semester is by finding a supportive community. Find people who you can relate to and see yourself in! 

Good luck with your finals! Try your very best until the end. Sending you lots of love!

Is taking eecs16b before cs70 actually helpful?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k4qoec/is_taking_eecs16b_before_cs70_actually_helpful/,2020-12-01 10:23:27,I have finished 61a and 16a and was considering taking 70/61b next semester. Should I take 16b before 70 or does it not matter?,"There's no need to take 16b before 70 since 70 involves little linear algebra. It is recommended that you have sophomore mathematical maturity before taking the class whatever that means.

Source: myself
Not really. I guess there's is genuinely some benefit from ""mathematical maturity"" in that more exposure to math always helps, but to be honest the classes have two very different modes of math anyway, and the benefit is extremely marginal. Also it's just S A H A I that tells you to take ee16b, probably because he orchestrated the curriculums for ee16ab.

If you wanted to take 70, just take 70.
I am taking 16B and 70 together and there is precisely no reason to take 16B before 70 imo
If you take it with professor Sahai, he expects 16b in general typically discrete math can be taken independently of linear algebra.
Took it before 16a/b or any lin alg class. Got an A. You only need to know matrix multiplication for markov chains which I taught myself in 10 minutes with khan academy. Error correcting codes is a bit hard to grasp intuitively without lin alg but other than that you're G.
You can take 70 without either 16a or 16b. Source: myself
Did you take both yet? 16a professors recommend taking 16b before 70 so I was curious what those who’ve taken both think.
Would a stats class give me some mathematical maturity? I've taken Math 53/54, and will be taking 140 this Spring. But I've not taken 16a or 16B - is it a good idea to take of the the 16ab before 70?
It’s with rao but by expect 16b, do you means there’s stuff you learn in 16b that you use in 70?
I took 16a but not b. So I’m good then?
I took 16a/b after 70 and I honestly think that the professors tend to say this just to make 16a/b feel more important than they are. They are very different classes with almost no overlap.
math 53/54 + 140 will be more than enough mathematical maturity, and you'll be set up quite well for the probability section of 70 too. no need to squeeze 16ab in just to take 70, with your background.
to some extent: I'd argue it more depends  o some minor intuitions in 16a when you take it with Sahai, and with rao, it's taught in a way that doesn't touch on linear algebra
Certainly
great to know; thanks!"
Is math 54 the best move ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/utg87c/is_math_54_the_best_move/,2022-05-19 16:39:44,"Now that the 16b requirement has been removed for l&s cs, does it make more sense to take 54 over 16a? Could anyone provide insight into the difficulty of math 54 and tips on how to do well please!

Also, my schedule for the fall is cs61b, english r1b, econ 1, and math 54(or keep eecs16a). Does this sound crazy or fairly doable?","100% take math 54. 16a does an absolutely awful job of teaching linear algebra, and no other major will accept 16a on its own.

your schedule sounds pretty normal to me.
If you're considering Data Science at all, take M54. If you take EECS 16A, the DS department will make you also take EECS 16B. My friend learned this the hard way :(
I took 54 this last sem and it was difficult but after thinking I failed the final I somehow ended up with an A-. This makes me think that the grading was very lenient because i was throwing up some prayers on that final. But as far as advice goes for how to do well I would say make sure you fully understand all of the material up through the 1st midterm really well. If you are shaky on the basics it will  make things a lot harder later in the course because it build on itself. You could definitely benefit from looking at the content of the course ahead of time. But its honestly not that hard to just finesse the class to do well but thats not rly the goal for us CS majors i guess. So try to go to every lecture and discussion and I'm sure you could learn most of the stuff pretty well. I took 54 with 61a and music 27 this sem and I was able to get away with doing ok while being pretty lazy so Im sure your schedule will be good.
Few things to consider 

1. Who’s teaching?
   Math professors are hit or miss. My favorites who teach 54 are Nikhil S, Ribet, Nadler
2. What is your goal. Do you want to learn rigorous math or the applications?
   54 is much more rigorous, 16A is half taught and will probably hurt in the long run. That being said, 16A at least tries to teach applications.
3. Why are you majoring in CS? Is it for SWE or do you like some other field?


I’d recommend thinking about these questions and then ask an advisor. You can also DM me if you want. It’s tough for us to give the proper advice without hearing your background.
I’m generally not that excited about math but 54 with nadler was a super enjoyable time! Found the class orders of magnitude more fulfilling than 16A, and the class is structured like a well-strung narrative over the course of the semester (by contrast, I think poor structure is generally the largest criticism of the 16-series).
You can take the math 54 equivalent at community college, much better option.
is the 16b thing official yet?
100% math 54
53 and 54, while somewhat challenging (but imo very manageable), were some of the best classes I ever took at cal. They really give you a strong foundation in the math that basically all of engineering and physics are built on. The department specific versions generally seem less good, imo-- I haven't heard great things about 16b, and I also had to take physics 89, which goes deeper into some aspects of linear algebra and has a wider scope, but I don't remember it as giving me as much of a deep insight into the foundations of linear alg.
Math 54 is a great course for learning linear algebra, I doubt EECS 16a.
Does anyone have the solutions manual for this following book?  
MATH 54 Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Second Custom Edition for University of California Berkeley.  
  
Thanks!!
What about 110? Isn't that better since it's pure LinAlg
I remember feeling sort of similar in some parts of 53 and 54 but I think maybe the reality is that a lot of people actually just do fairly badly and the average is concentrated a bit lower than you'd think. The tests are also super hard usually
Any thoughts on Serganova or Lin Lin, they’re teaching it in the fall ?
Can you take major related/required courses (not GEs) like this in a Fall/Winter/Spring term? Or does it have to be taken in Summers only?
54 can teach lin alg pretty well depending on the prof. If they're planning on going heavy into lin alg in the future imo it'd be better to stick with berkeley
I wouldn’t take 110 it’s way more theoretical than anything you’ll see in a CS class and you usually just gloss over important results and algorithms you need in CS in favor of nice theoretical results (ie svd, which is a super important result in computational linalg, is barely covered but almost a fourth of the class is on jordan normal form which is basically useless).
Would the cs department accept 110 instead of 54 to fulfill the requirement?
Yeah, I think 110 is a solid class, and if you think you know what you’re doing mathematically it’s not a bad idea to start with it. It’s definitely harder than 54 though.
[deleted]
That's actually really insightful, thank you for that. However, isn't half of 54 in differential equations? Arguably I won't really have a use for that either, right? Does 127 or 189 use differential equations? Does 54 go into vector calculus and stuff?
I have 54 Articulation from CC but my professor for LinAlg did NO teaching at all so I'm definitely weak on that aspect. I want to take 127 and eventually 189 (maybe even in the same semester) and right now all I have is literally 16A. So that's why I'm deciding between 110 and 54. Do you feel like either one of them is easier?
Isn't half of 54 in differential equations Would that be useful for like 127 or 189? Does 54 go into vector calculus and stuff?
Actually, you no longer need to inform Cal about this starting in Fall of 2022. No requirement like not being on academic probation necessary anymore. Just submit grade.
No from what I remember it was a single chapter that was basically just pattern matching and eigenspace stugf
no clue. I haven’t done either. I’m taking 54 in the fall tho and I heard both professors are average.

No grad school will because there will always be the bunch that got letter grades regardless of anything g on a transcript we’ll stick out
Grad schools are pretty holistic anyway. I'd say one semester probably won't make a huge difference in the long run, especially this one. As long as you don't monumentally fuck up, they'll probably let it pass.

YouTube bro
From my experience, its more beneficial to get back into the grind mentality once you're back more than trying to re-learn material in the Army. Just make sure you have all the fun b4 u come back so u dont feel like wasting your time when you're back .
What classes are you taking next? I’d say depending on your next year you might have different prep. But I really recommend 

-Coursera has a CS course by Princeton, with Robert Sedgewick. It’s 61b’s daddy. This is the easy, sure fire way to review. It has some cs70 type stuff if you read the book (hmu for pdf if you aren’t savvy about downloading the textbook for free)

The course is free and superb. I Have some other ideas in mind, lmk if you wanna talk it over. Best wishes!
Check out the previous course websites for the classes you’re planning on taking. Look at some notes, hw sets, discussion solutions, and exams. It can be overwhelming bc of the amount of unfamiliar material, but it helps focus your prep on the right stuff. If you’re taking 16b or another lin alg heavy class then 3blue1brown’s lin alg series on YouTube is great.
I did some programming here and there during my off-hours (I've been slowly automating my workflow here). I'm more worried about the math / theoretical CS topics. Any suggestions on that front?
Could also be somewhere like Finland
South Korea
Did you also have some time off due to service? I was wondering how common this is.
Well it depends what you want to take in your upper divs. If you want to take math-driven classes like 170 or 189, it’d be in your best interest to review 16A/B’s linear algebra material and all of 70.
fwiw ik someone who was from one of the above 3 and they are back now and are super insane as the top scorer in all exams for all of their classes. Don't lose hope OP, it's your education, and you can do it!

**189 (Shewchuck):**

pros:

1) interesting material

2) good homework assignments for the most part - well-thought out, reinforced concepts well, coding parts were pretty interesting.

3) reasonable exams and grading (applies to all semesters I think, not just this one)

4) Shewchuck's notes comprehensively cover everything he touches in lecture as far as I could tell; I pretty much exclusively used the notes and did well.

5) shewchuck is a very blunt and transparent guy (first professor I've ever seen who straight up told the class the bin for an A+ lmao). I personally liked it a lot. he also has a great sense of humor.

cons:

1) the readers are fucking awful at setting grading rubrics. I've been a reader before, and holy shit the readers for this class sucked. every. single. homework. had rubric items (requirements for explanation, graphs, random arbitrary shit) you couldn't possibly infer from the assignment unless you read all the piazza follow-ups. It got to the point that halfway through the semester, I started adding graphs and work questions didn't ask for to make sure I didn't lose phantom points.


2) I wish we went more in depth with some of the math, but I understand why that's not possible unless you assume 126/127. I get where sahai is coming from though, you'd be able to learn ML in a lot more depth with a solid understanding of optimization and probability under your belt.

3) some of the discussions toward the end seemed to cover incredibly difficult, obscure problems that seemed very out-of-scope for the class.

**overall: 8.7/10**

**stat 135 (Lucas)**

pros:

 - lucas is a nice guy 

 - you'll probably learn something about statistics 

 - some of the homework problems were reasonably interesting 

cons:

 - lucas's lectures could put insomniacs to sleep 

 - the textbook for this course is one of the worst I've ever seen, tons of dense mathematical jargon with nowhere near enough explanation 

 - I thought there was very little intuition behind what we were learning, felt like ap stats 2.0 to me. Nothing in the course (homeworks, exams, quizzes) really pushed you to understand the concepts beyond a surface level. 

 - Ties with the previous one, but not enough practice problems unless you dig through the textbook on your own. even a suggested list of book problems would've been nice. 

 - The material itself was easy, but the grading was not very nice. For one, the class was curved even slower than typical stats upper divs with a 2.59 average. Also, 60% of your grade essentially depended on the final, because the MT was so much harder than the final that almost everyone clobbered the midterm (even if you were average on the final and significantly above on the MT). 

Honestly despite the awful curve idt this class was particularly hard grade-wise (a lot of stats students are very bad at math compared to CS classes ime), but I wouldn't recommend anyone take this class. I got very little out of the class and it basically ended my plans of double majoring.

**overall: 3/10**

**127 (Ranade)**

pros:

 - ranade is probably my favorite lecturer at Cal so far. she basically spends lecture doing math with you instead of lecturing. it really, really clicks for me. (if you've had sahai, I think he has a very similar style.) I haven't really interacted with her personally much but she seems like a nice and understanding person too. 

 - material was interesting. I had very limited lin alg experience going in so this was basically the class where a lot of linear algebra clicked for me. the second half on optimization and duality was also nice. 

 - very reasonable workload, even before covid. 

 - excellent course staff - general administration, quality of assignments, communication, etc. are all top-notch. 

cons:

 - I wish she'd share grade distributions or statistics lol. that's about it. 

 - If you came in with a lot more lin alg experience than me, I think you might find the class a bit slow. 

 - Minor nitpicking, but I wish we had some harder / more out-of-the-box problems in the second half of the class. There were a couple but I think more practice would've been nice. 

**overall: 9.7/10**, one of my favorite classes at cal","I like your style lmao also rip 135 guess im not taking that class
Agree with 127 review!!! Ranade is best girl, followed by Raluca
lmfao thank god 135 ended your stat career and you didnt get in deep like i did
Some add-ons I thought might be useful:

Shewchuk's lectures are basically him just reading off the notes - if you read the notes and understand them, you really don't need to watch lectures to do well on exams.

Sometimes the homework can be orthogonal to lecture - in HW6, we had to implement an RNN, something that was never covered in lecture or discussion, and I spent a majority of my time on that HW trying to figure that part out.
Can confirm Ranade was a very good instructor, her OH was super helpful too.
What linear algebra experience did you have coming into 127? I finished the 16 series and plan on taking 127 next semester
Would you recommend EECS 127 for a data science major who wants to go into ML/AI (already taken/planning to take Data 100, 144)? Or would EECS 127 be redundant here? Thank you so much for the reviews they are so helpful!
Do you know of a way to avoid STAT 135? I'm considering double majoring in Statistics, and is there an alternative, like stat 134 vs 140, or stat 133 vs. data 100 + stat 33b?
[deleted]
Yeah 135 is usually a fat loss (jesus the curve) but from my experience, if you have a really good TA that you can grill for questions and talk to Lucas in OH you can still get a lot out of it. I did both of the above and thought that it wasn't such a bad class in the end, although I skipped the lectures and spent a lot of time reading both the textbook and other online stat resources.
Song is teaching it fa2020 so that might be different, idk though.
take it with song it can be a great class. he's amazing and truly puts great effort into teaching.
just ee16a. 16ab is more than fine.
i'm not sure what 144 covers, but yes, 100% would recommend 127. Optimization is essentially the language of ML.
there's no alternative. that said, I've heard amazing things about song (who's teaching this fall), so I'd try to take it this upcoming semester (if you've already taken a probability course).
I took them concurrently. I don't really think there was a substantial difference in difficulty (tbh the difficulty of both of them is a bit overhyped, I'd say they were around the same level as 70/170), but 189 is definitely more work. 127 provides a lot of insight / mathematical explanation into 189, I think it's a good combo to take together.
have you heard anything about stat/data102? I've heard better things about that class and that its similar to 135.
I'd expect song's version to be a lot better, I've heard good things about him in cs70.
This is good to hear because I'm taking Stat 135 with him next semester!!!

Do you know anything about the grading scheme/difficulty of exams?
Do you think Math 54 is enough?
Is it reserved for EECS Majors heavily? Like would it be near impossible to get into it as a guy in L&S?
rip I'm an incoming freshman - I'll need to take 140 before 135, I think. But maybe I'll be lucky next Fall if he teaches it!
I've never taken it but I think it touches more on the applied/modern areas of statistics (stuff more similar to 189/182 material) as well as a bit of causal inference (which is pretty interesting imo), while 135 is very focused on the classical methods of hypothesis testing (if you've taken AP stats, you learn how all of those chi squared /z/t tests are justified) and more theoretical concepts, namely the properties of estimators and the basics of OLS regression.
have you heard anything about stat/data102? I've heard better things about that class and that its similar to 135.
i love song
he had much more difficult exams and even homeworks, but i believe he follows the usual stat undergrad grading curve (check berkeleytime if you have a chance). the difficulty is offset by the clarity of his lectures and his willingness to help those who want to learn in OH/after lecture. OP complained about material being AP stats 2.0, which it could easily be, but song derived almost everything and i liked that
yes
I'm not super sure how priority works but it's an easy class to get into. Everyone who wanted to got in this semester.

I'm in l&s actually and could phase 1 it. I know for EE classes neither EECS nor CS get enrollment priority (no need, they never fill up) but idk if EECS classes work the same way.
should probably mention that compared to data 100 (and probably 144?) 127 is a very theory-heavy class. You won't find it useful if you don't want to dive into theory at all.
>Save

lol i never took ap stats so i have no idea what chi squared or anything u just said is. Do you think its worth taking stat135 then to learn classical statistics? Or just fuck classical stats and never learn it in favor of more modern stuff
don't know anything about that class
So - for someone who wants to go to grad school in data science (then the indsutry), would EECS 127 be recommended?
You could probably get away with not learning classical stats if you're primarily interested in CS/SWE but if you ever happen to interview for a DS position, knowledge of classical stats especially w.r.t. power analyses, sampling, AB testing, and OLS regression do come up very often.
not an expert, but almost certainly yes. any good ds grad school program will probably be pretty theory-heavy.
hmm, if I’m tryna do an ML engineering or research internship do u think it’s relevant for that?
Makes sense then. Thank you so much for all the answers!!"
cs 61a + math 54 in prefrosh summer,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nfza6o/cs_61a_math_54_in_prefrosh_summer/,2021-05-19 00:35:13,"is 2 summer courses a bad idea? 

I have programming experience and some familiarity with the math 54 material","Not a good idea.  61A is going to be a load.  Even if you took AP CS A and/or programming background, that might only help you the first week of summer, maybe 1.5 weeks.  After that it gets crazy for everyone and you spend a lot of time figuring out stuff.
math 54 is so stinky. if ur CS youll take 16a + 16b anyway (you can totally take 16a summer + 61a IMO if ur smart)
I see you want to double in CS and math- I'm a rising senior and that's what I'm doing. My freshman fall I did 61A + 54 and two breadths and found it doable. However, I didnt know what it would be like as a freshman and at the time it wasn't that ""easy"" to me (in retrospect, this is a super light semester, but most people like having a good work-life balance.)

I would say take one course over the summer if you really want to, and I'd say do 61A. Note that 61A is acc pretty hard but it's doable if you have prior experience at the level of AP compsci. As others say, 54 is kinda bad and since you have to do 16B I recommend doing 16A instead of 54. You will relearn all of the ""good"" linear algebra in Math 110 anyways (which you may want to look into this fall.) Welcome to Cal, go bears!
but I was considering math double major
i did not take math 54 btw
can 16a/b replace 54 towards a math major?
take 16ab. neither are good classes but 16b is required whether you take 54 or not, and it will be much harder with only 54 experience since you’ll be missing a lot of the circuits knowledge from 16a. 

plus, while 16ab only teach scuffed lin alg, from my experience they were still enough to go straight to math 110 (upper division lin alg) without needing 54
then invest time in math 53! 16ab gives credit for 54
Yes if you are CS or EECS.

 https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/major/declaring
would science Olympiad circuit lab help? It covered stuff like mesh/nodal analysis, op amps, diodes, Norton/thevein equivalent, transistors, digital logic such as Karnaugh maps etc
but doesn’t 16a/b still miss diffy eq
[deleted]
ah if you have that level of experience you’d probably be fine. if i were you i’d go through some of the 16ab materials online and if the circuit stuff seems reasonable to you, go ahead and skip 16a
meh there's a good bit of it. i speak only for getting major credits
who hurt u lmfao. All I basically said was I don’t mind catching up on circuits"
Can a Transfer Student still take CC Classes after Admission?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/125a68t/can_a_transfer_student_still_take_cc_classes/,2023-03-28 19:15:14,"I am a fall '22 transfer student and have completed 61AB/CS70 with a 3.4. But missing Math 54 because I am blind. I took a Diff Q portion already at my CC before I transferred to Cal and looking at assist if I take the Linear Algebra portion at my CC it'll be equal to Math 54. This seems like a cheaper option than full on taking Math 54 in the summer or Fall '23, does anyone know if that's allowed? I came with 70 units when I transferred. Basically can I still take CC classes to get rid of lower div requirements or am I screwed and have to do the long route and take Math 54 anyway.","The only constraint (for COE at least, not sure about other colleges) is you can't take CC and Cal classes at the same time. Most people at Cal will take CC classes in the summer
I would ask your advisor to get a definitive answer.

But judging prior instances with transferring credits, you likely can take the other class sequence during the summer. What's likely to happen as a transfer student is that you won't receive units for the class but only subject credit, as in you'll clear the class but is worth 0 units.
concurrent enrollment is allowed but you will have to consult with your advisor to confirm.   not sure what college you are in but here’s the policy at L&S for your reference. 

[L&S Concurrent Enrollment Policy](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/concurrent-enrollment)

Also recommend you schedule an appointment for academic counseling at the [Transfer Student Center](https://transfers.berkeley.edu/appointments) for helpful advice & guidance.
You should take it community college at any cost this summer.
If you are enrolled at UCB, you can't take any classes without permission at CC during fall and spring semesters without permission (which you probably won't get if the same class exists at UCB). 

If you have withdrawn, you have to get permission to take classes at CC in order to transfer the credit.
Honestly I’d take 54 over the summer (it’s pretty imp for ml classes). Otherwise just take it over the summer at your local cc. You can still do that. Even concurrent enrollment is allowed I believe.
can u lmk what cc this is? i also need to take lin alg this summer
There is one more constraint, which is that there is a limit to how many credit units you can transfer. When I was there, it was 60 or 75 for double majors. Also, be sure they actually transfer. There is a whole website with equivalencies, but I remember some were wrong and UCB was full of exceptions, so be sure to check with major's counselor before wasting your time.
Actually for L&S college, you no longer need approval to take CC courses during fall or spring. The website may not have updated yet, but I’ve talked to the department, plus I work with those policies"

So I'm going to be a rising senior in high school this summer and I was planning on taking Math W53 (multivariable) online during summer sessions. I recently saw that they also added Math W54 (Lin. Alg + DE) to the online catalog and was contemplating enrolling in it as well, as I won't have another chance after this summer to take Berkeley classes as a high schooler. 

Has anyone taken W53 and W54 at the same time? During summer or otherwise? Do y'all think it's doable to get an A in both if those are my only two summer courses?

For some context, I took ECON 1 last summer and got an A. Not sure what the relative difficulty between ECON 1 and MATH W53/W54 is though.

Any advice is appreciated :)","Math 53 and Math 54 are probably way more difficulty than Econ 1, so I suggest doing one class of these classes during summer only. Technical classes during summer have incredibly fast pace. Many current Berkeley students can’t handle the pace of a technical during summer while getting a high grade, so I don’t recommend taking both if you want A’s in both.
Both of these classes are incredibly harder than Econ 1 lol so definitely don’t take both"

127, not necessary for the 189 class but it doesn’t hurt. Probably overkill for 189 as it goes into much greater detail for optimizations than in 189.
EECS 127 maybe.
I think 127 helps more than 126, at least for Spring 189
This is true, I did well and I only had CS70 probability. However, without 127 and the instincts/intuition it delivers, I would've been really screwed"

anthro 2ac, nutrisci 10, music 29 are basically free A/A+es.

Freshman needing help about course selection,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bxalta/freshman_needing_help_about_course_selection/,2019-06-05 18:16:21,"Hello everyone,

I'm a freshman planning to double major in CS + Stats (I finished GE's and stuff at community college so it isn't a huge time commitment to add stats as a double major)

Due to my transfer credit from community college, I basically have to take all technicals my first sem. 

I'm debating between:

Data 8, CS 61A, CS 70 + random 1 unit seminar

or

Data 8, CS 61A, EE 16A + random 1 unit seminar

I've taken multivariable calc/diffeq+lin alg at community college as well. I know that most people say that CS 70 is a hard class, but if I do EE 16A and end up not declaring, then it would seem to me as a wasted class. At least CS 70 is a prereq for the CS major. Any thoughts???","The first one seems reasonable. If you already have linear algebra credit, that can be used to satisfy the 16A requirement, I'd talk to a CS advisor about that.
Both schedules would be doable. Have you taken linear algebra and Differential Equations (Math 54 equiv.)? If so, you can waive the EE 16A requirement, but you will still need to take EE 16B. I recommend taking Data 8, CS 61A, and 70 since then you can declare earlier which can help with CS course enrollment for future semesters. Technically, Data 8, CS 61A, and 70 would be harder than Data 8, CS 61A, and EE 16A, but not by that much. If you self study CS 70 during the Summer that could really help with the workload. I know of others who took 70 with one of the 61 series courses (61ABC) and they all did fine. Just use any tutoring resources that they have for the CS courses especially CS 70 and if you feel like it is too much work during the first few weeks drop one of the courses and add another class.
I really don't feel that my community college went over linear algebra well enough (we didn't even get to eigenvalues), so that's why I am planning to take EE 16A sometime. But its good to know that my first schedule seems reasonable!
16B + 47D
Yea I've taken the Math 54 equivalent but my linear algebra prof glossed over huge parts of the curriculum, meaning that I really want to take EE 16A to fill in the gaps. Thanks for the advice! I think I'm going to go with CS 70.
16A is really bad on eigenstuff, it doesn't go into depth at all and a lot of people feel like they don't really learn it having come out of the course. I think if you've got most stuff done but just want to fill in some gaps, take the transfer credit and audit whatever classes will help you fill those gaps. You can also supplement that with internet resources. The nice thing about linear algebra is it's very standardized and there's not much magic to it, so use anywhere you can learn the content and you'll be fine.
CS majors can use Math 54 to waive EE 16A. EECS majors can take Math 54, but then they will need to take EECS 47D to cover the circuits part of EE 16A. So CS majors who have taken Math 54 or the equiv. only need to take EE 16B

How hard is math 110 compared to ee16b or other cs lower divs,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9nhw17/how_hard_is_math_110_compared_to_ee16b_or_other/,2018-10-11 23:27:31,"So I'm a CS freshman and I'm pretty set on taking 61b and 70 next semester.  I also want to try adding either ee16b or math 110 and dropping it if it becomes too much. 

I thought math 110 would be much harder because it's an upper div class with a stricter curve, especially since my only experience with linear algebra is ee16a. But I've heard mixed opinions, with several people saying it's easier and at the very least less time-consuming than ee16b. I also did well on the lin alg component of 16a. 

Which of these would you guys recommend, if any, as a third tech? ","Math 110 is very different from lower division courses as it's your first venture into a proof based mathematics course.

In terms of upper division math classes, it's one of the easier ones. I don't know how familiar you are with proofs so that'll be a big factor
Unless you feel at least a little comfortable with abstract math and have proved something before, I would not take 110 until you've taken 70 (and know how to write a proof).  110 is totally proof based and very abstract.  It's the type of thing I suggest you try out and drop if you don't love the first bit.  
Keep in mind that Holtz, the 110 professor for next semester, is one of the more notoriously tough math professors.  I love her to death but she can be a little disorganized and she expects a lot from you.  Hard exams, very hard homeworks.  110 with her will almost definitely be significantly more difficult than 16b, but it will also be a great experience if you enjoy the theory and come in with the idea of growing your problem solving skills trememdously.  If your incentive is ""which class is easiest for me to get an A,"" then 110 with Holtz is really not something I'd recommend.
You should consider searching the EECS 101 Piazza for what the community has suggested in the past.
Why not take 54?
110 is very abstract. You need to be able to write proofs
Ignoring difficulties of particular instructors, there are two main deciding factors that make math 110 easy or hard for someone: Comfort with proofs and abstract math, and amount of linear algebra intuition. ee16a scratches the surface for these these things, but is not even close to being sufficient. I would recommend taking 110 only after you have finished cs 70 and ee 16b. Math 54 is a waste of time which only makes sense if you learn nothing after taking ee16b"
Linear Algebra at CC credits will transfer over?

Is it worth to try to also take Diff eq over summer so I can skip Math 54? Does taking only linear algebra help anything because the schedule of my class right now has a little interference with some of my other activities? How important is Math 54 for an EECS major.

Thank you for your help. ","[deleted]
As others said CS and EECS majors shouldn't take Math 54 since linear algebra in EE16A + EE16B is a superset of linear algebra in Math 54. You can take Math 110 or CS 189 if you wanna learn more linear algebra.
[deleted]
Hahah lol thanks dude!
Actually, this is not true. assist.org lists Math 54 as a major required course for CCC transfers; meaning if you don't take it *you'll be flagged for instant rejection.* It will save you time as well, as Berkeley does allow people who have taken 54 + a circuits course to skip out of EE16A (albeit unofficially).

op, if it says ONLY your linear algebra class transfers over to 54 specifically, you're fine. Otherwise, it would not articulate in the first place.

Differential equations is covered in EE 16B, so don't worry about that.
thank you for clarifying!
Well, it depends on assist, which is poorly maintained. 

For example, West Valley College has a C++ course that fully articulates with 61B - even without teaching any 61B concepts. It's not even a data structures course.

If the assist course says linear algebra is all that's needed to waive 54, then you don't need to take diff eq. 

Specifically for EECS though, linear algebra + circuits (any course in CC) can unofficially waive you out of EE 16A.
ok, thank you so much for sharing!

Is this the right move or death? should I replace it with some other class?","This is generally an awful idea. Unless you know yourself and know you’re insanely good at learning things, you really should get all the precursor classes to 140 done before you try it. 

140 is hard enough already no need to do challenge mode. On the other hand 100 is generally not that and as far as techs are concerned, so you can feel free to replace 140 with just a not super duper hard class and be fine
140 is TOUGH, for real. I took 140 last Fall with Data8, AP Stats, CS 61A, and Math 54 in my mind, but it still almost ruined my work-life balance. The pace is so fast and some of the content is complicated and obscure that you really need to spend a huge bunch of time outside the class to catch up. If you would like a more gentle DS-focused Stats class alongside Data 100, try Data C88S (the former Stat 88)
I finished CS70 and got a pretty good grade in it before Data 140 and I took Data 140 as my only tech in the semester. It was still very difficult and was probably the hardest class I’ve taken at Cal other than CS162. I’d recommend not taking data 140 without more rigorous math and stats experience or it may be a struggle to do much more than barely pass the course with a lot of effort. I don’t mean to scare you just giving my personal experience.

I took data 100 a few years back and it really wasn’t bad. Heard rumors it’s gotten harder so might want to ask about that one first.
personally i think this is ok. Data 100 isnt nothing but its a consistent predictable workload. Data 140 is tough as others have said. just dont throw in another time consuming tech and i think youre ok.
I have all the precursors (lin alg, calc, data 8), I am only missing data 100 which is not a hard prereq. And data 100 and data 140 are my only tech classes."

At this point we might as well find the best IM basketball players in the RSF and field them instead.
Letting normal students play really drives home how far Cal Sports is going with this ""The Bench"" branding.
trust the process
If we have to sacrifice a few Cal basketball seasons to get a Big Game victory, so be it. 
Longest streak of quality losses? 
I'm just wondering when they are gonna let that one Asian dude on the team play
How did we go from having Jalen Brown and going undefeated at home for an entire season to this?
Please just hire Jason Kidd as hc.  His name alone will land better recruits.  It’s a talent problem for the most part.
Why is the program so bad this year? You’d think Cal would have a sick squad. Hell, it absolutely should. 

Think about it... it’s cool to play basketball in the Bay Area. The best team on the PLANET (aka the warriors) play around the corner. Silicon Valley and tech money is everywhere, Cali is beautiful with good weather, and UC Berkeley just so happens to be the greatest public school in all the land.

And we are on a 12 game LOSING streak? Wtf is that!?
F
Maybe twenty years ago there would have been a protest by the student body over Jones remaining as coach.
Doing it the CalTech way!
Down to spend my week in the RSF scouting top IM talent if that’s what it takes
I've been saying that for the past year. If you took out Sueing from the Cal side, the best of IM's and RSF pickup games would give them a serious run for their money. 
I feel as though ""The Bench"" sounds so demoralizing. Like we have a student group that are all bonafide bench warmers cheering? Doesn't really elicit confidence from my perspective
might as well keep tanking so we can get a high lottery pick during the draft
He’s the next Jeremy Lin
Our coach is ass, my guy
And if all else fails, he can throw drinks on the court and make a scene. It won’t help us win, but it’ll be entertaining.
Man UCLA gets to be in tight with the Lakers (players come over to play in their practice facilities/gym, meet the college players etc) and we get none of that smh. But then again we don't have Lonzo Ball/Westbrook etc type players either (not since Jason Kidd at least) lmao
Because our head coach is terrible and constantly shits on his athletes. Some have even left the team over how terribly he's run the team. And the athletic director, rather than hire a decent coach, just paid the second in line and told him to take over. Can't believe Cuonzo was bad, this guy really takes the damn cake. I don't regret not buying a student pass to games
tfw coulda played scholarship money basketball for caltech (while drowning academically lmao)
You guys are idiots. I played with a Cal baseball player once at the RSF and he just absolutely ran circles around everyone else on the court. Any Cal basketball player would be 10x better. 

Now if you take a random fan and put him in the coach’s chair...
UCLA is located close to where many superstars have summer homes.. plus UCLA spends a ton of money on their sports/facilities including the brand new $35 million Mo Ostin Basketball Center. 

Meanwhile here at Cal people lose their shit when we rent hotel rooms for players.

do i ever take math 53,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bb0no2/do_i_ever_take_math_53/,2019-04-08 16:20:54,"im gonna be a freshman in l&s (intended cs) and was wondering if i would ever need to take math 53 (multi var calc). it isn't a lower div req for cs, but isnt it kinda important? i can clear the 1A/1B with AP credits. should i go straight to 54, or would 53 be good to have for future courses or smth?","Multi variable calc has some application is deep learning so that might be something to consider. You don't need to take it before linear algebra or discrete math at all tho.
you dont need to take it, but its highly reccomended if you want to focus your degree in machine learning (i.e you have an interest in doing well in classes like CS189, EECS 126, EECS 127, etc etc.). If you want to be a software engineer, it might not be worth your time/effort. Keep in mind that Math 53 doesnt have anything to do with linear algebra or discrete mathematics, so it doesn't matter if you take it before or after classes like CS70 and EE16A/Math 54/CS70. 

Also, don't take Math 54. The recommended linear algebra track for CS/EECS majors, according to EECS faculty, is EE16A + EE16B. EE16B is required for the major anyways so you're doing yourself a disservice by taking 54 instead of 16A.
The stuff on multiple integrals can be helpful for probability and optimization/gradients is useful in machine learning.

Most of the things in the latter half are irrelevant to CS(line integrals, green's theorem, stokes' theorem, vector calculus in general...) and in my opinion not at all interesting.

If you plan to stay completely on the software side, you can probably avoid 53. If you go into more theoretical/math-based CS, you should probably take it at some point.
I would argue that it's better taking both if you can. As someone who skipped EE16A with 54 and went straight to EE16B, I am keeping up with the lin alg/diff eq parts of the course a lot easier than someone of my peers who just had 16A lin alg experience. However, it took some time getting used to the quirks of the course (long psets, labs, sahai, etc.) that my 16A peers was just fine with right away. So yeah take both if you can. (PS: If you decide to skip 16A, make sure you self-study the circuits material well! You're expected to pretty much have everything down when you walk into the class, because well they expect everyone to have taken 16A)

I want it to be asynchronous. Does anyone know of a CC that has linear algebra asynchronous this fall semester? WVC has it but there is a waitlist rn.","[online classes that articulate to Math 54 for Fall](https://search.cvc.edu/search?filter%5Bdisplay_home_school%5D=false&filter%5Bsearch_all_universities%5D=false&filter%5Buniversity_id%5D=17&filter%5Bsearch_type%5D=course&filter%5Bquery%5D=course-258498&commit=Find+Classes)

As the other poster posted, to articulate to Math 54, most CCs split out the classes into Differential Equations and Linear Algebra.  What’s in the link are classes that fully articulate with just the one class, ir it has both Diff Equations and Lin Alg.
Laney College has one open that is asynchronous. The course code is 41518. Search it on https://sa.peralta.edu/psc/PCCDCPRD/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/SSR_STUDENT_FL.SSR_CLSRCH_MAIN_FL.GBL

But it only teaches linear algebra, not differential equations like Berkeley’s MATH 54. So if you wanted it to transfer to Berkeley as MATH 54, you would need to take another class in addition to it

Sociology Majors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/or5hrk/sociology_majors/,2021-07-24 22:09:37,"Hey guys, I am a new transfer student (F22) and I am a sociology major. Just wanted to know if anyone had any advice on what are good classes to take, preferred professors or good opportunities on campus? I'm opening this to anyone too, not just sociology majors! Any tips for transferring to Berkeley would be great I'm moving to an apartment that is a10 min walk to campus next week!","Try and take your theory classes junior year; it’ll open you up for more opportunities in your senior year. I’m also a soc transfer student and was told not to take them junior year, and now my senior year is going to be really rigorous because I’m doing the honors program and theory classes at the same time. Honestly I haven’t heard of a bad soc prof here, they are all amazing so far. Take classes that will feed into your interests!! I really loved soc of Ed, political sociology, and social psyc (from the soc department). Soc of religion in the summer is also a really great class that isn’t difficult at all!
Sociology major here :) I took two really fun soc classes last semester -- soc 167 with prof. Lin and soc 111 AC with prof. Kelsey. Both great classes and professors. Definitely would recommend!
Thanks for the advice the taking theory my junior year has been a huge debate and I do want to do the honors program. Just curious did you do part one of your theory your second half of junior year and are finishing it your first half of senior year or doing it all your senior year? Also I am taking social psyc (from the soc department) in fall and I have heard so many great things!
I'm an exchange student coming to Berkeley this year and thinking of taking Sociology of Psychology this semester (with John Kaiser). I'm taking a few heavy classes so I'm wondering if I will manage the workload of social psyc? I heard that Kaiser is a really great professor and that his exams are doable, so I'm hoping for the best! If you have any insights on the class I would be really glad!
Thank you! I am actually taking soc 167 with professor Lin this summer and I love it:) I will defiantly keep a look out for soc 111 AC with professor Kelsey!
I’m taking all of my theory classes senior year :( but yea if you wanna do the honors program definitely go for theory in your first year!!!!!! I was told “don’t do soc5 and theory together” and it was total BS. If you already have a good grasp on research methods soc5 is a cakewalk (as long as you get a decent GSI), so just do it!!! When I went to the honors meeting they were like “oh you should have already done your theory classes but I guess some students have made it though doing honors and theory at the same time” but they were also the ones who said “oh don’t take theory junior year” bitches🤣🤣if you want to talk about it more dm me!!

16A Course,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3y8sms/16a_course/,2015-12-25 18:40:49,"How much is the courseload for ee 16A compared to something like 61a/61c/70? Would it be fine to take with 186 and 160? 

Thank You","I felt that 16a was definitely more time consuming than 61a, but some of this is due to the fact I had no lin alg experience prior to taking this course. The homeworks for the class were the time sinks for me, but I did them super thoroughly. I would routinely spend 5 or more hours working through the homework with my buddies for 16a compared with breezing through cs hw in 30 minutes. The difference is that for EE, the tests are a step below the difficulty of hw, but for CS, the exams were about the same if not harder than the homework.



I just took it along with 186 and 16a was extremely easy, material-wise.  This is coming from having taken Math 54,110.  The only difficult thing really is the weekly homeworks--think kind of like 70 level so I'd say around/easier than 70.

186 is really manageable as you basically just need to do a few simple projects and have an approximate knowledge of the overall concepts.  However, the exams are rather tricky and easy to mess up on--like 61c at least for me. But shouldn't take a lot of time.

160 really depends on your group and those three courses combined seem very doable.
Much less, and yes. 
This will necessarily depend on what you already know. Have you taken Lin alg (e.g. Math 54) or circuits (e.g. Physics 7B) before? If you answered yes to both of those, you'll find 85% of the 16A content very easy, mostly review or extension of known concepts. The class is roughly 30-40% circuits and 60-70% Lin alg, so if you've only taken one of those listed courses, adjust accordingly. 

As someone who took 16a as a sophomore and therefore already knew what Berkeley level studying/understanding looked like, I found the exams to be really easy. 

The course takes up quite a bit of class time - 3 hours of lecture, 2 hours of discussion, 3 hours of lab every week. 

The big time sink is the homeworks. However, I found them to almost all be considerably shorter than the cs70 (vazirani) homeworks. There is homework every week, it will on average take 3-8 hours to complete to a point I would call satisfactory. 

Tldr it will take up a good amount of your time but is not too bad. I found 61c to be far more trying than 16a, although part of that was likely that 16a distributed the workload better. 

Disclaimer: I took 16a with Sahai. However, iirc Elad Alon is reprising his role as 16a professor. His 16a, from what I've heard, was far more difficult, but that could also be because he taught the course the first time it was offered, as a pilot course to ~50 students. So he may be easier now. "
Is this schedule manageable?

You might just feel tired though on Tuesdays having an 8am and the last class being at 5pm (that's just me though). 

I will say, SOCIOL 167 is by far my fav class I've taken at Cal with Professor Edwin Lin! An incredible professor and I'm sure you'll enjoy his class, if you decide to attend the lectures LOL

Already feeling so lost in EE 16A.. literally day one —a sob story and need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/aixqmv/already_feeling_so_lost_in_ee_16a_literally_day/,2019-01-23 00:42:42,"Today in class, the professor threw up some matrix problem dealing with projections and given density values and told us to solve it in 20 seconds. I probably wouldn’t even be able to figure it out in 30 minutes. 

Moreover, I had a lab on Monday, but because there was a holiday, the lab was cancelled and I had to do it by myself. But I tried for hours and hours, to no avail —only completing like 2 of the problems. Am I the only one like this? Are labs usually this hard or is it because I’m doing it by myself without TA assistance? Are office hours actually helpful or super crowded? 

Any tips or advice, please? I’m terrified. ","Don’t worry! This is the first day of class, it’s normal to feel a little lost. EE16A if I remember correctly doesn’t teach linear algebra particularly well (I was super confused about all the matrix things as well when I was taking it) but study up on the side and you’ll be fine! I think the math 54 textbook is pretty useful for reviewing basic Lin alg.

As for labs... those labs are a pain in the ass. They took my lab partner and I forever. Don’t worry if you’re getting stuck, most people do. Office hours can get crowded but I was always able to get the help that I needed, so imo if you’re feeling very concerned they’re worth going to!
I feel you man!!! I stopped at Calc 2 and have no Lin Alg / Calc 3 background and the motto this semester is “let Kahn take the wheel” I was kinda overwhelmed but I’m SO EXCITED FOR 16A and 61A so every challenge fr me is an area to grow. Keep pushing and we’ll get thru together. PM me if u wanna chat more - always be down to meet more people. 
don’t worry about the matrix problem. I barely had time to write down the problem and I don’t think you’re expected to solve it in like 20 seconds (most people around me didn’t get it)
[deleted]
I took it last semester and did pretty good, if you ever need help let me know.
self study lin alg. the class notes are pretty good but the math 54 textbook is even better. 16a is bad at teaching lin alg so dw if you’re having trouble. I would be lost in upper div eecs courses if not for the rigor of math 54.
Well ee16a didn't teach projections until the very end of the class (and even then, I don't think everyone understood them v well), so the prof was probably giving a ""jump intro"" or something.

Also, if you're talking about the optional lab that teaches you how to use NumPy, good god that shit was annoying. I sped through most of the labs in 1.5hrs but I wasn't gonna spend hours looking up NumPy syntax. You pick it up over the course of the class anyways.

Honestly, don't worry about it. The first lab is kinda scary (and from what you're saying, the first lecture this sem was as well), but ee16a generally does a lot of handholding.
Honestly, this is expected if you don’t have a programming and linear algebra background, so don’t fret because 16A is supposed to be teaching those topics. I already had these two, so I understood the numpy library before hand and how the matrix was referring to solving a linear system of equations.
For the labs, did you and your partner manage to finish within the 3-hr time frame? 
Yeah, I hope. I transferred to the new Thursday lab, so hopefully I’ll be able to finish the lab during the actual lab with TA’s. I’m going to the homework party too. 
Yeah, that would be awesome! I’ll reach out. Thank you so much. 
Thank god. So you got by without doing the optional lab? 
Not the person you responded to but when I took it, my partner and I regularly went over the 3 hour mark, especially as the semester went on. For us, it was fine because there was another 16A lab right after us so... hopefully something similar happens with you?
[deleted]
Easily. Idk anyone who did all of it. 
I have the last time slot of the day D:
Th 5-8 PM; Class #28551
eh, we were usually the last pair and I think the longest we stayed overtime was 10 or so minutes? I'm not the brightest EE16A student so you have a high chance of doing better than me lol. TAs and Lab Assistants are honestly really nice so don't be afraid to ask questions :)

What courses would people recommend I take before jumping into CS70? (I don’t have discreet math experience or competition experience) I’m also quite worried about the proofs because I made mistakes during Math 1B — I completely glossed over the proofs because I never really understood them, and feel that it will come back to bite me later.

I took CS70 as an intended L&S CS Major after being on failing track for Math 1B and getting a F on the EE16A final.  


Got a B+ in the class and declared.  


It's quite a bit different than other math courses and you don't need to have mastery of the material of other courses as much as a propensity to the material of this particular course in itself. I would review notes as much as you possibly can, because it is certainly possible to do well here regardless of your experience in other math courses (based on personal experience).
[deleted]
I think if you grind out the psets every week thoroughly and ask appropriate questions in OH and Piazza, you don’t need a tremendous amount of background.  But each student is different.  My kid for example had AP Calc BC in HS, had 16A and took 16B at the same time as 70 and did reasonably well.
Since it starts from scratch, would you say that if I stayed on track with everything in the class (staying on top of hw/notes/lecture/review problems), then I would be all set?

I was just afraid of jumping into a class where we were expected to be familiar with material from previous classes/semesters
Thank you! I’ve heard a lot about this course being unique from the other math classes in that it stands alone (material wise) and you have to start from scratch, basically
I was originally planning on taking EE16A concurrently with CS70, and since math 54 and EE16A are similar do you think that taking 70 would make 16A easier too?
I'm in 70 right now and I don't think it'll help with 16a, but you're also probably not going to have Lin alg if sahai isn't teaching"

Is csm the only option if you want to tutor for 70?","My understanding of the subject (which may or may not be a few years out of date) is that each class has two fixed budgets: one for TA hours, as well as another for other academic staff. The 61s can use the latter for tutors, since they don't need readers, but 70, being a very written-pset-heavy class with a high grading workload, doesn't have that luxury, and therefore doesn't typically employ paid tutors.

You may be able to ask the instructor to be an (unpaid) academic intern, which would allow you serve a tutoring role in return for units. This would be entirely at the discretion of the instructor, but they'll probably be happy to have you aboard.
Yes.  There are no tutor positions for 70, but hopefully you can join through CSM or work in another position for 70!"

It is a nice way to give back to the school and stay connected with Cal (they send out newsletters and stuff).  To me the nicest 'benefit' is the library access that comes with it.

Also, don't want to be 'that guy' that begs for donations, but if you have the means (and aren't burdened with a bunch of loans) you should consider donating to Cal (you can specify which department the money goes to).  Cal can use all the money it can get with the budget cuts that are going on.
I joined as a life member, for the continued access to UC libraries and just because I wanted a continuing connection to Cal.  I'm happy I did.  

Other than the library access, however, membership is not ""useful"".
Not useful in the networking sense. Your real, actual friends are good for that. Some people are mentioning access to libraries and stuff, which is nice.
Also, this is **IMPORTANT** for all alumni: CAA and Cal need your help, regardless of whether you are a card-carrying CAA member or not.

CAA relies on alumni volunteers to help with scholarship essay readings and interviews. You do not need to pay into CAA to do this. You just need to donate a few hours of your time.

Also, you do not need to pay into CAA to be added to Alumni group mailing lists. I belong to a few lists in So Cal. They send invitations for mixers, happy hours, dining events, football game parties, volunteer opportunities and loads of those things. It's a great way to network.

My Mom just bought me a lifetime membership for my graduation present and she just about flipped out when I mentioned there was insurance available if you enrolled in a certain period after graduation, even if you have pre-existing conditions.  As a freelancing theatre artist with lupus and epilepsy, she just about flipped.  If Obamacare gets repealed, I will probably be buying individual insurance through CAA.
I joined cuz I had some extra cash, I would say it's not worth it. The discount doesn't really matter since shops around Berkeley sell merch for much much cheaper, and the magazine is meh.

Did it, but mostly for insurance stuff and networking. I found out later that networking doesn't really require membership fees :/. 
maybe i'm just confused, but what do you guys mean by library access.........can't you just go into the library with your id card?
I joined CAA in order to start a regional Alumni Chapter in my hometown. Problem is, the process for starting a new club is not easy and demands a lot of time and resources I don't have. I'll do it when I get a few helping hands on board, but for the time being, I don't have any assistance. CAA has been very understanding of my plight, and are willing to assist me.

If you know of any Central Valley Cal alumni who want to network, let them know we are looking for them and folks like them.
Lifetime member here. I like using the library privileges and the magazines and updates I get from campus are great.  I live in LA now and miss Cal a lot.
I would join if I wasn't saddled with debt, and if the board of regents didn't vote to raise their own pay while cutting more important things.
Do you get online journal access with the library access?
If you love books, and expect to be living within reach of a UC, you should absolutely join.

For me, lifetime alumni association membership has paid for itself many times over. If you're a reader, and enjoy technical, academic, obscure, international, or out-of-print books/journals, UC library access is one of the best gifts you can give youself.

A one-year UC Berkeley library card costs $100—you get that for free with your $60 annual alumni association membership. Will UC library access save you from having to shell out to buy three $20 books over the course of a year? Voila, it just paid for itself.

But the big savings kick in with a lifetime membership. Pay $500, and get UC library access for life. I've used UC libraries at least ten times a year since I graduated from Cal a decade ago, and I expect I'll keep doing so till I die.
As over_the_line says, the best benefit has been the library access.
Alumni can't check out books (unless you join the alumni club), I think.
If you aren't currently enrolled you need an actual library card (which costs money).  The card lets you check stuff out, get into Moffitt, and request stuff from the UC's regional libraries.
As far as I know only currently enrolled students and faculty have online journal access.

However, I have requested some journal articles from [NRLF](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/NRLF/).  If they have the article they will email you a pdf copy in a few days.  [OskiCat](http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/) will tell you if they have the articles you want at NRLF.
[deleted]
So technically, you can have access to all the journal articles. It's just that you have to request them and have the pdf emailed to you...? How many can you request at a time?
Yup. ""If you love books, and expect to be living within reach of a UC, you should absolutely join.""
There might be some cases when the NRLF doesn't have the article (hasn't happened to me, but I guess it could if it's an obscure journal).

I'm not sure if there is a limit.  I have requested 3 articles on the same day without any issues. (each request is for one article, but I don't think anything is stopping you from placing multiple requests)"
[Critique] CS70 is made artificially harder. Here's how it can improve:,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ura55a/critique_cs70_is_made_artificially_harder_heres/,2022-05-16 17:26:47,"# Introduction
### Motivations

I wrote this constructive critique to motivate CS70 and other similarly dense and not beginner friendly material courses to follow suit in the suggestions I give. CS70 staff likely know who I am and if you would like to have a more in-depth discussion, please feel free to reach out :)

### Establishing Credibility/Reputability

To preface: I have (and when I say this, I’m not exaggerating) studied on average ~10hrs every single day of this entire semester. From 1/18 till 5/12, I have spent approximately 900 hours on CS70 alone, which doesn’t include office hours or discussions or CSM sections. I go to 4 discussions per week (2 different TAs) and I always stay late to ask questions. Additionally, I attend 2 CSM sections per week, I go to OH every day, I have a tutor, post on Piazza and Discord anytime I’m confused, and I spend my entire day from start to finish in the library studying JUST 70. Think I’m overexaggerating or lying? My hours are tracked, 70 also has a log of all my OH tickets, and my discussion TAs, and OH staff can back this as well.

&nbsp;

**Why do I feel like I’m qualified to critique the course?** I have significant prior experience privately tutoring students before and have had substantial involvement in the sequencing, design, and structuring of 3 different courses as well as development of course material at my high school (internationally recognized for one of the courses). And as previously mentioned, I have followed and done everything as recommended by the course staff, Rao/Sahai, and others on how to study/”survive” in cs70.

---

#1) Overall

Let me be very clear, this course is not equitable. In fact, this is emblematic of a much larger issue: none of the lower-divs (mainly 61A & CS70) are. In 61A alone, prior experience is the single most significant predictor of success; according to Pamela, only 15% of NPE students get a B+ or higher. In CS70, this gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim; students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college whether it’s USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or multivariable/linear algebra at a local college have a MASSIVE advantage. It’s a compounding advantage because those with prior exposure need to spend less time to understand the material (the so-called “mathematical maturity”). More precisely, their per unit of time spent has a faster rate of change (their score) versus NPE students. Lower-income students also oftentimes have to work to support themselves while in school, so the only gap-closer (spending more time on the material) is now no longer an available option. I say this as a first-gen student coming from a low-income background where the highest level of math taught at my high school is Elementary Calculus. Not everyone had the ability to take rigorous math nor was put through it. Specifically, my school only offered Integrated Math I, II, III, then “AP” Calc. 

&nbsp;

The course is WAY TOO FAST-PACED yet expects students to be able to reproduce every proof from a note that we read the day before. The goal of the class commonly said by Rao, Sahai, and CS70 TAs is to “encourage learning” or to “just learn the material and you will do fine.” This fails to acknowledge that the barrier to entry is way higher compared to 61A or 61B; **CS70 artificially inflates the difficulty of the course by intentionally creating a scarcity of resources** (or not investing time into developing resources), which I would argue is contradictory to this commonly spouted goal of “encouraging learning."" “This is hard material” is not a sufficient excuse for poor presentation and teaching of material (both in the notes and in lecture). Furthermore, from my experience interacting with course staff in OH every single day and other mediums, it’s also clear that the hiring practices significantly prioritize grades over teaching capacity. I along with many others intentionally try to avoid certain course staff in OH because we consistently run into the same one-dimensional math comp explanations. Yes, the material is hard, but you do not have to make it any harder than it already is.

#2) Lectures

My main point is this: the lecture should be intended as an introductory aid i.e a conceptual overview of all the main important pieces of the topic (ex: show FLT proof but not derangement, leave that for the note). This flows perfectly since notes should be used to deepen the understanding and discussion is used for application of the theory.

&nbsp;

An overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless (supported by student survey data as well) and it’s motivated by a variety of factors. I will mainly address the slides i.e the presentation of material in lecture in this section. 

&nbsp;

According to Professor Sen, lecture slides are said to never be changed or modified in any way no matter the professor (rules by the dept apparently?). I strongly disagree and so does the educational research. Lectures should include more visual aid and more colors instead of just black, blue, red. Colors help viewers stay focused instead of getting lost in a wall of all black text. Colors and graphic images help a ton with conceptual understanding and distinguishing what’s important and what to focus on. This could be something like putting a colored box around the theorem statement to make it easy to distinguish what the overarching statement is and then the proof in a different colored box can be formatted like a step by step tutorial (literally put step 1, step 2, and what we’re doing in each step) where every little detail is pointed out. This could be something as small as writing an arrow saying that this part of the expression is to account for the cookies, and this * 2 is for symmetry since bla bla. Most importantly, stop skipping on things you consider trivial- these are things that get students stuck from minutes to hours. Common instances of this are jumping 3 steps in a proof or implicitly making a simplification that YOU consider trivial. 

&nbsp;

Sometimes, slides legitimately just don’t cut it and that’s why you have the lecturer there. They should be there to guide you through their thought process and how they approach it instead of brainlessly clicking through slides. Literally write out your steps instead of rambling out loud what the steps are- literally write it out- write out where we are, then the next step, and then the next and explain while doing it. This provides a visual aid to focus on and the exact thing to associate with the explanation coming out of the lecturer’s mouth. Again, I can not stress this enough: visually walk the viewer through the proof instead of telling it to them and then having a bunch of slides spam clicked. The reason students come to lecture is to pick up what the slides alone cannot convey and it’s the rationale for each step, the thought process, the conceptual intuitive meaning. 

&nbsp;

#3) Notes

The notes are massive time sinks that are unnecessarily convoluted and overly complex for no reasons. The argument that this is how math is presented and that other courses later on will be way worse are bad cop-outs for putting in actual work into synthesizing and boiling down material into layman terms that people (undergrads) can actually understand. 

&nbsp;

The notes are literally pages and pages full of walls of black text. Add some freaking colors, box the theorem in blue, highlight the equation in red, or even something as simple as putting a visual of probability space A and B and their overlap and coloring it, or coloring the cycle of a graph. 

&nbsp;

Intentionally designing things by selectively excluding clear explanations or step-by-steps doesn’t help stimulate learning, it just confuses and angers students; for example, a visual step-by-step on how to build hypercubes and assign their bit strings instead of saying it in a one-liner in a gigantic wall of text. Why conceal information about how to deal with E[min(X, Y)] instead of explaining that you could convert it to P(X > t, Y > t)? Students don’t have unlimited time and it’s clear that our time isn’t respected; you can not reasonably expect a student to spend 30 hours on this course alone. 

&nbsp;

These are intentional choices made to artificially make the course more difficult and arduous than it needs to be. For students who don’t have time to spare this has a disproportionately worse effect (this group tends to be lower income folks, minority groups, less privileged). 

&nbsp;

The example of assigning bit strings on a hypercube is just one example (off the top of my head) of a concept that students routinely get confused on. If students ROUTINELY ask questions and have trouble with X topic or Y question every single semester, shouldn’t it warrant looking into? It clearly means that the explanation is not good enough. There’s a difference between trying to induce confusion to stimulate growth and a clear lack of a proper explanation. 

&nbsp;

#4) Exams / Walkthroughs / Recordings

To be blunt: make better solutions or make exam walkthrough videos. Potential suggestion is to have a TA make videos doing a conceptual overview of topics like Sahai did for the Sp2014 semester (can be viewed on YouTube). These short 10-15 mins videos made by Sahai and other course staff are phenomenal material that provide additional resources for students to access beyond just the notes and slides. 

&nbsp;

Exam solutions should be written like Alec Li’s Fall 2020 Final rewritten solutions. Every single step should be broken down (stop skipping steps, stop saying X is trivial, blabla) in laymen terms and how to conceptually think about it and the different ways you could approach it. 

&nbsp;

I’ve previously spoken with Tarang about past exam walkthroughs. CS70 used to do this in the past but stopped for some reason. His reasoning was that “we want to encourage learning,” but that is contradictory. 

&nbsp;

If your whole goal is to encourage learning, why offer a no-HW option? If anything, by that logic then all students should be required to do the HW not only for structural/disciplinary measures but to also develop a better conceptual understanding. Clearly, this isn’t the case and by offering a no-HW option the course actively supports the testing approach which goes directly against the whole “encourage learning” goal.

&nbsp;

### Other related suggestions:
61AB has a plethora of resources, so that even when you’re stuck you can find resources to help you get unblocked. Exam prep videos, exam prep sections, NPE sections, videos specifically about recursive runtime, or 61C’s catchup sections. In 70, you have lectures (which majority of people do not watch), notes, and in-person discussion (if you end up not being able to go, tough luck! If you forget the nitty gritty of what was covered, tough luck too!).

&nbsp;

The benefit of developing these materials starting now is that it will pay absolute dividends in the long-term. For example, students still watch the Enigma/Gitlet explanation videos from 61B which were made years ago. It’s not like mod arithmetic, for example, will suddenly change 20 years down the road.

&nbsp;

Here’s what you should do: build a database of resources, reuse it semester-to-semester → this reduces the workload of OH, TA’s, etc in the long-term and also saves on cost/time! That’s all to say that the second-order effects are huge. In fact, if the whole goal of the course, commonly said by Sahai and Rao, is to “just learn the material” then why restrict resources to force people to interact with course staff? Why create extra barriers to resources to enforce your methodology?   

### Suggestions:
* Discussion Walkthrough videos:
     * Data 100 releases discussion walkthroughs intentionally a week late to encourage people to go to live discussion
     * Ex: [Data 100 Fa19 Discussion 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CiUCgSr-Mg)
* Concept walkthrough videos i.e RSA, Mod Arithmetic
     * Ex: [61B Asymptotics Introduction](https://youtu.be/bBqfehNv7mQ)
     * Ex: [Sahai Mini-Lecture on Mod Arithmetic](https://youtu.be/l0DWLBX5d2A)
* NPE/Behind/LOST/Exam-prep Discussion sections
     * 61A, 61B, 61C, 189, 170, Data 100 all have some variant of these
* HW Walkthrough videos
     * Ex: [Sp14 CS70 Homework 1 Problem 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkm-YdTJjrk)
* HW Introductory videos:
     * Ex: [CS61A Fa21 HW03 Q: Num Eights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hihU9yqfndM&list=PLx38hZJ5RLZehTD4yb15G7zKmMEJDHNdn&index=3)

#5) Teaching Pedagogy / Hiring Practices
The hiring practices are based primarily on grades. While Richard has pointed out that CS70 no longer solely relies on an algorithm to assign points based on grades, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that most of course staff and especially readers are math comp kids. 

&nbsp;

The main reason for bringing this up is because those who come from rigorous math backgrounds or ones where they've likely competed in USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or taken multivar, lin alg, discrete, etc before even coming to Berkeley are gonna naturally be ones to do well in the course. Doing well in the course translates to better odds of getting hired. And funnily enough, out of the 48 cs70 course staff members who responded to the internal poll about comp math: 27 did comp math in HS, 9 did comp math but only in middle school, 12 never participated in math competitions. Now, I’m not a stats guy but that looks like an overwhelming majority to me. I want to be clear that it’s not problematic that they come from rigorous backgrounds, because I have received help from fantastic readers and TAs with a comp math background and they were great- but the flipside is that my poor experiences (as of many others) have mainly come from those with comp math backgrounds whereas I have had absolutely no issues from those without comp math background.

&nbsp;

It's very clear that this is true when a reader/TA gives an explanation that is one-dimensional; one that is likely derived from a math comp perspective. I have routinely had poor experiences with certain readers and TAs in OH, so much so that I along with many other students try our best to avoid them. Do you know how humiliating and demeaning it is to ask for help KNOWING that the person helping you will condescendingly mock you (most of the time implicit or implied, never direct) because you value the help more than getting degraded? In 61A and 61B, asking for help never felt like I was being ridiculed or looked down on. Yet, at 70, I feel it at every step. 

###Suggestions:
Introducing/encouraging course staff that comes from different backgrounds (non math comp, low rigor HS) would be a great addition. Another focus could be a better filtering mechanism. I like the approach that 61A and 61B take where you have to teach a concept to current course staff who role-play as students and ask student-like questions- teaching extends beyond just grades; someone with an B+ could be a WAY better teacher than someone who never struggled and got an A. If a course staff member feels that they communicate better over Piazza/Discord/Online, that should be a role/responsibility instead of shoveling everyone into a people-facing role which could have an adverse effect. As aforementioned in the previous section, within the content team one of the highly rated TAs responsible for those walkthroughs/recordings!

&nbsp;

It is SO important that the people joining course staff are non-judgemental, welcoming, and patient. The impact that these people have on students extends beyond just learning, it goes deep and emotional.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR: CS70 is made artificially harder by creating a scarcity of resources. The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school. Slides and notes have a lot of room to improve, and ""this is hard material"" isn't a sufficient excuse for poor presentation. CS70 should make walkthrough videos (discussion, hw, concept, etc) and not doing so goes against their own goal of ""encouraging learning"" by restricting resources. Furthermore, hiring practices are skewed and majority of course staff come from comp math or rigorous math backgrounds, which becomes problematic when students poor experiences are a result of one-dimensional math comp explanations.**","There’s still a ton of HS’s out there where the advanced curriculum is to start with Algebra in 9th grade and end with pre-Calc in 12th grade.  In face that’s what that lady at Stanford who got reamed by Prof Nelson is pushing for in schools as a standard.
Been saying this about the CS trifecta for declaration. Those with prior knowledge and experience with the material do significantly better than those who don’t. 

Great report!
I am a math PhD student, former Olympiad brat and I tutored CS70 for a bit this past semester.

This course is an abomination. It condenses years of math maturity and proof experience inside... 14 weeks. It is 4 classes in 1, neither of which is given enough time to grow into the minds of students. The easiest way to resolve the issues is to split the course into a 2 semester sequence that actually takes the time to teach you how to do proofs and why proofs matter in CS.

Also take out the probability module. I understand that it has bearing on other classes in CS, but... there are dedicated classes that teach you the material properly in the departments that teach these things for a living (stats, math).

That said, I also disagree with OP's take on the ""skewed hiring practices"" - mathematics is mostly about imitating the proofs and solutions of other people until you get it. The pool of people who ""get math"" to the level that it is required in the CS70 curriculum is already small enough - would you rather be imitating someone who ""gets it"" or who ""doesn't get it""? Or is the claim that there are other capable potential staff who get looked over?
Former CS70 GSI here.

These are all superficial problems. The real problem with CS70 is that it's a monstrosity spawned by intra-departmental politics.

They are trying to cram too much material because there are conflicting requirements from the EE and CS sides, but the EE v CS rivalry does not allow them to remove material so that what remains can be taught properly. They are also trying to make it “sexy” by teaching advanced topics like RSA, error-correcting codes, and linear regression.

Conventionally, math is taught by first providing a bit of motivation for a concept, then the concept is given a rigorous definition, then simple claims are proven, then its properties are explored, and finally some proof of a minor or major theorem is given. The proofs are often chosen to illustrate new mathematical techniques. 

In CS70, there's some motivation but concepts are not defined with rigor, there's no time, so simple properties are not explored, not shown and not proven, and we jump directly to some proofs that students are not equipped to understand.  Students are in a constant mathematical haze.

For example, to teach error correcting codes and secret sharing, you must first teach polynomials over finite fields. But CS70 does not even define what a field is, and finite fields are given a single lecture slide and a bit more than single page in the notes. 

I can give many other examples.

This is supposed to be the first course where students are exposed to proofs and mathematical rigor, but there's simply no time for that and the course fails in its most important mission.

There is no textbook. The reason is simple, no one else is crazy enough to cram all this material into a single course. The notes are no substitute. They are a mess.

The massive use of UGSI is a big problem. They are very smart and motivated, but they often don’t have the mathematical maturity or perspective to teach this kind of course, especially the second year ones.

And finally, if the department wants to require the student to work for the equivalent of an 8 unit course, it should be honest and list CS70 as an 8 unit course, not force students to give up other courses and any resemblance of social life. University regulations are there for a reason, y'all should file official complaints against the department.

On the positive side, at least it is not as bad as EE16B.
I see all the comments from CS and math legends. Imagine me, a cognitive science major (and creative writing minor), having to take this class as a major requirement without mathematical maturity or interest to be honest. 

I had to choose the no-homework option. There was absolutely no way I was actually capable to do the problems in the homework—I didn't even know how to start, or enough material to even attempt. 

Furthermore, as a social learner (as opposed to a textbook learner), I attended every lecture and discussion. However, lectures were disorganized and rushed, slides were not engaging and a mess as well. I learned more from 5 minutes from my discussion review lecture than 1.5 hours of Sen's or Rao's lectures—genuinely the biggest waste of my time. Especially Professor Sen, he was just inarticulate and mumbled in speech, disorganized in his thoughts and logic flow, and unfamiliar with his slides.

Lastly, reading through the post and comments, I liked the author's point of feeling looked down upon to ask questions because it was the case for me. As a straight-A student (except for my B+ in Math 54), I have never felt more dumb and lost. I was confused about the most basic concepts and after attempting to ask about my confusion a few times in a discussion class where it seemed like everyone else was understanding, I stopped trying to ask or answer questions by my UGSI (I felt like a fool having never answered a question asked by my UGSI right).  Another person in the comments were using the example of finite fields—I still don't know what they are—to say how fundamental concepts were not introduced that were built upon for the actual material in this class. I went to Professor Rao's office hours and it was the most condescending and unhelpful staff interaction I have had in Berkeley; I went to him with a list of conceptual, basic questions to ask but he didn't bother to listen to what I was confused about and started going on long tangents and told me I had to read the notes (and started reading the notes with me). I was actually speechless and felt helpless after the interaction. 

This semester, I went from Developmental Psychology to this class, which has been so irrelevant compared to all the other courses I have taken for the major (everyone I've talked to, including seniors who graduated, was confused why this was a cogsci req).  All this to say, I want to shout out all the people who took this class out of requirement but the subject matter was outside of their usual academic interest and expertise. I got around 1 standard deviation below the class mean for the final and most of it was by test-taking strategies more than the actual hours of review I put in. Oh, and I have cried four times because of this class this semester. This class was absolute torture. Cheers.
I think you bring up a lot of good points, but the teaching issues are harder to fix than you realize. I got an A+ in the class and was a reader for a semester of 70, but the honest truth is I still didn't understand like half the material in the class well enough to walk someone else through it in depth - most of how I solved problems was just intuitive leaps that I couldn't fully explain to another person. (part of this might be that I'm not the greatest teacher, but I still believe what you can teach is a strict subset of what you yourself understand.)

cs70 is a very, very difficult class conceptually speaking. there are a literal handful of people per semester who genuinely understand the material inside-out, to a point where they can teach it effectively. these are usually the people who've been doing competitive math for 10+ years and made USAMO. my experience has been that these people (as opposed to people that just dabbled in competitive math - making aime 2-3x will help you ace cs70 but isn't really impressive on the same level) are usually the best TAs. using grades isn't the best metric, but I understand why they do it for 70.

I think this class would heavily benefit from GSIs with a lot more experience, since almost no undergrads are actually qualified to teach this class. The ones that are are usually anomalous math prodigies.
Excellent write up! I’ve had similar feelings regarding classes with artificially inflated difficulty at this school, and you have great suggestions to help prevent this. Classes like CS 70 really soured my opinion of Berkeley.
Thank you for writing up about CS70. I've learned to hate this course for the whole semester that I took it especially given how it has pushed my body to its physical limits. I do like the content in the course but this course has a very unwelcoming environment.
Wow, amazing advice
Thank you very much for the post! I gave it an award because hearing this info is truly eye opening.

I am taking this class this coming Fall. Given that you've spent so much time on the course, are there any resources/tips/strategies you would recommend? Especially because you say attending lecture and reading notes is not enough.

Anything I should know about the course to succeed? Thank you!
i really and truly appreciate when course staff/tutors/folks involved with the course share things like this. i was a nontraditional/reentry student and CS was nonexistent in my high school and none of the community college courses i took articulated to berkeley, nor were they remotely as ~rigorous as the 61 series/70 expects. i felt awful trying to navigate these classes and my TAs definitely tried their best but there was always a vibe of 'yeah it's hard but there's nothing wrong with the course, keep trying and you'll get there' when in reality it was apparent that students with prior experience in competitive math or programming or who had been exposed to this kind of material before coming in had a huge advantage and when that seems to be an ever increasing proportion of the student body as optimizing your college app and experiences skew more getting towards programming experience as EECS/CS continues to be an incredibly selective major in an already selective school, the expectation becomes that you're already familiar with the course material and the tests become an exercise in pattern matching or gotchas since the content is already known to the majority of the class and the exam scores 'curving' to some average or bin shifting reflect that. 

idk im rambling but thank you OP for expressing this so well
I come from a rigorous math/cs background and also have friends with a similar background and I have to agree with the vast majority of what you said. Prior experience makes 70 along with a whole plethora of classes significantly easier. I also agree with the premise that there are many things the course staff could do significantly better about the presentation of the material. Certainly there are going to be discrepancies no matter how good the teaching is, but it should be the goal of the course staff to bring everyone up.

I do think however that it is a bit of a stretch to say that the course staff is making content artificially harder. I don't think neither the professors or the TAs have such malicious designs, and the course policy instead stems from a difference in teaching philosophy. I want to preface by saying that I feel their teaching philosophy is not necessarily wrong, but it does mean there are some significant consequences.

First, for context, I want to elaborate exactly why previous experience helps. While there is some effect of learning the same content before, that's not all of it. I have a comp math background, but I didn't know about a significant amount of course material (70%). The 30% I knew is a good chunk, but I think an even bigger factor is the level of mathematical maturity that comes from that previous experience. Making intuitive leap of faiths is a natural extension of that experience, and I think that is exactly what the professors are trying to nurture. I don't completely agree with the policy, but I think skipping a bit of the proof such that you have to fill in the gaps is one way to encourage such growth. It's a pretty common method, especially in math.

Ultimately, the material itself is only a part of what you are supposed to learn. There's definitely a lot of other things (dealing with notation, intuition, problem-solving persistence) that the course is trying to 'teach' on top of the actual course material that are arguably more important. At the very least, that's the impression I get from prof. Rao's mini-rants during lectures. However, it is empirically extremely difficult to develop these skills, even on a 1-on-1 basis. Imagine how hard it is to do at such a massive scale. For better or for worse, CS 70 as it is today is a compromise -- it accepts that some people may not follow (due to inadequate resources), but I believe it at least attempts to maximize the amount that does and get as much as the core skills out of the class.

I will end this part by mentioning that I know people who do not have extensive math backgrounds, but have gained significant mathematical maturity during their time at Berkeley. There's also a lot of privileged people who have tried to get into comp math and couldn't. This is to say that privilege certainly has a part in accruing opportunities before college, but at the same time it isn't perfectly clear cut. I believe most are well aware of this, but I think it's important to say nonetheless. While 70 might feel and legitimately be unfair, it's also the class where all those inequalities come to light out of necessity. I'll go further by saying that it has potential to be the class that closes the gap and level the playing field, so to speak. I certainly think closing that gap is part of why Berkeley exists.

Given these thoughts, I have a slightly different conclusion in diagnosing the problems and a set of solutions that will most likely never happen. The main problem is that 70, as a requirement to declare the major, takes the majority of the responsibility to impart mathematical maturity to CS students. One class is not enough, yet it's important that it is a prereq because many upper div classes will require sufficient mathematical maturity not to mention the course material in this class. In an ideal world, I would split 70 into two classes, 70A, 70B, and an accelerated honors class H70 like in a lot of math classes. First would be geared more towards mathematical understanding, the second towards the more specific parts of 70. Splitting 70 would give the needed time to digest the content and develop necessary skills. Anecdotally, one of the best ways to develop my own math skills was to spend a long time with one problem, but the pacing of 70 currently makes that hard to do, especially if you don't have experience before. An accelerated class would satisfy those who do have experience. With the budget as it is, I don't see this happening any time soon though.

On a side note, many TAs might lack significant teaching experience, and therefore lack certain qualities that you mentioned. I think it's important to realize that some TAs are going to be undergrads not much older and experienced than the students so mistakes (to some extent) are to be expected. Please, give specific feedback so that they have an opportunity to grow. Also, as you've said, a majority of TAs have comp math backgrounds, and a majority of bad experiences for you come from people with majority comp math backgrounds. Do account for base-rate fallacies when generalizing your experiences.
>The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school.  

Facts. It's actually insane how much of an advantage silicon valley kids (you know, the types that went to schools like Lynbrook, Monta Vista, Mission SJ, etc. etc.) have when it comes to a course like CS70. Most of these kids have had significant exposure to multivariable calc, LA, and other advanced math that while not directly applicable to CS70, has certainly had a profound impact on their mathematical maturity which is huge in a class graded on a relative curve like CS70. And that's not even including the easier access and greater opportunity these kids have when it comes to pursuing competition math (AMC, AIME, etc. etc.). Many of low income friends in CS/EECS have stated that they were lucky to even have AP Calc AB (Calc 1) offered in high school. 

I hope your post gets the necessary traction and spotlight deserves. CS70 is by far the most unequitable CS class at Berkeley, which is a real shame. Considering that courses like 61A have made large strides to level the playing field (precursor classes like CS10, etc etc.) , I have optimism that the situation regarding 70 can and will be improved.  

Excellent write-up, OP.
i like how they give examples of good notes at other universities and then alec’s notes are just there too
100% agree. Heard the ""hard material"" excuse while taking the course all the time and just kind of accepted it but you are totally right...there are barely any resources. I came from a school that did not have any math competitions, in fact I had no idea they existed and had the hardest time in 70.
I don’t care if you don’t end up passing or getting a good grade in CS70, this is such a strong data backed argument with incredibly specific suggestions to improve that I will give you a referral to Google if you DM me when you’re on the job hunt. Dead serious. This is way better than most product proposals or eng docs I’ve seen at Google
\>students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college

I don't understand this point. 61A and 70 were never meant to be entry level classes and the professors really try to get this point across. People shouldn't be attempting 70 without at least Math 1A, 1B, and 53 if not more unless they're confident they know what they're doing. Prerequisites aren't enforced because some people have other backgrounds. Many students come to Berkeley with absolutely no experience, take CS 10/Data 8, Math 1A/1B/53 and do well in both 61A in 70.
I don’t know how to do the quote shit but this may be ugly, but a few takeaways 
“In CS70, the gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim”
Source?? In fact I would imagine it’s significantly smaller if we’re considering everything, because for a substantial amount of students CS61A is their first time ever coding, whereas CS70 is certainly not their first exposure to math. Additionally, many recommend taking courses such as the EECS16 series and Math 53 in order to prepare for CS70. This preparation simply doesn’t exist for the 61 series as the only courses available are CS 10 and Data C8, which simply do not come near the rigor of the CS61 series.
“An overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless” 
And an overwhelming majority of students struggle in CS70. As someone who went to essentially every lecture, I can assure you a large portion of students did not go at all, however the people that I know that did go (granted this is anecdotal), ended up doing well in the course. I would love to see data on this, and of course this is just speculation, but I guarantee there’s a positive correlation between lecture attendance and grades. 

“I have spent approximately 900 hours”

I’m sorry but this is just absurd. There just exists diminishing returns in studying and it simply does not make sense to be spending this much time. Not all studying is created equally, and I highly encourage you to reach out to peers that did well and see what their strategy is and adapt your study habits.
 
This one is two quotes 
“For students who don’t have time to spare” 
“Why offer a no-homework option”
You critique CS70 through Tarang with past exams not including enough walkthroughs on the solutions. First off I think I agree with this philosophy of not just handing out the answers to students, and the person that convinced me was Professor Adikhari who designed Prob 140, and is an incredible professor. When you have difficult topics like Discrete Math and Probability Theory, all the learning comes through struggling and developing your own problem solving techniques. Seeing the answer just simply restricts your ability to learn. And I think the no-hw option exists purely for the reason of being accommodating. 

“61AB has a plethora of resources”

I have to hard disagree with this. In office hours for CS61B it was extremely common for people to wait for 3 hours absolutely stuck on a bug, only to get 3 minutes with a TA that gave them the completely wrong advice. That simply doesn’t exist in CS70 where there isn’t the same existence of getting stuck on a bug, and there is always quick response times in office hours (legit the few times I went I was the only one haha).

Overall, I think CS70 is difficult because 1) people do not take the proper prep courses to gain that “mathematical maturity” (cringe term but true) and 2) because you just simply can’t half ass it like CS61 series where you can just spend a couple days grinding practice exams (61A) or projects (61B/C). Attendance is absolutely abysmal in CS70 and it’s just not a course you can be not present for and do well.
This deserves a thoughtful response from the course staff. Thanks so much for posting this. Illustrates why we need to have a direct to major process that uses holistic review rather than a 3.3 grade-driven process that lacks transparency, creates artificial scarcity, and favors specific backgrounds.
Facts it doesn’t help that it’s curved either
Going through this post reminds me bad memories of similar experiences in 61A and 70. Seeing others who already knew the content breeze through the course was so discouraging. Between working part time and studying for these courses, I basically everything I could to end up with straight B+s. Things are not hard but the pace is gruesome and the instruction is very poor.
LMFAOOOOOOOOO YOU SPENT 900 HOURS ON THIS CLASS????? thats probably triple the amount of time I spent for my entire 4 years at berkeley on classes combined
How does one prepare for cs70 if they don’t have competitive math experience?
My dad is Mit graduate who specializes in mathematics and even he said the notes are too difficult to understand and that the notes are terrible as this class is suppose to be introduction.
The lecture slides thing is plain false. The lecture slides are updated and passed through by the professors before being posted.
I tutor CS in my free time, and the amount of kids I get learning CS and mathematical concepts in sophomore/freshman year of HIGH SCHOOL and even BEFORE is astounding. These students have very wealthy and intelligent parents that push their kids education since they’re really little. That’s why these kids are over represented as students in the CS/EECS population at Berkeley, Stanford etc is. It’s really unfair since it makes the population studying CS homogeneous while reducing discoverability for students who are talented but didn’t have the same level of exposure to math and CS as kids.
I'm taking 70 this summer, any advice on how to prepare beforehand?
I have not taken CS70 so I cannot speak to most of this but I will say that simply hiring to course staff those who earned the best grades is definitely a practice in other courses (across other departments), and is a problem in those cases as well. The argument is that someone needs to know the material extremely well to be a TA—this is true, but actually being able to teach the material is an even more important skill that often gets overlooked.
Can’t wait for OPs critique on 16B next 😂😂
Absolutely fantastic write up and I sincerely hope the cs department reads this thoroughly and takes it to heart. You didn’t just make arbitrary suggestions, but gave examples of what they look like when implemented properly.
(Disclaimer/background: I did math comp in middle school and up to Calc 1 in HS)

As much as I agree with the vast majority of this, I would argue that having the previous math exposure is frequently detrimental to you as the rigor of these classes is often a lot less than what you would learn in Math 1/2 at Berkeley. I admit that I had privilege in that I did not have to work a job while at Berkeley, but I did extracurriculars/clubs amounting to ~20 hours a week and was able to keep up with the coursework well enough with lecture/HW party/sections and little outside studying other than the week prior to an exam. That being said, the course material (especially the notes) really needs an overhaul, and I can absolutely relate to feeling disparaged by some of the course staff when asking questions. Frankly a lot of my understanding for this course (and other courses, especially Data 100) were aided the most by my interactions with other students on piazza, both me trying to help others and vice versa.
I took CS70 this semester and I agree with everything here. I assume you know this, but apparently the reason for a no-HW option is a lack of resources for hiring tutors (therefore not enough graders). 

I think this might reflect on at least part of the reason why CS70 is so unnecessarily hard: not enough CS funding for the upper divs means they *want* to weed people out, which leads to extreme inequity because it's harder to weed out people with prior experience. They might not even want to make it more equitable because of this. 

Let me know if you have more info on this. You clearly know more than me and I would love to hear what you think.
This is fantastic.
Wow who would've thought that people who are better at math would get better math grades. Very cool!
Facts! Why doesn't the school just let us take easy classes and get rid of classes I don't like personally? It's not fair!!!
They'd have more leeway with difficulty if CS was direct admit honestly.
disagree, 70 is easier then 61a and 61b.
No you’re wrong
Berkeley admits too many people
One minor thing I disagree with:

>The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school.

""this course is racist because some races don't have knowledge going into the course that they need for the course""
why is it even a requirement to begin with. blows my mind, along with 16b
Is this course worth taking for a minor
This is an extreme mischaracterization of what the CA math framework proposed. In the section people cited as supposedly claiming this there was even an explicit goal of everyone being able to take calculus by the end of high school. The Stanford person who worked on the framework was obviously wrong and imo racist in her personal communication, but the campaign against the framework was largely STEM academics with no knowledge of teaching best practices who were against anti-racism reform (it was and is broadly supported by math education experts!)
At least we had Calc BC for the tryhards. It was combo class with AB tho so they barely got to series. I wanted to do nursing and so did ap stats rather than calc, so big regret esp considering i'm doing cs major lol.
Agreed but cs70 is on a whole other level. I had an advance math backgroud. One of those kids who declared math their first semeseter. I noticed how poorly supported cs70 was but said nothing to anyone because it's the reason I scored so high in that class, by having background and knowing alternative actually helpfull online resources.

Got ~0.7 sd in 61ab but was able to score 1.2-1.5 sd on cs70 because how poorly normal students were taught in that class it actually gave people like me an advantage.
[deleted]
This is a prime example where you can't have good and cheap at the same time. They should hire 20hr full GSI from the math dept. to teach this class because not every 8hr kid with an A+ have years of teaching experience or experience with grad level proofs to do this job.
And if you think CS70 is bad, you should take a look at EE16A/B.

The entire curriculum of a four year EE degree, neatly packaged in two 4 unit courses.
A lot of the actual Olympiad kids (not AMC/AIME people) are really, really good at explaining their thought processes because of writing tons of proofs. The problem is in CS70, a lot of the readers are not at this level, and so they are not very good at explaining things as they are still learning how to teach.
hey Shakespeare I appreciate you sharing! Could you be explicit which classes have substantial material in cs70? i think it's 

1) some very early abstract algebra/number theory material/general 'discrete math&proofs', arguably two different classes

2) probability

3) some linear algebra?
""Olympiad brat"" I wish I could have that title lmao
> intra-departmental politics.

Can you elaborate on this? I thought a discrete math and probability course is pretty universal at any school that has a CS program?
Preach
The struggle was real
> how I solved problems was just intuitive leaps that I couldn't fully explain to another person

Not a CS major but it sounds like you're either psychic or just have an IQ over 120 lol. You're very lucky. I'm an MCB major, but my roommate took this class and this class genuinely terrifies me following the stuff about Sahai and looking over my roommates notes.
It definitely depends on the student, but I found that forgoing attending lecture, and instead reading the notes thoroughly before discussion was really helpful. In general, a lot of learning happens in discussion - applying the theoretical concepts you learn in notes/lecture to challenging problems), so its important to have a solid understanding of the concepts before going into discussion. Also, discussion content is fairly similar to exam content so it helps you in ways that might be instrumentally useful to performing well on the exam.
once you have a decent understanding of the content, I would honestly just recommend grinding past exams. Go through at least 6 practice exams and I guarantee you'll be able to get through half the exam from pattern recognition alone.
I would forgo the lectures as it is practically the note but u don't get to go at your own pace. Spend lots of time on the notes before starting the assignments. Don't just read a theorem and it's proof. Prior to reading the proofs spend time applying it to an examples you think of and try finding a case that breaks the theorem (If you actually find a case you probably need to reread theorem for understanding). Doing it this way should help u understand the proofs easier and better.
> precursor classes like CS10

Fun fact, that use to exist for CS70: https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4510, it was incredibly popular, with rave reviews, and as far as anyone could tell really helped a lot of students in CS70

but ~~Sahai~~ theory professors killed it because ""sInGlE sOuRcE oF TruTH""

Some faculty are actively preventing efforts to bridge that gap.
your point about the difficult high schools is correct, but not for the reason you think. fact is not all algebra 2 / precalc / ap calc classes are created equal. the double honors math pathway (algebra 2 in 9th, precalc 10th, ap calc 11th) at many of these high schools, including mine, was **very** rigorous. like, most of these classes were harder to get As in than cs70, even if they were conceptually easier. tests would be hard and require outside-the-box thinking in ways that most high school math classes do not.

even if someone never touched competitive math or a course beyond ap calc in their life, if they could get As in the hard math classes at my high school they'd easily be prepared for cs70.
they would fit right in at Google... all talk and no work being done
Here's the thing, plenty of people took Math 1A and Math 1B before coming into 70 and they still struggle. Rarely have I seen people that have already taken those courses do well in 70 just because of those 2 courses alone. It's usually because they did competitive math in the past or they come from a privileged background where they had access to many resources that helps them be prepared for 70.
I don't know how anyone could get a full understanding of the material from lecture without being able to rewind and rewatch.
[deleted]
Some professors don't even have lecture slides. When I took 70, both professors went the handwritten route.
There was a lecture slide on villagers committing suicide this semester. I think for the most part, unless it’s something controversial like that or stable marriage being changed to stable matching, what the OP said about the slides never being changed is true (ask the professors yourself).
facts, i also tutor math and cs, and students whose parents can’t pay $60+ per hour for math / cs tutoring are miles behind those whose parents can
Get exposed to the content beforehand. Start off watching the YouTube lectures from 2015 (Vazirani) and then read the notes. You don't have to understand everything or even half. Start thinking in the way of 70, and you'll be more prepared than just memorizing content.
How dare you
What they’re saying is that minorities are statistically *less* likely to have prior access to competitive math resources and experiences. So, the minority students are at a disadvantage *in comparison* to the non-minority group of students. They’re not saying “some races” don’t have the knowledge, or that “minorities are dumb” as you went on to say later. They’re just saying it’s *less* likely that minorities will have the necessary experience needed due to socioeconomic constraints that disproportionately affect them. Nothing to do with how intelligent students are.
The entire lower-div gauntlet is basically an IQ test anyhow. Wouldn't  really be an issue if Berkeley lowered admit rate and stopped the L&S loophole, so people knew upfront what they were getting.
The material is cs70 is far more relevant to CS than 16b. You absolutely need that mathematical maturity to take 170. 

CS really isn’t just programming. I think and I think most people would agree that programming is by far the easiest part of CS, with math being the hardest part.

There’s a reason a CS degree at a university takes 4 years vs a boot camp which can be a few weeks.

*This isn’t to say that 61AB are just programming but that obviously plays a big part in those courses, and is a big part of the challenge of those courses (ie 61B projects).
So are you saying that this site https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home is BS?  The vast majority of high schools that are in California (almost assuredly not attended by freshmen STEM students at Berkeley) and throughout the country operate with the schedule that I mentioned - Algebra in 9th grade thru pre-Calc in 12th grade.  And that’s the “advanced” curriculum.  Many students barely get to Algebra by the time they finish HS.
i lol’d at your flair lmao thanks for the laugh
Which alternative resources did you find helpful?
what helpful online resources would you recommend for 70? thank you!
How come? Genuinely interested in your take.
Agreed. It is really not easy to teach these kinds of math concepts, and to be frank a large number of uGSIs just don't have enough experience to be effective teachers. In contrast to the CS department, the quality of GSI instruction in the math department (I took 55 and several math upperdivs) was phenomenal and it felt like I was learning from a wealth of knowledge when talking to math grad students.

I understand the need for uGSIs - it's a resources problem. But for such a fundamental class, I think the standards should be higher.
Lmao grad students often don’t care about teaching as it’s just a job to them. Many times I’ve experienced where they aren’t even familiar with what is assigned and have to read the question making you wait even longer — anecdotal evidence from me in math classes but true
Why hire from the math department? If it’s a question of there not being enough CS people (some have indicated this isn’t the case and it’s just they don’t want to pay for a grad student?) I don’t think math is any better. They offer up ugsi spots for math majors decently often because of not having enough interested grad students (and not bc they’re not willing to pay), presumably bc a lot of the math dept is funded by nsf grfp
[deleted]
Agreed, I see this in a lot of mathy eecs classes (when I took eecs16b, I went to homework OH and an ASE gave me wrong advice on how to approach a linearization question — that involves partial derivatives — and from what they said, I could tell they hadn’t taken math 53 or any higher classes). You have no way of reviewing ASE/readers so if they are going around giving false info in OH then there’s not much you can do.

I think a stronger emphasis on teaching experience and not just hiring readers who got an A+ would help a lot. If you have a **structured** pipeline of AI → CSM/reader → TA then you can actually review their teaching experience and hire course staff that will help students learn the best. I think cs70 has started to do that and as they purge out the bad it will lead to a better course experience for everyone!
1) Number Theory

2) Graph Theory/combinatorics

3) Probability

4) Math 55
Discrete math and probability are universal for CS, not necessarily as a single course. Where I went to school there was a separate discrete math course (sets, prooof + combinatorics), and a separate probability course, but every school has their own way of doing that.

What the intra-departmental politics dictate the specific content. For example, as far as I know, the EE professors insist on continuous distributions. The result is at most two lectures, two tutorials and one homework. Some semesters it's even less. It is simply not enough.

The result of the politics is that there's simply too much stuff, and you can't cut it down. You can't even blame the professor teaching the course because they're doing their best under the constraints they are given.
There isn't enough time to ""solve"" each multiple choice question on exams, the best way to do well is to get good at ""intuitive leaps"" (aka guessing).
If you’d taken CS70, you’d realize that the intuitive leaps are actually a substantial part of the class. That’s part of the “mathematical maturity” that is mentioned, and it’s very hard to explain why you did the things you do after the fact in some cases. It often boils down to “I felt that this approach was best” and then has to be justified after the fact when talking to students.
120 IQ is barely considered smart, just fyi
[deleted]
I don’t understand how limiting resources like these does to help anyone. ~~In the most polite way,~~ fuck anyone who actively tries to discourage others from learning and attempting to get a better understanding of topics so that they can succeed academically. If people are seeking resources such as these, it’s most likely because they’ve never had the opportunity to get a high quality education prior to Berkeley. In fact, for some students Berkeley might be the first institution which gives them access to great resources such as these.
>but Sahai theory professors killed it because ""sInGlE sOuRcE oF TruTH""

Did you hear from Suraj/other decal teachers directly, or is this just something you heard? I find it a little hard to believe because CSM is still around, making content and teaching hundreds of students.
Right? At my bay area school our pre calc class included things like probability, induction proofs, etc. we started proofs in 9th grade with geometry which definitely helped to grow  mathematical maturity
LOL touché fair point
The weird obsession with color coding the notes. The only data I see is the internal poll. Staff obviously cared enough to try to figure out if this was the case, and it’s not easy to rectify. What are they going to do, ask if you’ve done math competitions in the past and filter you out based on that? Doesn’t seem very likely. But I do think the hiring process could be better. A simple google form asking for some essays does not seem enough, especially since you’re boiled down to writing skills at that point.
Yeah 1A and 1B are nowhere near enough. I took 70 with no comp math background at all and did very well just because of having taken other math courses for the physics major. You can build a strong math background right here at Berkeley it just takes a couple semesters. Most people are taking 70 way too early for their own good.
or maybe some people are just naturally smarter
completely agree. I did terrible in cs 70, but I can thank vazirani’s lectures for helping me not do even worse! his lectures definitely explain the concepts much better than rao or then notes
That’s just because he reused old slides without looking over them very carefully or consideration of triggers. This is not an indicator you’re forced to use the same slides as in the past. Otherwise you’d be hearing about this suicidal villagers every semester and complaints.
im getting downvoted so let me explain.

for 61a, the tests are harder than the homework. I could easily do the homework and labs but when it came to tests, the harder questions + time pressure made it extremely challenging. In 70, if you can do the homework, the test questions are comparably easy so there's no nasty surprises on exam day. furthermore, Scheme, environment diagrams, trees and tree recursion are killer topics, I don't think cs70 has any topics that hard. 

&#x200B;

for 61b, imma just say engima and gitlet. cs70 doesn't have anything close.
They're saying minorities are less likely to have access to resources. That's what you said.

Every course has prerequisites. Knowledge builds on other knowledge. That's how academia works. It's not exclusionary, that's just how it is.

Do you think that because some people don't have access to prerequisites we should make the class not based off of those prerequisites, or we should teach people the prerequisites?
I'm in no position to agree or disagree with you, but I'll just simply say that randomly blaming things on ""racism"" because ""minorities are dumb"" is really stupid (replying to the post, not your comment). Your comment is very reasonable.
Yes this website is a mischaracterization of the framework. The main groups that gathered signatures for these open letters were splinter groups from the AMS and other mainstream organizations that formed several years ago to oppose diversity/equity measures (Aaronson in particular is in leadership of several of these groups). There are obviously a huge number of people who have signed them --- again, overwhelmingly people who are not math education experts --- but I would suspect a large portion have not read the framework and have instead been convinced by a similar characterization. The original framework explicitly stated a goal of making it possible for everyone to take calculus by the end of high school (specifically, in Chapter 9) and subsequent versions after this campaign have been updated to make that even clearer.

When prominent mathematicians send out emails saying it's going to make everyone able to take less math, it's ridiculously easy to garner signatures. I see maybe two or three signatories here that \*might\* be considered math education researchers
No they’re saying that eecs16b *tried* to jam that stuff into the class, but obviously it doesn’t work and ends with miserable, confused students
I'm confused--Math 55 covers all three of the above as well, arguably in more depth than 70. How is it the fourth class contained in CS70?

My experience is that CS70 is just Math 55 with slightly less emphasis on set theory and formal rigor, and more emphasis on algorithms and applications.
Lol a lot of people are taking the 120 thing too seriously. I mean more on that scale then. 

To give you a satisfactory answer, when I say “psychic” I’m referring to the type of person that takes half the time to understand the material in compared to a normal student in this class. It’s probably what contributed to their grade.
Shouldn’t the average Berkeley student have the ability to read the room? and this thread is extremely noob-friendly, you’re the outlier by lack of tact.
Seems like the problem is that they need to hire *someone* to do the job anyway, and there's no 30 undergrads with years to teaching experience to hire.
Definitely agree. But with the new enrollment policies and also considering the fact people like transfers have to take courses like 70 ASAP. I don't see it getting any better.
No, I think OP is trying to say that a course of this design, rather than attempting to mitigate those differences in some way, exacerbates them unnecessarily. Academia doesn’t need to be excessively exclusionary. The same material could be taught in more accessible ways.
I don't know if there's been a public response to these letters by anyone that I can point you to, but the people I've talked with in Berkeley's education department have suggested just reading the framework. I will also add that beyond just the aforementioned messages from Boaler, a lot of her actual work has been criticized by a decent number of math education people as being an outdated because of its attempt at ""colorblindness"" and individualism. Her inclusion in the framework writing was to have a broad range of ""perspectives"" (and I might add, it is not surprising to me that she is the one who turned to problematic rhetoric)
I can agree that if something can be more inclusive it should be

But I think a course having prerequisites is fine

Thanks a lot !!","no, you don't need any prior knowledge for 16a. tbh the class just isn't very well-taught, the whole first module (which focuses in linear algebra) gave me no intuition for lin alg at all. I kinda understood things by really wracking my brain when the course covered least squares (though the class doesn't test for or require this level of understanding honestly, I was just curious and spent a lot of time thinking about it), and linear algebra finally made sense for me when I took eecs 127 a few semesters later (without taking 16b in the meanwhile).

if you're really concerned about this, tbh just take eecs 127 your second or third semester. ranade teaches it in a pretty accessible way, eecs 16a on its own is sufficient prep.
watch 3B1B linear algebra YouTube playlist
thanks for the responses!
The first unit of 16a teaches you the linear algebra that you will need. Though obviously it will help to take a linear algebra class beforehand, it is definitely not necessary. 

IMO if you really want to prepare beforehand you can just look at the notes on the [eecs16a website](https://eecs16a.org)
I took math 54 before taking 16a and it helped a lot with the lin algebra unit. They go through it rather quickly and not well enough so it would be pretty hard if you've never seen lin algebra before. Had little to no experience with circuits and it was fine for me
How were you able to to take eecs127 without 16a and b? Are they not enforced for prereqs at all? Just curious bc I have taken Math 54 but not 16a and b.
Which chapters would you recommend?: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B&ab\_channel=3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
pretty much no classes in the CS department (aside from data 100) enforce prereqs.
Just watch the whole thing if you don’t have any background
Do you have to deal with circuits or is it just entirely about differential equations and linear algebra?
Eecs 127 is a class on optimization (which uses a lot of linear algebra, and the first third of the class teaches some linear algebra.) it has nothing to do with circuits."
Double Majoring at Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2adts/double_majoring_at_berkeley/,2022-04-12 14:48:39,"Hi I am a recently admitted student at Cal and had some questions about double majoring. I got accepted into the L & S college and plan (hopefully) on double majoring in Poli Sci and Statistics. I was wondering if I could get any insight on the process of declaring two majors, if this will be too much of a burden to take on. On top of this, how much would double majoring increase my tuition by or is there a cost calculator I can use for it. Thank you!","Pretty straightforward to declare a double major.  If you look at the L&S website there should be a section on how to do it.

No extra cost for tuition.  You can take 13 units or 130 units a semester, and it would be the same cost for normal Fall and Spring semesters.
Statistics the only thing you need is a decent grade in the prerequisites
I’m double majoring in two completely unrelated things: comp lit and molecular environmental biology. Granted I did get a lot of things satisfied by AP credits but I don’t have to work very hard at all to satisfy my breadths bc my double majors do it for me. I know a lot of people are worried about finishing on time or a lack of crossover but if anything I’ve found the lack of crossover has helped me immensely!
Congrats!! Double majoring is very straight-forward, and you should almost definitely be able to do it and still graduate in 4. 

The biggest piece of advice I have for you is to finish as many of the math pre-requisites before you come to Berkeley. For the Stats major, you have to take Calc 1, Calc 2, Calc 3, Lin Alg in order to be able to declare Stats, and then need to take either Stat 134 (pre-req of Calc 1+2) or Stat 140 (pre-req of Lin Alg) before you can take the other upper div stats classes. So if you want to go the 140 route (typically seen as the better-taught class), it becomes a while before you can take the upper div stats classes (Junior year fall) if you haven't taken any calculus beforehand and are starting at Calc 1 in the fall. 

So, it sucks to spend the summer studying, but I would highly recommend taking either Calc 1, Calc 2, Calc 3, or Lin Alg at a community college (Berkeley makes the Calculus courses unnecessarily difficult in my opinion), so that way you can take the upper div stats classes sooner, which will also make double majoring logistically easier. If you have any questions about the major or anything like that then let me know!!

Does it not max out at 17.5? (Also looking to double major and I might be mistaken but the website said you can’t take more than that)
Okay I see, thank you very much for the info!
The 17.5 max is only after Phase 1 & 2. During adjustment, you can go as high as you want.  (Anything above 20.5 requires approval).  I’ve seen people who take 30.  Not that I recommend this.
Oh gotcha! Thank you!"
Two math classes as a Freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/c4x4gp/two_math_classes_as_a_freshman/,2019-06-24 15:27:37,"I’ve taken Calc BC, Calc 3, and Linear Algebra so I was thinking of either taking Math 53+54 or Math 54+55 for my first semester, would that be too much? I’m planning on being an Applied Math major.","Sure, two techs is pretty standard if you think you can handle it. Since you have Lin alg and calc 3 experience it probably shouldn't be that bad.

Would look into taking 110 as well, as it's the usual ""first"" math upper div and a more math oriented intro to Lin alg as opposed to 54.
Stick to a single course for your first semester. If you really want to get ahead of the curve you'll have more than enough time to catch up later and it'll be worth giving yourself a slightly more enjoyable intro to college.

Source: I followed my advice - still managed to get only 1 course short of the Pure Math degree by end of Sophomore year.
[deleted]
You should do 55 and 110 imo. It’s not worth repeating a lower div class
I know I have the knowledge/experience from those courses (for the most part lol) but I just don’t know if I’d be able to transfer that to a Cal course? Since I bet the teaching style/class structure/workload are quite different from CC courses.
Then should I take 53 or 54?
Oh, I didn’t know I could get it waived by taking the upper div DE, thank you!
I can’t skip 54 bcs it includes Diff Eq 😔
If you want to take it easy, then don't worry about it, the reqs aren't exactly very stringent.
53 is like Calc ++, 54 is edging towards real math, it's all about which you think you'd be more interested in.
Yeah, it's not an official thing you can do, but the math department is pretty relaxed with requirements and it's what they told my friend who self studied difeq and linalg
Are you sure? I'm pretty sure only the linear algebra class I took at a CCC gave me transfer credit for 54 (this is according to my transfer credit report. You should check assist.org to see if it does). If not, I think it'd be possible to get it waived by the math department.
Cool, I think I’ll go with 54 then. Thank you so much for the advice!
Yeah I checked on assist.org and it says that the Linear Algebra course I took only gives credit for half of 54. I might try to get it waived like you said then
That’s weird. Definitely ask your major advisor then"
Should I take COMPSCI 70 next semester?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hoev9l/should_i_take_compsci_70_next_semester/,2020-07-09 17:27:17,"I’m an incoming L&S transfer hoping to eventually declare CS, and I was planning on taking COMPSCI 61A and EECS 16A next semester. However, I was debating whether to also take COMPSCI 70. Would that be too difficult for my first semester? 

I ask because I feel like I can handle the first two classes (I’ve been coding in C++ for about a year and I’m familiar with the basics of Python, and I took linear algebra at my CC and got an A, although it was difficult), but would piling CS 70 onto that still be too much?","61A + 16A + 70 would frankly be a huge workload, we’re talking about like 60 hrs/wk if your experience in these classes matches mine, probably more around midterms/finals. All three classes are known for having lots of homework and difficult tests. I’m sure it’s doable if you really commit but personally I would strongly recommend against it.


Edit: your experience in programming and lin alg will certainly help, but considering the wide breadth of concepts they throw at you in 61a and how 16a moves on to circuits and optimization over pure lin alg after the first third of the semester, it would still be a massive undertaking
Doable but it would be a pretty hard semester.  Do note that CS61A doesn’t have that much programming in it, it’s mostly a concepts class.  

How good are your math skills?  Did you do a lot of proofs? Ever done competitive math?  You should take a hard look [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/archives.html) and go thru the class first and then decide.
I know a few transfer who did that workload. Its doable if you pick your battles really wisely, and if youre satisfied with perhaps not having amazing grades. It takes a huge chunk of the workload once you do it.
if you have any shred of actually genuinely wanting to declare and have any kind of life/commitment other than school i would strongly advise against cs70 with that schedule. i know it sucks to have to cram all these classes in to declare in such a short window of time but if i could have done anything different the first semester i transferred, it would have been not to take 61a and 70 at the same time lol. 61a was ok, even with minimal coding experience but 70 was just an enormous change of pace and content from community college, and i actually liked math! lol it's just very intense and a lot of pressure to keep up that gpa. knock out an american cultures class or something else in that slot
Math classes are probably the least affected (relatively speaking) by the shift to being fully online, in my opinion. As long as lectures are live and you can attend office hours, you should be okay with 70. Stay away from anything project heavy, or with ‘gotcha’ exams like 61A, as I am learning the hard way in 61C right now.
Thanks for the advice, I figured it probably wouldn’t be the best course of action.
I suppose the only proofs I did were in linear algebra and a few in calc 1. Thanks for the CS 70 link. I’ll definitely make great use of that before I take the course!"
