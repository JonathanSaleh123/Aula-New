Anyone have a Rhetoric R1B syllabus from past years? Ivy Mill's would be preferred but any R1B syllabus will do.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6mpe4f/anyone_have_a_rhetoric_r1b_syllabus_from_past/,2017-07-11 14:31:31,Thank you,"Those classes change in content every year, so I'm not sure that a past syllabus would be much help to you. You can expect the assignments to be 2-3 essays, including a final research paper. 
Ok thanks!

Still, if you've taken the course, I'd like to take a look at your syllabus if you have a copy of it on you. I just want to get an idea bout the course as a whole."
