Berkeley MS Civil Engineering classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/olqm8x/berkeley_ms_civil_engineering_classes/,2021-07-16 14:36:50,"So I'm currently registering for my Fall classes and the fact that some professors aren't showing up on ratemyprofessors.com is making me nervous.
Has anyone had classes with one of these professors:
Adda Zekkos (CE 270 + 298)
Jonathan Bray (CE 275)
Robert Kayen (CE 281)

Thank you so much! Any help is appreciated.","I recommend checking BerkeleyTime and NinjaCourses (deprecated but has reviews of well established professors at Cal).
Thank you so much for your help!"
