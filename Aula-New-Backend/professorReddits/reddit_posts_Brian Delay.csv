Previous?Current HISTORY 7A or CHEM 1A Students:,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ic59pw/previouscurrent_history_7a_or_chem_1a_students/,2020-08-18 10:18:43,"Does anyone who has taken HISTORY 7A with Brian DeLay still have ebooks or PDFs of the required readings? Also, does he cover all of the books on the [textbooks list](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-fall-history-7a-001-lec-001)? Please let me know :')

On an unrelated note, if I want to get the Sapling Homework for General Chemistry, where's a good place to get it, separate from the textbook? I found [this site](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/ca/product/Sapling-Learning-Homework-Only-for-General-Chemistry-Single-Term-Access/p/1319080510) but I'm not sure if it's the correct one for CHEM 1A. Also, if anyone's in an active study group/group chat for CHEM 1A, please let me know!! Thank you :)","I’m in the LoopChat group for chem 1A. Lmk if you want the link
I’d like that, thank you :)"
