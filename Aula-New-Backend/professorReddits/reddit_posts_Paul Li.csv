how is cogsci 1 w paul li?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ksvxl7/how_is_cogsci_1_w_paul_li/,2021-01-07 21:21:35,has anyone taken this class before? having a really hard time finding anything about it online and the syllabus won’t be released until class starts lol. trying to see if I should drop it or get an idea of what it’s like to gauge my options considering my other classes rn are math 54 ugba 10 and cs 61a. literally anything helps thanks :),"Paul Li is 10/10! I had him a few years ago, but Cog Sci 1 still lives in my memory as one of my favorite classes at Cal. He's passionate about the subject, and clear in his delivery of the material. The grading is pretty fair -- there were two midterms and a final, plus a few assignments. He also invites a very eclectic group of guest lecturers for each module, and they're usually very interesting to listen to!
i loved cogsci 1 w paul li -- one of my fav professors ever :) i can send you the syllabus
thank you so much ! this makes me feel a whole lot better much love :)

Attendance is required for the lab/discussion sections.  It behooves you to attend all lectures as well since some of the test questions, especially from guest lecturers, come from the lectures.  Getting some sort of A is fairly achievable, but it won’t be easy, you’ll have to put in your hours of reading and memorizing his big book.  The flashcards might help as well. Conversely, if you don’t put in the effort, it’s easy to get < 70% on either midterm and you’ll be scrambling just to get to a B or B+.
sent! :)"
Cog Sci 1 Paul Li textbook,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/erzkz7/cog_sci_1_paul_li_textbook/,2020-01-21 11:24:35,Does anyone have an online pdf for the textbook for this class? Thanks! The book is: The Cognitive Sciences: An Interdisciplinary Approach (2nd edition). Thanks!,"[deleted]
The person in the comments, soscollege, is requesting a venmo of 10 dollars before they give you the book which some might find unreliable. I found the pdf on Duplanca for 9 dollars and it is legit and high quality and they send the pdf immediately. Here is the link below.

How is Jose A Ramirez as a professor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l0d93c/how_is_jose_a_ramirez_as_a_professor/,2021-01-18 21:35:18,"I'm currently enrolled in Cog Sci 1B and am debating whether I should take the 1B version with Jose A Ramirez or the 1 version with Paul Li. Which one is the better one to take in this scenario? I have no idea who Jose Ramirez is, but I have heard excellent things about Paul Li.","Jose Ramirez is an *awful* professor: avoid him at all costs. Paul Li, on the other hand, is amazing."
CogSci1 Curve?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tkf8k0/cogsci1_curve/,2022-03-22 15:41:11,I'm taking CogSci1 with Paul Li and didn't do too hot on the midterm. Is the whole class curved at the end or after each test?,"i was under the impression that the first midterm was curved, I think gradescope mentioned a point adjustment
Not in my experience.  

Edit:  details, in Spring 2019, there were 2 midterms; the final grade was not curved.  The A- bottom border was like 89 average for everything.
its over for me
You can move up quite a bit gradewise with the Final if you buckle down.  This was a blow-off class for me as I was spending all my time on CS 70/EECS 16B and I screwed up both my my midterms royally.  I was in the bottom quarter of the class.  The Final (and the midterms) is all memorization from his book plus material from the guest lecturers. Also, I think the book has downloadable flash cards, those are somewhat helpful as well. Anyhow I managed to get very close to 100% for the Final.  I kicked myself knowing that if I had bothered to read the book with any type of regularity in the first 12 weeks of the class, this should have been an easy A."

RateMyProfessor rating and BerkeleyTime grade average/ distribution doesn't line up?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/a8zxt5/ratemyprofessor_rating_and_berkeleytime_grade/,2018-12-23 16:21:44,"Hey all,

I apologize in advance if I sound clueless; just wanted to clarify a misunderstanding I have. So I was just looking through the grade distributions for the classes I am taking for Spring 2019, and I noticed that the ratings that people give on RateMyProfessor are a little strange. So, for instance, I'm planning on taking COGSCI 1 with Paul Li. His course difficulty is a 2.0 and quality of 4.9, yet his grade distribution for his section on BerkeleyTime shows an average of a B. Am I just clueless in terms of what I think should be considered difficult/ easy? Because I thought course difficulty of 2.0 meant like a section average of a B+ or an A- or better. Please school me as I only just finished my first semester at Cal.","A high RateMyProfessor rating usually speaks to the quality of the professor, rather than the difficulty of the course. For example, Josh Hug has an amazing rating (for a good reason) even though his version of 61B is more difficult to get an A in versus Paul Hilfinger's version of 61B.
Depends on how many people respond on RMP. Berkeleytime certainly has more data so I would definitely trust it more. And people who did well on the class will tend to leave better reviews w lower class difficulty scores. A B is average among classes in Berkeley, and anything higher is an ""easy"" class. 
I post on RMP when I have strong feelings about the professor (love or hate them) while BerkeleyTime gives you the general distribution. IMO I think RMP is more skewed. 

I took Paul Li’s Cog Sci 1 - lmk if you have any questions. His tests are pretty detailed and often test unnecessary information, but he gives you extra points at the end!
I recommend in addition to RMP that you chack out some Berkeley Facebook groups. ""Course Advice"" is pretty general but for my major there's specific ""Mathematics"" and ""Applied Mathematics"" pages where I can do a quick group search to find out more about specific professors and get in touch with people who took their classes. I'd imagine there is a similar group page for every major. I find it can be a little more up to date than RMP
Great professor, know him personally. I think you'd love the course. Take it!
I've had classes that were extremely difficult and demanded a lot of time and attention - I still was able to get a good grade, but it took a lot of work.  Also, aren't these ratings subjective anyways?

For me, I would subjectively rate difficulty based on effort in to grade out.
A B average class is an easy class...
Cool! Is it alright if I message you later on through the semester? I've no questions as of right now, but I'm sure I will have some burning ones soon.
I think it depends. For a lower div yeah the curve is pretty generous. For upper divs I find that most courses have a B average. 
Yeah ofc! I also have a huge review doc but it’s from a couple of years ago"
Anyone have the pdf for cogsci 1 or psych/mcb c61 textbooks?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eqpsgw/anyone_have_the_pdf_for_cogsci_1_or_psychmcb_c61/,2020-01-18 17:27:56,Can’t find them on libgen thanks.,"Presti wrote his own textbook for C61, so odds are you’ll probably have to buy a hard copy (can sell ya mine if you need one but they’re pretty easy to come by on free & for sale!). If you have cogsci 1 with Pageler I can send you the pdf! But if Paul Li is teaching I think it’s a different textbook :(
[deleted]
Paul Li wrote his own textbook as well.
Ok thank you! How much would you want for the cogsci textbook?
would you be willing to share it with me as well?
By cogsci textbook do you mean the pdf for cogsci 1? Or the MCB C61 textbook? (feel free to pm lol might be easier)"
There looks like there's a vigil going on outside Li Ka Shing right now.... what happened?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1srhpx/there_looks_like_theres_a_vigil_going_on_outside/,2013-12-12 17:38:39,"There are probably 50 people in a large circle, and they are all holding lit candles. They were silent when I walked by. Did someone die on campus? Did someone from their department pass away?","I'm not fully aware of the situation, but I believe an MCB grad student (or former MCB grad student, he may have just left the program) recently committed suicide.
I know a professor did pass away but I don't know if they are in that department or if the vigil is for them.
It's for Paul Walker
^ I can confirm. current MCB grad student

Lol Love how you have become the subreddit troll. 

Good, these PC warriors need it. 
He is actually the grandson of Walter Haas, he has donated millions to the University over the years. Paul Walker helped finance Li Ka Shing   "
