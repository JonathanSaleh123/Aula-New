EDUC W190A: Critical Studies in Education,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s6qgn2/educ_w190a_critical_studies_in_education/,2022-01-17 22:08:48,"Has anyone taken this class with Christyna Serrano?
I’m not doing a minor in education or anything but wanted to take the class because it looked interesting 

If you have taken the class, could you please share your experience with me? 
What was the time commitment like? Overall difficulty? What kind of grader is Prof Serrano? Is it important to have prior knowledge about education for the class, e.t.c— anything that might help me decide whether to take this course or not would be really appreciated!!

Thank you so much!!!","One of the best classes I’ve taken. Christyna is the most thoughtful, considerate, and BADASS professor I’ve had so far. When I missed an assignment, she was really understanding about my situation and granted me a reasonable extension.

I’m not minoring in education either, but I found the class to be really insightful. The 2 hour lecture is basically a 2 hour discussion though, so be prepared for lots of break out room activities! Sometimes it got to me especially since the class was at night and I was too tired to talk. But honestly you just get through it! And you’ll be proud of yourself for getting through it too. You learn a lot from your peers, the class assistants, and Christyna

Time commitment can vary. There’s weekly reading assignments with questions you have to answer. Those aren’t too bad and could take a good 1-3 hours. There are also two big projects, which will take I’d say about 1-3 hrs a week outside of class with your group. 

She’s a really lenient grader, just get your assignments done! 

Don’t worry about not having enough knowledge on education. You’ll learn a lot through readings, your own opinions, as well as from your peers and the staff.
Thank you so much for taking the time to share—I’ll definitely take the class— I’m sold!!"
"Fun, educational classes with no final exam?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/101pgho/fun_educational_classes_with_no_final_exam/,2023-01-02 14:14:13,"I really wanna take fun classes to fill out a schedule where I can learn things like history, art, philosophy or anything interesting, but I’m terrible at exams. 

Any fun classes with papers/projects but no final? I don’t really need this class for anything in particular so any interesting classes are welcome!","I am signed up for education 190 and have been told it is very easy and 95% of people get an A if you look on Berkeley time. Also I believe there isn’t any exams
not a class but a decal: Teacal is pretty low stress, it has an emphasis on how tea is cultivated and it's history as well as discussions about zen. The class only has three assignments where are 1 page reflections and there is no final exam. Really just show up and write the 1 pagers and you'll be okay.

oh yea and you get to drink tea every class.
PubPol 192 AC with Jayaraman
Slavic 39n with djorje popovic
Is the course educ 190? Cuz I don’t find it in enrollment center
decal counts towards ur gpa right?
It is under EDUC W190A and taught  Christyna Maria Serrano!
No. They are pass/no-pass
Also it is a online class taught on zoom and it says that there is field work on Sundays but that is just a place holder saying there is work outside the class but not necessary on Sundays. If you have any other questions or looking for more recommendations I'm happy to try and help as a sociology major her I have taken a lot of great and pretty easy classes
Awesome! Did you just email the professor directly for permission code? Any additional supplements needed?
One last thing there is two sections and only one is open to any student the other requires permission so it is still open to join lecture section 2!
I signed up a while ago so I didn’t need permission but if you just email the professor I’m sure she would let you in. I’ve heard she’s super nice and there are multiple open seats:)
That sounds great! Thanks for sharing >3
Anytime! I tried to ask for advice on here and didn't get a lot of replies. Another pretty easy class is social pysch with John Kaiser. One of my favorite professors and easy weekly writing assignments and one midterm and one final but they were multiple choice questions that were online and super easy and I am not a good test taker either so that's saying a lot that I am saying it was easy.
Sad to hear that:( I think you are referring to SOCIOL 150 but it’s already closed for waitlist. Probably wait till next semester🥹"
Pls help with me with choosing this class 😩,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/104ow56/pls_help_with_me_with_choosing_this_class/,2023-01-06 00:25:14,So I want to add this class but can’t figure out what the difference between LS C12 and LS C196 is. The class descriptions are the same so I’m confused. The only difference is the times. Am I just dumb lol,"I’d take the upper-division credit just cuz…

https://changemaker.berkeley.edu/berkeley-changemaker-courses

You can also take the UGBA version. They’re all the same course, just with different listings.
should prob just enroll in the 196 one for the upper division units

>! 🙊🙊🙊🙊👍👍👍👍👍🐻🐻🤮🐓🤨🤢😄😍😄😍😡🤥🥶🫠🥶🥶🫠🥺😦👾👺👺👺👺👺 !<
It’s the Berkeley changemaker class by Chelsea Gregory and Christyna Serrano
Ah ok I see the difference now. I am a junior so the upper division shouldn’t be too hard I guess lol.
Thank you!
Yeah they’re pretty much the same haha
Yes just did, thank you!"

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"
