Easiest Econ upper div to get an A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1acnjx6/easiest_econ_upper_div_to_get_an_a/,2024-01-27 15:00:14,"Title ^. Already took ECON 157, looking for another elective

Also in terms of lowest workload tyty","heard history of chinese econ was easy. psych of econ wasn’t too bad either.
Took Econ 140, never attended lectures got an A+. Did already have stat 135 though
151, also with Edwards
Look into EnvEcon classes that meet Econ elective requirements if you haven’t already.
All classes with RYAN EDWARDS! Thx me later
Climate Change Economics

 David Anthoff
Sorry, forgot to mention im an econ major, and i already took the 3 core upperdivs. Do u know any econ electives that are hella easy?
Oh lol Econ 148 also super easy A"
Good courses for understanding climate change?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/p1glne/good_courses_for_understanding_climate_change/,2021-08-09 19:53:52,"I am an engineering student interested in learning about (and working on) the technical challenges around climate change. Are there any courses or other resources for this?

Thanks!","EPS 7: Introduction to Climate Change with Professor David Romps! The class was really straightforward last fall. Lectures were pre-recorded and fun, and if you understand the homework, then you’re pretty much set for midterms/final. No discussion section, no prereqs, easy physical science breadth. The class was 319 seats last fall, but it’s gone up to 1000 this fall (maybe that says something about how great the class is)!
I took EEP 176: Climate Change Economics with Professor David Anthoff. It was a great class and Anthoff was great. It has no prereqs, although knowing some minor econ would help. It kind of overviews a lot of aspects of climate change, from the science of it, the policy, and ofc the economics. But if you aren't interested in econ maybe go for a more policy/philosophy oriented class.

Also, Anthoff has some rly cool work experience that he can share. He helped build one of the models used by the EPA to predict impacts of climate change. IIRC, I think he also has experience working with the IPCC but I could be wrong. 

Highly recommend it!
I haven't taken this class yet, but CivE 107 (""Climate Change Mitigation"") provides background for climate change causes and explores alternative energy systems –– wind, photovoltaics, biofuels, carbon capture, etc.
If you want to get into climate change cognition, Michael Ranney at the Grad School of Education is a lovely human and does really cool research! I don’t know if he’s planning to teach any undergrad classes, but you could always shoot him an email and meet for a chat.

ETA: Prof. Ranney is teaching a grad course titled Climate Change Cognition in Fall 2021 -- if interested, I would suggest writing to him to see if it would be appropriate for undergrads. I would bet that one of the requirements is a seminar-length paper, in addition to heavy reading (but probably not a ton of hw throughout the semester...since it's assumed you would be working on research and writing throughout the course): https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2021-fall-educ-223b-009-lec-009
How technical of a class are you looking for? 

EPS C181 might be a good class for you. 
Atmospheric Dynamics - a deductive approach to the properties and behavior of the Earth's atmosphere based on the laws of physics and fluid dynamics."
