PS, I don‚Äôt really care too much about the Berkeley logo change. Just Lebron from your comment
[deleted]
> It‚Äôs not like lebron reminds people every time he introduces himself or walks onto the field

Sure that‚Äôs true, he doesn‚Äôt do that all the time he introduces himself or walks on the court.

But as someone that follows Lebron closely, he frequently hints himself as the goat or king or even does his ‚Äúcrown‚Äù celebration in games. His instagram handle is literally ‚Äúkingjames‚Äù btw. And I like Lebron btw
LeBron can make a case. To perform at his current level at his age. All time points leader, nvm. It's fashionable to crap on LeBron, and I am not a fan boy, but LeBron doesn't go around saying he is the GOAT, but his career has been great. King James is an appropriate name and his career is appropriate for that moniker.

If Anthony Edwards had a nickname of King Anthony... I hope you get my point."
Cheapest printing shop around campus (B&W copies)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ccurqw/cheapest_printing_shop_around_campus_bw_copies/,2019-07-13 14:30:57,"Hi all,

I have to make a ton of B&W copies and unfortunately as non-EECS/Haas, I don't get free printing, and the OCF is closed. 

Does anyone know the cheapest printing shop for regular B&W copies? If I can save even 1-2 cents per page over campus printing it's worth it.","ULPT: You don't have to be an EECS major to get printing. You just have to be enrolled in an EECS class. However, if you drop, they're usually too lazy to take away your acct/keycard access.

&#x200B;

Since 61A always expands to capacity (it's basically an uncapped enrollment class), you could enroll in 61A during adjustment and drop the 2nd week of the semester and keep your class account for printing. Do this every semester from now on, and you'll have free printing the rest of college.
Aha, yeah I took 61A last semester (to see if I'd be interested in minoring 
‚Äì I'm not), and the first thing I checked was if I still had the free printing. And they did revoke my access. Or at least I can't logon to the Instructional WebAcct site, maybe I'll try the computers at the lab. 

Although the second part of your comment is very interesting... I might try that out. I already pay OOS, free printing is the least I can scam out of the university. Thanks.
The list clears every semester. You have to be continually enrolled in a CS class because they clear account privileges at the end of every semester (including summer session). This won't work for summer because you'll get charged a fee for the extra class.

&#x200B;

If you've already taken 61a, this is a little harder because I think all the other EECS classes might have restrictions. However, since EECS doesn't enforce prereqs, the strat will work for any EECS class that is still open and you can get into."
Econ Course reccomendations? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d2ao0f/econ_course_reccomendations/,2024-05-27 21:06:06,"looking for some class recommendations to take. I will be attending UCB this fall as a transfer student in economics. I've already taken micro and macro at my CC equivalent to Econ 1, as well as multivariable, linear algebra, and diff equations. Ik there's a math-heavy route which is what I want to do so I'm just looking for some advice from ppl who have taken these classes to kinda help me out. I def have to take stats my first semester, along with either econ 101 A/B. Should I take 101 A or B first? does it even matter? can I take both? what's the average course/unit load for econ? is 100B rly hard as ppl make it to be? should i rather take UGBA 101B? What electives would be useful for someone trying to break into consulting/IB? 

Also, I've seen a lot of hype about data sci minor w econ major. Do u guys think it's possible to finish the minor in two yrs without filling any pre-reqs? I only have my math pre-reqs done. Is it even worth minoring in it? 

Please and thank you!","Take Econ 100A/B instead. The sequence for A or B doesn‚Äôt matter. Take 140 with Ryan Edwards. Take any Econ electives with Ryan Edwards. His lectures are all very chill.  Easiest econ elective out there is Climate Change Economics. 100B is not that hard tbh. Everyone in econ is doing a data science minor right now. Take Data 8 in your first or second semester. Hope this helps. Consulting and IB doesn‚Äôt care about what classes you take. You only need basic math, or maybe the  financial economics class to learn some basic financial stuff. IB and Consulting recruitment are all about networking, networking and networking. Applying and reach out to recruiters as early as possible. You may apply for consulting clubs on campus. If you get in, that‚Äôs great. If you‚Äôre rejected, it‚Äôs still okay.
If you‚Äôre an intended Econ major, you should be automatically enrolled in either 100A or 100B your first semester. I was put into Econ 100B my first semester. It was tough, but I‚Äôm also not great at math, so if you love math, it might be easier for you. I loved taking both Environmental Econ and International Environmental Econ. Labor Econ with Ryan Edwards was super chill. I liked Econ 191, but I would recommend taking that after taking econometrics, and take it if you want to do an Econ senior honors thesis. It teaches you how to write research papers. I hated hated hated natural resource Econ. It was more math and model heavy, so you might like it. I regret that class. I have taken more of the environmental Econ courses, but my second major is Society & Environment, so my interests lean more that way. I‚Äôm able to double major as a transfer, so a DS minor might be doable for you. It depends on how many prerequisites you need to do. I think for a minor, one upper division course can overlap between that and your major (for two majors, two upper division courses can overlap). I would map it all out and see what your schedule would have to look like every semester to get that done. It‚Äôs recommended you only take three upper division courses and one or two one unit electives (like that transfer transition course) your first semester, since it‚Äôs an adjustment your first semester at Cal. For Econ majors, that‚Äôs usually Econ 100A or 100B, Stat 20, and your American Cultures requirement. Past that, the usual course load is four classes, or 16 units, plus any electives you want (DeCals, PE courses, etc). I have no clue about consulting stuff. I hear it can be hard to get into the clubs, especially as a transfer. I hope this helps!
Lol people still think econ courses actually teach you anything.
At the moment for Fall, 100A and 140 are completely full, can‚Äôt even waitlist. 100B only has a couple of spots left.
thank you!
god bless üôè . tysm
the department automatically enrolls the transfer major either into 100A or 100B so I think that's why all the spots are gone.
Ah ok, interesting‚Ä¶I would think students should have a choice (since there is a choice), so not sure why they do this."
how to stop hating cs70?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1aevvc6/how_to_stop_hating_cs70/,2024-01-30 10:45:07,"for reference i LOVED 61a/b. like i LOVE coding so much it surprised me, and in that context, i actually like the math behind it i think it‚Äôs really fascinating how algorithms work. but.. in 70, i just can‚Äôt deal with the ambiguity of things. like i can‚Äôt deal w the fact that who knows if my proof will good enough, and how can i just pull out these mathematical magic tricks out of my hat? it just feels really really biased toward ppl who have previous experience, they don‚Äôt really give you any resources to succeed and they slap the ‚Äúintuition‚Äù label onto it so you can‚Äôt argue it. what tf do i do ?","To be clear: you absolutely don‚Äôt need to have prior experience to do well on this class (yeah they‚Äôll have an advantage but that‚Äôs the case for any class).

As for the rest of your grievances, it seems like you‚Äôre struggling with the idea of proofs. Maybe that‚Äôs because you just don‚Äôt like them (in which case good news because cs majors don‚Äôt need to do them after 70), but maybe it‚Äôs also because it‚Äôs new to you, and you don‚Äôt understand the process. This class is an intro to proofs after all.¬†

When it comes to ‚Äúknowing if a proof is good enough‚Äù, that‚Äôs part experience with writing them (and knowing what‚Äôs ok to just handwave or not, when you‚Äôre taking cs70 as a precaution try not to handwave anything), and part making sure that you‚Äôve actually proved what you set out to do (like covering every case instead of a specific case). All that‚Äôs up to experience with writing and reading proofs (hence the ‚Äúmathematical intuition‚Äù so talked about), so I‚Äôd recommend reading the hw solutions.

Ultimately, you may not end up liking the class if you don‚Äôt like proofs, but the topics are legitimately interesting so I hope you‚Äôll at least be able to appreciate that after leaving the class.
Perhaps the reason (this is really just a guess) you loved 61A/61B perhaps because coding algorithms is a very intuitive process. You don't just code a recursive algorithm out of nowhere, you have to think about the thought process behind previous algorithms you've learned.

In this sense, you can think of a proof as kind of like thinking ""does my code work?"" Obviously you don't have test cases to check if your code works, but walking through every single logical step of Dijkstra's algorithm is almost exactly the same as the proof of correctness for Dijkstra's algorithm. Induction proofs of graph algorithms, tree algorithms, and even that 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n thing follow the same vein as just coding it yourself.

As a more concrete example, one can follow the steps to prove every number can be written in binary. The induction proof of this is the literal algorithm to represent a decimal number to a binary number. You'll find that many proofs in CS are really just inductive proofs. A good example is backpropagation, a crazy important algorithm in machine learning, and relies on induction.

It is indeed very biased toward people who have had previous experience, as is CS61A. People have had that previous experience and built that intuitive toolbox to use those magic tricks. Like how can people just use dynamic programming out of nowhere? That's what I was thinking in CS170 because I was never exposed to it before.

My advice? Approach CS70 you approached CS61A and CS61B. How did you understand those algorithms, how did you understand recursion? When you learn something new, or a cool shortcut, make sure it makes sense to you, and put it in your toolbox so you can use it later. Intuition really is key, because you need that intuition to be able to apply to new problems. Sure one can ""know"" the formula to Chinese Remainder Theorem, but the intuition to every single step of CRT is important. Like where did every single coefficient come from, why are we in this modspace, etc. In that vein, that intuition will really help you with further topics like polynomials and lagrange interpolation, and teaches you very valuable lessons in algorithm constructions and proof by construction.

In the end though, you might still hate CS70 and that's okay. Hopefully this might help a bit.
Just get to probability, it was a lot better imo
Understand the problems first and foremost
You don't
In all honesty I hated CS70, did not do well in CS70 and did not feel like I learned that much from CS70. The good news is that the upper div CS classes are great and basically have zero overlap with 70 (even math-y upper divs).

My advice is grit your teeth through it and know that it gets better. If you want actual advice, I recommend going to more office hours. It gets more manageable once you get more in tune with the pace and style of the class
If you‚Äôre good at it you‚Äôll stop hating it
![gif](giphy|U6kJvHfPIiA7RnabEU|downsized)
People who have competition math experience from high school often do extremely well in CS70 because the class draws on a lot of the ideas needed to do well in math competitions (number theory, combinatorics, probability). This is somewhat ""unfair"" given that it's a curved class, but I also think it suggests that doing well in 70 is in fact a learnable skill, and the people who are good at it are good because they have that particular skill. 

How do you learn that skill? Well, you do lots of problems. I did some math competitions in high school, and so by the time we got to the modular arithmetic section I already knew what modular arithmetic was, was familiar with a few of the theorems, and had lots of practice doing modular arithmetic problems. One resource I might recommend is https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus, set it to ""insanely hard"" difficulty and just do a bunch of problems. I think 70 doesn't give people enough practice problems, and I think they are the best way to learn how to do well in the class.
Maybe play with some proof assistants like Lean? That way, it's more like coding and you can verify whether your proof is complete.
Rao wrote this
Lol I didn‚Äôt cite any research papers in my comment, I can‚Äôt be Rao.
fine ur Rao's cousin.

I wanna ask tho wdym by ""do well in the class""? I personally didn't have comp math experience or any other shit like that up my sleeve going into 70 and i studied my ass off and and rlly grinded the notes and everything and frankly put in the most effort I possibly couldve, and I only got a B+

im not salty or anything, I feel like I learned a ton from the class and it definitely improved me as a student (i did better in 70 than 61a lol), and i still declared but I don't think u can rlly do well in the class without previous experience. 

Like i can't imagine what else someone like me couldve done to improve (and i did everything the prof mentioned in the first lecture).
Ok after rereading my comment I really do sound like Rao lol.

I had to think about your second paragraph for a while, and here's my best answer:

In a class of ~700 students, you'll have probably ~20-30 students who have significant experience with the course material. Since the class is curved, most of the people getting A's, A-'s, and B+'s must have little to no prior experience, and so it's completely possible for you to do well.

That being said, the class is curved, so it's not like I can give a specific letter grade that's a ""good"" grade. Ultimately, it's all about what grade you're hoping to get from the class, and also just all the material that you learn in the class.
I rlly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs 20-30 students. Probs way more, I think a lot of kids have not necessarily comp math experience but just some kind of rigorous math training from a younger age. 

I did get everything (and more) from the class. Like tbh it was probs the most influential class I‚Äôve taken here. And I feel like I improved really hard in that class. But either way, there‚Äôs no reason for the prof to be like ‚Äúyou can do well without prior expericne‚Äù cuz that‚Äôs not tru. U can do ok, like I did ok, but I just don‚Äôt think u can get A- and above unless you had some experience before.
 
And I think it‚Äôs hard to define prior experience. First off like every other kid I know did comp math, and comp math isn‚Äôt the only experience, maybe someone just had other types of training that are different form the average high schooler. 

And btw this isn‚Äôt just math experience. It‚Äôs also study habits/discipline. I actually know so many ppl that did wayyyyy better than me in 61a/61b with doing very little studying and then they COMPLETELY tanked 70 and ended up not declaring despite being very capable of doing well. I think ppl get psyched out by 70 and it‚Äôs material. 
I actually think for this reason I don‚Äôt think 70 should be a prerequisite for cs. Bc it doesn‚Äôt make sense for someone like me who was lost in 61a/b and somehow did better in 70 to get in over someone who actually knows what they‚Äôre doing in 61a/b which are actual coding classes but got psyched out by 70 to not get in. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.
But CS isn't purely about coding. In fact, coding should not even be the main focus of a CS degree. Coding is a tool to implement other ideas. 70 is critical for many of the core ideas of CS, and the mathematical training in 70 is important since CS is a field of applied mathematics.
I agree, but it just seems like it‚Äôs applied differently somehow. Cuz Ik ppl who would do really well In projects and stuff for 61a/b but almost gave up on 70. This means 70 is another application of critical thinking somehow.
Yes. 70 is a totally different kind of class than 61ab and it involves a different approach that some may have to adapt or get used to. The 70 approach is just as important for CS however. 

61ab are more concrete and the projects are solving many simple problems with success mostly driven by the effort one puts in. 70 is more abstract and requires logical arguments and induction/ deduction whereas 61ab can be done just by manipulating concrete objects."
Spring 24 schedule sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16r4t5p/spring_24_schedule_sucks/,2023-09-24 11:24:49,"Hi! I‚Äôm a first-year intended econ major. Prior to the sp24 sched release, I planned on taking r1a, econ 2, and math 16b. I checked the catalog today and it sucks ass (for me that is).

First off, econ 2 is most likely going to be a fking 8am class. I currently have a 9am class and I alr hate waking up at 7:30am, so I‚Äôm prolly gonna die taking a class at 8am.

Secondly, 16b is w/ talaska. I saw a ton of doodoo ratings in her rate my prof page and that concerns me.

Im thinking of taking Econ 1 w/ campbell, stat 20 in sp24, and saving 16b for fall 24. Another route for the math stuff was going from 16a to 1b cuz Paulin is going to teach 1b, but idk abt that cuz I‚Äôm a pretty slow learner in math.

What do u guys think? Is it worth suffering thru an 8am class b/c Econ 2 is recommended for Econ maj? Is it worth taking a semester break from the math 16 series? 1b instead of 16b?

I know the catalog just released today and changes can be made, but now I feel like my spring semester will be dogwater. Thanks for listening to my problems lol. I‚Äôll definitely talk this out w/ my advisor : )


Edit: my only concern now is 16b w/ talaska : (","its not all up yet, theres literally 0 cs classes showing up for me right now. Give it some time, I'm sure more options will show up soon. The only class that I've found so far that I need, is MCB 100B, everything else I need just doesn't exist on there yet. Theres no linear algebra classes, barely any math classes in general as well.

Edit: Just checked and theres a bunch more that showed up that weren't there this morning.
anyone else not able to see spring 2024 as an option on the course catalog?
hey, im taking econ 100b rn and its an 8am. also like u, i thought i would never take an 8am. but its not that bad. u get used to sleeping a little bit earlier the day before and you utilize all your day. just try it out, u always have the early drop.

as a side note, econ 2 was amazing in giving me a solid foundation of econ. i wouldnt take econ 1 over it if u really want to learn.
where‚Äôs the link the see the courses?
You can just sleep an hour earlier and make the 8am.
Where do yall see the catalog? Is it on Berkeley time rn?
does anyone know if paulin will teach 56 again?
where can i find the courses :(
They said the cs classes will be up on 9/30
The course catalog is on the cal central enrollment site. They prolly forgot to put it on the classes website lol
Tysm for ur input! Yea, I‚Äôll stick to Econ 2 for now : )
True true. The more I think abt it, the 8am class shouldn‚Äôt be so bad if I‚Äôm on top of my sleep sched. Thx

I am also applied math + CS. I took Math 55 + Stat 134 and genuinely a great pace, I got an A in both. One thing I would say is to be cautious of using 55 and 70 interchangeably as prerequisites when registering for classes, because I made the mistake of taking EECS 126 having only taken 55 and not Stat 134 yet, and I struggled harder than I should have. Another note is that a lot of the applied math concentrations take Stat 134 anyways so you will cover the whole spectrum regardless of what you take!

I've learnt so much from both professors and found so much unexpected joy in working on each lab and project.bits not an easy A by any means, but if you're priority is learning and preparing yourself for learning how to do real word genomic analysis, then I highly recommend the class. The GSIs chosen for the class are also super passionate about teaching and helping you, ut feels like you always have support when youre struggling!
In the same boat as you. It seems interesting, but hard? Also, as an IB major it knocks out both a Group A and lab requirement so that's why it's enticing to take.
hey! would you mind elaborating on your experience in the class? I'm an MCB major, but I've taken some CS lower divs and data 8 and wanna dip my toes into bioinformatics (haven't had any coding experience in a biological setting tho). What kind of skills does the class teach? is it something that I could use in my research lab, for instance? what is genomics analysis? do you guys use a particular language (eg. Python)? I'm super interested in this class but unsure what to expect, so any help would be appreciated!
same!!! I have only these two recs left so I'm thinking about taking this course too for that reason aha!
I don't know if I should bite the bullet and take it or be more strategic and take two other courses. The problem is that the other lab courses don't seem enticing enough?
yeah.... the other lab courses are so random and not the best... I think I might take this class bc I feel like it'd be super useful for a career in science as opposed to the other labs which are pretty niche like anatomy, physio, or field labs. Honestly the fact this class is group A and Lab is soooooo enticing so I might just bite the bullet! LOL. Down to study w you if you decide to take it :D
How was the class?
Yeah, I echo whatever you said. My friend was in IB 131L and it was such a nightmare that she ended up dropping the course later in the semester. And even the somewhat bearable ones have a 10 page research paper or something or require special enrollment or something. With that said, I think I'm going to take it and if you are too, down to study as well.
Hey, so did you end up enrolling in the course?"

Possible rescind?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v1for9/possible_rescind/,2022-05-30 19:10:20,"Throwaway because I'm a bit ashamed I have to post this in the first place. Just some quick context: I've been accepted to EECS as a freshman but have dealt with some major personal family issues that have tanked my grades (from \~4.8 W cumulative) this semester. Here's what my grades look like so far (please excuse my strange senior schedule):

History: A (confirmed)

Student Success Class: A (confirmed)

Calculus II: A or B (dual enrollment)

Physics Mechanics: C or D (dual)

English B Honors: B or C (dual)

Environmental Science: B or C (dual)

I'm honestly terrified since I'm leaning towards doing worse on the unconfirmed classes rather than better (especially for Environmental Science and English) and Berkeley was the only university that I was accepted to and my top choice (I only applied to UCs). I'm working hard towards fixing these grades, but worst-case scenario (eg., two As, 1 B, 3 Cs or 2 Cs 1 D), would I have a chance at not being rescinded? I'm willing to explain my situation to the university and retake any and all of these classes for a better grade over the summer or the coming terms.","The main thing you need to do is to make sure you have to do whatever you can to avoid the D. If you‚Äôre slightly under 3.0 unweighted for the semester and that‚Äôs never happened before, it‚Äôs probably fine.
You won‚Äôt know unless you talk to admissions
The biggest mistake students make is waiting to tell admissions. Update them as soon as possible and inform them of the situation. I think that part of it is that delaying telling admissions reflects poorly on the student‚Äôs character. At the end of a day, it is a person that is behind the computer that may feel annoyed they weren‚Äôt in the loop.
Make sure you don't get the D. And try your hardest just to make one of those C's a B, even a B-. But yeah, talk to admissions.
Don‚Äôt think they care about dual enrollment since it‚Äôs not technically your hs courses.
Thanks! I don't think I'll be getting a D at this point (unless physics seriously decides to screw me over for finals), so that's a massive weight off my shoulders. Next goal: get back to my solid 3.0 UW!
Thank you! I notified admissions soon after posting. Fingers crossed all goes smooth!
Likely won't get a D, fortunately! I contacted admissions already, so I'll just see what I can do about my other grades. I'll power across this finish line as hard as I can!
I'm just a tad concerned since dual enrollment classes make up the vast majority of my high school transcript. If this is the case, then that'd be a huge relief!
Does it get reported on your hs transcript? I‚Äôm guessing you will send your cc transcript but I think you just need to pass for things to transfer. I don‚Äôt think it would hurt to reach out and ask and explain."

\-history 178 holocaust w/ alexis herr (UPPERDIV)

\-psych 136 human sexuality","Highly recc anthro 2ac as someone taking it now. The course material can be interesting for some but Prof Lowman really does his best to ensure that students are doing well (aka open note quizzes, multiple attempts on said quizzes) and even if you're not interested in Archaeology he has a lot of fun anecdotes for you to engage with! Its also super light and easy on grading :D
Anthro with lowman is literally a free A.  Also pretty interesting imo
Anthro 2AC. Literally the easiest class I've taken here at Cal. Prof. Lowman is also a 10/10 professor.
Anthro 2AC
Psych 136 is fun. It can be quite easy if you've learned biology, or have had some scientific knowledge about biological sex/gender/sexuality in general. you have to finish reading a whole ass book, which can be a lot if everything is new. but since you are a bio major, and the exam is open note, just going through the book once is fine. plus attending all the discussions could get you an A.
oh i actually meant that im an intended bio major, plus I'm really bad at reading. is it like a whole textbook or just book? would u still recommend for people who cant read really well?
It is a whole textbook. But its language is very simple. Personally i am bad at reading too. English is my second language. But I do find it very easy to read. The hard part for you might be some of the biology things, such as how the hormone cycle works for women's period. Personally I feel that that is the most difficult thing."

I don't know anything about P/NP. If you have B- before finals then I have bad news for you. It's hard to get more than C+. I pulled B after getting D on Final.
P/NP is fine unless it is a class that applies to your chosen field. I did P/NP for Data 8 during the '20 covid lockdown as a psych major/premed. If I was a CS major, that probably would have been a bad decision.

I‚Äôll repeat here what I said in a previous thread‚Äôs comments:

I think it's important to contextualize why it is not ok for an ASUC senator/campus leader to be projecting things like this on social media. If I was an ASUC rep working with/under Ms. Sharp and I read these tweets, I would constantly be questioning whether she would be willing to collaborate with me or properly hear me out simply because I'm white. I imagine folks from other backgrounds she has expressed certain feelings about could feel similarly.

Do I think she should be allowed as a private individual to say these things? Absolutely, and I don't deign to say that her anger isn't unjustified. However, it's a core responsibility of all elected officials to ensure they don't project anything that could be construed as racial bias being institutionalized in ""public"" offices.","Nobody is saying she can‚Äôt say racist epithets such as ‚Äúwhitino,‚Äù but we have just as much a right to call her out as a student representative than she does the freedom to say those things.
We expect a certain degree of professionalism from elected members. What happened to this basic standard?
absolutely shameful and disgraceful.
Isn‚Äôt she an RA? Someone should check on her kids as it doesn‚Äôt seem like she would put an ounce of support to anyone who does not fit her ideologies
The first amendment has always protected bigots like herself. I wish she saw the hypocrisy of being a counter-racist. Hiding behind twitter's walls like the people Berkeley has expelled before.
Keep that same energy, Sharp. 

I said what I said too: I'm coming for your job.

Lol this is just begining, you are fixing to be a real life meme.

Forget about racism - do you think it‚Äôs OK for a sitting ASUC senator to express her hatred for a group of people based on immutable characteristics?

Trolling or do you really believe this.
Sounds like something a racist or a troll would say. Or a racist troll.

English transfer applicant looking for some insight,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tmgqc1/english_transfer_applicant_looking_for_some/,2022-03-24 08:22:56,"Hi,

I'm currently at a CCC awaiting an admission decision and have been stressing heavily. I was wondering if anyone here could share some insight on their application process or history prior to getting into Berkeley.

I ended up with a 3.57 after having dealt with some pretty severe mental health struggles early in my college career. I dropped in and out a few times about 6 years ago with 3 B‚Äôs and 2 C‚Äôs and a semester of W‚Äôs that I have since gotten Academic Renewal for. I sought help and returned to school in fall of 2020 and have maintained a 3.93 ever since with 12 A‚Äôs and 1 B. I am involved in community service, I write for my school's newsletter, and work a part time job. I fear that my mistakes in the past may end up hurting my chances of getting in. I feel like I wrote really good essays and explained my situation well, but I tend to be rather pessimistic about getting in to such a good school. Has anyone else had a similar story or any insight into a situation like this?

Edit: Clarified grades.

Edit 2: I got accepted! Thanks for all the kind words and advice back then!","Current transfer student, here. I think, generally speaking, upward trends are all they care about. If you put your story out there, wrote great PIQ‚Äôs and seem to consistently improve- you definitely have a chance! 

I had a bunch of W‚Äôs, had dropped in and out of school, and walked away with around 3.5, all things considered. 

It‚Äôs hard to know anything for sure but I‚Äôd definitely not count yourself out- especially for transfers, berk takes into consideration your whole story and passions and if they think you‚Äôd succeed here. 

Good luck! Deep breaths. No matter what happens it sounds like you‚Äôre on a great path, doing the damn thing and have nothing but exciting moves to make in your future.
lol you are worried about the grade you got 6 years ago? 

You will be fine. It's a long time ago and admission officers know that things happen and they will consider what you learned from the experience rather than just looking at the cumulative gpa. I don't think your grade 6 years ago will be considered at all. Actually, if you have described the experience and what you learned from it, the experience could work as an advantage for you. Also, you have a bunch of extracurricular activities related to your major. Plus English is not as impacted as cs or Haas. Don't worry too much. I think you will get in. (Though I cannot say for certain because technically no one is guaranteed admission but still I think you have a very high chance of getting in to Berkeley)

If I were you, I would be worried about finding the house near the school!
I would genuinely be surprised if you didn't get in considering your comeback story & upward trend. If you explained your circumstances in the past, I don't see any reason to worry at all. Good luck!
current transfer- got a 3.4 or 3.5 and got mostly b‚Äôs and b-‚Äòs. I think ur fine
Explain your grade situation after adding your transcript in additional comment section.
Then write a PIQ on your biggest challenge on your mental health and explain how you made a comeback. That's what they want hear.
Then I am sure you will get in to Cal.
Edit: I did exactly the same and got in to Cal.
Hey I applied this year with similar stats.  Let me know how it goes for you. Waiting 2 more weeks for a decision seems like such a long time
Thank you so much! I really appreciate your response. It‚Äôs really reassuring to know there are/were others in a similar situation.
Thanks for your response! Yeah, I think I did a good job of explaining my situation and demonstrating how I‚Äôve grown since then. It‚Äôs hard not to just look at the average gpa and assume I‚Äôm toast.
hey just updating you! got accepted today! how‚Äôd you fare?

Wanna go for Quantum Engineering/Quantum Information Sciences as a field of research. I've done three different research lab assistantships in Computer Systems Organizaiton, Machine Learning for Geospatial Analysis, and Computational Bioengineering. The part that worries me is I have a 3.91 GPA, but with a bunch of Pass grades, a couple Fail grades in some core coursework, and a semester of just W's because I got burnt out from COVID and underwent a medical emergency. I was barely able to declare CS. But this past spring I started caring about academics more, took 5 UD classes, got 4 A's in CS classes, a L&S breadth, and a A- in Quantum Mechanics Pt B. That's my first upward trend after a crappy performing two years at Berkeley, but I feel like there's no hope for me to pursue a PhD after a bunch of Pass, Fail grades plus a semester of 5 W's.","Depending on the school and how you word your essays, you might still have a chance. Make sure to emphasize your successes and how they came after some failures. It shows that you can recover from struggles, which can say a lot about you.
I concur with kwontom, going to have to really emphasize that in your essays. A tier schools might be hard, A-/B tier schools shouldn't have a problem. If you're interested in the more device/implementation side of things it might be worth reaching out to our own Prof. Alp Sipahigil, since he's still growing his quantum lab
Make sure your letter writers know about your circumstances. Those letters saying ""Look, Powertokatelyn is great. They have a few W's b/c Covid, but it's not a reflection on their abilities; I've worked with them on research and they're super strong."" is going to be have way more pull with grad school admissions committees than anything you can say in your own essays.
What kind of schools are A- tier?
I guess that was a shitty description, and I kinda missed my point. my b. I guess I was thinking A- == ""schools just outside the top \~5/10"" for your general field (EE, Physics, Chem, etc). Sadly a lot of the ""A tier"" schools value stuff like GPA/transcripts, schools beyond that it's weighted less heavily. OP's gpa is really not bad though, Ws might raise eyebrows. Given that grad school really comes down to your research area/advisor, if you can find a professor(s) doing research you find really interesting (in OP's case, maybe some quantum information theory or quantum computing), it won't matter much that it's not an ""A tier"" school. couple of examples I recall from when i applied for EE PhD- UCSB had some of the best profs in III-V materials device research, University of Florida on numerical device simulation, etc... even though these are not considered  ""elite schools"" for EE, would've been a swell time"

Anyways, I wanted to just vent about my roommate who I‚Äôll call L because, well, he‚Äôs a walking L.

Next week, I‚Äôm planning on moving into this apartment to take summer classes but now I‚Äôm having second thoughts because of my epiphany.

So, yesterday, we agreed to meet up to eat at this restaurant as an icebreaker to get to know each other so that it wouldn‚Äôt feel like I was rooming with a complete stranger(and vice versa).

We made small talk and he seemed pretty cordial and his humor resonated with me but there were some yellow flags that quickly became apparent‚Ä¶

1.) His hair wasn‚Äôt disheveled and he smelled of soap, which made me nauseous. This means that he sh*wers regularly ü§Æ.

2.) His clothes smelled like detergent ü´†. That means he w*shes them. üò≠

Nonetheless, I was thinking with the wrong head(I will admit he was kinda hot üò≥) so I let the yellow flags slide and continued to interact with L.

So then, the dinner continued and I continued to fall more and more head over heels until disaster struck‚Ä¶

You see, the topic of majors came up and he told me that he was a philosophy major üíÄüíÄüíÄ. Without a modicum of shame or embarrassment ü§¶. Like, bro rly said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm studying philosophy ü§ìü§ìü§ì‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£. Like, bruh, how are you gonna make moolah? By sitting on your porch, gazing off into the distance and thinking intently while twiddling your thumbs? ü§£ü§£ü§£ By laying on your back in some pasture and gazing at the stars while chewing some grass ???üòÇüòÇü§£ For 15 awkward seconds, I waited for the punchline and then I realized that he was serious ü§£üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠.

As soon as I did, I spat the water I was drinking all over him and loudly sharted from sheer laughterü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£, and I ran back to my place from a  mixture of both mortification and repulsion. ü•≤

I then spent the next 2 hours dry heaving thinking about all the soap and detergent molecules from him that I inhaled. I‚Äôm now contemplating whether I should just drop those summer classes and now stay at that apartment over the summer because I doubt I have the strength to face him ü´†.

Nice satire, but imo this whole stem vs non-stem thing is overblown. Stem majors who are interested in academia like myself are in the same boat as humanities majors. It sucks seeing all these posts and relating to none of it, because on one hand you're a villainous stem major but on the other hand you're doing it because it's interesting, learning is fun, and classes are super easy (because you personally are extremely good at techs), so your reasons for doing so are more similar to a humanities major.

Edit: Why the downvotes? I consider this a new perspective and critical discussion point. There's 1000s of posts on stem vs non stem but none about how both can be done solely because of a love of learning, not prestige seeking.
LMAOOOOO I KNOW THE STEM BROS SCREAMING AND CRYING

I get it, it's just that I never hear my perspective voiced anywhere which makes me feel invisible
Okay, that's fair and sorry about your experiences. But your comment also reaffirms a misconception I feel is prevalent. I'm in CS and most people I talk to in the same major genuinely love the subject, myself included. I love it so much I might go into academia for it, which doesn't pay well, but I'll do it solely because I love learning and researching. But most people don't think we exist even though I know a lot of people like me. 

In my eyes both stem and humanities are academic subjects which seek to gain greater understanding of the universe and that's inherently virtuous. It sucks that there's dickheads shitting on other people though."

I have the option to make this semester's course load light. Should I take it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l078zu/i_have_the_option_to_make_this_semesters_course/,2021-01-18 15:58:16,"I'm taking 2 time-consuming techs. I'm too far down the waitlist for the 3rd class I wanted to take. I was on the waitlist for my backup through Phase I and II, realized too late that I wasn't moving up the waitlist, and so I'm now also waitlisted on my backup to my backup, but it doesn't seem likely that I'll get in. I have three backups to my backup to my backup: one of them is already full w/ a small waitlist, one is an integrative biology class that seems interesting but may also be time-consuming based on the B/B- curve, and the last is Math 110 w/ Professor Holtz, whom I've heard is a difficult professor. 

I'm on track for graduation, and I don't really need to take a 3rd class since I have URAP units and a seminar to meet minimum unit requirements. On one hand, my grades last semester were mediocre, and I'm feeling a little burned out, so the lighter course load could give me a semi-break. On the other hand, I feel like I'm just making excuses and that I'll regret wasting space in my schedule this semester. I also had plans to go to grad school eventually, so I feel like taking the easy way screams ""quitter."" Any advice would be appreciated.","Do you need the extra courses to graduate or make a noticeable difference for grad school? Is it out of interest? If those are no, then there's no point in spending more time in something you don't want to do. 

Recognize that seeing yourself as a ""quitter"" is a negative byproduct of always pushing yourself. Time is something you can't get back, explore something you haven't been able to before and consider that your ""class"" maybe.
Please take things easy on yourself, you deserve it. Don't worry, you aren't a ""quitter"" - you're just setting yourself up for better success in the long run this way.
you could take a light breadth instead!
Yes
Nope, I'm definitely on track to graduate. The classes I originally wanted to take were both for interest and for preparation for my desired field in grad school. Due to enrollment issues, I've been scrambling for replacements that I wasn't really planning to take. To be honest, I did have things that I wanted to learn on my own during the summer, but Summer Sessions and then my Fall schedule made it difficult. Thank you for the new perspective
Thank you for the kind words and encouragement!
Thank you for the advice! I'll consider it, but I don't want to end up with something that would bore me.

How can you tell that he‚Äôs 250 lb just by looking at him‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôm the guy who called 911, for all those asking about race he was white, dude came in and tried to steal a drink when he was confronted by an employee who he started to hit. He stopped, attempted to break the window by kicking it and then fled, kicking the employee through the door. the employee was ok thankfully

Yeah I understand not including the race of the perpetrator for news or journalist headlines. 

But this is meant to be a message to ask the public to watch our and/or help identify the subject. Race is critical for that. 

Besides, racists are going to racist whether these police reports reveal the perpetrator's race or not. If its a white guy, then let the public know to watch out for a white guy.
If you see the race information been left out, you can 99.9% sure it's.....um. yea

CS 61A Final Grading Curves,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7kmw0e/cs_61a_final_grading_curves/,2017-12-18 09:59:48,"I'm literally 5 points away from an A- (with EC added). Is there any way I'll be bumped up to an A-? I heard this was done in the past, but this semester, 5 points were moved from finals to labs, so I heard it would not happen. What are the chances the grade buckets will be dropped by a little? 

Also, is 61B any easier in terms of the relationship b/w effort and grades? I feel like I put my absolute best into this class, spent so much time preparing weeks in advance for the exams, yet don't do that great. :( ","In the same boat, to the tee. It really sucks but if we work hard we can still make the cap :)
I feel you, all points considered I'm also exactly 5 points off from an A- :(
Well, Data Science is looking like a nice major
[deleted]
There is a decent chance (took 2015, buckets got adjusted about 12 points).
A friend of mine in fall 2016 was 3 or 4 points off from an A and he emailed denero and got a slight bump so it never hurts to ask!
I totally feel you, I‚Äôm getting pretty worried about declaring. but i‚Äôve heard from almost everyone that CS 61B is good so that gives me high hopes. 
[deleted]
5 points from an A- is quite a lot of points from an A-. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily bank on the bins being changed for your grade. It‚Äôs possible but I‚Äôve had friends who were 1 point off and did not get their grades bumped up. 

As for your question about 61B. CS 61B is more a project class where the weightings on the projects are worth a lot more. This means if you were struggling with exams they‚Äôll be worth a little bit less. I think Hilfiger makes his class basically 1/2 project based (when I took the class the projects made up 100/200 whereas exams were like 80/200). That being said a B+ is a decent score and if you keep working at it I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get better at CS and do well on CS70 and 61B.
[deleted]
IMO 61b is harder but much more fun and actually useful. You need to put more efforts in 61b, however, you are guaranteed to get a good grade if you do so(also start early on projects!!!). I know many people who studied hard for 61a but did not do great in 61a just because exams are very dumb and they do not really test your programming knowledge. In 61b, they are testing solid knowledge and coding skills for interview type of questions, there is no puzzles or syntax questions like shitty 61a exams. 
[deleted]
Good luck to us both :) 
It might just be that the grass is always greener, but this semester's final seemed noticeably harder than previous finals. But then again, CS courses in high school have also expanded, which means kids in general are getting better at CS, which might explain why the averages didn't change.
How did you do in 61B? (If you took it) I‚Äôm worried about not declaring :(
1.5 points away from A- for spring 2016. Buckets weren't changed neither
Hopefully that happens this year ‚òπÔ∏è
[deleted]
I‚Äôm now just 1.5 points away from the bucket... kicking myself for making those silly mistakes on the final now..
Doesn't matter what fraction of the points are projects if most people do perfectly on them. Grading bins will still be made so that an A-  requires at least hitting the mean on exams, even with perfect everything else.
A lot of people do perfect on 61B projects so it still all comes down to the exams for A vs B grades.
The instructors do not comment on questions about the grade buckets changing, which is why I asked here. 
> exams are very dumb and they do not really test your programming knowledge. In 61b, they are testing solid knowledge and coding skills for interview type of questions, there is no puzzles or syntax questions like shitty 61a exams

This actually makes me so hyped for 61B next semester. Even though it'll be harder, I'm glad that the questions are more about the content than how well you can figure out what's going on in the test maker's mind
Thanks, that‚Äôs good to hear. It‚Äôs disappointing to study so hard and not get good results in 61A. :( 
I think we did get the point. I also wouldn‚Äôt worry about getting an A vs A+. It‚Äôs a pretty trivial difference...
Don't worry about the A+, doesn't even make a GPA difference.
61A always feels like it gets harder. But it's actually not. Once you get the gist of solving 61A type problems you'll realize it all can be abstracted with the same reasoning.
I had the opposite reaction, I thought it was significantly easier than previous years finals.
It always feels like that. What was the class average,median etc. Last semester Hilfinger fuckd us really hard. The average was something like 35 out of 80 or something. He didnt change grading bins at all
I barely got an A- in CS61A (literally got exactly what I needed on the final for an A-), was 0.02% away from an A in 61B (hug didn't bump me), and then I'm on track for an A in CS70. It's certainly doable. I also took 70 with 61C, Stat 134 and Data 8 with no issues. 61C is probably an A too, I should be getting a 4.0. The lesson is that it's certainly doable, don't allow 61A's grade to determine your future, it's very different class from others. You also learn a lot more about how to study and manage time as you take harder classes. Don't worry about it too much, I almost got a B+ in 61A and I'm doing fine now.

61B exams are much more fair in terms of being able to prepare for them. The first midterm maybe not, but the 2nd and the final were preparable as compared to 61A exams.

Make sure you really so well on the early midterms so you can prepare for the final that always destroys everyone.
Probably dependent on the final averages.
I think he did it before calcentral grades came out 
Same... 2.5 freaken points would be not screwing up one of the box-and-pointer diagrams fuuuu
Eh this semester, the difference between getting an A or a B was whether you did above average on exams or not.
A- is good don't worry about it that much. Focus on 61B and 70 and you're golden!
Did you take that extra survey point into account when you calculated your grade? I didn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm 0.5 points away from the next grade bucket ... if I take it into account does that mean I am ok? 
Thanks! I will definitely keep this in mind through my CS classes here :) 
Final average was a 45.7/75. On piazza, it seems like a lot of people think that the buckets won‚Äôt be changed though. 
[deleted]
Yeah you'll probably be okay, since they're going to release an announcement about the survey soon
Seems like an expected average unfortunately.
45.7 is higher than usual Hilfinger final average. There might even be a drop in grading bins (jk, no one is that evil)
Hmm I'm not sure actually, but I'm sure if you put more effort into the email the staff will be more likely to consider bumping you a bit than if you just said ""bump me pls"" 

I think he also emailed his TA, who may have put in a good word
[deleted]
tfw you only see your TA for 10 minutes a week because you leave right after the quiz
we out here prayin üôèüôèüôè
61a has quizzes now? lmao rip 
yeah they're based on effort though so the only thing it wrecks is your morale"
thoughts 8 units over the summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nk770f/thoughts_8_units_over_the_summer/,2021-05-24 13:14:46,"Sorry, I know these posts come up on this subreddit often but I wanted to get some more opinions. I'm planning on taking PS1 w/ Thomas Kent (Session D) and Hist7B w/ Sandra Smith (Session C) this summer. Both are 4 units and basically during the same session. These classes also both have around a B+ average on Berkeleytime, although I don't know much about these two professors. 

I know its doable, but I was kind of looking forward to a more chill summer where I can still go out and enjoy summer break. I don't want to be super stressed trying to get A's like I was during fall and spring sem. Anyone have any idea what the workload will be like? Both these classes fulfill really useful requirements for my major and will get me ahead, but I don't mind subbing one for an easy 2 unit class (I need at least 6 units for fin aid) although I'd really like to take these 2 if I can. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!","Idk abt PS1 but Ik History 7B is hella easy and totally doable to get an A. It‚Äôs asynchronous so you don‚Äôt even have to attend lectures and the work in the class is minimal compared to other social science classes
I took history 7b this spring semester and the work was pretty chill. Also a pretty solid and relatively easy class to get an A
Took ps1 this spring and it was ok (ended with an A-). The midterm was pretty easy but the rubric for the essays were kinda vague imo. He‚Äôs lecturing is kinda dull and I enjoyed it more when it was Van Houweling lecturing, but it‚Äôs still a pretty good class. Decent amount of reading. No class or test curves tho
I took PS 1 with Kent last summer and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. There‚Äôs a midterm, final, final paper, group project, and weekly quizzes, so it‚Äôll definitely keep you busy, but grading‚Äôs pretty good and lectures are completely asynchronous, so it‚Äôs manageable overall
OP, since these are lower, transferable courses, I highly recommend just taking them at a community college and saving money. You don‚Äôt have to submit any extra forms to Cal; just enroll in the ccc system
hi I know it's been a while since ur original post LMAOOO but did you ever end up taking hist7b w/ smith? if so how was it?
awesome thanks sm!!
sorry ik it's been long while since but who did you take hist7b with?
this is actually great advice! im still able to cancel these two classes and get a full refund right? im going to look into this more, don't know why i didn't think of this
LOL yes i did, it was super chill workload def wasnt too bad at all and all the assignments were related to lecture/reading so no curveballs. honestly i really enjoyed it!

I am a bit unsure what exactly this course covers. From the course description, it looks like I could expect to learn microservice patterns, a cloud hosting service, thorough testing practices, and popular architecture patterns. If the course does in fact cover these things then it seems quite worthwhile.

I have made some monolith web applications in the past w/ Node, Websockets, and React, but nothing too serious. I just want to make sure this class isn't going to cover just stuff I already know.

I'd appreciate any opinions on the class or specifics about tech stacks/projects.","AFIAK it's not very useful. You can learn all of this while doing an internship/a side project without the boring parts of the class.
i enjoyed it lol. I knew react/node/mongodb/heroku beforehand, but the class touched ruby on rails and heroku + all the other things you mentioned too. There was definitely some things I already knew how to do, but for me it was more filling gaps in my knowledge rather than learning something completely new.
No
Did you have to use ruby on rails?
yeah, we were tested on it too.
What was used on the front end?
usually html with embedded ruby (erb) or haml
you'll probably find the class projects pretty easy if you've already done web development -- even if you've never used ruby before. hardest part of the class for me were the quizzes lol"
Advice to future students taking Chem 3A with Professor Marsden,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15oowsz/advice_to_future_students_taking_chem_3a_with/,2023-08-11 16:53:14,"This won't apply for the fall, since he'll be teaching Chem 3B, but I thought I'd write it now since I just finished the course for future semesters.

This class is extremely daunting at first glance. It's not curved, the subject material is extremely harsh, and GSIs can either be condescending or just not understand your struggles. I know because I have been there. However, this class is doable.

1. Do everything. Everything. All the post lecture worksheets, all the discussion note assignments, everything. Although missing one or two may seem inconsequential, it adds up extremely fast. If you are a rudimentary test taker (like me) this is where you can make up those points to bolster your grade. Pete will say something like ""its okay if you miss one or two."" He's lying. Do them all.
2. Study for the Quizzes. At least a little. Depending on when you take the course, quizzes will either be at the beginning of lecture (terrible) or the end of discussion (preferred). Do well on the quizzes. Usually, it's basically a repeat of what's on the homework/PLWS, so they are all doable. Practice answering questions fast. You're more likely to run out of time then you are to not know the answer to a question.
3. At least skim the homeworks. They're not mandatory, however they are there for a reason. For example, a question from Homework W was lifted word for word and put on the final exam. I think it was worth like 20 points. Homeworks also help solidify an understanding in course material that can't happen in class due to pace. If you review the homeworks beforehand, the quizzes will probably be a nobrainer for you, since it's basically the same exact questions.
4. Study for the tests (?). I am a terrible test taker. I have really bad test taking anxiety, which, at its worst, have caused me to accidentally skip over full questions on tests. If you can relate to this, just do your best. If you do all the stuff above, a B- or C+ on a test matters less. Plus, you can get back some of those points with test corrections. Remember, C is passing, and thats enough.

&#x200B;

If you do all the stuff above, you'll pass no worries. The class grading system is not curved, however it is formed so that above 50% is at least a C-, which you'll need to progress to either 3B or whatever else. Plus, (assuming you did everything above), there are so many areas for extra credit, it will bolster your gpa. I did everything above, (B on Exam 1, C on Exam 2), absolutely bombed the final, and I am finishing the class with a B. It is possible.

And for anyone who needs to hear it, know that it is ok to fail. This class is difficult, and not everyone comes in with the same mental and physical capacity. I tried taking this class in the Spring and completely bombed it. Why? Because I always skipped my discussions to go to work, and sometimes I came home from work too tired to finished my PLWS. Physically speaking, I was too tired to actively participate in the class, which affected my performance. I also know people who were in mental health ruts at the time, which also really affects their performance in the class. Just know this. If you fail, you fail. Try again. You're current performance in a class is not the extent of your intelligence or your potential. You can do it! You're the boss of your own educational career!","[deleted]
Happy to see that PETE is still teaching the ochem series. He was one of my fave profs at cal
I took o chem at community college but my professor there had the same sentiments. No one stumbles into a course like o chem accidentally. 

It‚Äôs generally understood that everyone with any intention of passing the class knows to show up, take notes, do homework, and study. My professor straight up refused to offer extra credit because he knew that the students that were already determined to succeed would do it, and the students that actually needed the EC wouldn‚Äôt, because they were already putting in minimum effort anyways, and so it would just dilute points and give him more work to grade. 

Like‚Ä¶. Once you get past intro or general courses you should already know to have pulled your head out of your ass if you want to succeed
I took Marsden‚Äôs class, so I think it‚Äôs fair that I provide more advice than just ‚Äútake Marsden‚Äôs class.‚Äù I have friends that had other Chem 3A teachers and the experiences vary widely. Although Marsden is the best Chem teacher, it‚Äôs important to note that his class is not curved, unlike a few other Chem professors. It can be daunting for people who are used to other STEM courses that are curved in which all you have to do is be better than the next person.

Also, It‚Äôs so easy to get in your head with classes like Chem 3A. Especially with people posting stuff like ‚ÄúWhat it takes to get an A in Chem 3A‚Äù and it‚Äôs just a picture of 3 binders filled with paper. It‚Äôs so easy to think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not smart enough to do this‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fail‚Äù, or ‚Äúmaybe I should just drop‚Äù. Many of us have mental and physical struggles. I could have really used a post like this when I first took Chem 3A. To remind me that even if it‚Äôs daunting, it‚Äôs very possible.

Also, this post was not for people who aren‚Äôt struggling Chem 3A. This post is a guide for people either scared of approaching the class, or people who are struggling with the class in the future. When you get in your head, or you get busy, even simple things like ‚Äúmake sure you do ALL your PLWS‚Äù can be helpful advice. Especially because it‚Äôs hard to scale the importance of them at the beginning of the semester.

Not only is this post just specific advice for this specific class, it‚Äôs reassurance that it is possible to pass this class. And trust me, even if Marsden‚Äôs class is the easiest Chem 3A class at Berkeley, it‚Äôs still difficult in its own right. And best believe people struggle with Marsden‚Äôs class too."

prospective student: How's Berkeley student life?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fwua3b/prospective_student_hows_berkeley_student_life/,2020-04-07 15:34:13,Hi I'm deciding b/w cal eecs and ucla cs. I have always heard that berk has worse student life and balance. is this true?,"Let me put it this way. The people here heard about how difficult Berkeley could be and yet still decided to come to get that world-class education. This means that the people here really want what they want. You are going to have to compete more at Berkeley than you would most other places.

That being said I think everyone figures out their work-life balance sometime their freshman year.  And the education is truly world class. I can't speak to all majors but in STEM you really cannot bullshit through your classes.

This article helped me with the same circumstance you are in - [https://medium.com/@eamonsmith22/why-i-chose-cal-over-ucla-9d51504bb0c3](https://medium.com/@eamonsmith22/why-i-chose-cal-over-ucla-9d51504bb0c3)
Hot take: student life at any university is what *you* make of it. Student life for me is great so far, but not every student here can say that, and that‚Äôs true at every university. For example, just because you went to Harvard doesn‚Äôt mean you are guaranteed to have a better GPA. Likewise, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you will end up depressed if you chose to go to Cornell 

Berkeley does have a lot to do though, being so close to SF and all. *Fun fact: Berkeley is closer to SF than UCLA is to LA.* At a big public school, it is really up to you who you want to hang out with. Because of the sheer size of the school, it is practically guaranteed that there are people that you click with. You just have to find them
I like to play Pokemon Go during Coronavirus off-season and water houseplants, or loiter in boba shops and draw. Other people like to surf, dedicate their life to their awesome club, volunteer at the ASPCA, party, or start fights in front of pizza places at 2am. It's all up to what kind of person you are, but Berkeley is big enough and SF is close enough that all your needs can be met. You just have to be the proactive one!
Would you rather be around tech culture, politics, colder weather, more crime Vs. Warm weather, beaches, arts culture, safer area?
This is a very one-sided look though. also many of these r clearly just misconceptions 

Crime rate FBI data suggests Ucla is more dangerous than Berkeley: 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wlwt.com/amp/article/report-uc-ranked-13th-most-dangerous-campus-1/3527094

>>> UCLA was considered the most dangerous campus, followed by UC Berkeley and Duke University.

Also, Westwood is a lot colder than Berkeley in the winter while being hotter in the summer, so idk what u r talking about lol. Bay Area weather is just so much better than LA weather in general

summer classes input from a stressed bear pls help i am sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mtruis/summer_classes_input_from_a_stressed_bear_pls/,2021-04-18 20:10:51,"soo im so lost w my class situation! I'm a current freshman thinking ab majoring in PH + MCB. I have acc no idea what to take this fall :( i took tons of cc classes so im done with all of my breadth requirements also. the biggest doozy, i am taking chem1a rn and eating ass. a lot of it is me not preparing well for mts and just cramming lectures/ content vs acc studying/prepping. and i don't know  (but i do know?) why this keeps happening, trust me i hate myself for it. anyways, this sem is probs the worst I've ever done academically and my self-esteem and mental health rn sucks. i did well first semester and this semester... its def not gonna be that great lmao. i am also premed which is stressful bc ppl ik b freakinnn about a B lmao. 

i was thinking about taking chem3a/3al this summer since i feel behind in the o-chem series already as i took chem1a in the spring and not fall. but now, idk whether i should just take chem3a/3al in fall (w robak). OR do just chem3a this summer and push lab to fall to not overwhelm myself over summer? i don't wanna wreck my gpa or my learning in such an important course. 

i cant even decide my fall classes bc it kinda depends on what i do over the summer. should i take some chill class to boost my gpa a little over summer, and also get the chance to self-study o-chem before i go into it? or should i j go for chem3a? i would get like 4+ weeks until that session starts to self prep.

i would really appreciate any help im sorry if this was all over the place, im so lost and my advising app is like right before fall enrollment lmao so i would love ur input <3","I haven‚Äôt taken 3a over the summer but hearing from people who did, it‚Äôs very intense. Mostly because organic chemistry is something you learn with practice, not just memorization. However taking it over the summer may be better for you if you‚Äôre not taking any other classes at the same time like you are this semester. Another thing is that it‚Äôs pretty hard to self-study for classes so unless you have all of Robaks notes to study over the summer, I doubt that it‚Äôll be much help to try and prepare over the summer. Last thing, just because you‚Äôre not doing well in 1a doesn‚Äôt mean that 3a won‚Äôt go well for you. Maybe inorganic chemistry just isn‚Äôt your thing right now. In general I would say ask yourself if there‚Äôs any other classes you could take this summer that would be useful to you and your goals if you want to go a more relaxed route or be ready to really focus on 3a in the summer because you‚Äôll need to take it one day.
""I'm a current freshman...i took tons of cc classes so im done with all of my breadth requirements""...what a legend
If Chem 3A is with Pete (marsden) I‚Äôd take over summer. He‚Äôs fantastic but don‚Äôt stress too much about being behind in 3 series. You can still take the bio 1A/1B and physics 8a/8b without needed the 3 series. The only thing is you need both bio 1A and Chem 3b to declare whenever you want to start taking upper divs
Hi! I am in the same situation, would it be better to take physics 8A during the summer than chem 3A, and then do physics after sophomore year (during that summer)?
hi there! i am totally unsure of who is teaching chem3a this summer. do you know if there is a way i can check this? tysm!!! also, would u recc taking chem3al simulatenously? :)
I believe if he is teaching 3B in the fall then he usually is teaching 3A in the summer. Also for labs it is up to you, they are needed to declare but it helps to take relatively close to when you took the class
Labs are not*** needed to declare"

for those of u who have taken bio1b before ....,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nb6ttj/for_those_of_u_who_have_taken_bio1b_before/,2021-05-12 19:58:21,"i am a little confused on how grade bin shifts / curves work especially for bio1b. in bio 1b, the  mean on all three midterms was a 75% and the mean of the final was a 66%. In emailing Joshua Povich, he told me that for academic planning i should stick w the bins they have said (traditional grading where a 93.3% is an A etc). 

For those of you who took this class., was there any shift for you? Berkeley time shows the avg in this class is a B but our class stats seem to be pretty low? this is my first bio course at berk so i am not sure how this works... no bin shift at all seems wild. thank you.","Took the class last sem. There's no grade shift and yeah the stats were like that for us as well. It sucks because a few questions wrong basically means you're already at a B despite a week of studying in advance (like me).

And Josh is probably one of the worst head GSIs of all time.
I took Bio 1B in Fall 2019. Sadly, we didn't have any curve either. I know because a friend scored less than 0.5% less than an A and if there was any bin shifting, she would have gotten her A.
I took it summer 2020. No grade shift either. The exams were an average of 75-80
I am in the class but I doubt it will. It‚Äôs weeder class meant to torture you. Good thing I am done with it! I also saw a grade drop. Also do know when looking at bins, it‚Äôs better to find the median since the grades are almost certainly not in normally distribution. My guess it that it‚Äôs skewed to the left, but there the median might be much higher than the avg.
Currently in the class. Averages are lower from other semester but I don‚Äôt know if they would curve it much given that a large part of the class is based on labs and lab quizzes (which have higher averages). I guess it all balances out :( 
Best hope is they add like an extra percent
what were ur averages on exams if u recall?
what were ur averages on exams if u recall? depresso espresso vibes tn
 thank u for ur comment. im so sad bc my grade dropped after the final. the avg was a 66 on it, you'd think they'd curve a little? :((
Unfortunately I don't remember the averages, but I think they were the standard for Bio/MCB at Berkeley (roughly 60 - 70%???). Also you said that this is your first bio class at Berkeley so I just want to congrats on starting your bio journey here. Fyi, I assume you'll take Bio 1A and 1AL and for my semester they didn't curve either. I found curving to be an important factor in my lower div chem classes but not so much in bio weeder classes :(
That‚Äôs a very mean average. I sure hope they do. That sounds like it should be curved"

CS/DS with comp bio DE guy here.  I happened to have taken MV Calc in HS at a CC, so that counted for my lower division emphasis class (articulation to Math 53).  I had a 5 in AP Bio, so theoretically I had subject credit for Bio 1A/B, but DS would not take that.  I don‚Äôt think you really need much Bio background tbh, you can study up on DNA and cell theory on your own IMO.  It‚Äôs much more CS, math and stats leaning.  As for my uppers, I took CS 176 which was a pretty difficult class but I worked really hard in that class (I‚Äôm usually very lazy) and got a great grade.  I also took BioE 145 which was somewhat a waste of time as it‚Äôs a subset of CS 189 with some bio twists to it, very easy class, but don‚Äôt recommend it.  Do grab the classes as soon as you can, most if not all of the classes for the upper division DE are only offered once a year, if that.

I would do CS/DS mainly for the purposes of taking extra CS classes. For me, I only took about 2 classes that I personally wouldn‚Äôt have taken has I been only a CS single major - Data 8, the ethics class, and perhaps this BioE 145 class. And even the ethics class was sort of worth it since it doubled as a history breadth. So it was worth the double for me.
Ooh thank you so much!! I took IB Bio HL but didn't get credit for that, so i do have to take bio 1a unfortunately :(( 

For the domain emphasis, are there any other upper-division classes you were considering taking? I was interested in BioE 145 but if it's a repeat of 189 it's probably not worth it, yeah.
BioE 131 is a intro course into CompBio.  I couldn‚Äôt fit it into my sched, but I heard it was a very intro class and It didn‚Äôt sound like I missed much.  The CMPBio 156 class  on Human Genomes sounded very interesting, but similarly I could not fit it in my schedule as I had a time conflict as well.

FWIW, all the profs for these classes I mentioned (Holmes BioE 131, Lareau BioE 145, Yosef CS 176, and Barcellos CmpBio 156 are all very prominent computation biology and/or epidemiology researchers, and getting in good with one of them could be a great way of connecting in with research.  I mention this kinda as a missed opportunity for myself, as whatever research I did (with Hug) was fairly limited and subject to so much competition for limited research opportunities on the CS/DS side.  All the classes are small, around 50 students, so you‚Äôll get to know the profs for sure."

An Update to Everything Happening in Math 54,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10t23lw/an_update_to_everything_happening_in_math_54/,2023-02-03 18:02:36,"This is an update to everything that has happened in Math 54 over the past few weeks, the first post about this can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10qa5ll/an_explanation_of_whats_happening_in_math_54/).

On Wednesday night, the Math Department sent out an email saying that the replacement instructor for Dr. Talaska was going to be Norman Sheu. Up to this point, whether you were enrolled in Lecture 001 (M / W / F) or Lecture 002 (Tu / Th) in Calcentral didn't matter and you could go to either lecture and to discussions in either class. However, with Professor Sheu taking over, the email said that this would no longer be the case as the classes would be fully independent, and that students should make an effort to switch to the correct class if they weren't already.

Yesterday's lecture for Professor Wehrheim had been cancelled, but at around 3pm Prof. Wehrheim posted on the class's Ed forum. The post detailed a proposal for the class to keep relatively the same structure as before, resuming once Prof. Wehrheim returned from medical leave, which was at the very least planned until Feb. 8th. The post was long, but Prof. Wehrheim seemed to be committed to continuing the class.

Around 8 hours later, at 10pm, the Math Department sent out another email saying that Prof. Wehrheim would no longer be the instructor for Lec 002, and that they were looking for another instructor teaching the class according the standard department syllabus. Math 54 would still satisfy all university requirements and count towards pre-reqs, majors, etc., just that it would be adjusted because of the class essentially starting over three weeks in.

And now, a few hours ago, Prof. Wehrheim updated their proposal post on Ed to clarify that the Math Department had removed them as instructor without their consent and without consultation. Prof. Wehrheim mentions that they had met with the Math Department Chair Michael Hutchings on Tuesday, in which he had assured them ""it's your course, you're the boss"" and Prof. Wehrheim also uploaded all 45+ minutes of this meeting with Michael Hutchings onto the class's bCourses page. They went on to say that they would continue to ""support the learning and teaching of Linear Algebra and Differential Equations,""  apologized for everything happening to everyone taking the class, and that is where things stand now.","drama@berkeley
Lol she uploaded the meeting with the chair? Honestly her class format is pretty flawed despite being a good idea in principle, and also I was surprised how she described her format as flexible when it is the most prescriptive shit I‚Äôve ever seen.
Just to add on, yesterday's update included stuff like:

""Students who are enrolled in Lec002 and do not take these steps to opt in are encouraged to take their own steps to switch into Lec001 ‚Äî see the second paragraph above. In addition, I would provide a list of these students to our administration with the request to switch them into Lec001 ‚Äî or drop them from the course if there is no substantial work in the course so far, and no explanation for that. If that turns out to be impossible, then I would assign incomplete grades to all students who have been caught in this unfortunate situation.

Students who remain enrolled in Lec002 and don‚Äôt opt in ‚Äî or opt in but act in serious disrespect for our Community of Inquiry may be excluded from all support structures (including forum and take-home assessments) and assigned an incomplete grade. ""

We had to opt in (basically agree with their proposal) to stay in the class, or else you would be dropped/forcibly removed/given an incomplete.
Wait, what happened with Dr. Talaska? I had her for 10A
üëÄ üçø
That's crazy! Thank you for the continued updates. To all those in the class, wish you the best.
Welcome to Berkeleys, secret bad math plan. Designed to destroy society by either driving us all crazy, insisting we completely accept their math; or make us all really dumb, if we actually manage to ""learn"" it. Either way, it's an elimination of the brightest, plan. Made by those who passed and understood the bad math. 
Good luck. 
Remember variables matter.
[deleted]
Any more updates? What happened with this? Did the full 130-page manifesto get released?
Not in this class but curious: what's special about the class format?
That‚Äôs the dumbest possible take on the text you just sent. They (not she, they) literally said that you should not take their lecture if you don‚Äôt like the way they structure their class and instead take lecture 001, which is structured in a more conventional way. That is the obvious point of that post. The thing is not ‚Äútake my class or get dropped or an incomplete‚Äù it is ‚Äútake my class, or the other class, or get dropped or an incomplete‚Äù which seem to be the only options no matter who is teaching the course. How you got your interpretation demonstrates a shocking lack of reading comprehension.

What the post actually is saying: ‚Äúswitch to lecture 001 if you don‚Äôt like my class structure/if you‚Äôre not willing to do the work for the class

What you claimed it‚Äôs saying: ‚Äúdrop or incomplete if you don‚Äôt like my class structure‚Äù 

The two are very obviously different
Medical leave.
but she‚Äôs teaching 10B still?
Edit: I apologize for my writing. I recognize it is not my strong suit, but I tried to make it readable. Also, sorry for the long response; I think I might turn this into a post.

First of all there are no exams. Your grade is based on completing checkboxes through at home ‚Äúskill quizzes‚Äù, group work, and prework before each lecture and section. Hence why this class was considered an essay A. 

In addition to that, there are no official resources for this class in terms of a textbook, slides or a lectures you could watch. Lecture is another glorified discussion section where the professor might or might not take 10 minutes to explain something. Basically you have to figure everything out by yourself. And to be fair they link some resources at the end of each worksheet which are usually mathisfun links or chapters to an optional textbook. In my and some other friends‚Äô opinion these resources don‚Äôt usually match the depth of what we are learning.

The problem is you have 6 hours per week of mandatory class attendance divided in 3 lectures and 3 sections for Tallaska‚Äôs portion of the class (Werheim has 2 lectures of 1.5h) that are all group work and those 6 hours are accompanied by ‚Äúprework‚Äù assignments that are supposed to prepare you for the groupwork. These prework assignments are also really badly written which makes it super frustrating as they are the only thing we have to work with. 

Anyways, these format of ‚Äúinquiry based learning‚Äù could work if they gave you a foundation before group work (maybe let lectures be lectures) and the only materials the class relies on were well written. 

Lastly, a side note about accessibility:

I am sure Werheim had the best intentions, but I feel she achieved the opposite of what she was aiming for.  Sure, this class is an easy A and not a gatekeeping class, but students without a strong math background and time are going to have a bad time regardless of the grade. There‚Äôs a way more efficient way of making you think critically without wasting your time. Who is at an advantage here? The student who has 10-20 hours of part-time work or the student who doesn‚Äôt need to work to afford Berkeley (assuming a normal workload of 4 courses for both)? Sure, I get the thing about thinking critically and asking questions but university is also about sharing knowledge and giving you some things chewed as bad as it sounds. A lot of courses at Berkeley give you a foundation and then let you branch out from there by giving you hard problems to think about without reinventing the wheel into a square.

Furthermore, as a student with ADD this class was a nightmare. I like group work, but I cannot concentrate when all those 6 hours of mandatory attendance are group work. I am basically coming into these classes naked in terms of preparedness because the prework worksheets don‚Äôt give you any solid foundation and are badly written. Then I have to theorize with other groups talking all around me for a whole hour with my own group which is often also unprepared. Somehow I am expected to be focus and productive under all these circumstances. 

There are very few cases where I can see a class format like this working without being inaccessible. You have to have a very light courseload and the learning materials for the class are appropriate and not some messy overcrowded badly written mess of a weekly worksheet. 

I really don‚Äôt know what is going on Werheim‚Äôs mind to think this course is flexible and accesible. 

 Finally, a clarification before I end the comment. I don‚Äôt want to make it sound like I hate the idea of going to class by talking about the mandatory attendance. In fact I usually go to every lecture and section in my classes even if they are not mandatory. However, the lack of flexibility and super prescriptive format (6 hours of group work divided in 6 classes preceded by mandatory prework for each one) is frustrating. We are students, but we are also people with lives and responsibilities outside school.

Oh I'm sorry to hear that, she was always so nice to me.
Oh wait idk if she's teaching 10b this semster, I had her 2 years ago
Yes I'm in 10B and she is still teaching it.
This format also sounds like a nightmare for people on the autism spectrum. 6 hrs/wk of group work?
Wow, if you have a schedule conflict you have to take the only class available, & if you don‚Äôt like the only class available, you have to incomplete or drop. What part of this is specific to how they teach the class and not something that would be completely the same in literally any other class???

Edit: they blocked me and Reddit cared me for this lmao so idk what their actual reply is
It is funny that we had an assignment about privilege and disadvantages that people may have (invisible disabilities, low income, etc.) and then she creates a course like this lol
[deleted]
And these people are teaching math
Except you do realize how that expectation is not only completely reasonable but literally impossible for them to do otherwise? If you don‚Äôt like the class, aren‚Äôt willing to do it, and have a time conflict for the other lecture, literally what other option do you have lol?

They Reddit cared me too, imagine telling everyone who points out how stupid you‚Äôre being to k*ll themselves lol"
got into berkeley for poli sci - thinking of staying another year to apply for econ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15ai5bh/got_into_berkeley_for_poli_sci_thinking_of/,2023-07-26 14:20:03,"I got into Berkeley this year for Political Science as a transfer, but I was thinking of staying back another year to apply as an Economics major.

Basically, I'm lowkey scared of Poli Sci as a major, it seems as if it's going to be really hard to do the things I want to do with this major. I used to be solidly pre-law my entire life, which is why I chose Poli Sci as my major, but I realized last year that I definitely don't want to do law. I want to do something in finance/consulting on the business side, and I feel like Poli Sci won't give me those opportunities (every internship I see for those opportunities asks for business admin/finance/econ majors, and as a poli sci applicant I feel like my resume would be immediately discarded)

Honestly, I knew last year in November when I was applying that I wanted to do Econ instead, but I wanted to apply anyway as Poli Sci just to see where I'd get in. Got into every UC I applied to :), but unfortunately, I had undiagnosed ADHD at the time, and took a W in College Algebra not just once, but twice, once in fall and once in the spring. Also got a B in Honors Psychology this spring, so my overall GPA is a 3.95. edit: this is why I decided to just stay Poli Sci and commit, bc I had screwed up my transcipt

I did take College Algebra again and ended with a 99% this summer after getting my ADHD treated, which I can explain in my essays. However, when I apply again this November as Econ, I'll only have Calc 1 done, and to be a competitive applicant, it's recommended that I have both Calc 1 and Calc 2 done prior to applying.

I have pretty competitive extra curriculars, but they're all very poli sci oriented, not econ/business related. However, I do have TAP for UCLA, so I could definitely apply again with my backup major as Poli Sci for UCLA and have it considered.

Does anyone have advice on if I should go about this, and if so, how I can unenroll for Berkeley this fall? Also, would it make me look bad to have enrolled and committed to a UC and then apply for transfer again. TIA!","Check LA Mission College if possible.

So the 1A equivalent (MATH 261) is the 1st 8 weeks of Fall and 1B (MATH 262) is the 2nd 8 weeks. Yes, it may be difficult and a bit cumbersome knowing you won't get actual credits for them but just subject credits, but it will be so much easier doing this than what others are suggesting taking MATH 1A & 1B here simultaneously since you're not ""rushing"" courses out of sequence and it's not Berkeley level rigor lol. This way you can potentially complete those prerequisites to declare Econ on time.

^ The class search engine. Make sure to search for ""Math"" as the subject, and then ""greater than or equal to"" for the drop-down menu that says course number. Just type the number ""261"" to the right, and it'll show you the courses available. There's 2 8-week courses for MATH 261 & 262. One of them is in Valley College, it's in-person and has time schedules. Ignore those. The courses you'll be interested in have 11 HR 5 MIN as schedules, which are the asynchronous ones.
I am a polisci Cal transfer alum, formerly firmly prelaw, now work in government after getting my masters instead of my law degree. DM me if you want my two cents, we can set up a call
See if you‚Äôre able to switch to econ?
I‚Äôm a polisci/public health double major if you‚Äôre interested!
Whoa! So cool
Omg I would love that!! I will DM you right now, thank you so much!
I can't because I haven't taken Calc 1 or Calc 2, which are both pre-reqs for the major
Ahh you need to complete the prereqs in the first semester for econ which is doable since they don‚Äôt enforce prereqs in the math classes but it‚Äôll be insanely hard to take both at the same time lol. There‚Äôs also political economy as a major but if you don‚Äôt want to do that nor political science then ig stay at CC but there‚Äôs never a guarantee you‚Äôll get back in
Ooh yeah there's no way I could do Calc 1 and Calc 2 in the same semester with all of my Econ pre-reqs, which are already insanely competitive as is.  


I did meet the Political Economy major requirements, I need to speak to an advisor asap. Unfortunately, that's also a capped major, but I'll see what they say! Thanks for your advice!
Idk if taking Political Economy would change all of the original issues I had with having Political Science as a major though
You could try and take Calc 1 at a CC and then Math 16B at Berkeley, both in the Fall.  Berkeley doesn‚Äôt enforce prerequisites, at least not for this class.  It would be a insane sched, but barely doable if you were good at math.  Otherwise, you‚Äôll probably run out of time because of the Econ deadline.  

An alternative is that you can withdraw this semester and do Calc 1 at a CC in the Fall, and then come back in Spring and do Math 16B and apply for Econ in the Spring.
With Political Economy you have to take 4 college semesters of a foreign language for the major on top of the rest of the requirements so that could cause more time to complete the major.
Yeah you would have to take calc 1 and calc 2 at the same time to switch to econ. How is it that you haven‚Äôt taken at least Calc 1 though?
I‚Äôm not great at math, but am pretty confident I‚Äôll be able to get an A at CC with dedication, and also I‚Äôll have plenty of time to focus on it as I‚Äôll barely be taking classes 

No idea if I can do Calc II at Berkeley and still pass tho lmaoo..  but that‚Äôs a good option, I‚Äôll keep that in mind!!
I got a W in College Algebra last fall, and another W in the same class this spring. Turns out I had undiagnosed ADHD the entire time, and once I got it treated, I was able to end with a 99% in the class when I took it again this summer.  


My original plan was to take College Algebra last fall, Trig in the spring, and Calc 1 this summer, but the W's obviously threw me off course unfortunately. I'm doing great now that I've been treated, but obviously not having Calc 1 done makes me a less competitive applicant

There will also be a great deal of calculus involved. Good luck! 120A is a fascinating, yet difficult class.
Quantum in chem has a reputation of being badly taught, but if you can learn it, quantum is quantum. Griffiths quantum mechanics is a pretty approachable physics book and a good thing to try if you want to preview or if chem 120a is not making sense.  It also reviews some linear algebra.

I recently submitted my UC applications and my levels of anxiety are unmatched!! and i mean they are SHOOTING thru the roof. I will be applying for this fall 2022 transfer. However, I'm a 1-year transfer student and I got 2 B's in a total of 11 classes, and since UCs only take the fall gpa as the overall gpa.. I'm beginning to lose hope 0.o .. I'm submitting winter grades though because they finish this week, and I ended up with all As in them.

**Here's my background:**

California community college student

Major: Political Science

GPA: 3.46 (Fall 2021) ; 3.89 including winter but it doesn't factor into the gpa by admissions 

*Major pre-reqs:*

Intro to American Government - Completed (A)

International Politics - Completed (A)

Political Theory - Planned for Spring 2022

Introduction to Comparative Politics - Completed (B) (89 :<)

Statistics & Probability - Completed (B)

English 2 - Completed (A)

I've received A's in all other coursework while in CC. I have 2 W's; one being in the Forensics team (time confliction) and another being in Anthropology (time confliction).

Extracurriculars:

\-Interned for 2 U.S. Senators

\-Student-athlete in a unique sport for 5+ years, nationally ranked

\-Political Affairs Internship at the Borgen Project (wrote articles on global poverty and government solutions, reached out to Congress and Cali government)

\-Head of communications for a non-profit that helps foster kids reach better education for 4+ years

\-Was the president of the political organization in my city

\-Was the president of Model Congress at my college (which is like Model UN but more in close relation with government

\-Won several regional, state, and national competitions (Top 5) for Debate and Public Speaking

\-Internship for law/legal affairs at a company

\-Tutored 200+ kids in my district for non-profit as part of an organization; director position in

\*\* I think I have okay-level essays, not sure tho TT

Thank you!!","nobody here knows except the admissions committee tbh just sit tight until you get your decision
Judging by your life experience/ extracurriculars and decent GPA, as a CC transfer, I‚Äôd say you have a good shot. 
I was accepted with far worse GPA (3.4) and less extracurriculars- this is not to say I didn‚Äôt also have a particular arc/ story to tell which made a competitive applicant‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just saying, as intimidating and competitive as Berkeley is, my sense is they really want to know WHO YOU ARE. I think extra ++ if this earnestly aligns with values such as service, community, innovation, social change. Pay extra attention to your essays and take deep breaths! You sound like you have a lot to offer. Know that.
First of all,  you should have completed all major required courses. Second, you have ton of experiences in extra curricular activities but the question is how you presented those experiences in your essays? 
Don't worry about GPA you don't have to get 4.0 but should have at least 3.7. 
You have a bright chance because UC Berkeley emphasis on internships and extra curricular activities.
P.S: I also got B in Physics in CC by 89.73%. Yet I am in Cal.
Best of luck! :)
I HAVE A 3.46 at time of application TOO BRO BDSBDJHSBHSBBFH!! and thank u sm for that u dont know how much that means TT  also what was ur major?? 0.0
FAWK physics is SO HARD i took it in hs and i wanted to cry.. can't imagine how it is in CC..
Phys 7A (force and motion) was mathematically hella lengthy but I comfortably managed A. Then I took Phys 7C (heat and wave) which was much easier and less math intensive. However, I painked in online timed exam thanks to covid yet my cruel professor didn't give me A for 89.73%. At the end, I took Phys 7B (electricity and magnetism) which was conceptually toughest but I scored more than perfect score in final online zoom exam and got A.
thats so amazing!!!!! i could never. i was the same way!! i got an 89.59% in my comparative poli class so i asked the professor if she could round and she said that she'd report me HELP TTTTTTT
There are some professor who are rude. Majority of them round off. I got round off at 89.5% in Bio 1A and Calc 2 at CC.

I got into bowles and will most likely to Clark Kerr (CK) b/c my top 3 choices is CK and i have regents. Money is not a factor. Which should i choose?

I heard the bowles meal plan is seperate from CAL Dining. Does this mean i can only eat at Bowles hall?

Additionally, is there a gym in bowles hall? If not, can i use the gym at the colosseum near by?

Thanks!","All students can use the gym at memorial stadium. Clark kerr does have its own small gym in the southwest corner, but its not nearly as extensive as the RSF or memorial stadium. CKC also has a track and pool up on the hill.
bowles is right next to memorial gym. bowles food is so much better and the rooms are nice. more close community. def pick bowles

Need help with this math problem (not assigned for any of my courses and I just did it out of curiosity),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11qwh14/need_help_with_this_math_problem_not_assigned_for/,2023-03-13 21:25:18,"Preface: 

I attempted the problem using two different methods but only the second one yielded the correct answer of 1/3. What I'd like to know is where I messed up in my first method that caused me to get 1/2 and how I can rectify it to also get 1/3. 

&#x200B;

Here is the problem:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/opbetwwzsmna1.png?width=3023&format=png&auto=webp&s=576615a8aad2f12bbbb21645bf8eb32c26df7cb5","So I think the problem with your work is it overcounts (also wouldn't approach the problem using the first method)

I just did this. Kid A, and Kid B. Based on your problem, it's either a boy or girl question. So 2\*2 = 4 end possibilities.

1. girl giril = two girls
2. girl boy = B is a boy
3. boy girl = A is a boy
4. boy boy  = Both boys.

&#x200B;

Now which possibilities here would you actually consider? Just possibility 2, 3 and 4 right?

The main problem with your work is that it overcounts the scenario where both are boys. (Scenario 4)

Case 1 B and case 2 A are overcounted here. Boy-boy is counted twice.

A being a boy(given) and B as a boy(probability) is equivalent to B being a boy(given) and A being a boy (probability). In Method 1, you counted it twice even though its the same thing.

This explanation's kinda weird sorry. Dm if u have any questions.
[deleted]
Hey thanks for the explanation and it's not weird at all! In fact, it matched up nicely with my thought process with the second method!

This problem was kind of trippy though and I believe it's called the Boy or Girl Paradox. I think it's called a paradox even though there's no contradiction because of how counterintuitive it is bc i feel like a lot of ppl, myself included, would be quick to say that the answer is 1/2
\*sexes

My bad.

Alternatively, I could have said, ""...both genders are equally likely to be assigned at birth"" since I don't think anyone is assigned nonbinary"

I took 16 months off Berkeley via withdrawal for mental health reasons and since coming back my only goal has been to declare CS so it‚Äôs a scary day for me.

I‚Äôm not even in some horrible position score wise but I have also been steadily declining in my classes this semester. Gone from +0.2 to -0.7 standard dev from cs70 midterm 1 to 2. Also have like an 88% hw avg post curve which will slightly hurt me. 

I only need a B- in 70 to guarantee CS major admission (even if I fuck up 61B final) but my confidence has been steadily declining in the class in spite of a lot of attempted effort and office hours. Since the class is curved w/ correlated exam distributions I don‚Äôt even know what type of min standard deviation would boot me below the bucket for a B-, but it feels like it could realistically happen possibly. I don‚Äôt know since nothing can really be computed accurately yet.

Good luck to everyone taking CS finals today. I‚Äôm (statistically) not even in the most desperate possible position and I‚Äôm terrified there‚Äôs a real chance I could fuck up and not make it. I really hope it works out.

(By the way, if anyone with a better working knowledge of stats than me has any reasonable idea when accounting for correlation what a very ROUGH estimate would be for the min standard deviation on the final I‚Äôd need to maintain a B- or better, please let me know because I‚Äôve driven myself crazy trying to figure it out)","Good luck bro. You worked really hard and I'm sure it will work out.
Good luck today! Just take a couple breathers before and during your exams! Fight for those partial credit points. And in the end, even if something does happen to your grade, there are other paths you can take towards where you want to be in the far future, not necessarily any easier or harder than the one you are on now.

It's too late now that I'm commenting but for future reference take two benedryls and don't use your phone after taking them. Also don't use benedryl as a crutch for sleep.

Take Earth and Planetary Science classes!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mwbkcc/take_earth_and_planetary_science_classes/,2021-04-22 11:40:10,"Hello everyone. I'm writing to put Earth and Planetary Science classes on everyone's radar for the upcoming phase 1 enrollments. This fall we will be teaching breadth courses on climate change, earthquakes, the oceans, and introductory Earth science.

I personally will be teaching EPS 102: History and Evolution of Planet Earth (M,W,F 3-4) and I would really like to get people with diverse backgrounds taking the class.

This class covers the origin of our solar system, the origin of life, Earth's climate and tectonic history from the recent ice ages to global catastrophes billions of years ago, the evolution of life from microorganisms to complex animals, and more! The class has no prerequisites other than high-school level math, chemistry, and physics. Anything you need to know is taught.

Average grade in the class: B+. Most common grades A or A- depending on the semester.

Example comments from recent course evaluations:

‚Ä¢*The course does a really great job being accessible to students outside the EPS department. I took it as a breadth class and was daunted in the beginning looking over the syllabus. Even though many students had taken EPS 50 as an ""unofficial"" prerequisite, I didn't feel like I was disadvantaged coming in with zero knowledge. It was well organized to build understanding from the ground up. I also think Professor Stolper is an engaging lecturer and he took the time to go over key concepts patiently multiple times to reinforce them, which is surprisingly uncommon. I think this course should be publicized more as an alternative to classes like Chem 1A which students from other departments take for the Natural Science breadth. I learnt a lot more than I thought I would as the class (not being central to my major) was low priority for me but ended up being one of my most interesting classes at Berkeley.*

‚Ä¢*Professor Stolper is a very strong, engaging lecturer. I really enjoyed the way that he explained the course concepts, and his style of teaching ensured that I always felt included, even within the lecturing format.*

*‚Ä¢It was like listening to a well‚Äìmade podcast: lots of compact, in depth, well‚Äìexplained info*

Main criticism? I have bad handwriting. This is true.

*His handwriting is a little yikes but he knows it and will try to rewrite for you.*

Other classes to consider:

EPS 7: Introduction to Climate Change (M,W,F 2-3)

EPS C20: Earthquakes in your backyard (T/Th 11-12:30)

EPS 50: The Planet Earth (T/Th 2-3:30)

EPS 82: Oceans (M/W/F 10-11)

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

Does Hug *actually* not curve 61B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/iw3pot/does_hug_actually_not_curve_61b/,2020-09-19 17:14:25,"So with midterms coming up soon, I'm pretty nervous. The course policy says that he doesn't curve the class/adjust the bins \*at all\*, but that's what 61A said and we all know that 61A adjusts the bins at the end. 

If anyone who's taken 61B w/Hug can confirm that he curves/doesn't-change-the-bins, that'd be great lol. I just can't see how people get any grade above a B+ if he doesn't change the bins at all - you'd have to lose less than 300 pts to earn an A, and that's a very, very low margin of error (considering that the course of >6000 points, and exams are 600/800/1000 pts each).","He didn‚Äôt change the bins my year but in general everyone gets all hw lab and project points. There‚Äôs extra credit too and you can only lose points in exams so the bins are quite nice. He may have lowered bins in the past but if so it‚Äôs not as generous as the 61A shifts.
IIRC the means are all in the 60‚Äôs for the 3 tests the last time he taught 61B, but it‚Äôs not necessarily a regular bell curve.  More like flat earth with the scattergram, meaning the number of people who got high scores and low scores and the median was somewhat close to each other, IIRC.  Yeah, you‚Äôll probably need to average around 90% on your 3 tests to get an A, around 77% for A-, historically.  This is assuming you average around 90% on your projects.  

In his other classes that he taught last year, no bins for Data 100, I think grading was pretty generously curved to a 3.3 GPA.  For 186 last Spring, bins were announced after everyone went home due to Covid, and the bins were not changed at all.  Also very generous."

The best way I can explain this app is with a Spongebob metaphor. In this episode, the krusty krab is the university/college system of clubs, resource centers, etc. and the bulletin board is the Manifest app. Manifest brings a bulletin board abstraction of messaging to the abstraction of the Krusty Krab, which is actually the entire university system of clubs, resource centers, and institutional orgs (thus currently working with UCSC Resource Centers and the rest of the UC system for this pitch).

We may hope to see Manifest as the community bulletin board machine of great good, so long as it is free from unlawful censorship and has community standards that facilitate amazing and inspiring interactions.

Here is a more formal pitch for a web app I'm working on called Manifest to connect clubs on campus within UCSC (my school) and the rest of the UC system (including UC Berkeley):

* What is the Manifest app? Messaging for local communities.
* What is the problem it solves? Sharing information between locals quickly and efficiently.
* So what, who cares? It may help to streamline events, activities, and more in real-time within the local area. There are so many steps to joining a club, promoting events, and emailing groups‚ÄîManifest was created to unify these activities in a local platform.
* Demo link: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

Here are the instructions to install the app on any smartphone home screen by going to the demo URL ([https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)):

1. Have location services enabled via Privacy > Location Services (on) > Safari Websites (Ask or Allow)
2. Have location services enabled via General Settings > Safari > Location > Ask/Allow, you can add the app to your home screen via the Safari app on iPhone.
3. Once added to the home screen, it should work as a native iPhone app.
4. After location is enabled, here are similar Android instructions to add on home screen: [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
5. Note: to enable location on Android, it is required that Google Chrome settings allow for the location to load, and this must be adjusted via Chrome or the default browser.

The url to access the site and add to home screen is: [https://onmanifest.com/](https://onmanifest.com/)

The main bet behind Manifest is the idea that locals can share contextual information more quickly and efficiently than anywhere else on the web.

I want to give an update on how the class went. I took the class this fall (2021) with Bustamante, Wildermuth and Wilson in that order. My major is MCB-Neuro, I‚Äôm a transfer student(first semester) and took 15 units (just background info on me). The format of the class included recorded lectures that you could attend live on zoom, quizzes through bcourses, a few assignments, required discussion sections, and in person exams for Bustamante and Wildermuth and an online ‚Äúfinal‚Äù exam for Wilson. 

Opinion: The class is hard, but remember you are not the only one struggling. My class created a discord which was super helpful and allowed us to study w/ one another and answer each other questions. What I disliked most about the class is the lack transparency about what should be known. What I mean by this is that you are learning so much information in the class and there is no way that the professors can test you on you everything but the professors gave very open ended ‚Äústudy aids‚Äù with things we should know[every little detail]. I think students would have done better with w/ a more refined list of concepts to know from each chapter/topic we learned because it would have allowed for a better study approach. In order to do decent in the class and score above avg, you have to know close to everything which is exhausting. I highly recommend using flash cards. I made anki decks for each lecture of each part which allowed me to review the lectures as I was making them, then review the cards and lastly focus on the topics I didn‚Äôt understand. 

Stats: Exam 1 - 118/150, SD= ~+1.2
           Exam 2 - 119/150, SD= ~+0.87
           Exam 3 - 102/150, SD= ~+0.1
Usually the course is curved to a B- and +1SD above to my knowledge usually means an A- but I‚Äôm not sure how it worked out this semester. On bcourses with quizzes, assignments and exams inputted, my percentages ranged from an 80-83%. My final percentage was ~80% on bcourses and I ended up receiving an A- in the class as my final grade. I‚Äôm hope this was helpful and I definitely wish anyone taking the course the best of luck!",Thanks for the update. Would you mind sharing those anki decks?

now enough w the rant, and on to what this post is about. i am not sure if i should enroll in summer classes. i would need 6units for fin aid, and there are some open classes. i am done w all my breadths + AC req. idek what classes i would take over summer. i was thinking about r1b (4 un) then i would need something else to fill up the 6 un. i don't know if i should try and take these classes to kinda buffer my gpa more OR take this summer to self prep ochem/data8 and work on myself mentally/physically and volunteer etc. i feel bad for not taking any classes, esp bc my gpa will for sure be bad after freshman yr. one on hand,  I'm so mentally exhausted from online school. on the other hand, maybe i can try using better time management over summer knowing where my weakness are (but i can also do this in fall when we r on campus lol).

sorry for this ramble, i appreciate it if u stuck it out and read. what would you do if u were me?

TLDR: idk if i should take summer classes, my gpa is shit tho so summer classes can help increase it but my mental health is also shit from online school.","Take the summer classes. You‚Äôll thank yourself when you get into a great grad school. Trust me
i think you still have quite a lot of time to recover your gpa. if i was in your situation, i would take the r1b at a cc (it won‚Äôt count for your gpa but it‚Äôll be significantly easier than a cal class and you‚Äôll just get it out of the way), figure out a good plan/time management strategy for next semester, and just recover from being a bit burnt out. bio and chem are hard classes and you‚Äôre going to be just fine. gl!"
Technical Co-founder sought.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10mzkza/technical_cofounder_sought/,2023-01-27 15:29:12,"Hello Cal Reddit peeps. I'm seeking a technical co-founder that can build an MVP. It will be a mobile-enabled website. Happy to share the concept/pitch deck and my LinkedIn profile via pm.

What credentials do I have? I co-founded and ran a company in Santa Barbara/Goleta/Isla Vista in the same business space from 2007-2010 in the last recession. We got up to 7 team members, 30 paying businesses and 2000 unique customers of those businesses. This one is an evolutionary step forward in both concept and business model from that company.

Also, In the last two months I've spoken with over 100 small businesses in the Bay and East Bay and about 75% of them are interested in trying us out as-described. I've spoken with 70+ potential customers (we're in between small businesses and new customers- we do hyper-local coupons) and 90% would be interested in using our service as-described. I've spoken with 5 potential co-founders/CTO's who all said the technical issues to get this made are all feasible. The reason they couldn't commit is either because of $ or existing commitments. That wasn't true in 2010 (the technical feasibility part) when we folded the last company. So I'm optimistic about this business and business model. I just need to find someone with buy-in that's willing to work for 1-2 months with me in the Bay /East Bay area (I'm in West Oakland) to get the MVP built. I can do the rest of the heavy lifting as far as sales and getting funding.

I would ideally like to meet several times per week in person with my co-founder for one to two months while building the MVP. Once we have the MVP made I can sign up small businesses and get customers to start using the product. Then we can establish ourselves as a B corp. Then we can get a bank account. Then we can get some income. Then we can get funding. Then we can pay and back-pay ourselves and bring on some employees.

I went through YCombinator startup school. Applied for W'23. Will apply again for S'23. I need a technical co-founder right now to get this puppy off the ground. Any suggestions? Any leads? Thanks!

"As an Aspiring Junior, is there anyway to improve my chances for Berkeley?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1byw5v/as_an_aspiring_junior_is_there_anyway_to_improve/,2013-04-08 21:03:02,"Berkeley has always been a sort of a dream/out of reach school for me. However, recently I've been improving in academics and feel I've hit right in the money for decent competition in terms of academic performance with 2300 SAT, 3.84 UW GPA (People keep on telling me this is lowish, its 1 B per semester though :/), 4.18 W GPA, SAT Math II 800, SAT Chem 780. I have heard that Berkeley has a more hollistic approach to admissions. My EC's are nowhere near spectacular, just some community service (like 40 hours or so) and the usual high school sports. I don't have any serious commitment to any clubs and all my internship opportunities are looking down.

Is there anything else I can do right now to make my application stronger as a junior? Like more community service, working on an website (that i'm currently out of ideas for anything new), etc.?","I will prob be downvoted for my honest opinion here. I think you are set with your academics. Berkeley really will be looking into your personal statements for characteristics that it deems necessary to succeed. My advice is talk about how badly you want to succeed, research interests, academia, etc. Find cliche statements and avoid them if possible. Berkeley wants creativity and originality the most, and the passion to find who you truly are and commit to more than simply being a number. 


Anyone can have high GPA and SAT scores (at Berkeley), but what makes you different? Are you committed to something in life? I hope you get what I am trying to say here. That being said, have a backup plan. Going to the CC route is always a good thing to save money, and the competition is more tough in the freshman arena. The other UC's are great too, after all, the UC system is the top of the top. But Cal is certainly more special, I think we all know ;)


TL;DR - Focus on your personal statement, get it read by industry pros (lawyers, professors, doctors, anyone that has intense focus in life)
the UC's are a lot more into numbers and stats than anyone wants to admit, especially if you're in-state. If you stay the course, you should be fine. I would definitely try finding something solid like an internship or a community service thing to stick with - otherwise, you should be fine.
Your academics seem fine. If you could really take off with a specific service project or internship and knock your personal statement out of the park, I'd say you have good chance.
You'll get in.
My stats (incoming freshman for fall term):
* 2290 SAT I
* 800 in SAT II Phy, Maths and Chem
* International Student So I'd say my GPA was somewhere close to 4.0 (we don't have weighted)
* No community service but I was really passionate about computer science and wrote some decent level programs. My personal statements also reflected this as well. Check out my [blog](http://totallygamed.wordpress.com/) where I describe some of my work
*Mix of extra curricular activities including debate, quizzing, etc. And I started a Model United Nations Competition at my school
However I cannot comment on your chances of getting FinAid but those seem pretty high too
1) Do some extracurriculars. If there's a big club on campus in debate or whatever, then try to gain a leadership position. Or look into starting your own club or something. 

2) Do some community service. Get involved with Habitat For Humanity or something that you can put on your resume.

3) Visit the campus, get in touch with current students, and talk to the admissions people a few times so they know you're serious.

4) Find your differentiating factor. What makes you different from everyone else with strong academics?

Good luck.  
If you cannot get into anywhere you really like, attend a community college and get your general ed courses and some major prereqs out of the way. If you have a good personal statement and show them you can attain high grades in college courses (even if they do not compare to Berkeley classes), your chances of getting in will skyrocket.

Source: I stretched myself incredibly thin in HS, being a part of almost every activity under the sun but ended my senior year with an overall GPA of 3.0. I literally did not get into any uni's. Then I went to a CC and transferred to Berkeley in the spring after 1.5 years with a 3.9 taking honors courses (because, let's face it: CC courses are pretty easy). I just want to say that you will get in to Berkeley if you really put everything you have into it.

Sorry about spelling and typos, on my phone. Good luck getting into Cal!
Lol wtf? You will definitely get in with those numbers. Honestly, your GPA and SAT scores are absolutely the most important aspects of your application.
get less B's
So essentially focus on achieving something that shows passion rather than goals that are fancy and show strong prowess?

I really only have one truly honest passion that I can talk about (which is still honestly cliche) as the rest are kind of either meh or crapshoots. Its currently soccer outside of school and although I've done some community work with teaching young kids, I haven't done much of it (and to be completely honest, I didn't really like it either, but I did grow as a person from it). So something like during the summer, should I re-enlist in the soccer youth program for teaching kids and work on a personal statement from their?
I agree. Unless you're applying to Engineering Undeclared as an out-of-state student, you're pretty set.
This. I don't get why people love to talk about how holistic the UC's are in their admissions process. If you have good enough numbers, you will almost for sure get in. During my college application process, I basically knew I was going to get into the UC's due to my numbers, but elite private schools are another thing completely and are more holistic than the UC's IMO.
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't qualify for financial aid (My parents are pretty well off, I'm not really in need) You're blog is great low! Definitely gave me some inspiration on what I should and can do.
I've heard of people getting rejected with similar stats like me though, like this [guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1b79uq/congratulations_on_your_acceptance_to_uc_berkeley/c94dt25)

I do have backups though, but it kinda sucks when you're well qualified and get rejected anyway. Just trying to get that chance down to none or near none.
How much more difficult is the engineering or eecs department admissions than typical admissions? I'm pretty sure I'll end up doing something in either chem, generic engineering, or cs departments, all of which I heard are ridiculously competitive.

I'm instate btw.
Glad to help out an aspiring bear!
Admission is much more difficult for the College of Engineering than for the College of Letters and Science. The College of Engineering admits by major; Engineering Undeclared is the most difficult program to get into, followed by EECS, then BioE. Berkeley does not offer a General Engineering program. They don't publish statistics for freshmen by major, so far as I know, but you can gain a *general* idea of the *relative* difficulty of admission from [Page 5 of this flyer for transfer applicants](http://students.berkeley.edu/files/Admissions/12626_5.Info_TransAdm.pdf). 

The College of Letters and Science, on the other hand, does **not** admit by major. You'll get in or not regardless of what you list your major as on the application. For some majors, known as ""impacted"" majors, you must apply, a process which typically requires a 3.0 GPA. Letters and Sciences offers B.A. versions of Chemistry and CS.    
What's the difference? As /u/that_pj recently linked to in the catalog of courses, ""The EECS path is appropriate for people who want an engineering education. The L&S path is appropriate for people who are interested in a broader education in the sciences and arts, and/or are not sure at the time of application that they can gain admission to EECS."" I can tell you that it is much harder to transfer from L&S CS to EECS than it is to gain admission to EECS in the first place, so don't even think about trying that.

I'm not very familiar with the College of Chemistry's admissions process or curriculum, but it is presumably more difficult than admission to the College of Letters and Science.

If you anticipate still being undecided between Chem, Engineering, and CS by the time you enter college, it's important to know that the first year of these programs at Berkeley are very different. I know plenty of chemical engineering students (the major is in the College of Chemistry for historical reasons) who are unable to transfer to something like mechanical engineering because of the difficulty of the transfer application and because the Chem curriculum is very isolated. In the scheme of things what you did for undergrad isn't all that important between these fields, but still.
chem and engineering are completely different. I would high reccomend you to apply to CoE. Chem is harder to get into although your SAT chem score is solid. I would recommend you to also take AP chem to have some prior knowledge. 

Also if you're engineering you can take all the classes chem requires while still in the COE for just your freshman year. After that you need to transfer into CoC.
chem curriculum is very isolated? all of the ChemE classes freshman year are prereq's for mechE but I could see it being hard to transfer after freshman year
That's what I've heard second hand.    
I see [you recommended](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1byw5v/as_an_aspiring_junior_is_there_anyway_to_improve/c9bhoyz) applying to CoE and transferring to CoC if necessary. How difficult is that process compared to CoC->CoE?
I'm not completely sure but if you took your ChemE required courses freshman year in COE, it would be easier due to not having to take 4a/4b (weeder classes) you would just take 1a and 1b which are easier. I'd assume having a higher gpa would assist your acceptance into any college at Berkeley"
My guide to picking out classes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d3rrmu/my_guide_to_picking_out_classes/,2024-05-29 18:01:28,"Hi yall, I've noticed its that time of year where people are starting to ask about what courses to take/what schedule to do so I'm just gonna write down what I personally think and I hope it'll help some people.

Here's a few things I want to address first to the people who are coming in from hs since I've found hs classes and college classes are vastly different and they take a lot of getting used to for a good chunk of people. Here's what I found that are different abt college classes vs hs classes.

1. Classes are always graded not on how well you do objectively, but how well you do relative to your classmates. That means no more 90% = A and 80% = B, and so on. Instead, what will matter for your grade will largely be three things - your score, the average score, and the standard deviation of your score. Basically these things can tell you how well you did relative to your classmates and will largely determine your grade. This also means that you don't need to be discouraged if/when you come out of an exam knowing you probably got less than a 70% on an exam. There's a good chance that exam was just hard. In fact, a 50% or so was enough to get an A comfortably in some of my classes so please don't take it to heart and give yourself a hard time if you don't do very well objectively.

  
2. Professors can make or break your class. In highschool, there's usually only a few teachers who teach each class, maybe 2-3 and they all basically teach the same things because there are guidelines (such as common core or AP guidelines) that shape what will be taught in your class. This reduces the amount of variance in hs classes and that makes it so that what teacher you get usually doesn't matter too much. In college, your professors kinda have free reign on what they cover and how they cover. Different iterations of a class can have very largely differing content and difficulty so I'd highly reccommend looking up who is teaching the classes you want to take and see if they are well liked (a common tool for this is ratemyprofessors.com). (footnote 1

3. You have complete freedom over whatever you take and it's all up to you. You guys are legally adults now (or at least fairly close to it. If you're one of those kids who are at college at the age of 13 I don't think this post is for you to begin with). It's not up to any person to choose what you take and I personally believe that you can ask for people's advice/opinions on stuff but you ultimately make the decision. Don't let anyone (including me) dictate what you should do.

4. Depending on where you come from, the classes here may seem much harder relatively. This is a common thing I've seen in a lot of people and I just want to tell you that you're not alone and I believe you guys can do it if you put in enough effort. I could make a whole thing about my advice for this stuff but that's off topic.

Ok I think that's all the major differences between college and hs classes I can think of rn. Let's carry on to choosing courses.

1. The unit system is a scam and don't believe it. They say that each unit will take a student approximately 3 hours/wk but this could not be any less true. There are some classes that will quite literally take you 3 hours every month even though they have 3-4 units (footnote 2). Other classes are notorious and take a lot of people 20+ hrs/wk even though the 4 units suggests it should be 12. A particularly infamous example of this one would be CS 70.

1.1. Just tacking along, this also means that classes vary a lot in difficulty so it's usually kind of pointless to ask people if taking a certain number of units is a good choice because taking 16 units can mean anywhere from ""I have basically no work to do and can fuck around every day"" to ""I'm taking way too much because I'm taking 4 of those 20 hour courses and basically working 2 full time jobs""

2. Thus, it's improtant to figure out what classes are relatively easy and what classes are relatively hard. There's two methods I'd suggest.

2.1 First is you just look for it on google/reddit. A lot of classes (especially the cs ones) have people commenting on the class if you just look for ""\[Insert name of your class\] berkeley reddit"" such as ""CS 70 berkeley reddit."" Also another tip I've found is most of the times where you don't get results ur satisfied with, try asking google a phrase of all the keywords you want instead of asking ""What is the difficulty of CS 70 at berkeley like."" Dont have any evidence to prove it but personally its worked so if you want u can give it a try.

2.2 Try taking the classes yourself. ADJUSTMENT PERIOD IS YOUR BIGGET FRIEND!! You can enroll in up to 20 units and so what I'd reccomend is just enroll in an extra class or two that you are thinking about taking and see what all the classes are like for the first week or two. Then, you can have first hand experience with the workload of the class and you can determine if you think you can take it yourself instead of having to rely on what other people say.

3. It's usually pretty pointless to ask ""Is this a good schedule or is this too much."" Everyone is at different skill levels and you kinda have to account for that. I know a lot of people who struggle with getting by at 13 units while there are also some people who take 30+ units and still thrive. Don't go hating on everyone who asks these questions but ultimately, the answer to any of these questions will always be ""depends on who you are and how good at this stuff you are."" You guys have 4 whole years here and just take it slow and figure out what pacing is good for you instead of forcing yourself to go along with what is ""normal."" You can finish basically any degree taking less than 12 units/sem if you don't do any other classes for fun. Not that I'd reccomend doing that cuz please take a courses that interest you but I just wanted to put that there for people who are worried they're behind. You're gonna graduate on time anyways with the same degree as everyone else so who cares.

4. Speaking of fun classes, theres this thing called decals here which are student led classes and there are a lot of interesting ones so I'd reccomend you look at them and see if there are any that interest you. Similarly, there's courses that are titled freshman/sophomore seminars which are classes where you don't have much work and you listen to ur profs talk abt a variety of subjects. If you don't know what to take it might be nice looking for one of these that fit your taste.

Uh I feel like that's all i have for rn have a good day yall and hope this helped. Comment if there's anything that you disagree w or want to add and I'll try to take it into account. Oh also i didnt know what flair to use so uh i'll just got w other.

Foonotes

1. An example from my first sem here was math 53 taught by James sethian vs Norman sheu. Sheu's class had hws that were graded much more leniently and had about 1/3-1/2 the length of Sethians. Idk if sethian did this but Sheu gave extra credit for attendance + released ""practice exams"" for all the exams that were basically the same things with numbers tweaked or a small twist.

2. (in my case, nus ctx 11 was this for me. Nothing requried except 5 hws and 3 open note, mc, online, exams. hws are super short and you literally just skim the notes/ctrl f for keywords and you can finish each in an hour or so. Everyone I knew taking the class also didn't study for the exams at all/minimally and got A-s or As just by looking up answers on the fly). ","who is taking 30 units
incoming transfer here, thanks for the advice!
Bump!

Open team in Dynasty Baseball League,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35vah9/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league/,2015-05-13 13:25:13,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. This isn't an all Berkeley league, but I figured this would be a great opportunity to meet other baseball fans at Cal.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward. 

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete). 

The team roster is below. The minors system is pretty barren and the roster has too many bench offensive pieces, but there's a great deal of elite talent here. A smart owner could turn this team into a contender in short order, either through rebuilding or with a shorter term strategy. Reply or PM me if you're interested!

ECON major 1st year cource choices,https://i.redd.it/co3hnhiw4l3d1.jpeg,2024-05-30 08:50:04,"HELLLOO, please help me choose my cources for the first year to declare an economics major. ","The first question is - what are you bringing over from HS in terms of college credit? Any Calc? Any English?
I do A levels so i believe I am not bringing in any credits
I do Maths and Econ my bad
Will you be required to take any classes in the calc series? Math 1A/B? If not, definitely avoid them. Same with econ 1/2 if you can help it. If you've passed out of both of those I believe all you'll need to take is intro stat and one upper division econ course between Macro and Micro. I'd sign up for intro stat your first semester, and one of the upper division classes (100A/B) second semester, dependent on who is teaching. I took stat 20 my first semester, and with a HS stat background it was fine.
So when you say Math, do you mean you‚Äôre going to get college credits for the equivalent of 1 year of Calc?  ie Calc 1 and Calc 2?  You probably want to check first, you might not want to repeat stuff you‚Äôve already gotten college credit for already. (A lot of students do repeat stuff though). 

So your Math and Econ prereqs might already be done. For Stats, usually people default to taking STAT 20, but I recommend taking Data C88S as your requirement. But in order to take that class you also need to take Data 8, either as a prerequisite or as a co-requisite.  IMO learning Python via Data 8 is somewhat more in vogue than learning R via STAT 20.

The intermediate Econ classes, you‚Äôre not eligible to take until later on.
Also, a ton of Econ students these days tend to minor or double major in Data Science, of which Data 8 is a requirement. Something to think about.
is it possible to double major in ds if accepted into l&s?
It is possible, but no one really knows the outcomes and odds of switching to/double majoring in CS/DS/Stats until next year. You apply, go thru a comprehensive review and wait and see."

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares. ¬†[Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART‚Äôs weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
Out-of-State Community College to UC Berkeley Junior Transfer Advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35spp3/outofstate_community_college_to_uc_berkeley/,2015-05-12 21:42:11,"Hey bros, I'm kinda new to reddit  and just happened to stopped by to ask for some advice if its not too much bother since relates to UC Berkeley. Basically to summarize, I am a community college student studying engineering, from Virginia( i know right? so far away) and I started since fall 2014 and now I am planning to apply to most 4 year universities by fall 2015( i talked to a transfer rep from Berkeley at my CC and told me that its a year long application and you register by I think November) or early spring 2016 (to other 4 year universities)before anticipated graduation at spring 2016. My basic question is? Should I focus on most of pre-req or rather take a lot of credits while also getting my pre-req but the thing I wanted to get into the honors program which I still can but that just means I have to give up a class or two on the following(which I would take during spring before graduation) : Differential Equations(Math 291 at my CC) , and Organic Chemistry II(CHM 242 at my CC). I come from a CC that offers guaranteed admission to good engineering universities like UVA, Virginia Tech, etc. I do not plan to give a lot of background because that is not really my thing plus I want this to be related to mostly academics, but I have gone trough significant trials throughout my life and it has affected my performance. Now that I am here I would like to try to do my best til the end and don't look back. I plan to either go to bio-engineering or chemical engineering. 
So far my transcript looks like :



Fall 2014:

-Precalc w/ trig (5 cr)       A

-College lvl Chem I (4 cr)  B

-English I (3 cr)               B

-SDV(Advising, 1 cr)        A




Spring 2015 :

-Calculus I  (5cr)   C 

-Honors CHM II (4 cr)   W 

-Intro to Eng (2 cr)    A

-Physical Education(Lolz ,required by Cc, 1 cr)    A



* I am extremely ashamed and regretful about this semester, and  realize this may even jeopardize my whole chance about getting into top engineering schools(especially out-of-state) since they don't have the Guaranteed Admission (3.5 and above for engineering majors) like those in-state like UVA OR VTech. 



* For Spring 2015, I decided to enroll into Honors Chm II class, which was fine at the beginning but rigorous, except that semester started severely hard for me financially, I never owned a car which I always had to borrow from my dad and my family is somewhat dysfunctional and that means I had to pay by my own pocket including loans to pay for my fall 2014 and spring 2015 and it limited my amount of credits and that is completely fine except that I have had a negative mindset most of my life. I did not bother to buying books since I had no money because I was worried about my dad having to pay for fixing the cars.My borrowed car broke down by december 2014 and had to rely on getting a ride by half of the semester and could not buy any book since trying to fix the broken down car for transportation was mostly important and therefore could not do much homework and could not mobilize easily. My family is lower-middle class and I am not mad because money is not easy to find. I decided to borrow a car from my uncle by middle of the semester but by then CHM II was too far way plus I did not even know about having the option to borrow a car from my uncle. 

Summer 2015(As of Now, starting next week):(Plan to get all A's )


-Calculus II(5cr)

-Regular CHM II (4 cr)

-Engineering Computer Programming ( 3 cr)

-Communications Public Speaking (elec, 3cr)  

-Engineering Economics ( 2 cr)

--Calculus I? (If they let me retake, max credits at CC 18, if not I guess I will cross out electives mostly likely communications and try to retake even though my CC shows both classes on transcript but will only count latest retake on GPA)



Fall 2015( Future and probably one of most intense due to desire to show application to 4-year Unis)


- Physics I (5 cr)

- Multivariable Calculus (4 cr)

- Engineering  Electric Circuits I ( 3 cr)

- Honors BIO 101 (saw Berkeley's engineering lower division req, so there) (4 cr)

- Honors English Survey of World Lit / or Honors Engl Intro to Lit ( 3 cr)

- Honors Economics Macroeconomics (3 cr)

*I can substitute the last two honors courses for : Organic Chemistry I( I can take it during the spring too) and Linear Algebra (3 cr) (Also towards spring) . I  just wanted to fulfill the honors program and graduate with honors( need social science,math or science , english, plus capstone honors that could take during spring) but if that puts at stake my chance at transfering to other 4 year Uni(specially those out-of-state then I would stick with science and math pre-req.) I know for sure I have to apply to UC Berkeley sometime during the fall if I want to get in the following fall 2016. 

Given the scenario I gave for fall 2016, my Spring 2016 schedule would be :


-Physics II (5 cr)

-Organic Chemistry I (3 cr)

-Engineering Solid Mechanics(Physics and Statistics related) (3 cr)

-Linear Algebra (3 cr)

- Differential Equations (3 cr)

-Engineering Electric Circuits w/Lab (4 cr)

-Honors Capstone and honors humanities class(6 cr, 3 for each in order to graduate with honors)



* If I decide to focus on my pre-req and completely disregard then that means I could get to Spring 2016 with Organic Chem II and have less to overload( cuz fall is 22 cr, and spring is 24 cr)


* Should I focus on most of pre-req or rather take a lot of credits while also getting my pre-req but the thing I wanted to get into the honors program which I still can but that just means I have to give up a class or two on the following(which I would take during spring before graduation) : Differential Equations(Math 291 at my CC) , and Organic Chemistry II(CHM 242 at my CC). 


In conclusion, I have never really been the person I should have been including academics. I mostly hesitated in the past to buy books but now I realize I really need to do all homework if not even more than asked in order to learn more efficiently. I am recently now taking more credits because I have managed to convinced other people to letting me borrow money in order to take those credits. Whether too late or not, I want to take a chance and try to transfer and earn a bachelors. By no shape or form I try to downgrade into thinking that a person like me has a high change of getting into top universities. But I want to see the end of a goal in which I plan to work very hard from now on including more studying and getting more EC's. Thank you, and any response is tolerated.  
","First thing to learn about Berkeley:

Ain't nobody got time to read all that!
That is an incredible amount of information. Really, all that matters is that the classes you take count for transfer credit in the specific major you want to study. It's actually the biggest pain of the experience because you deal with not 1, but 2, separate bureaucracies. 

Aside from that, of course do well in your classes but the real variable is letters of recommendation. You want them to be highly personable and obviously from people who are a)knowledgeable about your field and b) knowledgeable about you. More than the classes you are fretting over you need to do what you can to get 3 of those bad boys lined up by the time you apply. Either by visiting them in office hours, helping in school events, whatever. They need to be academic level unless you have some good industry contact that can vouch some major project you did.

A relevant courseload, a good GPA, and 3 good letters of recommendation really gets you most of the way on their own. 
Hey man, I've transferred and the most important thing is to get pre reqs out of the way. It looks like you're trying to go for chemical engineering so I would heavily recommend not taking any GEs besides English if you want to transfer on time. Berkeley might not be the best place to go for chemical engineering despite the bragging rights. it's also a lot harder transferring as out of state. Pretty reqs over everything else and try to have one or two ECs that you care about. A lot of people who do chem e at Cal end up working in tech in the bay area so if you want a real chem e job it's probably better to look at Midwestern schools like Georgia Tech/UTA/UCB(the boulder one)
I didn't read that, but as far as the priority transfer ladder go, you're like... bottom of the food chain:

1) In-state CC
2) other UC's
3) other 4-year in California
4) Out-of-state 4 years
5) asdfjkl; (maybe?)
6) you
7) probably poor international students who will never ever get in. 

so yeah
haha, true. I shall move it to collegeconfidential.com something like that. My bad brah's, new to reddit. 
Thanks a lot bro,Will take that into consideration especially regarding EC'S and letters of recommendation.  And sorry for stating all the information above, I just wanted to be more specific so people could look and give their opinion more in-depth. I will focus on mostly my major and will try to show any 4 year colleges that I really want to study engineering. I guess it really is a marathon, so I will be as persistent as possible. Plus I did not mention that I was considered out-of-state even in this community college (2.5x higher than in-state tuition) because my family situation is  a mess both emotionally and financially(everything is mixed) and that is why i have struggling to take credits once and for all and ensure to keep up to date. I have so many things coming from all sides but I know I will try to make sure I get into a good engineering university and get my bachelors. Im gonna be persistent, work hard and be smart despite future obstacles from now and try to be positive in life overall. 
Also definitely would take out speech/econ classes for math/physics/chem. I've done your schedule before and my best advice is that the turtle always beats the hare. Doing better in classes and enjoying yourself is better than doing mediocre in classes while killing yourself(metaphorically).
Another thing that C in Calc is not repeatable which puts a heavy dent in your gpa. Schools like positive grade trends though but I would seriously advise against overloading because it's really hard to suddenly build up the work ethic to get all As in a semester. You're more likely to fail/get Cs and totally ruin future chances of getting into a good school. Also, unless honors is required by a school, the program is usually not worth it. 
Thanks a lot bro, and yes I will take into consideration. I can definitely do it , i guess overload is never good thing for anybody. For me I guess it should be a marathon, I would even take my chances of securing a good 4 year university near my state by taking about 14 credits per semester and graduate in 3 years. Plus, I really struggle financially so hopefully universities will take that into consideration. Thanks a lot and have a great one. "

You can now get first, second or booster doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at any of a series of Berkeley Public Health clinics over the coming week.

These additional clinics are being scheduled in an effort to bolster the supply from primary vaccination sites: health care providers, local pharmacies and [myturn.ca.gov](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTEyMDQuNDk3NzA2MjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL215dHVybi5jYS5nb3YvIn0.l9dR0z64bmsNbRlzkFuOr0pNjcDF_oTwkkGa4XoFowg/s/1434227999/br/122287972649-l).

Vaccines continue to be the most powerful tool to fight the pandemic, providing strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization.

Booster doses are recommended for everyone who is at least 18 years old and who:

* Received a second Pfizer or Moderna dose at least six months ago
* Received a first dose of Johnson & Johnson at least 2 months ago

The Pfizer boosters being used at these clinics can be used for anyone, regardless of which brand you chose for your first dose, according to [state](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDQsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTEyMDQuNDk3NzA2MjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZHBoLmNhLmdvdi9Qcm9ncmFtcy9DSUQvRENEQy9QYWdlcy9DT1ZJRC0xOS9WYWNjaW5lLUJvb3N0ZXItUUEuYXNweCJ9.9Tgf1zkyxnvRoPMd5YMubEpB-hgkx8XzCI326FN1KSU/s/1434227999/br/122287972649-l)and [federal](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDUsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTEyMDQuNDk3NzA2MjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZGMuZ292L2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLzIwMTktbmNvdi92YWNjaW5lcy9ib29zdGVyLXNob3QuaHRtbD9zX2NpZD0xMTcwNjpjZGMlMjBjb3ZpZCUyMGJvb3N0ZXIlMjBzaG90JTIwZ3VpZGVsaW5lczpzZW0uZ2E6cDpSRzpHTTpnZW46UFROOkZZMjIifQ.9FQ4PUNCRIbuA_kDLuLijYkY8rl2EygodWbqV_EFnM0/s/1434227999/br/122287972649-l) guidelines.

Class Review : Stat 88,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eedwa4/class_review_stat_88/,2019-12-22 18:02:59,"Hello everyone,

Stat 88 received a complete overhaul this semester with a newly written textbook, and an increase to the unit course load from 2 to 3. Given this, I thought I would give a review on the class from the perspective of someone who had never taken AP stats or had any stats exposure.

Also quick disclaimer: Lucas will be teaching this in Spring 2020 so my experience can and will probably deviate from future class's experiences. Additionally, Adhikari kicked out anyone who was not concurrently enrolled in or had not taken Data8 in the past. Also, if you had taken Stat 134/140, she also kicked them out because she said those students would have an unfair advantage and recommended they take other upper div stats courses.

**PEERS:** Anecdotally, I would say a majority of people were pre-haas or cs kids looking to cop a data science major/minor. Also (I'm a transfer), There were also not that many transfer students compared to a class like Stat 20 (which imho, meant tougher competition).

**WORKLOAD:** I would definitely say that the homework and textbook exercises required a pretty considerable time commitment. I'd say pretty much everyone I interacted with in office hours, or before/after lecture hours/discussion peeps I talked to agreed that this should have been a 4 unit class and some kids I talked to also voiced their regret as to not having taken stat 20 instead. And it was kind of hard to justify spending more time on a 3-unit class versus a 4-unit class when obviously the 4-unit class matters more towards our gpa for declaring majors or whatnot --  I'd say this was a pretty big reason in some kids falling behind in material (those taking cs61a/b/etc or other important major-related courses).

**LECTURES:** Honestly, Adhikari lectures -- not much more needs to be said. Though I will say that I knew some kids who stopped/never attended lecture and read the textbook instead and they did perfectly fine.

**TEXTBOOK:** The textbook was written week by week, by Adhikari. Honestly, I was pretty amazed at how thorough and well written the book was for having been written on the fly. Book is really great and definitely did its job. I'm used to math textbooks being useless and resorting to khan academy or w.e., but this book did a really great job.

**QUIZZES AND EXAMS:** Though the homework and textbook exercises were pretty time-consuming, I actually felt like the quizzes and exams were really fair. If you followed along with homework/textbook exercises, you probably did 'ok' at the minimum on these. First midterm had an insanely good performance result because the midterm length was 50 minutes and Adhikari wrote questions to account for time-length. Also there's a clobber policy so the final can replace your midterm grade. Fortunately, I have extreme testing anxiety so I made really dumb mistakes on both.

**GSI/OFFICE HOURS/PIAZZA:** The Course staff was really really outstanding. Plenty of office hours to get help, and they, along with Professor Adhikari were super responsive on Piazza. They were also hiring tutors for next semester, though I did not apply. No criticisms at all about this.

**WOULD I RECOMMEND SOMEONE TO TAKE STAT88?:** Definitely. Though there were times I disliked the workload, I'm so glad to have taken the course and I feel like I'm really prepared for future statistics related courses. I would definitely tell people to not underestimate the course just cause it's 3 units though. Be prepared to keep up with material and homework or you will fall behind because there will be no curve to save you. There's plenty of pre-haas kids who are really grindy for that dank gpa and would be more than grateful to you if you plan on making this class a low priority. Also, this class fulfills the stat requirement for the econ major **AND** can be used for the data science minor, while stat 20 **does not** as far as I know.

**TIPS I HAVE FOR FUTURE STAT88 STUDENTS:** Take advantage of piazza, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Also, it seemed like everyone in the class formed facebook messenger groups and banded together for problem sets and to make study groups so that would be a great idea. This is especially true for those of you who have never had any prior exposure to stats/probability... **READ THE TEXTBOOK**

Anyways overall, I really enjoyed the class and would take it again if I were to go back in time. Feel free to ask any questions if you're curious. This ended up being super rambly, but I really hope y'all don't take this as too whiny and I genuinely hope this class gets the popularity it deserves!","Great review! Would personally like to see more content like this on our subreddit.
This is awesome! Thanks for sharing!
Thanks for the review.

Small correction, seems like Econ still will accept Stats 20. Though I may be misreading the requirements.
I also took the class, and I would second all of this. The most important thing for me was reading the textbook and doing the exercises (I didn't go to lectures). If you read the entire book and do all the questions, chances are you'll understand it pretty well. I didn't really do the homeworks all on my own or study for the quizzes and I got a B on the midterm and ultimately went into the final with a B+, but I studied the book for a solid couple days during dead week and did well on the final (which thankfully clobbered) and got an A. So I'd just say read the book and do the exercises throughout the semester instead of all at once lmao
I second this.
i think they are saying that the data minor will not accept stat 20"

### Life Story:
(excerpts taken from this Washington Post article, linked [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/beverly-cleary-on-turning-100-kids-today-dont-have-the-freedom-i-had/2016/04/02/7a63e92c-e6d4-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.90d8da85d179).)

Beverly Cleary doesn‚Äôt really want to talk about turning 100. ‚ÄúGo ahead and fuss,‚Äù she says of the big day, April 12. ‚ÄúEveryone else is.‚Äù

Across the country, people are delving into Cleary nostalgia, with celebrations and new editions of her books with introductions by the likes of Amy Poehler and Judy Blume. Kids and adults are being asked to ‚ÄúDrop Everything and Read‚Äù to commemorate Cleary‚Äôs contribution to children‚Äôs literature.

But the beloved children‚Äôs author has something far more low-key in mind for herself: a celebratory slice of carrot cake, she says, ‚Äúbecause I like it.‚Äù

Cleary is as feisty and direct as her famously spirited character Ramona Quimby ‚Äî an observation that she hears often and doesn‚Äôt care for. ‚ÄúI thought like Ramona,‚Äù she says in a phone interview, ‚Äúbut I was a very well-behaved little girl.‚Äù

Today, Cleary lives a quiet, well-behaved life in a retirement home in Northern California. She gets up at 7:30 a.m. and spends the day reading the newspaper and books (on her night stand when we talked in mid-March: Alexandra Fuller‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let‚Äôs Go to the Dogs Tonight‚Äù) and doing crossword puzzles. She watches ‚ÄúDoc Martin‚Äù and CNN and enjoys visits with her family. She doesn‚Äôt have a computer, and though she enjoys writing letters, she notes dryly that ‚Äúwhen you get to be 99, there aren‚Äôt many people to write letters to.‚Äù

Cleary‚Äôs last book was ‚ÄúRamona‚Äôs World,‚Äù published in 1999. Her plucky heroine remains frozen at age 9; her sister, Beezus, is 14 and just entering high school. Who knows what Ramona might have been like when she hit puberty. Cleary, for one, is happy to leave her before that nightmare. ‚ÄúI think writers need to know when to retire,‚Äù she says.

Yet Cleary‚Äôs books live on. In January, HarperCollins published new editions of three of her most popular works: ‚ÄúHenry Huggins,‚Äù ‚ÄúRamona Quimby, Age 8‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Mouse and the Motorcycle,‚Äù with introductions by Blume, Poehler and Kate DiCamillo, respectively. There are more than 40 Cleary titles in print, and you can even watch Selena Gomez and Joey King play her two most famous characters in the 2010 movie ‚ÄúBeezus and Ramona.‚Äù

Cleary has won a National Book Award, a Newbery Medal and a National Medal of Art from the National Endowment of the Arts, among other accolades. In 2000, the Library of Congress gave her a Living Legend Award.

Yet she wears her literary stardom lightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just lucky,‚Äù she says. Throwing zingers ‚Äî ‚ÄúPeople tell me I don‚Äôt look a day over 80‚Äù; ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt expect me to analyze my books!‚Äù ‚Äî she‚Äôs both modest and outspoken.

Perhaps these qualities are a product of her upbringing. Born Beverly Bunn in rural Oregon, she spent much of her early life doing farm work. When her family moved to Portland, she says, ‚Äúcity life was a shock.‚Äù

During the Depression, Cleary attended Chaffey Junior College in Ontario, Calif., where tuition was free. To help pay for the rest of her education, at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Washington, she worked a variety of jobs ‚Äî including as a seamstress and a chambermaid.

She struggled through her classes with poor eyesight; her mother denied her money for glasses because she feared it would spoil her daughter‚Äôs appearance. Eventually, her mother relented ‚Äî to no ill effect on Beverly‚Äôs love life. In 1940, she eloped, marrying her longtime sweetheart Clarence Cleary, who died in 2004.

Cleary‚Äôs first book, ‚ÄúHenry Huggins,‚Äù was published in 1950. Based loosely on a story she had overheard while working at a military hospital library, the book (originally titled ‚ÄúSpareribs and Henry‚Äù) came slowly. And it was, at first, rejected by her publisher. As Cleary reworked it, she added Beezus and Ramona ‚Äî the latter a name she heard being called out by a neighbor ‚Äî to the mix.

Her own children ‚Äî twins Marianne and Malcolm ‚Äî born five years later, inspired the book ‚ÄúMitch and Amy‚Äù and even helped shape that story.

‚ÄúMy son pointed out that you cannot ride a bike with a banana in your hip pocket,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo I did take that out. I didn‚Äôt want my character to have a squashed banana in his pocket.‚Äù

As she approaches 100, Cleary still talks about her characters as if they are friends. Even if she doesn‚Äôt want to be compared to Ramona, she confesses that the spitfire is her favorite. The charming and better-behaved Ellen Tebbits is a close second. She would have both girls over to dinner, she says, ‚Äúbut not at the same time.‚Äù

Ramona, she says, has to some degree been misunderstood. It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs naughty, Cleary says, it‚Äôs that ‚Äúthings just didn‚Äôt work out the way she thought they should.‚Äù But for her creator, things pretty much have.

‚ÄúI live in a very pleasant place with a very nice room that looks out on trees and rabbits and birds,‚Äù she says. She has her books, her newspaper, her family and her memories. Bring on the carrot cake.","There‚Äôs also the residence hall named after her with a picture of her in the lobby (also happens to be a fabulous place to live too!). Thanks for this series, pretty cool to hear these stories and keep it up
I loved reading her books when I was in elementary. Didn't know she was an alum, that's awesome!
*Ramona the Pest* was my first completed chapter book as I was learning English. 
I love Clearly. Her books were the shit."

## **Student's Piazza post**

> **Discussion: Why is Berkeley CS so highly ranked?**
> 
> I know Berkeley is in the top trifecta of CS schools, along with Stanford and MIT. I emailed Prof. Sahai recently, and he mentioned Berkeley is the #1 CS program, alongside MIT. I'm wondering what makes our program so highly regarded. I haven't studied at any other programs, so I can't compare them to ours.
> 
> I can only think of two ways to quantify a school's ranking: accomplishments and people. For the first one, we created Spark, we created floating point representation (IEEE 754), we created BSD, we created RISC CPUs, we created robot legs, we created RAID.
> 
> For the second one, we have Prof. Michael Jordan (top ML researcher in the world), Prof. Andrew Ng Prof. David Patterson, Prof. Richard Karp (wrote the paper on NP reductions), Bill Joy, Eric Schmidt, Gordon Moore, Jim Gray, etc.
> 
> 1. What else makes our CS program so highly ranked? Have you experienced anything that made you feel ""Wow, this is an amazing school""?
> 
> 2. How does our undergrad CS education compare to that of other schools' students? What makes us different?
> 
> Hoping to open a productive discussion on this topic.

## **First Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> Also wondering about this since you'd think that the best CS program teaches CS much better than at other schools, or that maybe the best CS program has the best professors, or the most resources for its students. But do we really learn CS at Cal better than at some other UC? Are the professors here better at teaching than at other schools?
> 
> Sure, we have notable people on the faculty team, but does that really translate to having a CS program that's better than at other schools? Is the access to some of the best minds in the world really the thing that makes students' learning experience better here than at other UCs? Do other UCs not also have great faculty? 
> 
> Perhaps our high ranking is caused by the fact that this is a selective university (because a ton of students apply yet there's limited space) so naturally only the top performers get admitted, thereby making this university appear it has a good CS program even though it's merely the students who are top-notch as a whole, and can accomplish more, on average.
I'd like to draw a connection to elementary/middle/high schools in my neighborhood: some of them are known to be ""good schools"" because of high test scores or whatnot. So does that mean they are better at teaching? Are the teachers better there? Or is it just that these ""good schools"" are in better parts of town and so the students who attend these schools are more privileged and have the resources to focus on their education?
> 
> I think the same thing is happening at Cal and at any other university that receives a lot of applicants: There's limited space so only the top people (however you want to define it) are admitted. When you have a bunch of top people in a school, naturally it's better. Naturally, great achievements happen at that school. Naturally, more people want to apply because they hear about the school's achievements. Naturally, more professors want to apply. Naturally, the school only lets the top professors in. Naturally, those top students graduate and as a whole make more money. Naturally, those top-notch alumni can donate more money back to the school. Naturally, the school has more money to fund its amazing students and professors. Naturally, it's a ""great school"".
> 
> Now of course, this cycle has to start somewhere. I believe that it started because this university, and so many other ""top"" universities, are old and have had time to grow. And then when other universities pop up, naturally, prospective students are skeptical of them until they're established, and so prospective students naturally apply to established universities before they consider the newly created institutions. Naturally, this more established university has a lower admittance rate than newer universities. Naturally, a lower admittance rate gives off the vibe it's a better place, and naturally the university can only admit the top applicants who achieve more, on average, than students at less selective universities. And there, we're in that cycle.
> 
> Key realization: When ""top"" universities go around the county encouraging students to apply, it's not because they need to get their name out and convince students that they are good universities. They are already well known. Everyone already knows they're Ivy league or whatever. I believe it's mainly to get more people to apply so they can boast lower admittance rates. Because, come on now, you can't tell me you haven't looked at the admittance rate of a school to see ""how good"" it is.
> 
> I'm sure my opinion is not shared by all. I'm looking for further discussion and to possibly change my views on the matter :)

A student replied:

> OP here - thank you for your thoughts. I have to disagree that our CS program is prestigious due to our low admit rate. Berkeley admits 17% of applicants each year, which is far higher than any Ivy League school or Caltech/Stanford/MIT.
> 
> Yet Berkeley is said to be better at CS than all but two of those schools. In fact, the only reason people think these other schools are more prestigious than Berkeley is because they have lower acceptance rates.

So Cal and many of the Ivy Leagues and UCLA, Stanford, and CalTech are also said to have good CS programs -- and they all have low admission rates. It seems that almost every school that has a ""good CS program"" has a low admission rate. No? So for the most part, I'd say that schools with a ""good CS program"" admit only the top students.

Not all rankings are meaningless, and even the most questionable ranking system probably has some truth in it. Its not logical to just dismiss these rankings because its unclear exactly how they measure a school's quality. I'm also curious why you think these notions are ""baseless"" and ""evidence-less.""

I mean, clearly living in the US is better than living in some poor country in the middle of a war, but if someone came out with rankings about which countries are the best to live in, would you believe their rankings? I wouldn't. If they tell me italy is two places ahead of germany or that Japan is 5 places worse than Australia I wouldn't believe them because they don't know enough. They can quantify rankings based on their own preferences but they can't tell me where is the best place for me to live . They're all good enough countries! The best country for me to live in depends on my own preferences. And on top of that, it really depends where I live in said country, and how I live, and so many other factors.

> OP, I think you are trying to extract too much from these rankings. I completely agree with you that comparing schools based on single-digit ranking difference is a subjective matter, and people should perform their own research to figure out what they want from a school. However, the fact that no ranking system can these subjective opinions is not be a reason to disregard the rankings completely. They do their best to capture the differences between schools.

A student replied:

> There is some good discussion going on here, especially with regards to how much we should regard rankings. I think a high ranking (in a particular subject) is more indicative of the faculty quality. Indirectly, this attracts top students, and hence, after years of this process, sometimes some people want to go to a particular school because of who they might be surrounded by (this includes other students, not just instructors). Along the lines, this gets blurred as an outright reason to attend the school, when it probably shouldn't; because, as stated above, going to a higher ranking school does not therefore mean you are learning CS ""better"". Being in a better ""environment"" however, thats kind of subjective, and entirely is based on what someone deems ""better"".
> 
> I picked Cal EECS over schools some people may not have (a couple ivies included; not bragging just making a point). Whereas someone else might have gone to the highest possible ranked undergraduate university they were accepted to. Are my reasons better? I don't know, I don't think so. So to the OP's point about what makes a school better, I think these things are indeed subjective and it may not be possible to extract a host of useful information. Not because they are doing an inadequate job at making the rankings, rather, some people just care about different things when it comes to picking a school. The rankings may ""try"" to capture that, but as most people may agree, its still incomplete.

I suppose I take issue with the fact that yes, the rankings are opinions that could be plain wrong and yet, I think, ever since they've started coming out annually, it's been an obsessive race to get into the top universities. People take them to heart too seriously. So in a sense, the fact that people take them so seriously, makes me want to hold them up to a high standard. But, at the end of the day, they are indeed just opinions of some people working at a news outlet. They never promised to be accurate. I should chill.

> 
> 5. The schools that you hear commonly about (living in CA) aren't all ranked highest. UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara aren't regarded super highly in rankings but you hear about them a lot. I'm sure they have decent grad and retention rates. Nitpicking who has a few percent higher here or there doesn't matter. They're all great. Seriously, if your school makes it to the us news rankings, how worse can it possibly be compared to the top 30 in the rankings? Also, UT austin is 56 in the rankings and you see it as highly ranked--so yeah, whatever. the 56th position is also great. And so is 57th and 58th and so on. I really think if a school is known enough to be in the top 100 it's good. As long as enough people (students, faculty, and administrators) apply to be part of learning, teaching, and managing the school, it will be a good place b/c the school will be able to pick the best people out of those who apply. And the cycle of greatness kicks off from there.

Urgently need help w a cs course question,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14kqqh3/urgently_need_help_w_a_cs_course_question/,2023-06-27 14:52:04,"I'm a second year, hoping to declare CS. I had no CS background before Berkeley, and took CS10, which I did really well in. After that, I signed up for 61A, but I ran into some health problems that made it impossible for me to do well in it(I was looking at a B-/B) so I late dropped and decided to either take it this summer or next fall with 61B(and an easy breadth) since I have a fantastic background now. If I take it this summer, I can finally get rid of the requirement(and declare cogsci this fal). However, I'm doing an intense abroad summer research program and I genuinely just don't know if I can spend enough time on 61A. If I wait until fall, I think there's a really good chance that I'll do well in both classes, and I can spend the summer prepping for 61B as well so I have a good platform for both. I can also register for DSP, which will accomodate for my health issues and make it easier for me to get a good grade. This way I can also enjoy being abroad this summer. The only downside with that is that it's pretty intense, and I'll probably have to take math 54 next summer which is kinda bummy, but I'm planning to take it at cc so it shouldn't be too bad. When should I take 61a?  I have until June 30 to drop 61A for the summer.","Would not take it alongside 61B if you‚Äôve only taken CS10. Just take 61a in the fall, 61B in the spring. Better to be ‚Äúlate‚Äù than struggle and get bad grades
If you've already learned all of the material in 61A, taking both simultaneously is possible
If you are abroad during the summer, I am pretty sure you can't take 61A because most classes don't offer remote exams.
Tldr?
ive taken 61a too, until the last week and i was looking at a B grade, that‚Äôs why i think it‚Äôs smart to just prep even more and knock both out
Dude has 61a knowledge and is contemplating whether to take it this summer or in the fall w 61b because they have some large time commitment thing in the summer
Bruh idk how I forgot that ‚ò†Ô∏è but 61B is a very time-intensive course, so doing both is gonna take a lot of work. I think it‚Äôll be Justin Yokota‚Äôs first time instructing 61B solo, so no one knows how he‚Äôll handle the class, but he is known for being hard in other classes. 

Someone else who had been in a similar position should speak on this, though.
Bad idea. Baaaaaaaad idea. Just do what the other person says and take both separately
Thanks üíÄ OP wrote a whole ass essay.
even if i took it already though? i mean realistically ive done all the hw's and projects for 61a so i dont see how it can be that time intensive

I‚Äôm in L&S, intending to declare CS. I am wondering how this schedule sounds.

CS61A
COGSCI 1
COLWRIT R4B (*)
+Either a seminar / non-STEM breadth class

I also have some questions lol...

1. (*) Relating to the English class, which I need to take to satisfy the B part of the English requirement (assuming I got a 4+ on the AP Lang Test)‚Äî is the college writing class a heavy class? Or does anyone have recommendations for lighter English classes that fulfill the second half of that English requirement?

 I would like to focus on CS61A a lot and am worried that having too difficult of other courses will bring me down. I usually find English to be one of my stronger subjects, but taking a harsh English course alongside CS and COGSCI might make it more difficult.

2. Has anyone taken Intro to Cogsci (COGSCI 1)? How is it? I‚Äôm hoping, since it‚Äôs introductory, that it won‚Äôt be rough. 

3. Does anyone know of any lighter breadth requirement classes I can take to fill the last spot on my schedule? Perhaps something that isn‚Äôt too difficult to get a good grade in? I need some padding, lol.

4. This is for future reference, but if I do declare CS, I‚Äôd have to take EE16A/B, I think. To anyone who has taken that series‚Äî thoughts? I know that‚Äôs only a problem if I actually am able to declare CS, but the whole electrical engineering thing sounds a bit scary to me. I‚Äôve never explored circuits, engineering, whatever... and that doesn‚Äôt sound like something I‚Äôd be good at (I loathe physics, literally). I‚Äôm prematurely freaking out about EE16, so I‚Äôm wondering how that one is.

Thanks... I know I have a lot of questions. Sorry :/ I‚Äôm just trying really hard to make the right schedule decisions. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks again! ","You cannot take cog sci 1 this semester unless you are a declared major :( sorry! 
As a freshman I don't think you'll get into Cogsci 1, it fills up fast, and ee16a is easy after you take math 54
Which is why EE 16A + Math 54 is no longer accepted for L&S CS

I'm an incoming transfer for Fall 15 and had a few questions I was hoping I could get answered. 

1. Should I look for any summer/fall positions at cal (whether its work or research) right away? do you guys know of any resources I could use to try to find these kinds of opportunities?

2. I'm planning on taking summer classes, but most of the ones I'm interested in taking are all full and have a waitlist of about 6-10 people (for classes with a total of 30-40 people). Should I still sign up for them or are my chances slim of getting into these classes?

3. As a transfer student, when do I get full access to bMail/school email access? I'm thinking of applying as a reader for a summer course as well, and have contacted the person in charge of hiring already; she told me to sign up through a link she gave (and that they'd be finalizing the hiring by May end), but everytime I try to apply through the given link, it says its unable to validate my CalNet credentials. Do I need to wait till CalSo to get it validated, or should I try to email/call someone at the admissions office to talk to them about this?

Thank you kindly for your answers :)","1. I got research starting the summer I was accepted/transferred.

2. Don't take summer classes if you want to get started on research (in my opinion)"
