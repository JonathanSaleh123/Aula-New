"Cal Sailing Club apparently facing eviction from Berkeley Marina sailboat dock, by City of Berkeley",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cjddvb/cal_sailing_club_apparently_facing_eviction_from/,2024-05-03 09:48:06,"The Cal Sailing Club apparently has used six slots for its small sailboats at the Berkeley Marina for about 50 years. The Berkeley City Manager has now proposed evicting them so those spaces can be rented to larger private boats for more profit for the City.

I should say that I'm *not* a part of the Cal Sailing Club and not familiar with the details of this particular controversy, but the organization has a good reputation and focuses on providing low cost or free opportunities for sailing on the Bay and teaching people to sail. And they make a compelling case in their petition (see links below). They say they provide 2,500+ people with free rides / sails on the Bay a year, and have 1,100 ""active annual memberships"". They need their specific current location so their small sailboats can *""maneuver in and out of the marina under sail.""*

I should also add that I'm not surprised to see the City wants more money here. This is part of a long term pattern. Key people on the City staff, IMHO, are focused primarily on ""generating revenue"", often undermining or killing popular community activities as a side effect. The popular Berkeley Kite Festival which thousands of people attended every July, and was held adjacent to the Marina in Chavez Park was done away with in this same sort of way, with the City suddenly demanding vastly increased fees for hosting the festival.

The Sailing Club has a petition on [Change.org](http://Change.org), here:

[https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-eviction-protect-community-sailing-preserve-cal-sailing-club-s-j-dock-berths?recruiter=1337151460&recruited\_by\_id=1c7247e0-029c-11ef-9a74-479723f0d238&utm\_source=share\_petition&utm\_campaign=share\_petition&utm\_term=share\_petition&utm\_medium=copylink&utm\_content=cl\_sharecopy\_490028321\_en-US%3A8](https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-eviction-protect-community-sailing-preserve-cal-sailing-club-s-j-dock-berths?recruiter=1337151460&recruited_by_id=1c7247e0-029c-11ef-9a74-479723f0d238&utm_source=share_petition&utm_campaign=share_petition&utm_term=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_content=cl_sharecopy_490028321_en-US%3A8)

And in the petition there's a link to a letter from the Sailing Club that gives a lot of details about their history, and problems with the City's proposal.","If you live in Berkeley, also recommend contacting your city councilor about this! They're supposed to represent their constituents.
the berkeley city manager has such a history of ruining anything community oriented. fuck them they suck
This is alarming.
Berkeley city council are such ghouls
Worked as a day leader at CSC while I was a student. It is still the best and coolest job I’ve ever had.
This is possibly the most evil thing I've ever heard the city council doing lmao. The Sailing Club helps so many students learn to sail, and they want to kick for them out for rich people yachts? WTF lmfao?

And I guarantee you they wouldn't allow the marina to expand if the marina wanted. They've probably denied construction permits hundreds of times.
I would imagine that a vastly more effective way to engage on this topic would be to get involved with the Waterfront Specific Plan. The actual controversy arises in section 2.3.2 in the draft plan

>The plan at right illustrates the potential for docks D, E, J, L and M to be reconfigured to allow for larger slips. This change reflects market analysis that demonstrates reduced demand in the Bay Area for smaller slips. Adjusting the balance of slips to reflect demand for larger slips is intended to reduce vacancy rates at the Marina and increase berthing revenue.
Everybody Ling Ling!
Get rid of these tit sucking, tax milking, destroy our local traditions and fun folks and elect people who can make a difference.  Berkeley:  Your fault for electing these non-forward thinking people!
This sub suddenly not a fan of market dynamics when the victims aren't poor people in tents. Weird.
If Cal would pay more, I’m sure they wouldn’t get evicted. This is how it works everywhere in the world, sometimes prices go up, and if you don’t pay the prices, you don’t get to keep the service.
Second this. And this November Vote accordingly!
It sounds like the City staff are the culprits in this case. Hopefully the Council will listen to the petition.
Me too
> The Sailing Club helps so many students learn to sail

How many?

I took a paid, community, sailing class with them a few years ago. It was so terrible. The instructor was such a complete asshole.

I don't know that the org deserves to die because I had a bad experience. But I can certainly believe that (like a lot of non-profits!) they're very inefficient, and a poor use of public space.
Non-profits often get reduced rates.
Yeah, but they offer a public service. No one else wants to offer it, or do it more efficiently. So you might as well be calling for that service to never be offered. Maybe that’s fine for leisure stuff but there are a lot of non-profits that provide incredibly invaluable resources.
Not sure why you are being downvoted, this is a good point. I'm not sure how many students / club members they have.
""Public service""? The Cal Sailing Club isn't free, or even close to free.

But they are freeloading on the Cal name and on this land that belongs to the City (and citizens) of Berkeley.

Maybe they provide a worthwhile cost-efficient service to a large number of people, and should continue to exist. Maybe they shouldn't. Let's look at it through data. I object to the kneejerk narrative that government bureaucrats are obviously wrong in every case, no need to examine the merits.

(*) Freeloading -> paying far less than market value
Every weekend there are dozens of people there, and many of them get to go sailing for the first time for very little money
Dude it’s $90 for 3 months of unlimited sail time, they give you gear to borrow and everything. Every Thursday evening they also buy pizza and beers and you are free to eat if you want. With a Berkeley clipper card you can take the 51b down from campus for free. Sure, the folks on the Monday courses are not always the most coherent, but every single instructor is a volunteer, and is paid in food at most.

If you go 2x per week (say Saturday/Monday + Thursday) for 3 months (about one semester) you will come out to about to about 3x4x2 = 24 sessions with at least around 48 sail hours, if not more as well as around 10-12 meals. Moreover, signing up as a member entitles you to the weeklong junior skipper course which is much more intense than the casual sail lessons you get most of the time, provided you can rig your own boat and you do a couple of volunteer hours (when I say a couple, it literally means 2 and you can use that time to learn something useful like bosuning). Moreover, if you log 12 hours of volunteer time, you get a free renewal for your membership.

I get that the members of the club are a bit weird sometimes, but it sounds like you just didn’t want to put in the work of learning the theory by yourself (which literally everyone tells you to do) and are sh*tting on the sailing club because you had a bad experience. It is an incredibly cost effective service and I personally learned how to sail well enough to compete in some serious regattas more recently because of how much freedom I had to do what I wanted in the club. Each of the boats they have is easily $10k-20k or more and most sailing clubs will charge a whole lot more than Cal Sailing does for upkeep and maintenance."
Rescind??,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d4hw7h/rescind/,2024-05-30 16:46:14,"I am completing my high school within a week and will graduate fulfilling all terms of admission, however I had an AP Calc course that I am still taking outside of my high school. It won't be done by the time i graduate high school, but will be complete by the deadline of July 1st when transcripts are due. Is this an issue? I am stressed, so please let me know what to do.

here are the documentation requirements: 

# DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

* All final, official documents must be received or postmarked by **July 1, 2024**. Request electronic delivery, if available, and follow sending instructions on our [Transcripts page](http://admissions.berkeley.edu/transcripts).
* **Final, official proof of high school/secondary completion** *must include date of graduation/completion*. (Request this transcript before the end of your senior year).
* Students completing secondary school in another country will be required to submit the final results of their exit exams and/or completion certificate. (Review the [by-country list](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/international-applicants/applying-for-admission/freshman-requirements-country.html) to ensure that you are submitting all required documents by the deadline).
* Send us all official test scores:
   * SAT Subject Test (if applicable)
   * Advanced Placement and/or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination results
* You are responsible for monitoring your CalCentral task list and email accounts for status changes, admissions updates, and notifications; and working with your sending institutions and campus to resolve any delivery problems.

and here is info on cancellation of admission:

# CANCELLATION OF ADMISSION

**Your admission to Berkeley may be immediately revoked or modified if we determine:**

* You did not satisfy **all** of the above conditions
* You did not respond to our communications regarding missing documents and updates.
* Any information you have submitted on your application for admission was not verified by received official documentation.
* You completed any college/university coursework after high school graduation (except for summer session coursework immediately following high school graduation).","Shouldn’t be an issue, quite often you have public high schools complete classes near the end of June because of unforeseen circumstances.  You should submit an update on your portal stating that your AP Calc course transcript submittal will be late because the class doesn’t end until _____.
It’s self paced though, as it is an online class.
I will submit the transcript on time (by July 1), just not sure if I was supposed to have completed it before high school graduation.

Can't declare Psychology because of Prereq GPA and now I feel hopeless.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d2qibo/cant_declare_psychology_because_of_prereq_gpa_and/,2024-05-28 11:26:04,"I have currently finished my second year and  second semester at Berkeley. As mentioned in the title, I've recently  filled out a major declaration form in Psychology, hoping to declare the double major before phase 2 so I can enroll in Upper Divisions. I've passed all the preqs required to declare Psychology with a passing letter grade with a ""C"". With that,  I've also submitted the declaration form as soon as I received my final grades on CalCentral. But, this morning I've received an email from the psych department that they couldn't sign me off because my prereq GPA wasn't high enough. The department then asked of me to submit an appeal by July 1.

I plan on completing the appeal this month, but I honestly believe that I don't have great luck with my appeals. Receiving that email gave me a major blow to the head, as if all the work that I've done throughout my years of Berkeley were for nothing.  And I feel behind compared to everyone else who has declared my major. I really don't want to consider changing majors because I was so fixated on Psychology in the first place while I was undeclared. My plan was to  explore research opportunities as soon as I declared and pursue grad school, but realistically with this scenario, I find the odds to be quite skim. Is there anything that I should do right now? Or if anybody has some advice about appeals, that would be great too!","You have to have a 3.0+ GPA in all your prereq classes in order to declare.

If you file the appeal and it doesn’t work out, Cog Sci is a good alternative.
Were you unaware of the 3.0 GPA retirement for the prerequisite classes? Did you get a C in all 5 of the classes? If you have two classes that satisfy a category they take the higher grade so take different prereqs next semester and get better grades. 

They require you to declare before your 6th semester so you appear to have one more semester to do well but it should be possible
Just wanted to let you know that I’m sorry you are going through this and I hope you figure everything out soon. Please reach out for mental health support during this time if you need it. CAPS is available to all students regardless of insurance and could be helpful if you don’t already have a support system in place.
Psychology is overrated! You’ll be fine :)
I dislike referrals to mental health when someone actually needs individualized academic attention to figure out next steps.
Other people provided actionable advice with knowledge I couldn’t provide. I wouldn’t have commented this unless I knew that had been provided. Acknowledging the impact of academic hurdles on mental health and recommending a possible place to turn for emotional support is appropriate. Mental health support isn’t the answer but it can be helpful. People pretending that mental health resources will suddenly fix everything is incredibly toxic."
Mailed High School Transcript,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vsz3yn/mailed_high_school_transcript/,2022-07-06 13:03:56,"For anyone else who mailed in their transcript, is your hs transcript task still not checked? I sent it in like almost a month ago now, should I email?

I’m in the same boat. I sent mine in on June 10th and it’s still not checked. I called admissions on June 24th and they said they got it and are processing it. The task still isn’t checked and it doesn’t say anything about being processed, so I might email or call again later this or next week to make sure it didn’t get lost
They told me to call back at the end of July if it is still showing as incomplete.
I contacted my high school in early May to have them sent over and they still say they're being processed (but processed nonetheless, rather than not received at all.) I feel like I really couldn't have gotten that done any earlier and it still isn't saying it's ""completed"" hope that eases your mind a bit haha
Status just changed to “being processed” for mine.
yeah i figured but i was just asking on here to make sure it wasn’t just me lol i dont want my admissions to be rescinded >.<
okay good phew lol i havent called or anything yet but at least i know its not just me
mine just updated to completed! maybe check yours too?
yeah this made me feel a lot better lol! i was rly worried they didnt get it and were gonna like not let me sign up for classes. mine literally just updated to completed though so maybe check yours too!

Maybe some senior professors still hesitating about if they should teach in person or not?

This is like 90% of CS classes > 200 currently:

> This is a 'dual lecture' class. Everyone should enroll into Lecture 01. Once the (adjusted) room capacity is met, all other students will be turned away and can watch the remote lecture.
That is exactly why. It's being taught by Stankova this Fall (source: she told me so).
Borcherds is teaching 250A in person, as is Rieffel for 202A, and they're no spring chickens (no disrespect lol). I guess that could be the issue, but I mean, couldn't they just post the class and just say that it's tba wrt in person/online? Idk. It'd just be cool to actually know if my major classes are being offered more than a couple of days before enrolling.

NEW L&S CS PROPOSAL ACCEPTED,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wh4b5j/new_ls_cs_proposal_accepted/,2022-08-05 12:37:30,"Many people have been wondering about the status of the new CS proposal.

If you create a new application for the upcoming fall semester and select Computer Science, there is now a short sub section about the major (shown in the attached image). When I applied for the most recent cycle for L&S CS, this sub section wasn't there (correct me if I'm wrong).

https://preview.redd.it/4l54kvgm4yf91.png?width=2878&format=png&auto=webp&s=666725c1200df52f8ad7d627bc45a23630983541

1. The crucial line is ""If you are interested in this major, it is very important to select this major on your application."" This VERY likely refers to the direct admit policy in the new CS proposal. Without selecting the major here, it would be very tough to get it otherwise (through the CS discoverer channel mentioned in the proposal).
2. Additionally, if you click the ""Read more about admission to high-demand majors"" link ([https://admissions.berkeley.edu/academics/academic-programs-majors/](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/academics/academic-programs-majors/)), ""Information on College of Letters & Science high-demand majors, coming soon. Check back for updates."" Once more, this likely means that the new CS policy passed as new information about it will soon be published.
3. If you check the internet archive for the page on July 15  (only 2 weeks before the new 22-23 cycle UC app opened) at [https://web.archive.org/web/20220715120350/https://admissions.berkeley.edu/academics/academic-programs-majors/](https://web.archive.org/web/20220715120350/https://admissions.berkeley.edu/academics/academic-programs-majors/), this blurb about high demand majors does not exist. They specifically added it once the application opened, indicating that there was a change between old policy and new policy for L&S majors for the new cycle (i.e CS).

I think this is pretty conclusive evidence that the CS policy was passed. Feel free to share your thoughts below!

&#x200B;

Update: the ""high demand major"" message shows for some other select highly demanded majors as well (Ex: DS/Stats) on the application - L&S might be revamping its admission system for multiple high demand majors, not just CS! Full list: [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wh4b5j/comment/ij3mmff/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wh4b5j/comment/ij3mmff/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)","Nice! Better slightly late than never I guess.
It does that for Data Science as well
I'm more surprised they allowed this school year's applicants to declare an alternative major.  Must be nice.
Yeah Berkeley will probably do something similar to Michigan that makes CS direct admit. Otherwise there're simply not enough resources to support thousands of students who want to study CS.
But if someone was admitted for a different major from last admissions cycle and wants to declare comp sci, this doesn't apply to them, right?
LETS GOOOO!!!!
This doesn't say that not selecting CS will bar you from switching to CS anywhere. They should be more explicit about this point if the policy is approved.
If I was a high schooler who already took 70, would I be able to still declare CS if they just enrollment cap 70 to ppl who put CS/EECS on their application?
I plan to transfer next year as an econ major and once I’m in i would double major in CS. Will this affect transfer students who plan to double major in CS for next year?
Would this proposal impact incoming freshmen or solely the following years?

For example, I was accepted econ but want to double major in econ + cs. Can i still do that under this proposal as an incoming freshmen?
If CS became direct admit, it makes sense that other high-demand majors would follow (esp since DS is decently high in demand). Additionally, for all other majors than some high demand ones it says a diff message: ""You are selecting an intended major; Letters and Science does not admit students directly to majors. For more information on applying to declare this major upon admission to UC Berkeley, please visit the Berkeley Guide.""
There's no proposal for DS to be direct admit though.
[deleted]
Yeah grandfathering generally happens for new policies
That may be because they may preserve a small number of seats for new discoverers but it will be an ultra competitive program for a sophomore admit similar to the current orms or haas bba majors.

In any case, if you are am applicant you have to assume it as admit or bust.
You should indicate CS or EECS on your application. Otherwise, there is no other probable pathway assuming this policy actually goes in place.
I would imagine so but you should definitely reach out to Cal and find out for sure before applying.
Yeah, once you got in you would need to then go through the discoverer channel for CS. The new proposal states that you would be evaluated holistically (grades/clubs/projects/essays?/etc.)
Yes, the EECS dept said they will maintain all current policies for all current students and students admitted from the past cycle (meaning L&S still would allow anyone to major in what they want). This proposal would only affect those in the upcoming cycle afaik.
I’m pretty sure current students would be grandfathered with the current setup.
Yeah I think you are right. Check this out too. If you go to this page

[https://admissions.berkeley.edu/academics/academic-programs-majors/](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/academics/academic-programs-majors/)

it states:

Information on College of Letters & Science high-demand majors, coming soon. Check back for updates. 

Basically L&S is having a massive admission overhaul. 

This is the compilation of the majors that's gonna be affected:



Computer Science

  
Data Science  
  
Statistics  
  
Economics  
  
Psychology  
  
Social Welfare  
  
Operations Research and Management Science  
  
Media Studies  
  
Public Health  
  
Art(Practice of)
There actually is an L&S-wide policy change that was proposed and accepted but although it was accepted, the specific details weren’t 100% fleshed out back in May when I last checked, so no details could be shared as everything back then was subject to change.

I would expect more details to be known now as admissions are upon us but I officially no longer work in the Union so I wouldn’t know these details
All the same, they may decided to put something in place for all high demand majors. If CS wasn't available, its natural to expect much of the unmet demand to shift to DS or Stats.
Yeah apparently they are changing to a more direct policy for the 2023 class as well:  

https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/majors-minors/computer-science-major.html

***Due to capacity constraints, students who are admitted to the University of Michigan in Fall 2023 or later must first be selected for the CS major before they can declare the major.***"

> The changes will happen in three phases:

> Phase I:  Relocate the Fit Staff desk and move more of the “check out” equipment  onto the floor. This means less need to check out equipment!

>Phase II:  Add two more power rack / bench press combo stations (with benches) to the main weight room. Move the Smith Press into the main weight room and remove the bench press from the weight room extension. This will bring our main weight room to five squat / bench press stations and will create more open space for body weight exercises in the extension!

>Phase III:  Replace the old Cybex weight machines in the main weight room with the new Cybex Total Access Selectorized equipment line designed to be more accessible for people with disabilities.

>We expect to complete these changes by mid-July!

Looks pretty good. I hope this will help alleviate the heavy crowds at the gym.","About time!  I always thought it was crazy that 3 racks were in the annex,  blocked off by classes all day.   Do most classes even use them? 
Where is /u/roidbears when you need them?
Any new equipment for the stadium fitness center? They should take out that back wall of cable machine things and put in 3 new squat racks.
Darn, those new racks are going to take up valuable space that could be used for MORE useless cybex trash. /s
I thought RSF was some kind of research computing cluster and this was a post about some new electrical capacity.  I need to get out more.
Now they just need to build another RSF. Berkeley has one of the lowest rec sports square footage per student out of any school in the whole country.
Damn another two racks. Not bad RSF. Not bad. 
this isn't exactly related, but is RSF membership just $10 for students over the summer? or is that only for fall/spring semesters?

International Guidance Out + Question Forum,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hqqq2n/international_guidance_out_question_forum/,2020-07-13 16:51:12,"The guidance from BIO is out.

The full excerpt:

July 13, 2020


Dear Student:

As you may know, on Monday, July 6th, DHS announced new guidelines regarding fall semester enrollment requirements for international students. On Tuesday, July 7th, DHS provided an updated FAQ to the guidance. In response, campus leaders are examining our options and discussing how to respond to and comply with these new requirements.   

Meanwhile, we want you to know that we understand the concern and anxiety that this DHS guidance has caused you and we are going to make every effort to assist you as we address these new requirements. As you may know, legal challenges to the DHS guidance have already been filed in court, and the University of California has filed its own lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief to bar ICE from enforcing the DHS guidance. For now, we must proceed as though the DHS guidance will become a rule and will be in effect. 

We understand that you and your families have urgent questions and concerns about how this will impact you, your fall enrollment, and your F-1 visa status. Although we do not have all the answers yet, we want to offer you as much information as we can about the DHS guidance. Please keep in mind that this information is subject to change based on decisions made by DHS and/or the campus.


Here is what we can tell you at this time:
The July 6th F-1 guidance and July 7th F-1 FAQ from DHS address enrollment requirements of international students based on the university's instructional model for Fall 2020 semester. In the case of Berkeley, as you are aware, the university will be using a hybrid model of instruction. This means that while most course offerings will be delivered via remote instruction, there will be some courses with in-person components. 

Current J-1 guidance is far less restrictive and provides more flexibility for continuing students. Please see J-1 Students with a DS-2019.
 

New and Continuing F-1 Students Currently Outside the U.S.
Whether you are a new or continuing student, you are not compelled to be physically present in the U.S. You may remain fully enrolled through remote instruction while you are outside the U.S. We encourage students who are currently outside of the U.S. to think realistically regarding their ability to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, as ongoing travel bans and consular closures may make it impossible for some students to arrive in time for in-person instruction. 

New F-1 Students: If you DO NOT intend to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, you may enroll in fully remote coursework while outside of the U.S. and Berkeley International Office (BIO) will adjust your I-20 start date. If you DO intend to enter the U.S. for study for Fall 2020, you must meet specific in-person enrollment requirements, and BIO will need to make annotations to your I-20 that are required for entry. See information regarding your in-person enrollment requirement in the New and Continuing Students Inside the U.S. section below.  

Continuing F-1 Students: If you DO NOT intend to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, as of today, our understanding is that continuing students outside the U.S. who will remain enrolled remotely from outside the U.S. will be kept in Active SEVIS status, thus preserving your F-1 status even while you are outside the U.S. If you DO intend to enter the U.S. for study for Fall 2020, you must meet specific in-person enrollment requirements, and BIO will need to make annotations to your I-20 that are required for entry. See information regarding your in-person enrollment requirement in the New and Continuing Students Inside the U.S. section below.   

New and Continuing F-1 Students Currently Inside the U.S.
If you plan to be present in the U.S. for Fall 2020, you must maintain full-time enrollment, including at least one in-person class. In-person enrollment should be appropriate to your academic level and program. Any remote coursework should be part of your degree requirements. If you are unable to meet these requirements, you should depart the U.S. If you are not currently enrolled in an in-person class but desire to be enrolled in an in-person class, contact your academic advisers or graduate department regarding enrollment options, and contact BIO to make sure that you understand all of your visa options before you make irrevocable plans to depart the U.S. BIO will need to make annotations to your I-20 and SEVIS record that indicate you are approved for in-person study in the U.S.

If you wish to drop an in-person class, you must be sure that you continue to comply with the in-person enrollment requirement; otherwise, you should depart the U.S. Failure to do so could mean that you will be in violation of your F-1 status and may be subject to deportation. 

What constitutes an in-person class for immigration purposes?
A course at UC Berkeley may have one or more instructional components. Each course component at UC Berkeley has been coded with a specific “instructional mode.” You may be enrolled in a course that has multiple instructional modes. You can find information regarding course enrollment and how to identify instructional modes on the Registrar’s Instruction FAQ. A course that is “in-person” for visa requirements means that it has at least one course component that has been coded with the following instructional modes:

In-person

Hybrid

Flexible

All 99, 194H, 199, 298, and 299 courses as long as they are coded as In-person, Hybrid or Flexible instructional modes

The current guidance does not place any restrictions on the minimum number of units assigned to an in-person course.

What is a fully remote course for immigration purposes? Which courses do NOT meet the visa requirements for an “in-person” course?
A course that is considered fully Remote for DHS purposes is one that does not include any in-person component. The following instructional modes are considered remote and do NOT meet requirements for an in-person course component:

Remote (Note: All DeCals have been classified with a Remote instructional mode)

Web-based

What about Filing Fee or In Absentia status for Graduate Students?
Filing Fee — Graduate students approved for Filing Fee status should provide BIO with written confirmation about the in-person requirements that have been arranged.

Registration In Absentia — During the In Absentia period, students must remain enrolled in a full-time course load. In Absentia Graduate students must have some course enrollment which includes an in-person component. In Absentia students who wish to meet the in-person standards must provide BIO with written confirmation about the in-person requirements that have been arranged. 

What if I drop in-person classes, or the instructional modes for my course changes?
 
If you wish to drop an in-person course, or if the instructional modes change for your in-person course, you must be sure that you continue to comply with the in-person enrollment requirement. If you are not able to maintain some in-person enrollment, you should depart the U.S. or transfer to another U.S. school that can meet the requirements. Failure to do so could mean that you will be in violation of your F-1 status and may be subject to deportation. If you intend to remain in the U.S., you must continue to have at least one in-person course as part of your full-time enrollment. You will not be permitted to remain in the U.S. with fully remote or online-only enrollment.

What if UC Berkeley changes to a fully remote instructional model for Fall 2020?
In the case that UC Berkeley is forced to change its instructional plan to fully remote at any time during the Fall 2020 quarter due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other local or state public health agencies, then students will not be eligible to remain in the U.S. on a UC Berkeley I-20. If this change occurs, DHS currently indicates the following guidance for students inside the U.S. will apply:

Students who wish to remain in the U.S. will need to take alternative steps to maintain their non-immigrant status, such as transferring to another school offering in-person/hybrid instruction.

Students who wish to depart the U.S. may be eligible to continue maintaining an active SEVIS record as they complete Fall 2020 through remote instruction. 

Embassy and Consulate Openings
Today, Monday, July 13, 2020, the Department of State tweeted the following update from @TravelGov:

""US embassies and consulates are beginning the phased resumption of routine visa services. The dates for each embassy or consulate will depend on local conditions. We are unable to provide details for each location. Please monitor the embassy or consulate website for updates.""

To find embassy or consulate websites, go to https://www.usembassy.gov/. The embassy links get you to the right embassy website, but you will have to do some clicking to find relevant COVID-19 information, as each embassy website is structured a bit differently.

Travel Bans
At this time, all travel bans announced since the start of COVID-19 remain in place. Accordingly, most international students outside the U.S. will still not be in a position to travel to the U.S. even if you are able to obtain a valid entry visa. No information is available as to when the travel bans will be lifted.

J-1 Students with a DS-2019 
New students planning to enter the U.S. for Fall 2020 enrollment: 

Guidance from the Department of State pertaining to the enrollment of J-1 students allows for sponsors to provide an instructional model that is mindful of exposure to COVID-19 while also ensuring that students enroll in some coursework that has an in-person component allowing them to have an opportunity to interact with their American counterparts. Accordingly, new students who intend to enter the U.S. and enroll in classes may do so and enroll in at least one course with an in-person component. For more information about in-person enrollment requirements, see the What constitutes an in-person class for immigration purposes? section above.

Continuing students enrolling in classes for Fall 2020:

Guidance from the Department of State pertaining to the enrollment of J-1 students allows for sponsors to provide an instructional model that is mindful of exposure to COVID-19 without laying out specific enrollment requirements. Accordingly, continuing J-1 students in active status may engage in a full course of study with fully remote courses.
 

Next Steps for All F-1 and J-1 Students:
Instructions & Survey Response: In the coming days, BIO will provide instructions that you must follow to complete a mandatory survey about your plans and intended course enrollment for Fall 2020. This information will assist us in making any necessary changes to your I-20/DS-2019 or SEVIS Record. 

I-20/DS-2019 Updates & Adjustments: After receiving responses to our survey and data from campus regarding student enrollment, BIO will begin making required updates to I-20s/DS-2019s and SEVIS records, including any necessary annotations or start date adjustments. More information about updates and document distribution will be provided soon. We will prioritize document distribution to students needing to enter the U.S. 

BIO COVID-19 FAQ Update: As soon as we can, we will update our COVID-19 FAQ to include updated questions and answers regarding the Fall 2020 instructional model and impacts to student status, travel and entry to the U.S., and F-1 OPT/CPT/ J-1 AT qualification.

Replacement I-20 Requests: Replacement I-20 requests are currently on hold until we have completed the process of updating new and continuing student records with the necessary information to meet DHS requirements. 

NIF: If you intend to enter the U.S. for Fall 2020, please continue to submit your NIF request for processing. We will be placing NIF Fall 2020 I-20s/DS-2019s on hold until we are able to confirm your enrollment and entry plans for Fall 2020.

Travel & Entry to the U.S.: We recommend that all students who intend to enter the U.S. for Fall 2020 adjust their plane tickets and arrival dates to as close to the start of the semester as possible. BIO will work as quickly as possible to update I-20s with the annotations required for entry by DHS and do our best to prioritize student entry dates. If you choose to attempt entry before receiving an updated I-20, you are entering at your own risk. Annotations are not currently required for entry for J-1 DS-2019s, but adjustments will need to be made for new students not attending Fall 2020 in-person. 

As stated earlier, we will follow up with new information and directions you will need to follow as soon as we learn more, so do look out for further communications from BIO. In conclusion, we want to reiterate our support for you and reaffirm that we look forward to welcoming you to UC Berkeley. In the meantime, we hope you stay safe and healthy.","“Continuing F-1 Students: If you DO NOT intend to enter the U.S. for study in Fall 2020, as of today, our understanding is that continuing students outside the U.S. who will remain enrolled remotely from outside the U.S. will be kept in Active SEVIS status, thus preserving your F-1 status even while you are outside the U.S.”

Does this mean that we won’t lose the ability to intern next summer? I’ve emailed BIO to confirm but the reply will be expedited here.
I'm a new international frosh and I've gotten my I-20 but I haven't been able to proceed with my visas yet. Does that make me a ""New F-1 Student"" or am I not accounted for in the email?
Do you mind posting the full guidance, if possible?
Do you think this guidance will be applied to most universities around the U.S are strictly to only some universities?
[deleted]
You're a new student.
Done
What other schools? The international office from my previous community college told me that she’s confident that big universities like Cal will/can find a way to defer your SEVIS rather than terminating it.
Cornell and UMich have both said continuing students outside the US will have their SEVIS record terminated, and they are both doing Hybrid:

Just Another Berkeley Renter's Questions Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13wrglm/just_another_berkeley_renters_questions_post/,2023-05-31 09:48:31,"Hey y'all, I'm an incoming Berkeley Law student and I'm looking for a place to stay off-campus because I'll be living with my partner. I have a pretty generally solid concept of how to go about this, but there are a lot of things about renting in a place like Berkeley that make it very different to the small college town I lived in for undergraduate. Any help with any of these questions (I know I have a lot so no need to try and answer them all) I have would be immensely helpful.

1. I'm looking to move in around early August. As I understand that seems to be the standard. Is there a specific day/week that people tend to move in?
2. If an apartment says that it's available now, or will be available sometime in June or July, what are the chances that I'd be able to reach out and essentially be like ""hey, I want to rent from you but not right now"" and they accept my application? Should I only really look at ones that say they'll be available in early August? I guess to summarize: what's a good yet realistic time frame between looking at an apartment in person, signing a lease, and moving in?
3. Is there a way to approach these rental companies as a student that makes my odds better? I don't know if being a grad student really changes much like I know it does in some places, but I don't want these rental companies blowing me off because I won't be a working professional within the next couple months.
4. Is [Apartments.com](https://Apartments.com) a viable resource? I've been using it quite a bit for perusing the area but it dawned on me that it might not be great for the area, not sure.
5. Do any significant number of students live outside Berkeley in like the Oakland or Richmond area or whatever? Is that really going to be any cheaper?
6. What are some tell tale signs of something ""scammy"" going on with the listing? The signs listed on Berkeley's off-campus housing page about avoiding scams was helpful, but from my experience I know there's a lot of ways that either individual landlords/property managers or property management companies can screw you over.
7. Any neighborhoods to avoid?
8. Simple question: is a lack of AC really that common? How bad is it like that? I'm from the Deep South so no AC sounds like an actual nightmare but I know that the Bay Area has quite a different climate.

Anyways, if anyone has any thoughts on any of these or anything else they can think of that'd be very helpful and you'd have my eternal appreciation <3","I'd generally agree with earlier comments by highliter but add these things:

I think most leases start at the first of the month. Since it's a seller's market, unfortunately the landlord generally has no incentive to give you a deal with a mid-month starting date, or hold a unit for you.

Many parts of Richmond are not good, and some better parts don't have good transit access. But there are neighborhoods in the Richmond hills (east of 80) that are fine, and the ""Richmond Annex"" neighborhood--a little sliver of southernmost Richmond--is OK, as far as I know, and is reasonably close to buses and a BART station. Also look at El Cerrito, city just north of Berkeley, and Kensington (unincorporated area in Berkeley Hills north of Berkeley as well). Mainly single family homes there, but if someone is offering to rent a room in their home or an in-law apartment in their home, it can be worth checking out. Being a grad student will probably be an advantage for you, there.

In terms of bad neighborhoods in Berkeley, there are pockets here and there, but most of the city is fine from my perspective. The general advice used to be the further north or east you are, the better the neighborhood, but those areas are also more expensive. There is some opportunistic street crime in Berkeley, unfortunately, but a lot of it seems to be right around the campus edges where criminals look for easy targets amongst the many students.

As the other comment noted, many undergrads living in Southside and Downtown areas, so those districts will have noise. If you are looking at a Berkeley housing listing, compare it with AC Transit bus routes nearby, to see if you would have a simple commute to the campus area.

(As an overall comment, unlike many universities, Berkeley doesn't really have ""on"" and ""off"" campus housing. The core campus is all academic buildings and non-housing facilities. Most of the residence halls are out on city streets, usually one to four blocks from the campus. So essentially everyone lives ""off-campus"", although there are a couple of dorms on university land east of the  core campus.)

Air Conditioning not a need / issue in Berkeley area. Humidity not at all like the Deep South or Midwest. If the temperature gets above 80 F for more than a day, people here think it's a ""heat wave""(!). Berkeley and the adjoining cities have natural air conditioning--almost every day a breeze comes off adjacent San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, and cools things down for the night. So that's one worry you can legitimately cross off your list.

And yes, welcome to Berkeley and congratulations on getting admitted!
1. The earlier you can afford to get in the better,  you don't want to be stressed out and still getting set-up once classes start.
2. LOL Berkeley Landlords are next level. Its a sellers market, if there is a place you really want but it comes available in June they will not ""hold"" it for you when they could be collecting rent. 
3. In my experience not really, but I always lived walking distance to campus. 
4. Don't know, I haven't used it. I used Craigslist with mixed results but that was 10 years ago. 
5. Yes you can find some cheaper places but commuting can be stressful, especially if you are new to commuting on public transit. In my opinion you want as little additional stress as possible, for me being able to walk to campus was a big part of that. Do you want to be worried about the homeless guy on the bus sitting next to you smoking crack right before your exam on Civil Procedure? 
6. Google the shit out of everyone and everything. Most landlords are scummy so if you can find an average one you are doing great. Application fees are a common scam, also making up bullshit  reasons to keep your security deposit.  Ideally you can go in person and basically close a deal with the landlord on the spot. 
7. South side right by campus is loud at night if that bothers you. I'd stay out of Richmond altogether. Also stay out of Oakland around 880. North Berkeley, Claremont and Rockridge are good and would be close to campus.  
8. Yes, not much humidity here. Spend a few hundred on portable unit for your room if you are worried about it. 

Congrats on Berkeley Law and good luck!
Thanks for all the tips! I had a hell of time dealing with the property management company in undergrad which makes me feel like I'm gearing up for the final boss from everything I've heard about metro area renting, so this was massively helpful."
Chancing a Martinez Apartments Spot as a Transfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/noqo7o/chancing_a_martinez_apartments_spot_as_a_transfer/,2021-05-30 19:36:45,"What are the chances of getting an offer for a single in the Martinez Commons apartments as a transfer? I selected the two single options along with a single in Channing Bowditch, a double in the Wada apartments, and the ""any room"" preference in my housing application. If I don't receive an offer for any of the above, would they prioritize me for another apartment option based on my preferences, or would my assignment be random? Also, can I resubmit my application if I want to change my room preference to another apartment?

I started looking for housing the day I was accepted but have gotten really discouraged the last couple weeks–the Co-ops have super long waitlists, I've yet to receive a response from any of the Craigslist listings I've replied to, and the Facebook account I made to join the off-campus housing group was just disabled (for no fucking reason). I think I'd enjoy the middle ground between living on campus and having the ""autonomy"" of being in an apartment, so I'm considering holding off on looking for off-campus housing until mid-June (when housing offers apparently go out) since I don't want sign a lease out of fear of not finding a place and then have to break it if I receive an offer.

Obviously, the problem with this would be that if I don't receive a housing offer (or receive one for a dorm and not an apartment) I'd have to scramble even harder to find off-campus housing. Does anyone have experience looking for off-campus housing in June/July, or experience in on-campus housing somewhere else as a transfer?",Me tooooo. In the exact same boat as you. Housing is so overwhelming rn.
anyone interested in postal service tickets?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gzgg8/anyone_interested_in_postal_service_tickets/,2013-06-24 11:44:31,"i'm not sure if this is the best place for this or not, but i have 4 tickets to the upcoming postal service show at the greek theater (july 26).  i live in LA and was initially planning on making a road trip of it with some friends and seeing the show and spending the weekend in the city.  alas, plans have since changed and the friends who were initially going to be accompanying me -- no longer are.  

so if anyone out there is interested in going to the show and was going to buy tickets -- maybe consider buying mine?  i'm not looking to make a profit or anything, just sell them at face value.  ","According to [the Postal Service](http://postalservicemusic.net/tour/) website, that date seems to be sold-out. Opening act is Big Freedia, for anyone interested.
How much are you asking?
$60 each.  tickets were $45 and then there was a $15 service charge for using ticketmaster. 
Could you match stubhub? They're currently going for $44 including all fees
there's a $5 charge. i saw some for $44 so + $5=$49 basically.
They got rid of this charge pretty recently. Now it's pay what you see

In a toxic relationship :C sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mh1xi5/in_a_toxic_relationship_c_sad/,2021-03-31 01:57:48,"In the beginning, I was so happy. March 26th… It was the day I found love. The words “congratulations” made me feel warmth. It caressed me like.. no other. It couldn’t compare to any of the previous relationships I had. It was genuine love. I loved it, and it loved me. Our relationship and fantasizing only grew with each passing day. July 16 was a special moment in our lives. I asked... if it would love me more if we took the exit to 61a. We also stopped by on the way to exit 70 as it was its favorite. I could hear its excitement and approval. Little did I know, our relationship was a lie…   
Fast forward to August 26. It was a huge moment in our relationship. I finally set foot inside of it. There, I saw the huge thing shoot up-right. It was known to ring every hour at the sound of the hourly bell. It was indeed, a joyous moment filled with comfort. We would laugh in the glade, and bask in the hopeful light that ran down on us.

It all started to turn for the worse proceeding the weeks of August 26. All of a sudden, it started to demand more from me. It became more ruthless. It changed… My mental demeanor dropped from a smile to horror. Everyday, the mental smacking and abuse hit me in the head. But, in the end, I would obey without question as it was my everything. Nothing could separate us. It owned me. There was no escape….. At least, not for the next 4 years.

Since then, every week I shuddered in fear. I heard it… The steps of the p\* sets approaching. I covered my ears and my eyes. No.. I repeated No.. Still, it would take me my force. I had no power or authority against it. I lied there helplessly as p\* set after set I would get f\*\*\*\*ed up. Sometimes, it was multiple at once. The f\*\*\*ing only grew stronger with each new p\* set. It hurt. I was in horror. Each one f\*\*\*ed me up so hard that after each set, I just lie there.. twitching with nothing left inside of me. Still, I gave it everything. I let it have all of me. I embraced it and then it came… It was like a deep longing has always been there...

Sahai.. I repeated. Sahai. A worship of fever overcame me.  It whispered to me: “mathematical maturity”. Suddenly, the pain stopped. I saw a whole new world. It was the... cure to my misfortune and misery. I told myself that I would endure this relationship. For one day, it will end… and I will make it to the end of the light.  
In the end, it was never a sincere relationship… please do not fall into a toxic relationship.

Ps: Sorry for bad grammar (im not good at english), and don't mind me :D",Mathematical. Maturity.

Special effects inventor and engineer Petro Vlahos, whose industry contributions made possible such iconic film moments as Julie Andrews dancing with penguins in the 1964 classic MARY POPPINS, died Sunday. He was 96.

Petro Vlahos was born on August 20, 1916 at Raton, New Mexico. After graduating in Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1941, he became a designer at Douglas Aircraft during the Second World War.

After working as a radar engineer at Bell Laboratories, he joined the Motion Picture Research Council, spending six months devising a complex laboratory process that separated blues, greens and reds before recombining them. The result — his patented “colour-difference system travelling matte scheme” — created the breathtaking visual effects in Ben-Hur . Having minimised the unwanted “halo” side-effect that had dogged earlier attempts, he modified the technique to work on green screens as well as blue.

While others had grappled before with so-called “composite photography”, overlaying shots of separately-filmed actors on background sets, the results were never totally convincing, with actors often appearing to glow in a halo of light that spoiled the effect.

Vlahos moved the process forward, first for the spectacular chariot race in William Wyler’s 1959 remake of the epic Ben Hur, and later for the charming penguin dance in the Disney musical Mary Poppins (1964).

The techniques that Vlahos perfected in such pictures were applied in many subsequent science-fiction and fantasy films, including the first Star Wars trilogy between 1977 and 1983. Unfortunately, shooting for some of the special effects in Star Wars took place during the hottest British summer for many years. The blue-screen process required giant arc lights, making the sets stiflingly hot: electricians fainted, and the actor playing Chewbacca, clad in a body suit of angora wool and yak hair, collapsed from heat exhaustion and dehydration.

Vlahos and his collaborators won an Academy Award for their composite processes in 1965, and with his son, Paul, he shared another Oscar in 1995 for the blue-screen advances made by Ultimatte, the company he founded in 1976.

His original concepts and innovations have been enhanced and expanded over the years, making possible entirely seamless composites which preserve fine details such as hair, smoke, mist, motion blur and shadows while automatically suppressing “blue spill” (whereby light from the blue screen behind washes across the foreground subject).

Refinements of Vlahos’s pioneering technique were used to make many of the blockbuster films of the 1990s, notably Titanic (1997), in which scenes that had hitherto been too dangerous, expensive or difficult to film were finally possible.

Special effects triumphs in contemporary films like Avatar (2009), in which blue-skinned Na’vi dwell among floating mountains, and Life of Pi (2012), in which the tiger, the ocean, and sometimes even the boy Pi himself are digital creations, also derive from Vlahos’s work.

Vlahos had more than 35 patents for camera crane motor controls, screen brightness meters, safe squib systems, cabling designs and junction boxes, projection screens, optical sound tracks and even sonar. He created analog and digital hardware and software versions of Ultimatte. As a result, every green- or blue-screen shot today employs variants of the Vlahos technique.

Visual effects supervisor Bill Taylor paid tribute to Vlahos during the Academy's Feb. 9 Scientific and Technical Awards presentation, where Taylor received the John Bonner Medal of Commendation, the same honor that his mentor had received.

“It's hard to emphasize the importance of his inventions,” Taylor said. “His inventions made a whole genre of film possible - a genre that seems to make more money than any other. He created the whole of composite photography as we know it - blue screen, green screen, an important contribution to the sodium vapor system.

“He leaves no unfinished business. He lived a life full of achievement and honor and the love of his family.”",I’m watching captain marvel and it’s pretty amazing to know his work probably helped bring this movie to life.  (Given this movie is probably a lot of green screen)
FALL online ONLY instruction,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hvcrhe/fall_online_only_instruction/,2020-07-21 11:23:46,"Called it lol

Dear Colleagues,

As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, show that infections continue to increase.

The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.

Although we have repeatedly noted that all fall plans are subject to public health conditions, we understand that this news will be disappointing. Many of you have worked diligently to develop plans to provide in-person instructional activities for almost one thousand classes across the campus. Many faculty and students continue to look forward to resumption of some element of in-person instruction. We will continue to work hard on our plans, and to learn from the setbacks as well as the advances. 

Learning to switch between remote and in-person

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow.

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to providing guidance and support. 

If previously approved in-person instruction returns later in the semester, students will not be required to attend classes in-person—they can continue to attend classes remotely through the semester. 

To the degree that operational logistics and public health conditions permit, we will prioritize offering in-person instructional activities for Tier 1 and some Tier 2 courses, depending on instructor, classroom, space, and facility availability. Tier 1 is defined as instructional activities that, by their pedagogical nature (e.g., labs, studios, fieldwork), are significantly preferable to offer in-person or partially in-person. Tier 2 is defined as instructional activities that, if offered in-person, would substantially contribute to cohort-building for entering students, to academic engagement for students who are underrepresented on campus, and/or part of a capstone experience (e.g., freshman/sophomore seminars, first-year cohort-building courses for graduate students, capstone courses for seniors, etc.). 

The Office of the Registrar will continue to assign general assignment classrooms as needed for courses provisionally approved as Tier 1 and Tier 2 in the event that we can return to some hybrid or flexible instruction later in the semester. At this point, it is less likely that we will be able to offer Tier 3 in-person instructional activities, those in which the instructor strongly prefers to offer instruction in person—even later in the semester—so we are holding off on Tier 3 room assignments for the time being. 

Current fall planning

For now, as we plan for the start of the fall semester, faculty should implement their contingency plans for fully-remote instruction. Waiting for conditions to improve would not provide us with sufficient time to prepare for the start of instruction. If it is not possible to offer a particular course remotely and the course needs to be canceled for the fall semester, please work with your department scheduler to update the schedule of classes at your earliest opportunity. It is important that students have the most up-to-date information. For questions, please contact the Office of the Registrar scheduling@berkeley.edu.

Whether or not public health conditions allow us to return to some in-person instruction as planned, we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for our students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. Please also take a look at the following FAQs: 

For instructors (COCI)

For students (Registrar)

Participation/Attendance (CTL Resource) 

Looking forward 

We acknowledge the challenging times for our community with regard to childcare, dependent care, personal health, and other responsibilities through the fall. Our instruction planning and operations recovery management teams are working to develop plans to support instructors, GSIs, and staff who require classrooms or office space to prepare for and/or deliver instruction. We will send more detailed information about these plans in the near future.

We will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester.

As the public health situation continues to evolve, we will keep you updated as additional information regarding fall plans develop. We will provide regular updates leading up to and throughout the fall semester.

For your information, a message about fall plans that students will receive later today is appended below. 

We are immensely grateful for your incredible dedication to our campus community in the face of this pandemic and for your remaining flexible to our ever-changing environment.

Letter to be sent to students today

 

Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students -


As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, continue to increase.


The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.  

 

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow. 

 

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students, but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to continuing to communicate regularly with you regarding these matters.  

 

Regarding Thanksgiving, we will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester. 

 

Whether we are all remote, or mostly remote, you should know that we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. 

 

We realize that these changes may be frustrating and make it difficult for you to choose what you want to do for fall. This may also be confusing for incoming undergraduate students, including first generation college students (students from families in which neither parent has a four-year college degree). Please know that you belong here. You are an essential part of the UC Berkeley community and we will support you in having a rewarding college experience. We have numerous offices, groups and services at Berkeley and the Educational Opportunity Program is a great place to start. This incoming undergraduate class also marks our most ethnically diverse freshman admitted class in more than 30 years. We are committed to encouraging and supporting all underrepresented students through programs like The Office for Graduate Diversity and the Centers for Educational Justice & Community Engagement.

We’re hoping this email can provide more information to help you make your decision. In general, if you can reasonably live and learn where you are right now, staying there may be the preferred choice for you. However, you may decide to reside in the Berkeley area if you have on-campus housing, critical in-person classes (depending on public health conditions), in-person research or work, or other specific directive to come to campus; or accessibility, accommodation or other needs. Fortunately, the federal government has rescinded the rule that would have harmed our international students. They can now make the decisions that work best for them.

Learn More

We are hosting a series of “conversations,”live-streamed events where you can learn more.

 

Student housing (including on and off campus housing): Tuesday, July 21, 12-1 p.m.

Instruction: Wednesday, July 22, 12-1 p.m.

Newly admitted undergraduate students (for freshman and new transfer students): Wednesday, July 29, 5-6 p.m.

Student experience (including professional offices and student groups and events): Tuesday, August 11, 5-6 pm. 

 

Help Us Support You

To help us better understand how to support you, we will asksurvey you about your plans for fall and your public health habits so that we can create a program to support COVID-19 prevention practices. Your feedback is important. Watch your email for more details. 

 

Instructional Support

For graduate student instructors, the Graduate Division has created FAQs about fall instruction. 

 

We will begin by providing remote access to academic services such as academic advising, tutoring and peer advising and will assess other options as public health conditions allow. We are exploring how technology can enhance our services, creating toolkits for staff, and following guidance to support equitable access including adhering to ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) best practices and ensuringstudents have the technology they need to succeed.  

 

The Campus Experience

 

The campus experience will begin remotely. There will not be opportunities to gather with groups of other students on campus at the start but we hope to switch to a more flexible approach should public health conditions allow. The State of California is currently drafting guidance for universities and colleges, we expect to share that soon. We will provide more information at sa.berkeley.edu/covid19/Fall2020. 

 

Students who do come to campus, including living in the residence halls and apartments, will be required to adhere to public health and safety requirements. 

 

Financial Aid and Scholarships

 

We are committed to offering financial aid to support students in covering the estimated total cost of attendance, including tuition, housing, books, food needs, and more, whether they are living on or near campus or outside of the Bay Area with their family. 

Students not living in on-campus housing are encouraged to update their “Cost of Attendance” information in CalCentral as soon as possible. Click on “Update Housing” and select “Living Off Campus.” Please review Financial Aid & Housing Updates for Fall 2020 for more detailed information. Should the standard allocation not match your actual living expenses, you may request a cost of living adjustment in mid-August.

On-Campus Housing

 

On-campus housing for students in the residential halls will be single occupancy only; you’ll get your own room. We will be able to accommodate all students who have received housing offers. Occupancy levels in apartments for undergraduate and graduate student and student family housing (University Village Albany) remain the same. All housing complexes will continue to have residential life, housing, custodial, maintenance, and other critical staff on site. Additional information is available at housing.berkeley.edu/fall2020covid. 

 

Off-Campus Housing

 

We remind students that off-campus housing (including private apartments and houses, fraternities, sororities, and the co-ops) is not owned or managed by the university. You are more likely to contract and/or spread the virus if you live in crowded, congregate living environments. We advise that if you are living off-campus in Berkeley you have your own bedroom and you not socialize in person with anyone outside your household (the people sharing your apartment). For group living environments with large numbers of residents, we encourage students to create smaller social bubbles like we will have in the residential halls. 

 

Preparing for Positive Cases

 

While we are working diligently to mitigate the spread, we will reserve space in the on-campus Foothill housing complex for students who have tested positive and are in isolation; are waiting for the results of their test; or have had close contact with a known positive and need quarantine under public health orders. We will make sure students have meal service and other resources they may need during the isolation/quarantine period. Students living in on-campus housing will be given priority but University Health Services will also oversee a small number of spaces at Foothill that will be available to house high risk students who live off campus, as appropriate. Students who are experiencing symptoms or think they have come in contact with a positive case should call the 24/7 Nurse Advice line at (510) 643-7197.

Final Thoughts

 

Our plans will, by necessity, evolve as we receive direction from public health officials. This is the case all over the country with cities, counties and states easing and then reintroducing restrictions. We are grateful for your patience and flexibility. These are challenging times but we continue to invest in a robust remote experience - both instruction and student engagement - to ensure students can have a full and meaningful university experience no matter where they are learning. The campus remains as resourceful, determined and resilient as our students. We will get through this together, and our shared journey through these difficult times will make us stronger. 

 

Stay well, Bears. 

 

Sincerely,

Please do not reply to this message","yo why do I have a course materials fee if I can't actually take labs for the course...
bamboozled
Does the school have any thoughts about people living off-campus and can't cut their leases? Seems super unfair for us to pay \~4000$ over the semester for rent if everything's fully remote and not making the announcement until midway through summer
What does this mean for athletics?
how the fuck are they going to justify charging people 25k a semester when none of the facilities are open on campus lol
\*will begin fully remote
Tldr? 

I can't read this.
It's possible that you will be mailed a lab kit, at least that is what 16A is doing this summer.
Berkeley released a city ordinance that allows any student to cancel their lease with 30 days' notice. This is a city policy so it would supersede anything written in the lease not allowing this. Landlords have already gotten in trouble for trying to stop tenants from doing this.
 I foresee the Big Game played in April
[deleted]
If you think that they can still hold anything in person after starting and ending the semester fully online, I want some of whatever you're smoking.
The title
Imagine going to a world-class university and not being able to read.
Classes in fall start online, might go back in person if things get better, if you have a housing offer you can keep it but you can cancel it, and a couple other things for students to know.
seriously doubt I'm going to be doing 143 stuff at home tbh
You are still on hook for the rent until a new person takes over the lease, so it’s not really that helpful.
The issue is that leases are signed way in advance - finding housing is such a shit show that most students (me included) sign leases in like March, because if we wait until June we’d literally be living a mile and a half out from campus.
At least we get to keep the Axe?
He's probably including rent, food, alcohol, textbooks, condoms, and event tickets. Either that or he's out of state / international
I know leases need to be signed way in advance in berkeley (I'm actually the house manager of a \~40 person house). But even if you signed in March, you can still give them 30 days notice today. It will be a little annoying with Spring leases \*if\* classes are in person, but even if you signed a long time ago, you can still give 30 day notice today.
oos rise up
I see, this changes everything. Let me look into it, thanks."
International House Announces Closure for Fall Semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/huynyz/international_house_announces_closure_for_fall/,2020-07-20 18:55:29,"Full Announcement:

ANNOUNCEMENT TO RESIDENTS FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT INTERNATIONAL HOUSE UC BERKELEY
July 20, 2020

We write today to let you know that the Board of Directors of International House decided unanimously on Friday afternoon to close the House for the Fall semester and likely the entire 2020-21 academic year.  That decision was made with great reluctance and came out of concern that there is no safe way to operate the House in a manner that would adequately protect residents and staff from the threat of COVID-19.  The purpose of this communication is (i) to formally notify you of the Board’s decision (as provided under Section IV, Subsection D Cancellation – By International House of the I-House Room License and Board Contract Terms and Condition for AY 2020-21, (ii) to give you some additional insight into the Board’s decision, and (iii) to alert you to the alternative campus housing option that is being made available to you through the strong support and assistance of the University’s Campus Housing Office. This decision will not affect current residents who will continue to have access to the House and its services through the expiration of their Resident Agreement on August 15, 2020.
 
In reaching our decision, the Board, working closely with staff, the University, and outside public health resources, examined a great many possible physical changes to the House and enhanced disinfection practices to better protect residents and staff.  Ultimately, however, we concluded that there was still an unacceptably high probability that one or more of our residents or staff would become COVID-19 positive and that protecting our residents and staff from infection would be difficult, particularly given the I-House’s communal bathrooms and other common areas.  Moreover, our ability to properly isolate and support any infected or exposed resident within the confines of the I-House is limited.  Even if all residents were to limit their social interactions and practice good distancing and mask wearing when outside their rooms, the Board determined that the risks (and potential consequences) of the virus entering the I-House and spreading were simply too great to proceed with housing residents this fall.  Please be assured that the decision to close the House has been made for health and safety reasons, not due to financial challenges, though these of course are real and substantial, and will be with us as we work through this period and as we eventually are able to reopen.  It was also clear that under any scenario, the House could not provide the myriad of programs and social events, including communal meals in the dining commons, that form the heart of the International House experience.
 
This decision will require, of course, that you secure other housing for the Fall. In that regard, the University’s Campus Housing Office is prepared to offer you housing (and board) in its residential housing facilities for the Fall and upcoming Academic Year.  Although the general time for submitting University housing applications closed last month for all but graduate students, they have indicated that they will make an exception for you if you alert them on their application form that you were registered for housing at International House for the Fall semester and are seeking replacement housing from them.  To better ensure your access to this alternative housing, it is important that once you have determined whether you want to be included in this alternative University housing, that you promptly complete and submit your application with the Campus Housing Office. The link for that inquiry is:  
 
https://portal.housing.berkeley.edu/StarRezPortalx/89449879/13/30/UC_Berkeley_Log_In-Instructions. Make sure to indicate that you had secured housing at International House on your application.
 
Our understanding is that if enough International House prospective residents apply, they will make an effort to house residents together in one or more of their facilities.  The Board is also committed to identifying ways to support and nurture the I-House community despite the substantial limitations resulting from the pandemic. 
 
There are, of course, also a number of off-campus housing options in Berkeley and many websites provide listings of some of those options.  Craigslist.com is one popular (and free) listing site that you may want to explore. Our staff is available to answer questions and provide support during this transition, including the processing of your deposit refunds.  Questions to I-House staff may be directed to the Admissions office at the following email address: ihres@berkeley.edu.
 
We realize that this is sudden and unwelcome news, but we wanted to let you know of the Board’s decision promptly.  We have spent a great deal of time and effort trying to find a way to keep the House open safely, but we were not successful in that endeavor.  Our hope, however, is that we can maintain an important and lasting connection between you and International House (albeit a virtual one for the time being).  Thank you for your understanding and your continued support of the mission of the International House at the University of California at Berkeley.

""Fostering intercultural respect and understanding, lifelong friendships, and leadership skills for a more tolerant and peaceful world""","Man, I literally took on an extra job starting in January to be able to afford the room I wanted, and I lucked into a 7th-floor west-facing single and then FUCKING CORONAVIRUS cancels my ALREADY SIGNED housing contract in JULY.
I still have a meal plan there
Are they making IHouse into a quarantine building for students that test positive like Carol mentioned?
Most likely at facing west it would of had a beautiful view of the Golden Gate Bridge and sunsets.  

Join the club, I have suffered several losses and push backs even before the coronvirus. but that does suck for you.  Hopefully they'll keep you on that list. of course if this is freshman year, you're not going to get that housing the following year?
I am a senior. Yes, facing west and on the 7th floor were specifically mentioned because of the view and sunsets -- I had a ""premium single"", which I specifically saved for for month and months (and chose my housing last year to be able to afford), which is specifically more expensive because of the views and sunsets.
Well, it might be in their interest (as well as yours) not to have to redo student housing placements all over again but rather small adjustments for people who have moved on and you will eventually get that spot? but I'm guessing you're going to be placed elsewhere and I wonder if that is a 8-9 month lease which binds you to it?
IHouse is **closed**. No one gets those spots. IHouse is also separate from university housing (e.g. dorms).
You mean it's closed for just the fall or do you think it will be sold eventually from lost of money?  I thought it was apart of the campus.  I didn't know it was independent from it.
It is closed for the fall, likely for the academic year.

I understand that there is high demand for the major, but it seems rather unreasonable to expect students to have their life plan decided on while they’re in high school. This move shuts people who may be interested and more than qualified in electrical engineering out from pursuing a career in that field simply because they came into college unsure of their major. 

## **Instructors' Answer**

Instructors wrote:

> EDIT: This policy was put in place this year to reflect the practice that has been going on for some time. Due to constrained resources, we have not been able to accept change of college students into EECS for some time. This policy only makes the practice more transparent. As everyone else has mentioned, we encourage folks who discover their passion for EE/CS to pursue the Computer Science major in L&S. 
> 
> To reiterate what Halley said, the rationale was that students in L&S have the option to pursue the Computer Science major and have the option to take EE/EECS classes so there shouldn't be a need to switch colleges. For the LSCS major, eight out of the 27 units in upper division need to be CS, but the rest could be EE/EECS. Employers and graduate schools are going to be interested in the classes you took over the label of EECS vs. CS.


## **First Followup Discussion**

An instructor wrote:

> If you are in L&S, you can still pursue electrical engineering. The two majors have the same requirements.

A student wrote:

> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd imagine that companies that are hiring electrical engineers would look for applicants who majored in electrical engineering.

An instructor responded:

> If you have to same technical background, why would that make a difference to companies? This is why you submit cover letters when applying to jobs. Students that minor in CS or EECS still get tech jobs without CS or EECS being their major.
> 
> instead of tech jobs, i should say software engineering. some are even pursuing PhDs in Electrical/Computer engineering

A student wrote:

> Electrical engineering jobs often require more specialized expertise than software engineering jobs; as such, companies are often more selective as to what major their applicants are for electrical engineering positions than for software positions. Especially for more interesting/higher paying positions, having an electrical engineering degree is, I would think, a huge advantage over having to explain one's situation in a cover letter, which may not even be read. If someone takes ee-heavy courses, why shouldn't they be award with a degree that reflects their education?

An instructor wrote:

> I'm not disagreeing with you, and i agree that it is unfortunate. however many EECS students choose to not take any EE course, other than the lower division requirement that both CS and EECS students must take. Yet, they get the stamp of Electrical Engineering. 
> 
> If you decide you want to take more EE courses, you are taking to same coursework and taught by the same professor as the EECS person next to you. These professors will be writing your recommendation letters. Having a specific major on your transcript is not the only way you can get a job/internship.
> 
> I am sure staff/faulty can talk more as to why this choice was made. But I do not believe they are cutting off the opportunity to pursue EE from L&S students.

An instructor wrote:

> One thing you might want to do is talk with industry recruiters about this.  Often there are misunderstandings about what industry is looking for and requires. 

A student wrote:

> Would the notion that companies prefer to hiring electrical engineer graduates for electrical engineering positions be a misconception? I haven't talked to recruiters specifically, but job postings for these positions seem to be rather inflexible. 

A student wrote:

> As a general rule, job postings are usually written to be more rigid than what the company is looking for.
> 
> If you really want, just note on your resume that your degree is called CS, and your focus is in EE. It provides the complete picture regarding your situation.

A student wrote:

> Almost all midsize and large companies use software to filter out applications that don't meet certain criteria. While it certainly is possible to get an EE job with a CS degree (just like it is technically possible for an English major who took some EE classes to get an EE job), there is obviously a significant disadvantage and extra barriers one would need to go through. The department should be giving students with the adequate ability the necessary tools to succeed, not telling them to fill their resume/cover letter with excuses.

A student responded:

> Agreed, and even if there is a good enough reason for this policy change, I believe that the lack of communication about it is still an issue and needs to be addressed as well.

## **Second Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> I've been perfecting my gpa and drastically changing my academic schedules(did CS61A, 61B, 61C in one semester and EE16B 16A for the other) for the entire school year just to submit an application in this fall. It is really unfair closing the application without giving any prior notice. Why is this change made so abruptly and what do I do now??

A student responded:

> EECS has been pretty impacted, and hard to transfer anyways.  I don't know their exact reasons, but since its very unlikely that you will be able to transfer, they might as well just not take applications, especially now the LS CS is pretty much the same thing as EECS; the electrical engineering requirements are the same.  Even though there are some potential disadvantages in the discussion above, if you want to do EE, your best bet is probably LSCS and just take EE classes.

An instructor wrote:

> Agreed and please note there are a lot of rumors and misunderstandings of the benefits of an EE degree compared to the CS one in industry.

A student wrote:

> Not able to transfer because of academic qualifications and completely close the application are not the same. The unlikeliness of transfer doesn't justify tearing down the whole process overnight. I did acknowledge the difficulty of this undertaking at the very beginning and I still chose to do it anyway because I believe in my academic records. In my humble opinion the College should at least pay some respect to the students who already put efforts into this process instead of dismissively referring to the ""unlikeliness"" of transferring.

A student responded:

> What really frustrates me is that students like me who have put tremendous efforts into this endeavors end up doing everything in vain. I know a couple of other students who are in similar situations and even though there might only be a handful of students trying to transfer from LS to EECS each year, it doesn't mean our needs can be disregarded.
> 
> If the College made the decision and notified us one year in advance, I have no question about that and I would perfectly understand the rationales behind the decision. I could've enjoyed my first year of college by taking classes at a much slower pace and declared LSCS last semester if it's not for transferring to EECS.

A student responded:

> Completely agree with the statements above. If I am excluded from a major, I would prefer it to be because I got too many A's/not enough A+'s, not because the department closed the major off abruptly.

A student wrote:

> +1, closing off the major entirely seems too particularly extreme of an action as well, unless there's a particularly strong reasoning for doing so (e.g. takes up too many resources, not enough interest). The unlikeliness of transferring isn't enough of an argument imho, that's pretty much like saying you're blocked from applying to a certain college now because it's not likely that you'll get in (the analogy isn't perfect as schools do make money off of more applications). There definitely should've been more discussion with students and foresight into this policy change, as the department seems to be out of sync with some students about this.

A student responded:

> y'all flexing 2 hard smh

A student wrote:

> But that's precisely the reason? Not enough resources

A student wrote:

> Is there a significant difference in resources allocated per EECS student vs per LS CS student?

A student responded:

> I don't think so major wise, maybe college wise (ie CoE v. LS). This has just been my personal experience and should not be taken as indicative across campus

## **Third Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> I'm going to have to agree that not enough of a notice (if any at all) was given in regards to this decision to close off the EECS major for transferring into. Even though this policy may not affect much in terms of how many people are actually able to transfer into EECS in the first place, this decision seems rather off on a whim, as there were virtually no discussions of this policy prior to now (that I know of). Disclosing this important information at such a short notice seems particularly disrespectful to those who've already heavily invested into the prospects of transferring into EECS, and others who would like to pursue that path. Is there any reason in particular why not much of a notice was given in advance for this policy change? I certainly believe quite a few could have definitely benefited from knowing about this in advance, not to mention that the department should strive to notify students of important policy changes in a timely and responsible manner.

An instructor wrote:

> I agree that there was not enough notice given. It is so hard for students who take such a rigorous schedule in the hope of transferring to EECS. I know some of the staff feels the same way. I feel like you will get better answers to these concerns after the 4th of July because I am a student and not included in staff meetings. However, it might be in your interest to shoot an email to the College of Engineering in the meantime because it is ultimately their decision. I think it would be interesting to here what they have to say.

An instructor wrote:

> Please see Sarah's edit above. In addition, the College of Engineering and the department had no way of knowing who was interested in this pathway. We can't simply email all students in all colleges about policy changes. Undergraduate students are admitted to the College they select on their application; those admitted to L&S are undeclared and have the right to pursue any major in their college. This does not necessarily include EECS. 

A student responded:

> I'd assume that the College of Engineering does have the ability to update their website several months in advance of a policy change so perspective transfers would not be loading their schedules under false pretenses. I'm sure I can speak for most student that we were admitted to UC Berkeley under the assumption that, given the necessary academic standards, we would be able to switch our course of study, an assumption that until a few days ago was reflected in the College of Engineering's policy and website. It is unreasonable to assume that all high school students have their course of study completely planned out. Had I been aware of the policy, I certainly would have applied to Berkeley differently.

An instructor wrote:

> It is super unfortunate! But it is kinda unfair to all the students that applied EECS and got rejected from Berkeley, when they could have just gotten in undeclared in L&S and then switched. But, like Sarah's edit says, it was already EXTREMELY rare for students to switch into EECS. So now that it is officially on the website future students can apply for admittance accordingly 

## **Fourth Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> If the department is going to make sweeping decisions like this without consulting students, why not just fix the problem at the root and do away with the EECS major altogether? This is not to say that the EECS major itself is the problem-- it's great, and it's the reason I chose to come to Cal-- but by jamming all students who are interested in EE into a major that is by and far dominated by CS students, you are doing them (and anyone else who'd want to pursue EE) a terrible disservice. Simply making the already-existent split between ECE and CSE into a formal major division would be a simple way to solve the problem, and you could ensure that students that pursue both EE and CS (at least within CoE) get the resources they deserve. In all likelihood, in my mind, CSE would become what EECS is now (ultra competitive in terms of admissions and with an overwhelming focus on CS) and ECE would fall in at the tier of, say, MechE in terms of transfer availability. The department could keep the already different course requirements for the two (perhaps tweaking ECE so that more EE classes must be taken at the upper-div level), and I feel this would be a reasonable solution to a lot of the department's problems with regards to major selection for students. Is there a reason people don't talk about this more?

An instructor responded:

> The department is exploring the possibility of an EE focused track within LSCS. EECS is not going to be eliminated.

A student wrote:

> I have COE EECS friends who take a mix of CS/EECS/EE classes.  Many CS and EE classes complement one another to form a cohesive area of study (ex. see the many threads about AI/ML/Robotics or IoT/Cyber-physical systems).  I don't know what administrative/resources changes you are hoping to see with a formal split between EE and CS, but it sounds like it disadvantages the students who take both.

> Anyways, I believe many students, myself included, can only work with anecdotal/personal evidence.  Are there any statistics on EECS students who take exclusively either EE or CS courses?
> 
> For those with interest purely in software engineering, being LSCS rather than EECS makes more sense to me, especially since it sounds like employers/grad school doesn't really care.

A student responded:

> note that we only have an EECS department - not EE or CS individually (much like MIT's course 6) that merged together something like 50 years ago done by exceptional people (Prof Zadeh, 100% worth reading his biography) that knew what they were doing. it wouldn't make sense to have a split between EE and CS if we only have one EECS department. 2cents

A student wrote:

> I think what the guy above is saying: you can have one department offer two majors.  Kind of like how the math department has math and applied math.  Maybe it could help with dividing resources?  But in other aspects, not sure if this would be a good move.

A student responded:

> My point was that EECS is largely a heavily ""impacted"" major because it has ""CS"" in it. I don't want ""EE"" or ""CS"" people in CoE to lose their privilege of taking courses that are in the other specialization.That's why both names, ECE and CSE, have ""computer"" and ""engineering"" in them. This is not a radical idea, considering basically every other UC school does it. It would be a simple formalization of the currently symbolic choice EECS students already have to make between the two concentrations. Simply put, if the two were nominally separate, admissions would be a lot simpler. My rationale is that Cal is not able to admit as many intended-EE students because EECS is the only major for EE students, and this is reflected in the relatively smaller number of students who take core EE classes compared to other schools of similar stature. It was difficult for me to get concrete data on graduating seniors in ECE, but the best fit for me was looking at enrollment in EE 105 and mapping that over 8 semesters of undergraduates. Obviously, EE is not just circuits, but, as was pointed out, enrollment in other core EE classes like EE 120 includes students who are ""double-dipping"" (as they should) but will eventually become CSE or CS. Currently, EE 105 for Fall 2017 has 37 students enrolled in it, and, although this is larger than the sub-30 number who finished the class last semester, I think it is reflective of a good approximation for half of the ECE students for one class (i.e. C/O 2019, etc). Just for the sake of argument, I'll boost the number to 60 (although the other core subset of EE, signals, is not large enough to justify this, considering EE 123 enrollment for Spring 2017 was just 12 people). I understand that there are AI/ML/Robotics, etc. but those students would likely fall under CSE, so I'm not including them in this argument. Anyway, 60*8 is 480 and 480/27496 (<-- total undergrad enrollment) is ~1.7%. Remember, this is a generous estimate in my opinion. Compare this to EE + CE enrollment for the University of Toronto (a similar large public research institution, where I'm studying for the summer, and the most convenient for me to get data on), which is 1510 and dividing by the total undergrad enrollment of 56261 yields ~2.7%. That's a whole 1% difference! 1% of 27496 is 275 students (who could be in ECE but are not because EECS)! You can run the same analysis on basically any other similar school, and I guarantee that you will see a trend. That Cal lags behind in attracting students to EE despite being the ~3rd best undergrad EE program in the WORLD is honestly pathetic. 2cents.
> 
> Additionally, I feel like creating EIS for L&S is an imperfect solution because the subject matter of the major means that someone in EIS really deserves a place in CoE: it's called ""electrical engineering"" for a reason. Making ECE separate in terms of admissions would ensure that everyone who wants a chance at EE when they apply to the university has a fair shot at it. And, because I feel that it won't be as severely impacted as EECS, transfers should be possible, without the need for a whole new major.

A student continued:

> Also, to respond to the anon who is advocating MIT's style of doing things, I think EECS as a major should be done away with, not as a department. Plenty of other universities have ""EECS"" departments, and MIT is really not special on this front, but it is different from Cal in that it offers courses 6-1 (Electrical Science and Engineering), 6-2 (EECS), and 6-1/8 (EE w/ Physics) as separate degree options for students interested in EE. Cal has nothing like that, and that is a problem. 

An instructor wrote:

> There has been a lot of internal discussion about separating EE and CS amongst both faulty and staff, but the decision has been to keep them together.

## **Fifth Followup Discussion**

An instructor wrote:

> Just a reminder that any student who wants the ""Electrical Engineering"" line on their resume or transcript can complete the EECS minor :)

An instructor responded:

> +1","I fully support the split of EE and CS. The influx of students in CS has caused so much trouble in fundings. EE upper div classes used to have 2 TAs for a class size of 30+(roughly). Now because of CS, they can only have 1 TA per class. It just makes no sense to drag EE into it.
Earlier post: https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6lzbl0/psa_newly_admitted_non_eecs_coe_majors_interested/

> This is for changing into EECS from LS. If you're in CoE already you can change your major to EECS provided you fit the prereqs. Last time I checked it was 3.3 in major/technical + 1 EECS technical per semester after 1 year.
If the department is unable to accept transfers from LS, then it makes sense to just close off the application entirely.  There was a student above complaining about how he re-arranged his schedule just to be able to apply, and I think this is exactly the scenario they are trying to prevent in the future.
Feel like I'm in the minority here but I really wish that just put CS in CoE and make it so that the only way to major in CS is to get admitted into it through the college application. it'll fix our overflow of CS students since admissions will control how many people are in each class
Yeah, why not allow students in both colleges to pursue EE, CS, or EECS? Or you could limit pure EE to the CoE and pure CS to L&S but make EECS available in both colleges. 
Again, no one is suggesting split the DEPARTMENT (which is where funding is allocated) just split the majors. That will essentially not make a difference in terms of funding.
Split the department, split the fundings, split the majors

The combined EECS has made it so hard for people pursuing EE, both in terms of fundings and admission.
EE would *probably* lose funding in that scenario just fyi. It benefits from a symbiotic relationship from CS. Its not like a departmental split will result in 50-50 fund splits
I highly doubt if EE gets any benefit staying with CS. The student-to-faulty ratio has increased significantly since CS started to expand. And I don't see any reason that staying with CS will improve this, especially when CS has expanded to a size that they can't even support themselves. There's no way they have any extra to help EE.

In terms of research fundings, EE probably draws in more money than CS. Fundings in EE are usually larger in scale as they require more equipments than CS. "
"Connecting With Berkeley Alum on LinkedIn or via Email - ""{Hi} and {Why}""",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vsdsir/connecting_with_berkeley_alum_on_linkedin_or_via/,2022-07-05 18:25:38,"In the era of ambitious tech bros and ""product bros"" aka future MBA grads who want to be PMs, LinkedIn is a great way to get connected to others in the tech industry. I utilized LinkedIn to get referrals or ask Berkeley Alumni about their experience with certain companies as graduation approached and I was applying to jobs.

With that being said, connecting in good faith is important to keep the ecosystem alive and well. What do I mean by this? I mean that if you connect and say ""hey I'd love to get to know other professionals in the tech industry"" but you just want a referral, or you say ""I'd love to chat and learn more about what your work looks like at [company]"" but you actually are trying to connect about your club on campus or some kind of partnership, then you are contributing to the ""bait and switch"" environment, which hurts everyone. 

cc: Cal student consulting organizations

## My Context

I have been on several panels for students in the program I graduated from at Cal (Statistics), have posted or commented on tech subreddits or other forums, and simply by having an updated LinkedIn profile, get somewhere between 3-5 messages / week during busy seasons and \~1/week during the rest of the year. Most people ask for referrals or for me to hire them explicitly when I have advertised that our team is growing; I once shared a referrel link directly to LinkedIn and our internal analytics registered thousands of likes and hundreds of applications, and I also got dozens of DMs during those times. Others ask how to ""break into tech"" from other industries, or ask miscellaneous questions about my current or past company.  I think LI's algorithm will suggest me in the sidebar since I have a high response rate, but from my colleagues this experience is not uncommon.

## Incentives on both sides

Before I go into the format with examples, a word on incentives:

### Incentives for Current students

1. Opportunities: internships, full time job offers, referrals
2.  Knowledge: a phone call or email exchange where you ask someone in industry about their experience, tech stack, org chart, best practices, domain knowledge, etc. This almost always feeds somehow into \#1, but a highly motivated senior for instance might have internships and a solid profile, so they may just be reaching out to understand a more niche role, like MLE vs. ML SWE, or DS vs Applied Scientist, TPM vs. PM, and so on, or ask about projects on a high level. 
3. Mentorship: maybe you have seen someone's content or interacted with them and you admire them or otherwise want to get to know them or learn about their career journey. Maybe they were a GSI who graduated or you were in a club with them.

### Incentives for Alumni

1. Hiring pipeline and referral bonuses: if there are entry level roles to be filled, then oftentimes Berkeley students are particularly capable, and it means that there will be a shared context, or the current employee may even have a clear grasp on exactly what sorts of projects and academic training the current student has. Referral bonuses range from $500-$5000 depending on the context, which is nontrivial for what usually amounts to submitting a form or a slack message on behalf of an applicant.
2. Giving back: being a mentor can be a rewarding experience, and it also uplevels you as a manager and teacher, gives you more context on what is happening at different levels of the hiring pipeline or experience funnel for your industry / role ladder, and also reminds you of how far you've come in your own journey to have someone giving you some level of trust, admiration, or otherwise looking to you for guidance. 
3. An additional connection who may be useful later when the currently employed individual is in a position of needing a reference or job. Maybe the current student is going to have a much more successful career and soon you'll be peers or in need of mentorship yourself! You never know. 

An important note here is that these interactions are almost exclusively one-sided at the outset, or at the very least strongly asymmetric. Even in the case of referral bonuses, a job offer is clearly of greater value than a couple thousand dollars one time after taxes. 

## The ""Hi and Why"" Format

My suggestion is the ""hi and why"" format. Give a greeting, and then give a VERY brief (one sentence if you can) description of what you want from the interaction, including scope. By scope I mean, do you want an hour long call and for me to review your resume and project portfolio? Do you want me to look at your code? Do you want to meet in person? Do you want me to connect you to someone else in my network? Do you really just have one question and think you need a phone call to ask it? I want to know how much you're asking of me so I can budget when I can offer it, if I do want to offer it.

### Good Example:

""Hi Jake,

I'm a data scientist looking to apply to [company]. I was hoping I could speak to you beforehand so I can better prepare for the roles I'm seeing. Let me know if you have time to chat!

Best,
[first_name]""


You can see this person reached out, gave a brief intro (hi), said what they were hoping for (why), and a polite salutation to conclude the message. I appreciated the brevity and because they included both the hi and why, I knew exactly what to expect and how to budget my own time and energy to interact with them. I ended up having a back and forth email chain of more than 25 emails over several weeks containing detailed feedback for this candidate's resume and other components of their interview prep, have had two chats now and I genuinely was glad to be part of their career journey as they transitioned to ""big tech"" roles since they come from a slightly different environment. We have plans to grab coffee in the next few weeks to finally meet in person. They responded promptly and eagerly, but not ""desperately"" and were appreciative and teachable. This makes the exchange rewarding for me, thereby reducing friction when it comes to having additional touch points or advising.

### Bad Example

""Hi Jake, I'm Mark\* and I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. I saw that you studied at UC Berkeley too and I would love to connect! Go Bears!""     

\*(name changed here for privacy)

You can see here the student includes the hi, but no ""why"". I don't quite understand why people want to connect on LinkedIn with people they haven't met because a low quality ""connection"" without an introduction or brief set of messages is not very useful unless you post frequently and I'm able to sort of ""get to know you"" via seeing your posts on my feed (which I rarely look at). But I understand some students are eager to connect with professionals and don't want to rebuff their enthusiasm, so I sent back a message (again, with name changed here for privacy):

""Nice to meet you Mark; looks like you have a strong profile and still a couple years left to gain momentum. Have you considered if you will do a masters or MBA?""

I responded this way because this student clearly is ambitious, and their LinkedIn is FULLY decked out with over 12 different experiences, several internships per summer, and some confusing employment entries which I now understand are some kind of ""consulting clubs"" at Cal of which I'm unfamiliar. They have the full measure of both typical and somewhat cringy ""I am deeply honored to have accepted my offer of internship at Bumbleflairex\*"" for literally every step in their student career and internship journey. Understainding their goals could help me get at the ""why"" component of connecting, and I thought they could be interested in the masters program I completed.    


\*Bumbleflairex is what all small startup names sound like to me, but is not a real company (yet).

The student's response was to send some kind of multi-paragraph advertisement about how he is the vice president of a very exclusive and illustrious consulting organization and how my current company could really benefit from the expertise and ""acceleration of product development"" that his organization has to offer. The website was not specific about exactly what partnership looks like and I couldn't see clear examples so :shrug:. 

I was sort of taken aback because he also didn't answer my question or continue in the organic conversation, which indicated to me that I'm clearly part of a wide net LinkedIn outreach effort, and while I would be potentially interested in connecting with an eager student, I'm not excited to engage in some kind of ad, especially when it wasn't part of the ""why"" in the original message. It's a bait and switch--I saw you're a Cal alumni, let's connect! Great. I'll connect. Also, now that we've connected, here's an exclusive opportunity I want to sell you on. 

## The Big Tech Company Ecosystem

Before I go on, let me be clear--I think that Cal undergrads are exceptional. I was a GSI for several courses when I was at Cal and had students who were far more accomplished than I was as an undergrad and extremely sharp. However, the team I currently work with are all econ or stats PhDs from top 10 schools who have between 4-10 years of experience in our specific domain--oftentimes they come from the specific research field that my company or team focuses on. This means they have, on average, 12-15 years of experience working with the data and models our team cares about. This is nearing the age of undergrad students. And unless you're Terence Tao you're going to need more time to absorb and process the information and methods in our domain. When we hire interns or undergrads, it's nearly 100% because we trust that they will be helpful or productive after a substantial investment *from our end* while providing little to no benefit during the ramp up period. Internships in general are chiefly to reduce costs on the recruitment budget because it's easier to identify and invest in students over a summer and have return offers for the following year than it is to sift through hundreds of thousands of resumes during full time recruitment season, and those same interns tend to refer well for the roles we care about, so we pay them bonuses instead of hiring more recruiters. Furthermore, our company has a TON of training and bureacracy in order to allow people to have access to ANY data or even log in to our system. It's a huge headache when something goes wrong and we have senior people in their 30s who fuck something up even when they havd so much experience. It presents a large incentive NOT to trust or engage with outsiders about internal proprietary information and increases the necessary value add before a break even point. This is not to say that it's impossible to add value, it's simply to illustrate the perspective of someone working in industry and how this ecosystem is represented to us when we know nothing about your student organization.

What I'm getting at is that there is *some degree* of presumption when you are a student and you contact a full time engineer, data scientist, product manager, or other employee at a large firm and claim that you have something strong to offer. Additionally, it takes a substantial amount of ""messaging around"" for the most eager of employees to find out who is in charge of these partnerships, then I have to have a call to explain what it is, then a follow up to introduce the point person, and I also have to take on the risk of it being unfruitful which reflects poorly on me and might hurt my ability to get resources later when I need them. Have these organizations provided some value to companies in the past? Their existence suggests so, but it's not evident to me what the value would be, since my company has a hoard of engineers, data scientists, and PMs at all levels working on these things all the time.

This student has now sent me several messages to remind me of his original offer, and even sent me a ""Happy Fourth of July"" message and an **additional connection request** after I declined his first one, which actually reminded me to finish this post I had in my drafts, so it was not entirely useless.

## Recommendations

1. Be clear from the outset what you're interested in by summarizing it in your ""why"" component of your original message.
2. Avoid jargon and be specific whenever possible, because not everyone knows your context or what you're offering. E.g. if you say ""consultants"" or ""accelerate product development"" add that your consultants are current undergrads in a STEM major, and that by ""accelerate product development"" you mean perhaps that you will do some kind of project on an underresourced area for 4-6 weeks, or say ""you give us access to proprietary data and we will build a model and partner with one engineer, one data scientist, and one PM before we hand it back off to your team for maintenance"". 
3. Don't pester or follow up half a dozen times if the connection isn't happening. Leave your original message, MAYBE one reminder, and then thank them for their time and leave a link or an email to reach you if they are interested in the future. I have left a message on read or declined in the past, but then gone back to look for the message when the right time arose, but only if the person was (i) not aggressive or pretentious (ii) they were polite and brief.","""hi, i want connect. gib referral or job? thx in advance""
pretty much agree with everything here. also worth noting that I think a lot of people are willing to take time out of their day to give advice or a quick referral. I wish I reached out randomly to alumni more just for advice when I was in school.

something that turns me off is if the person reaching out comes off as too tryhard. what you wrote about being presumptuous is really true. i know that shits tough out there for some students and im more inclined to help people who seem casual, humble, and are just trying to learn/better themselves rather than simply use me for a connection, shill me something they've been working on or are a part of, etc. dead giveaway is when the message I get looks like it could have been copy pasted and sent to 100 other people.
I get loads of invite requests, some tips:

1) A simple “Go Bears” goes a long way

2) If you ask for a referral within 2 messages (or at all really without meeting face to face) that’s gonna be a no from me dawg. I’m not some referral vending machine, this isn’t a transaction.

3) It’s a good idea to have a few questions that you want to ask, it’s a good idea to show genuine interest.


+1 for the suggestion to come off more casually/humbly. Talk about who you are but you don’t have to oversell it.
Excellent summary. I know it takes a good amount of courage to send cold messages, so I'm forgiving for the most part even if the manner isn't perfect, but I certainly wouldn't say 'no' to a polite concise message. 

Some alumni may not always reply back or have the warmest tone, but there are other alumni out there who want nothing but the next generation of golden bears to also succeed, so keep connecting. Go Bears!
!RemindMe 2hrs
As an incoming econ transfer student, thank you for this post. It was very helpful
Brb adding this to the good examples
I think the reverse for 2. If you’re messaging me for a referral, I would prefer if that came out early. There’s nothing worse than someone who feels obligated to make empty conversation just to pad out the time before they ask for the thing that they want and it’s incredibly obvious that that is the case.

Get the transaction out of the way and if you want to talk we can talk, or if not we can skip the water cooler talk.

I don’t necessarily disagree actually. I think I just prefer to avoid people that are gunning for a referral. I don’t know you, my referral is gonna be pretty useless. I’m more than happy to offer a referral on my own accord once I’ve met you at least once (over the phone/zoom/in person, etc)

Or if they’re gunning for a referral, I think the best approach probably is: “Hi I saw your profile and wanted to connect. I’m currently interested in an open role/internship at XYZ and I know a referral can go a long way. Can we set up a quick call for me to introduce myself?”
I'm glad to see two completely opposing opinions on this because it's important also to keep in mind that everyone you reach out to has an unknown preference so it's impossible to make that connection every time. I have lots of well crafted messages with what I think are insightful questions that get left on read. One of my most impactful research experiences was obtained through 40 cold emails with only one response. That's showbiz, baby!"
"Berkeley Alumni Who've Changed the World: Francisco I. Madero, Leader of the Mexican Revolution and President of Mexico",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/aqt3zi/berkeley_alumni_whove_changed_the_world_francisco/,2019-02-14 21:04:23,"Here's the next installment in this series! A link to the previous installment is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ao1941/berkeley_alumni_whove_changed_the_world_dalip/). Hope you enjoy this one!

## Francisco I. Madero (1873 - 1913)

### Photograph: [Link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Francisco_Madero.jpg)

### Claim(s) to Fame
* Leader of the Mexican Revolution
* 33rd President of Mexico (1911 - 1913)

### Degrees Received at Berkeley
* Unknown (Attended 1892–1893, majored in Agriculture)

### Life Story:

For all the rep Berkeley gets as being the school filled with fanatic revolutionaries, few people know of the one Berkeley student who _actually_ led a revolution, _actually_ toppled a government, and _actually_ installed himself as the leader of an entire country. That one man was Francisco I. Madero, and he overthrew the 33 year long dictatorship of Mexico in 1911 in one of the most defining acts of Mexican history.

(Excerpts taken from his biography by Jim Tuck, found on MexConnect [here](http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/278-glorious-innocent-the-tragedy-and-triumph-of-francisco-madero-1873%E2%80%931913).)

Francisco Madero was a man who was too good for his own good. Naive, trusting, merciful toward those who deserved no mercy, he was in the end betrayed and murdered by those in whom he had mistakenly placed his trust. A rich man's son whose following included bandits and killers, a teetotaler and spiritualist in a society dominated by hard-drinking machismo and mawkish veneration of saints' images, he was such an odd-man-out that the terrible fate that overtook him seems almost inevitable.

Yet Madero was truly a figure who achieved vindication in martyrdom and death. Today, the plotters who laid him low are forgotten or reviled. By contrast, Madero's memory is venerated everywhere, no town or city in Mexico is without a street that bears his name and the statues built in his honor would fill an armory.

His career was filled with contradictions. A white man, he led a movement of oppressed Indians against a government representing a European-descended establishment — but headed by an Indian. Born to wealth, he led a rebellion of the poor and downtrodden against a greedy power structure many of whose leaders had been born to poverty.

The future liberator was born at Parras de la Fuente, southern Coahuila, on October 30, 1873. Though he is usually known as Francisco Indalecio, legal documents and his marriage license list him as Francisco Ignacio. Like many privileged youths of his day, Madero received part of his education abroad — at a Catholic school in Baltimore, at a lycée in Paris and briefly at the University of California at Berkeley.

In 1908 Madero published a book titled La sucesión presidencial en 1910 (""The Presidential Succession in 1910."") Hardly inflammatory, this volume didn't even call for Díaz to step down — it merely urged an honest election with the removal of Corral and representation for those who opposed Díaz's reelection. But the book sparked a firestorm of anti-Díaz sentiment. A strong anti-reelection movement sprang up, complete with anti-reelection clubs and then an anti-reelection party, with Madero as its candidate.

Díaz began to grow alarmed. At first, he had considered Madero a joke, referring to him as el loquito (""the little madman""). At a meeting between the two, he caustically observed that ""a man must be more than honest to govern Mexico."" But then he witnessed the groundswell of popular support for anti-reelectionism. On June 6, 1910, he had Madero arrested on charges of inciting to rebellion. Thrown into the penitentiary in San Luis Potosí, he was bailed out by his influential family. On October 4 the tame Chamber of Deputies made the expected announcement and officially declared Díaz and Corral winners in the rigged July election. Deciding that rebellion was inevitable, Madero jumped bail the next day and fled to the United States.

November 20 is celebrated in Mexico as the Day of the Revolution. If one wants to nitpick, it is the celebration of a fiasco. Madero crossed into Mexico with a few followers, the large force he was expecting didn't materialize, and he was forced to recross the border.

But the Revolution was alive and well. Under such authentic popular leaders as the ex-rustler Pancho Villa, the ex-mule driver Pascual Orozco, and the ex-horse trainer Emiliano Zapata, a ragtag army was kicking down the rotting timbers of the Díaz regime. Madero rejoined the revolution and was on hand at the May 1911 battle at Ciudad Juárez that sealed Díaz's fate. It was there that Madero's trusting and forgiving nature first came into conflict with those who believed in playing hardball. Villa and Orozco had wanted to execute General Navarro, the federal commander at Juárez, because he had given the order to bayonet rebel prisoners. Madero, taking into account that Navarro was eighty years old, wished to release him. Following a stormy scene where Orozco threatened him with a pistol, Madero eventually had his way and Navarro was released. Though Pancho Villa, who enormously admired Madero, begged forgiveness for his part in the mutiny, Orozco forever held a grudge and would put his thoughts into action before too long.

After the defeat at Ciudad Juárez, Díaz resigned and went into exile. Madero made a triumphal entry into the capital in June 1911. In October he was elected president by a huge margin in what was probably the most honest election in Mexican history.

But euphoria would soon vanish. In March 1912 a resentful Pascual Orozco, armed and financed by the Chihuahua cattle barons, mounted a counterrevolution. To smash Orozco, Madero called on one of the most sinister figures in Mexican history, General Victoriano Huerta. Another conspirator against the trusting Madero was an individual who surely rates as the worst ambassador in the annals of U.S. diplomatic history. Henry Lane Wilson, hatchet man for big business and apostle of dollar diplomacy, longed for the good old days of Porfirio Díaz. Then there had been a favorable climate for the global capitalism of its day and the masses were held firmly in check. Admiration for Díaz was a common bond between Wilson and Huerta, the latter having wept when the old dictator was deposed and commanded the guard train that took him into exile. Another bond between them was a fondness for the bottle. Their attitude toward Madero was similar to that of two barroom bullies who taunt and ridicule a teetotaling Sunday school teacher. ""You cannot imagine the impertinences of (Wilson),"" said Madero to an associate. ""In a few months Woodrow Wilson will become president of the United States and he is my friend ... I will ask him to change ambassadors. This Henry Lane Wilson is an alcoholic ... Madero, infuriated by Henry Lane Wilson's arrogant and patronizing attitude, was delighted by the unrelated Woodrow Wilson's victory in the 1912 presidential race and looked forward to his becoming president in March 1913.

It was a March he would never see. On February 9 a violent artillery duel broke out in Mexico City. This was in conjunction with a sham battle staged to create an atmosphere of confusion that would facilitate the removal of Madero. The ""rebels,"" secretly in league with Huerta, were led by Félix Diaz, the old dictator's nephew. Again, Madero's trusting nature would lead to disaster. General Villar, who commanded loyalist forces in the plaza, was wounded and Madero appointed Huerta to take his place. Though he neither liked nor trusted Huerta, Madero overrode most of his advisers in making the appointment. Possibly he had in mind Huerta's skilled leadership during Pascual Orozco's rising.

Though this was a fake battle at the higher levels, there was nothing imaginary about the terrible toll of civilian casualties. Taking advantage of widespread desire for the terror to end, Huerta had Madero arrested on February 18.Then he sent the following wire to President Taft: I HAVE THE HONOR TO INFORM YOU THAT I HAVE OVERTHROWN THIS GOVERNMENT ... FROM NOW ON PEACE AND PROSPERITY WILL REIGN.""

In there ever was an unindicted co-conspirator in a great international crime, it was Henry Lane Wilson. He had previous knowledge of the plot, his admiration for Huerta and contempt for Madero were well-known and — the worst blot on his record — he disregarded all pleas to save Madero's life. The day after Madero's arrest Huerta asked Wilson what he should do with Madero — banish him or put him in an insane asylum. In a Pontius Pilate gesture, Wilson replied that Huerta ""ought to do what is best for the country.""

The murderous Huerta saw this as carte blanche to deal with the Madero situation as he saw fit. On February 22nd, while being transferred to another prison by car, Madero was shot dead by one of his captors. Huerta immediately declared that the deposed president had been killed in the crossfire when a group of sympathizers tried to rescue him. To lend credence to Huerta's fabrication, the faithful Henry Lane Wilson issued a statement insisting that it was the truth. Equally sordid was the announcement of a pact between Huerta and his ""enemy,"" Félix Díaz, that Díaz would succeed him as president. (That Huerta later doublecrossed Díaz is beside the point.) There is a final grotesque touch. February 22, the day of Madero's murder, is Washington's birthday. That night Wilson invited Huerta to a reception at the American embassy. There the two conspirators poured champagne and lifted their glasses in a toast — to George Washington.

History has a way of setting events into proper perspective. In January 1954 a Gallup poll showed Harry Truman to be a highly unpopular ex-president and revealed that 50 percent of the American people approved of Senator Joe McCarthy's investigations. (As opposed to 29 percent who disapproved.) Today Truman is widely respected and McCarthy's name has become a synonym for political gangsterism. Right after Madero's deposition and murder, many Americans believed Henry Lane Wilson's claim that Madero was ""a man of disordered intellect"" and Huerta ""the Mexican Cromwell."" Today, Madero shares honors with Juárez and Hidalgo in the pantheon of Mexican heroes while Huerta is universally despised and Wilson is a figure of opprobrium on both sides of the border.

### Legacy

Though (as the previous biography mentioned) Madero's life ended in tragedy, his influence upon Mexico and upon world history in general cannot be understated. One of the revolutionaries who helped create modern day Mexico, his name now graces [one of the most important avenues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madero_Street) in central Mexico City, as well as multiple large throughfares through Mexico. [Statues](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mexico_City_2015_130.jpg) of [him](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Monumento_a_Francisco_I._Madero_frente_al_Centro_de_las_Artes_SLP_003.JPG) are found in most Mexican city centers, and his name even sits on a [Chicago middle school](https://schoolinfo.cps.edu/schoolprofile/schooldetails.aspx?SchoolId=610215). Madero was a truly remarkable man who sadly died way before his time.","If you’re interested in this topic take history 8A!!! It’s a great class on conquest and colonialism in the Americas and includes the Mexican revolution. We learned about Madero in the class too!! Highly recommend as a history breadth. 
Damn I wish I knew this before I applied. It sure would’ve made convincing my parents it was a good thing a lot easier. I heard so much about him growing up but didn’t know this
VAMOS OSOS
Damn he went to cal? TIL
Also History 8B (modern Latin American history) which covers the revolutionary periods on! Awesome class."
