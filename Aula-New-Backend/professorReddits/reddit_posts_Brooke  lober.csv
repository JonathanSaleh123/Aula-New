How is GWS 130AC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15w42bf/how_is_gws_130ac/,2023-08-19 23:52:22,"Hi, I enrolled in GWS 130AC (Brooke Lober) this semester to meet my AC requirements.  Has anyone previously taken this course?  How is this class?","Haven’t take that class but taken a few with Brooke and she’s incredibly intelligent. Go to office hours and get help on any concepts or books/ideas that interest you. She is probably one of my favorite professors I’ve had. Class I took last was writing heavy and some difficult readings, so I would really recommend office hours!
Haven’t taken that but I literally love Prof Lober so much! Last year fall sem, I took GWS 139 with her and it was super interesting & really eye opening. She’s passionate about gender & identity & that really translates in her lectures. Our class was cut off a bit because of the GSI strike, but I 100% recommend taking any class you can with her!
Thanks!! What classes did you take btw?
LGBT 145 and GWS 14! Both were amazing, she is really passionate about everything she teaches and had some really good guest speakers throughout the semester. You’ll love her class if you like the topics or are willing to learn!"
