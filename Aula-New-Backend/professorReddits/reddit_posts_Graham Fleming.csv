Graham Fleming receives executive pay for nearly 1 year after resigning amid sexual harassment allegations,http://www.dailycal.org/2016/06/20/graham-fleming-receives-executive-pay-nearly-year-resigning-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations/,2016-06-20 21:34:16,,"The good ol' boys club marches on!  From [the Chronicle](http://www.sfchronicle.com/education/article/UC-Berkeley-exec-booted-for-sex-harassment-got-to-8313976.php?t=0f7dab8224):

> Records show Fleming’s higher pay was halted in March, one month short of the year of transition leave permitted by UC’s policy.

> Asked to explain the sudden end of the compensation, Mogulof said only that “the chancellor believed it was appropriate to end the transition leave at that time.”

> However, also in March, Napolitano began to scrutinize a different perk that had been provided to Fleming. After he lost the vice chancellor job in spring 2015, Fleming was named by Dirks to another administrative post, at UC Berkeley’s planned Global Campus in Richmond. He was paid a $20,000 stipend and reimbursed for travel in Europe and Asia.

> Napolitano didn’t like that.

> “I expect you to immediately remove Professor Fleming from any administrative positions that he holds,” Napolitano told Dirks in a March 11 letter brimming with frustration about UC Berkeley’s seemingly lax efforts at preventing and punishing sexual harassment by top-level employees.

~$1000/day to sit around at home or live the high life as a reward after being a perv, and a $20,000 bonus and vacations to Europe and Asia as a farewall thank you from fuckin' Dirks.  


Sounds like these are still allegations and not a conviction. why is your noose ready?
 He already got removed from the job... just because he made some poor choices doesn't nullify all of his accomplishments and his executive pay... You don't get to rewrite history on what he contributed just because it makes you feel good.
[Your benefit of the doubt is severely misplaced](http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/UC-Berkeley-s-chief-of-research-exits-as-sex-6195118.php).

> In January, Fleming sent Chancellor Dirks a letter acknowledging that he had “used poor judgment” with Leite on several occasions and that he “sincerely” regretted the actions, “as well as the embarrassment those actions may cause the university.”


Nobody is asking for him to pay back that executive bonus pay, but as the public, we can certainly get outraged that policies and his scumminess meant he still got that pay despite being a perv who used a bullshit resignation ""for personal reasons."" 

On top of that, media and the public have every right to call out the obvious graft in Dirks giving him an appointment to keep his exorbitant pay flowing despite incidents that prove he has betrayed the trust of the University of California as an executive/leader.

I'm not sure what sort of ""justice"" or ""conviction"" you think happens in situations like this, but if you believe in the character of people who have to resign ""for personal reasons"" after a scandal erupts, there are lines of people ready to sell you a bridge. "
Graham Fleming was terminated Friday from his Berkeley Global Campus ambassador role after last year's sexual harassment allegations. The decision was reached after Dirks and Napolitano discussed expectations for handling sexual misconduct incidents.
