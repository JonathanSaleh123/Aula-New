any input would be appreciated :),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/o4m2bn/any_input_would_be_appreciated/,2021-06-20 20:31:25,"hey guys. i was looking to take stat W21 this summer, and the only professor teaching it is Imani Partow. I couldn't find any reviews on her teaching; but I was wondering if anyone knew anything about this professor in general. I'd appreciate any input on the class as a whole as well. (My other option is taking stat 20 with Ibser which I'm a little iffy about).",Hey! I took stat w21 last summer and Imani was a gsi. She was super nice and helpful during office hours. Stat w21 was also a pretty chill class aka you put in work and you get a good grade.
