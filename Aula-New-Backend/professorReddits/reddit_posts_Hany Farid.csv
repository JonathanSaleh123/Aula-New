Hany Farid >>>> John DeNero,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j77oz3/hany_farid_john_denero/,2020-10-07 22:50:33,"To anyone in my CS61A class...Prof. Farid is sooo much better at explaining topics than Prof. DeNero. Whenever I see Prof.Farid in one of the lecture vids  I’m just like “Thank God!!”. If DeNero used some teaching methods that Prof. Farid uses, maybe lecture vids from DeNero would be more fun to watch. 

This is my opinion by the way! Let me know what y’all think!","I absolutely love Farid's lectures, plus they're a little bit longer and I feel like they go more in-depth explaining the concepts and he actually lectures as if it's your first time coding. As much as I like DeNero sometimes his lectures feel like that owl drawing meme.
DeNero is honestly my favorite professor.
They're both amazing lectures, but I have to agree. Hany dumbs down the concepts and the examples he provides are better. Denero overcomplicates it sometimes.

If what you say it's true, you will have gained my trust
Facts
you’re awful and a horrible human being. denero for life
You're a fucking dumbass John 4 lyfe
Yeah, that’s what I’m sayin! And no hate towards DeNero, he is the goat, but sometimes the man says the same word five times in one sentence and It drives me crazy
Lol yeah I just made this account..."
Trying to decide on a Professor Recommendation,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/118r0yj/trying_to_decide_on_a_professor_recommendation/,2023-02-21 22:30:40,"I'm in the process of applying to transfer out of Berkeley to another school, and I'm figuring out which professors I should ask for a recommendation. I need two, and they specifically have to be from a math or science professor. My main problem is that all my classes were huge, and I honestly don't think attending office hours every so often helped much to get my professors to notice me. I was wondering if anyone had experiences on getting recommendations from the following professors, as well as advice on how to approach asking them for the recommendation. Currently, these are my only options:

1. Alexander Paulin(Took Math 1B last semester with him, got an A-)
2. John DeNero or Hany Farid(Currently taking CS61A with them, doing alright in the class)
3. Satish Rao(Currently taking CS70 with him, could do better, but not terrible)
4. Emiliano Gomez(Currently taking Math 53 with him, could do better in the class ngl)

Thank you for any help in advance.","Paulin for sure — I’d recommend him even if you got a lower grade. He’s a genuinely good guy who would always go out to help a student 

Denero would probably not agree to write you one given 61A is such a large class, or even if he does I bet it’ll be pretty generic and thus less impactful 

Not sure about Rao but I’ve heard good things from Gomez so I’d shoot my shot with him
Thank you so much for the input! I think I'm gonna take your word and reach out to Paulin & probably Gomez. I think it's a little easier to approach the latter, since I have class with him, but how do you suggest I approach Paulin? Should I just email him, go to one of his OHs, or something else? I'd also appreciate any tips on how I should say it."
CS 61A for the spring 2023 semester!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wdae9t/cs_61a_for_the_spring_2023_semester/,2022-07-31 23:37:19,"Hi guys, 
I was just wondering who will be teaching CS61A in the Spring 2023 semester?? 

Best,","Probably John DeNero and Hany Farid.
