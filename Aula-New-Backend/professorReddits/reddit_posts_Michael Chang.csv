I can see the Trump administration's rebuttal already:  
""Alternative Reality""
This is so progressive! Drumpf is living in a post-fact, post-science world, and we need scientists to put pressure on him to do the right thing regarding climate change.

Problem is weve ostrasized and demonized politics to the point few educated people want part in it. Leaving the elites/1% the to take full control.  Also as a person who was o  the ballot very time consuming and marketing yourself while measuring the benefits of getting sponsored by people or businesses (which unfortunately is much easier) unless you are already rich. And getting business money to run a campaign and want to rely on that money for the future means you're on the way to becoming that which you despise - a politician - a person who has to make decisions to guarantee their next term in lieu of doing the right thing for the people. So the best you can do is vote for the companies where you hope the people arent watching... such as cory booker and the canada drugs fiasco.

THIS JUST IN: CAL IS JOINING THE ACC AS WELL AS STANFORD. WHAT ARE YOUR GUYS THOUGHTS???,https://i.redd.it/33h258lkonlb1.jpg,2023-09-01 07:40:35,,"Stadium debt is a hell of a drug
Basically instead of flying 1 hour to SoCal to get clapped by usc and ucla, players will fly 6.5 hours to get clapped by Clemson
Much better option than merging with the mountain west conf, OSU and WSU got screwed tho. Sad to see the PAC-12 die
As much as I hate to say it, this gives me a lot more respect for stanfUrd not just bailing and instead requiring the pair to go together. Hats off to them.
This is the best option other than big 10. Very relieved.
UCLA can supplement our revenue for starting all this.  It is telling that Stanfurd stuck with us while fUCLA did not.  Tip of the cap to our rivals, flip the bird to our ‚Äúbrother.‚Äù

ACC ‚Ä¶ it is just ridiculous, but so much better than had we been forced to the Big West or unsustainable independence.
California Golden Bears 2024 ACC CHAMPS! üèÜ
Personally very very happy with the result. Yeah it‚Äôll be expensive but as everyone has already noted this is a better of many bad outcomes. Our Basketball conference is actually upgraded with Duke, UNC, UMiami, Syracuse, and Louisville as our fellow conference mates. Football is relatively good with Clemson, UNC, Notre Dame, Wake Forest and UMiami. In terms of academics Stanford, Cal, Duke and Georgia Tech, and Notre Dame are very intellectual and have a strong culture so happy to be in good company.

More than anything I hope for the success and good mental health of our athletes hope they can thrive just as well if not better (now that they‚Äôve got a little more well rounded traveling). I hope that for all sports because Cal is just so great at so many sports and it‚Äôd be a shame to see any of that lost over something out of the students and schools control.
Great news and a big relief
It's going to be expensive.
So glad! Expanded visibility for great recruits and prefer to be with schools more on par with university academically!!!!
Hopefully, there should be more academic & blue chip players from the south now be interested in Cal/Stanford. Jaylen Brown is from Georgia‚Ä¶ academic & blue chip student-athlete.
I‚Äôm not sure why this is a big deal or what it means for cal sports
away games in miami abouta go so hard
k
Is this what relagation is like?
wrdgaf
I don‚Äôt know what this means and don‚Äôt care that much
Atlantic coast conference. I thought you liberal Californicators weren't about appropriating things that aren't yours. This makes exactly zero sense. Go and have your bankruptcy in your own conference. This is some grade A stupid stuff folks.
Gub‚Äômint gonna give memorial the Soldier Field treatment because it‚Äôs a landmark.
Hot
We wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way ü™ì
If UCB was good, they could‚Äôve joined the Big 10 just like UCLA. UCLA doesn‚Äôt owe UCB anything, it‚Äôs UCB‚Äôs own fault if they‚Äôre running a deficit on sports. They can either figure out how to make more money, or cut programs. We will enjoy the Big 10.
Bro are you serious rn? CAL has an awful athletic dept, that in reality the BIG 10 did not need. As for UCLA supplementing your revenue that ain‚Äôt gonna happen bud. Yes it was mentioned but now you guys aren‚Äôt in the PAC anymore so it doesn‚Äôt stand. Survival of the fittest dude go cry somewhere else.
ND is in all ACC sports except for football & ice hockey. But the ND vs Stanford annual pigskin is still there I believe. Maybe ND should add Cal to their schedule too.
yep, once the pac-12 started crumbling there was no real ""winning play"" for us. The best probably would have been to join the BIG with UCLA and USC, but ACC is likely the next best option.
A year and a half of this shit I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs over‚Äî- Road Trips to Atlanta, Boston, Miami are gonna be so legit
It‚Äôs survival but it‚Äôs only for a few years until the ACC falls apart - Clemson and Florida State are trying the USC/UCLA bullshit
It's the least expensive. All scenarios are bad. The options:

1. Lose a lot of money now, but MAYBE lose less money in the future. Cut some sports. (ACC and reroll during the next realignment round)
2. Lose a lot of money now and in the future. Cut a lot of sports. (MWC/PAC4 Rebuild/Indepdendent)
3. Cancel all sports. (Obviously some of you sickos here would love this. 440 Million debt gets passed to students and/or the California taxpayers. Some of you sickos would love to turn this. Cal becomes a dirty homeless version of Caltech/University of Chicago)
it's all about the money, basically. conference membership means media rights deal, which means money for the athletics program.

we used to be in the PAC-12, which imploded. no other big conference wanted us, so even though joining the ACC is a financial downgrade, it's still better than anything else we were being offered and gives us stability until the end of the contract in 2036. if the ACC hadn't taken us in, there's a good chance we'd have to seriously downsize if not drop some of our sports programs.
We do. Athletics pays for a lot of things. Athletics allows a lot POC/minorities to earn a scholarship and get Berkeley degrees.

So we really do give a fuck. Because the public schools should serve all of its people with all sorts of talents and contributions.
We do tho. We arent stanford or an ivy so we dont get boatloads of private funding. We are partially dependent on football and basketball income whether we like it or not
you said what we all thoughtüôè
College football ebbs and flows by its very nature. There have been times where Cal had the better program and times where UCLA was on top. While UCLA does have to overall average historically, we had a century long competitive rivalry that your school threw away for $$$. The PAC-12 could‚Äôve returned to greatness with some proper leadership, but instead our generational college traditions are dead. Have fun being at the bottom of the big ten.
Nothing about any of this realignment nonsense is about being good at football. Look at Oregon State, who have performed similarly to UCLA in the past few years. Now they're stuck trying to find any conference at all. The Big 10 didn't want UCLA, they wanted USC and Oregon, the 2 biggest programs in the Pac-12. UCLA only got a free ride because Oregon wanted to try and keep the Pac-12 alive back in 2022 and USC was hell bent on leaving. 

Remember 2019 when everyone thought Wilcox had turned Cal around and UCLA was floundering? Have you seen Cal's records from the 2000s when we were going to bowl games every year? Most teams (Cal and UCLA included, and even Michigan was near the bottom of the Big 10 in 2008) alternate between good and bad periods. It's just as natural as the seasons changing. Regional rivalries have always defined college sports, and now they are dying for the sake of TV money.
As someone who moved to MA I‚Äôm hyped to go see my bears. Still wish PAC 12 could continue tho
With 18 teams, there‚Äôs lower risk of the ACC falling apart. That was part of our leverage in negotiations.
The people who would wanna cancel sports are weirdos
I'm down for cutting football and basketball  ;)
Exactly right, TV money in particular. The NCAA Is dead as far as sanctioning bodies go - may as well officially name ESPN-fox sports-legacy networkss as the new governance team
You thought, not ‚Äúwe all‚Äù
UCB Stanford and UCLA USC are arguably much more important rivalries than UCLA UCB. Athletics programs need to support themselves, and both ucla and ucb were/are running deficits. ‚ÄúThrowing away‚Äù a rivalry in the name of reducing how much of my tuition they waste resources given to student athletes is far more important than any rivalry. We‚Äôre a school, not a sports team.
Then let college sports die. They serve no real purpose. In Europe, you either go professional, or you don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no weird ‚Äúin between‚Äù semi-professional level at universities where significant numbers of under qualified students are accepted to universities and given a disproportionate amount of resources despite having 0 change of going pro, just so that the 10-15 students in the school who will *actually* go pro are able to be surrounded by a team. College, especially at top universities like UCB and UCLA, changes lives. Why are we giving away seats in each class to students who aren‚Äôt academically qualified? Those resources would be better used investing in more academic resources, like hiring more faculty so that we can actually get the classes we need, or giving academic scholarships.
Cutting football means cutting every sport.
You have no idea how any of this works
We could have kept every rivalry. Your school saving money has cost my school more, and you didn‚Äôt even inform the UC Regents early enough to make alternate plans. It was a selfish move that destroyed a cherished UC tradition of visiting and partying on each others campuses for the game, so own it and go watch your team lose to Nebraska on TV instead of gloating in our sub.
‚ÄúThey serve no real purpose.‚Äù Now that‚Äôs a wild statement. And yet Europeans constantly want to experience the American university system. College sports isn‚Äôt just a matter of semi-professional level, it‚Äôs a culture. College sports fund most universities and they offer countless benefits. God college would be boring without them.
And we'd have a giant useless stadium.
You might be surprised by how much I actually do know about exactly what's going on; however, I don't give a fuck and know my words on Reddit ain't gonna change shit about how UC Berkeley runs their athletics department.  It's all theory-crafting here.
I‚Äôm not a football fan, I haven‚Äôt been watching games and I don‚Äôt plan on watching games, I‚Äôm just glad that less of my tuition will be wasted on sports if we start making more money. 

Plus, since when has UCB been anything but selfish? UCB has never cared about the other UCs, yet now UCLA makes a decision without worrying about UCB‚Äôs little feelings, and everyone is pissed?!?! It‚Äôs not UCLA‚Äôs job to care about UCB or do anything at all to look out for UCB, when UCB has never done the same. UCB would‚Äôve left to the Big 10 in a heartbeat if they had sniffed out a chance to make more money, and wouldn‚Äôt have given a second thought to UCLA.
I don‚Äôt think ucb has ever screwed over another UC like this, we have a responsibility as the flagship not to. And if you‚Äôre not a football fan, why are you even in here typing essays? UCLA lil bro energy is something else
Because it‚Äôs my school running a deficit on athletics. It‚Äôs my tax dollars and tuition subsidizing this ridiculous sports system. And it‚Äôs exactly the attitude of UCB thinking it‚Äôs such a special ‚Äúflagship‚Äù campus that is the problem. UCB is so caught up in its own circle jerk of considering itself the best that it can‚Äôt accept another campus making a choice without considering UCB.
If you followed the sport before bringing your cringe inferiority complex to this thread, you‚Äôd realize letting cable TV money corrupt college sports is an ongoing problem, and UCLAs continuation of that trend was derided across the nation, not just here at Berkeley. Anyway, shouldn‚Äôt you be preparing for your school year instead of obsessing over our alleged superiority? Here, I‚Äôll help you get back on track with a block :)"
Incoming data science freshman schedule. Thoughts or Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xx9lv/incoming_data_science_freshman_schedule_thoughts/,2023-07-12 11:55:32,"1. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler (mixed reviews on RMP but seems like a hard professor), CS 61A with Prof. John Denero (not sure if I‚Äôll enroll as a DS major and with 300 waitlist max), and EPS 7 Climate Change and Computer science mentors (not sure how to enroll in CSM)

2. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler, DATA C8 w/ Prof. Swupnil Sahai, EPS 50 Planet Earth w/ Michael Manga

3. Math 32 (Precalculus) w/ Prof. Rui Wang (bad reviews on RMP but not suer if I should enroll in precalculus since I want to do well in calculus at Cal), CS 10 w/ Dan Garcia (friendlier pace than CS 61A) and some other random GE course

4. Math 32 w/ Prof. Rui Wang (again, has bad reviews on RMP), Data C8, and some random GE.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like.

New Schedule Draft is out for Fa22,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rvkrew/new_schedule_draft_is_out_for_fa22/,2022-01-03 19:47:26,"Link: [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html)

Interesting stuff I noted was

* CS 61A being taught by Professor P. Fox herself, which is great to see! I guess this means Denero is off in the data science dept, maybe there's news for data8/data100 there as well?
* Professor Hug back in 61b, i wonder if he will continue to teach gitlet so early in the semester if at all, I wonder who will be teaching data 100 then...
* New faculty hire in Lisa Yan (not completely new as they are teaching data100 with Prof Hug this spring [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001)),
* Professor Ranade teaching 16b and 127 (which a LOT of people were waiting for),
* Michael Ball teaching 375,
* Professor Popa in 261 (which is completely unrelated from CS 161 which is taught by Nick Weaver -- kinda a shame as I wanted to see him branch out and teach some other classes (61b with Nick sounds fun lol, may make it redesigned in golang though XD, same with 162) but I understand that 161 being offered every semester is important to it being persisted and I'm sure fa22 161 students are overjoyed at the news lol)
* and Professor Rao in CS 70 again also was great to see as they are very familiar at teaching those areas.
* On that note Professor Babak Ayazifar will be teaching both CS 70 and EE 120 per [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html) which is great news for anyone who couldn't get in this semester!
* Professor Chasins teaching CS 164 again, seems like a return for OCaml and a tearful goodbye to Hilfinger's ChocoPy (btw where is Hilfinger on here?? I hope he hasn't retired...).
* CS 168 finally being offered although CS 160 is not offered (not an issue since it's usually there in summers),
* Professor A. Sahai teaching  CS 182 (seems like we'll get another bio-focused 189 since he's not there but him teaching a PyTorch class (altho 182 is clearly more than that) falls in line with what I saw in eecs16b),
* 186 being completely online even with everything hopefully back in-person. I guess it will be CS W186 then?
* No CS 188, though if it happens, Russell and D. Song are my guesses for the professors if they get the funding for that to go through and Abbeel still isn't able to teach it.
* As well as a return of a few 194s (I heard a few more are planned yet to be listed though such as Dawn Song's DeFi CS 194/294-177).

&#x200B;

Keep in mind this is still a draft so changes can be made, but thoughts?","Lisa Yan was a lecturer at Stanford for a couple of years. She has a PhD in CS education (also from Stanford) and is an excellent instructor overall. Hug and Yan should be nothing short of the teaching dream team.
Holy shit they resurrected 168 from the grave
It is unlikely that I will do gitlet at all. As much as some students love it, it has relatively poor synergy with the course material, and I also personally find it a bit boring (sorry Joey! It is a **great** project, just not my style). But I'll review all the course evaluations over the summer to decide whether to keep it or not.
goated, thnx for the update
From what I've seen, CS 160 is planned for the spring next year.
182 is more of an applications class.  Wonder how Sahai will approach it.  Hopefully they offer it in the spring with another professor in case he makes it theory intensive.
Ranade and P. Fox, we love to see it
Oh I so want to teach other classes.  But 161 is one of the classes we‚Äôve scaled to meet demand (500+/semester).  The only way to maintain that is run the class every semester.  I‚Äôd really like to do 162/redo-162-project-as-194/162 as a sequence.
Good to see 176 back, though Prof Yosef isn‚Äôt teaching it.  But since Prof Ioannidis is so involved on the comp bio end, she a good replacement.
Gonna take 182 with my favorite prof
who's pamela fox?
and also what has dan garcia been doing i haven't heard of him since his 61c semester in the first semester of online
damn 176 seems like a really cool class. Doubt I'll get in though. Are prerequisites usually enforced for CS classes?
[deleted]
I miss Ranade
SO happy about babak teaching 120!!
182 is taught in pytorch, not tensorflow
hmm does this mean Shewchuck is not teaching 189 this semester?
Just to clarify, who is teaching 189 in Fa 22?
I'm really interested in 168, but since it's scarcely offered, does anyone know whether it's a difficult class to get into? I'll be a senior then, so i should have a decent slot all things considering
No 188 either.
Is 162 a preq for 168? I‚Äôm seeing conflicting info on different sites
I would recommend Demmel/Nelson cs170. I took Jelani Nelson's cs170 and enjoyed his teaching style very much. It's a hard class, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it was all worth it.
Yes, Prof. Hilfinger is retiring. His last lecture is tomorrow 4/29 at 1pm in 155 Dwinelle.
omg you just made me remember that Lisa Yan was the one i was referring to in [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)   


I'm glad she finally decided to leave Stanfurd for Cal, go bears!
Let's just hope there exist enough TAs out there for the class to be a normal upperdivision size now...
Any thoughts on the lack of a fall offering for its future? Dyt it doesn‚Äôt matter as much as other classes because of summer + is cs160 usually a ‚Äúfall xor spring‚Äù class?

I didn‚Äôt mention stuff like 270 not appearing for that reason (it‚Äôs biyearly spring only)!
I actually have the opposite viewpoint: Marvin Zhang's 182 appears to be less application-focused than past iterations (the usual final project is now a final exam being the main point, until the course site comes out not much more to say on the matter). I hope Sahai recognizes the power of PyTorch and brings back an application-based final project, as he did when introducing those notebooks into 16b. Marvin Zhang making DS 189 Listgarten/Malik-theory oriented instead of Shewchuk application-oriented is another example of how he prefers theory but we will have to wait and see what actually happens this spring (note that this makes sense for DS as many of those students are double majoring in a subject like biology so listgarten's version does make more sense to offer to DS students).

However, you very well could be correct. Maybe Sahai will make it even more theory intensive as that's always a possibility. The fact that NNs need big data makes me hope a deep NN class would be very application-based but if Sahai ruins it then we always have Levine's [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL\_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A) to lean back on and audit... definitely not the same though :(
Yeah I‚Äôm sure other universities would also love seeing a Rust OS project on the scale of pintos üëÄ

After all Berkeley did take inspiration from Stanford, this could be a chance for Berkeley to give back and help lead education in that sector!
hopefully me and you both survive through bestie üòµ‚Äçüí´
Pamela Fox is a new lecturer who has taught 61a alongside DeNero and Hilfinger in the past alongside some other classes (she was a CS 302 co-lecturer last spring, the class for summer instructors, maybe 169 as well iirc but i have a shaky memory there and the other Professor Fox teaches that so I very well could be confounding the two).

I talked to her once about the work she did at Khan Academy on their CS curricula (which I actually used as a kid growing up)  as well as some stuff she did on Coursera. She's done *a* *lot* for 61a these past few semesters and I'm interested in seeing how she changes the course as it's a course that has been evolving a lot recently with SQL ‚Üí Regex ‚Üí BNF etc, as well as an A+ project and new additions from when I took it! I can tell she cares about teaching a lot and have had heard good things about people who took 61a with her though she came just after my time... I took 61a in su20 haha.

And I think Dan was on sabbatical.
usually not
yeah and we could also use those profs to teach grad classes like 286, does 186 still use Hellerstein's lectures lol?
well now she's back from her leave and teaching 2 classes at that :)
yeah, usually he teaches 120 in the spring only, this is quite a surprise IMO but a pleasant one at that!
yeah... i think i misremembered because it was pytorch that Prof Sahai introduced into eecs16b this semester (which is what i referred to), i think i just typed the wrong thing, ill edit it, thanks!
He is for spring 22, the above is for fall 22 which is after sp22.
Also note that Shewchuk is only teaching CS 189, DS 189 will be taught by Marvin Zhang
NVM: Listgarten and Malik
prolly will be. but i think most seniors will get into it. i doubt any juniors will get in. Depends on how big the class is also, if its around 500, itll be fine but if its < 300, then big yikes
FWIW there were 500 seats last time it was offered [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001)
it's not, that's an old prereq
and she can also teach CS 168 in the future so this is incredibly based
BTW, Lisa Yan also did her undergrad at Cal, which is doubly awesome
Prof. Fox co-taught 169 this past semester. I didn‚Äôt love the class (more specifically, I absolutely hated it), but its failings weren‚Äôt her fault and she clearly has a passion and a great talent for teaching CS. It‚Äôll be cool to see her teach a class that isn‚Äôt buzzwordy garbage!
that's good. Still don't think i'll get in though since I'm not a cs major and I imagine seats are reserved T_T.  thank you for the answer!
[deleted]
Oop you're right my apologies.

Wait, 182 is being offered Fa22?! Let's goo!
ya but there were more TAs back then since 168 was offered once a year. Its been 2.5 years since, so there will be a lack TAs along with the fact that the budget is less
Thank you
yeh as i said above, havent taken a class with her so everything above was second-hand anecdotal. Though i bumped into her in Soda a couple of times and she was a nice person to talk to. Am also a huge fan of her work at Khan Academy. I think she'll do good things with 61a though i thought it was a great class as is when i took it (doesn't mean that it cant improve ofc).
if you phase 1, and wait it out then who knows
:o isn‚Äôt that the first live lec 186 in awhile? Is this confirmed or could this still change, might have to sign up for it if so
Yeah that‚Äôs also usually a spring-only class, I was surprised to see it there‚Ä¶ I also think this is  Prof A. Sahai‚Äôs first time teaching it, should be an interesting experience
yeah ive been worrying about that myself tbh"

Although some students are concerned that Obama‚Äôs decision to speak at UCI may decrease the likelihood of the president coming to another UC campus just a year later, Saigali said the announcement has only motivated him further.

I have not heard any news about Barack Obama being Berkeley's 2015 commencement speaker. Does anyone know anything about this?","Doubt it. All you have here is some evidence that people want him to speak (which is probably true at every school) and that's about it.
If to be honest, I prefer Guy Fieri on Obama.

Given that Saigali doesn't have the power to personally invite President Obama, the campaign is technically successful if the invitation was sent (regardless of whether it was accepted.) Frankly I think most of us with resume writing experience would write something similar in his position.
People inflate their credentials on linkedin all the time. ""Successful"" doesn't have a specific meaning and can be interpreted a number of ways.

I mean if Obama giving the commencement is supposed to be a secret, then surely this guy would know not to give it away on social media.

And if it's not a secret, why wouldn't they have told us when he was booked?
he successfully invited him. Doesn't say anywhere that the invitation was accepted, just that he was ""invited"" to speak
[deleted]
I am skeptical too that President Obama will be the commencement speaker.

I agree with you that this might be credentials inflation. I'm not sure what Elias Saigali means by ""successful campaign."" The writing is misleading if he doesn't define ""successful"" and Obama's not giving the speech. I also don't understand why Elias Saigali is being so specific about the commencement's location (Memorial Stadium) and date (May 16, 2015).
fuckin kek if this happened id actually be excited about general commencement, just to see some rustled liberals one last time
May just be playing the language here. ""Invite"" may be the keyword here, not ""successful campaign."" Essentially, maybe he's just propping up the fact that he invited the President by using more interested words to distract from that fact, like ""led"" and ""successful campaign."""
"Background on the strike, why I'm on strike, and why you should be too",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yy57d9/background_on_the_strike_why_im_on_strike_and_why/,2022-11-17 15:38:00,"Hi folks! I'm Liam, a member of CS 170 course staff.

We are currently in the midst of the largest academic strike in US History ‚Äì as many of you have likely heard by now, over 48,000 academic workers are currently on strike. As of today, bargaining teams from all four academic bargaining units are attempting to negotiate with the University, and this small window of time will prove to be a crucial moment that must be capitalized on. The contract we decide on will govern us for years to come.

**Why you should strike/picket/support your staff:**

Students:

We are fighting for funding, specifically a more livable compensation for our teachers and a dedicated increase in EECS staffing from the UC. This will lead to a better learning experience for you as students, giving you advantages such as:

\- shorter OH queues

\- more small group tutoring

\- with more staff, you will be able to get into the classes you want to take

In addition to this, the students who are most vulnerable are those who were not privileged enough to receive extra academic preparation beforehand; students with less experience often have a difficult time in computer science, especially here at Berkeley, and it frequently results in them being turned away from it. This manifests itself in the following ways:

\- students are expected to do exceptionally well in our massively sized and difficult lower divs, yet are left to drown, lacking adequate course support

\- if students cannot pass the GPA requirement, they cannot even enroll in CS classes

\- non-majors, e.g. CS-cluster applied math majors, are not allowed to enroll in CS upper-divs period

\- the poor compensation and long hours make the (u)GSI position much less attractive to those who have to pay for school themselves(they could engage in private tutoring instead, or some other job that pays market rate), reducing the diversity in course staff and limiting access to these important jobs(which can be a stepping stone for an academic career) for underrepresented students

It is not hard to see that it is those students who are the least groomed-beforehand for CS (i.e. underprivileged students, the backbone of our diversity) that end up suffering the most; *if the University of California wants to continue to lay claim to its storied diversity, it must deal with the fact that it can only do so by diverting funding to the aspects of the school that actually serve to constitute and nurture this diversity.*

**Background on the strike for EECS:**

EECS has the largest population of academic workers on campus. Teaching quality has suffered. The way we've adapted is by resorting to more ""scalable"" options that aren't very productive for your learning, or for our assessment of your learning. We have created mass auto-graders to check your code instead of having a TA present to help you go line-by-line; the latter is how it should be, especially at the greatest public university in the country. We've resorted to multiple choice and short answer questions, discouraging creativity and stripping away from students the ability to explain why they chose what they chose ‚Äì  we've increasingly taken away the human aspect of teaching, the aspect of teaching that leaves permanent, endlessly inspirational impressions on students. Personalized feedback and guided assistance is the most effective way to learn. Without this, we might as well all go on coursera to learn from Andrew Ng and search up practice problems on our own and grade them on our own ‚Äì keep in mind how much you‚Äôre paying to be here. Is it so much to ask that courses be adequately staffed, in a non-exploitative manner? Because we cannot afford to hire more TAs, the quality of teaching in our department has really suffered. I‚Äôm sure many of you can attest to this.

In addition, lower division courses often have to rely on unpaid labor to adequately support students. Since they don't have enough money to hire more tutors and TAs, they often will rely on Academic Intern labor just to serve the course. I was both an AI and a volunteer for computer science mentors; Computer Science Mentors (CSM), a volunteering club, is also heavily sought after for assistance in the lower divisions. *To put it bluntly, the University of California is relying on unpaid volunteers in order to provide only the most basic academic infrastructure for their students*. It would be hard to call this anything but abhorrent and exploitative, and it has the stark consequence that the more vulnerable students who cannot afford to provide unpaid labor cannot get the experience they need in order to be competitive for a paid position; again, we claim to be committed to diversity here.

**Why I'm on strike:**

This is my 4th time on course staff.

OH queues are ridiculous. For example, the course I'm currently serving has 2-3 people staffing an office hours that regularly draws 30+ students, each of whom is different and deserves their own individualized assistance. This is all that we can afford. The homework in my class is hard, and more likely than not, each person needs a lot more time than the mere 10 minutes we allot to each student to understand the material. But there are more people in the queue, and unfortunately we just have to move on to the next person before adequate assistance can be given.

Here‚Äôs some simple math: in each block of one hour, each staff member can talk to 6 students on average. Since we have 2-3 staff, that means 12-18 students get help in an hour. There are 30 students and people are continually coming into OH for help. We simply cannot reach everyone in a timely manner. *I have friends that are discouraged from coming into office hours due to what is regularly a 2-3 hour long queue.*

I was a student in an upper division EECS class last year. I was at office hours once with 20+ students. There was one TA, who was there for one hour. Nonetheless, when that TA left, most of us were left no better off than we were before OH started. There were simply not enough people to staff that OH.

What would we do with more money? Staff OH properly. Hire more tutors for group tutoring! My course (CS 170) is difficult and people would benefit massively from small group tutoring, such that we can go through the algorithms and strategies together, and provide personalized feedback. We could afford to hire more people to read through your code and suggest best practices ‚Äì who doesn‚Äôt want this? We could get rid of the rubrics for design docs that make it hard for you to really learn. We could make exams that actually test your knowledge, in a manner that‚Äôs far more equitable and far more thought-provoking than a small fill-in box, or bubble-in circle.

The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring. This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. *This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.*

**There's another, arguably more important side to it:**

GSIs, ASEs, and lecturers are heavily overworked and underpaid. Due to a lack of staff, we often have to take up extra work ‚Äì we have to choose between our students and our own personal well-being. I've been forced to choose between a break in between my discussion and my office hours after a long day of work, or helping my students. This is tortuous because every single one of us feels a genuine, human obligation to our students. There are so many great things about teaching, and the university expects us to quietly bear the unnecessary hardships (overwork, underpay) just so we can do what we love. We as an academic community deserve to work with dignity ‚Äì we should not be told to keep our heads down and suck it up. It is a job.

Lecturers often have to cover for the lack of funding and it hurts them immensely, not to mention the fact that it just isn‚Äôt fair. For GSIs in particular: GSIs are rent-burdened, overworked, and especially underpaid. They are people like anybody else, and should not have to be living paycheck to paycheck, if they‚Äôre even managing that. They deserve a living wage, especially here in the bay where everything is just unthinkably expensive.

**What you as a student can do:**

\- Show support for your staff on Ed. Tell them you support them. Heart their strike posts on Ed, it means a lot

\- Make a post on Ed encouraging TAs who are on strike to keep striking, ans TAs who aren‚Äôt on strike yet to start striking

\- Show up to the picket line. Visibility is super important in a strike.

\- [Sign the community support petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/uaw-undergraduate-letter-of-support?source=direct_link&).

\- Tell your friends who are indifferent about the strike why they should support the strike, and engage in proactive dialogues wrt the strike among your acquaintances.

**For those of you that feel that you have a duty to your students:**

Students are currently suffering, have been suffering, and will continue to face the consequences of understaffed courses until something changes. My heart sinks when I hear that my students are discouraged from coming into office hours because of 3-hour queues; I know, we all know that students greatly need more individualized support. Without any change, we will not be able to provide that which we know our students need. They deserve a better education than they are currently being provided, and in my opinion, fulfilling your duty to them means going on strike and picketing until UC can meet our demands. Only then will we be able to serve our students in the manner in which they should be served, as students at the #1 public university in the country.

**GSIs who are still going into work:**

\- You are likely overworked and underpaid.

\- There is little job security. For some PhD students, every semester is a new struggle to find funding, since not every PI has enough GSR funds, and GSI appointments are semester-by-semester

\- The quality of the education here will skyrocket with more funding. We will not have to resort to autograders and multiple choice questions ‚Äì this means a more fulfilling, and more importantly less soulless, teaching experience.

EECS especially has had to deal with the brunt of the UC's unfair labor practices. Classes are universally understaffed, students cannot enroll in classes that they want or even need to take, lecturers and TAs are heavily overworked, and there is little job security for researchers and academic employees alike.

**Why we need to be out on the picket line:**

*Withholding labor is only half the battle.*

Picketing is so important because it gives us the visibility that is needed to make real change at the university-wide level. This visibility goes very far in showing the University how much power we, as the academic workers at the school, hold. We do a large majority of the work in the EECS department and the University must be made to understand how crucial we are as academic workers to the everyday-functioning of the school. No academic workers means no UC Berkeley. If we just sat at home and did nothing, the university would not care or notice. By making a lot of noise, it is unambiguously shown how many of us there are, and how much we are willing to do to be treated only fairly.

Plus! Picketing is fun! There is music, dancing, food, and all of your friends there along with you. You meet new people from different departments. You connect with others who are each there for their own reason. *These are valuable connections ‚Äì anybody who‚Äôs friends with a grad student knows that it‚Äôs a great thing to have.*

**We are making history out there. There have been, there are, and there always will be many who would like to see the University of California made into a docile, lifeless machine ‚Äì in the words of Mario Savio we must throw our bodies upon the gears, or we risk being enveloped eternally within them. See you on the picket line.**

Genuine question here. I understand why it's necessary but sadly I don't know much about the financial situation of UC and I'm just wondering how the university is going to pay more once they reach an agreement with the union? Do they have a lot of extra money that they are spending on nonessential matters now (exceedingly high wages for administrators, buying random expensive things that only a few people use) or are they going to have to get the money from somewhere else (raising tuition, more funding from state gov, reallocating fund from sports or research)? If they are spending the money unwisely then they definitely need to use those money to pay our academic workers better. If they don't, does that mean researchers and atheletes will have less funding or we students have to pay a higher tuition?
OP post
I‚Äôm kinda confused on the budget for this, if salaries are increased and staffing is increased, where is the money coming from, higher tuition?
Quick question: Is my math here right? [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi_gsi_pay_gap_is_gsi_pay_really_only_16hour/)

I've been trying to understand the whole deal. Like I think right now UGSIs make $34/hour and GSIs make $16/hour. Is that right? And if the union wins that goes to $66/hour for UGSIs and $30 an hour for GSIs? 

I really hope you can get more money, especially for GSIs, but still honestly a little conflicted about the proposed UGSI pay if I'm understanding correctly. Like I can justify it that UGSIs can land really good internships, but if I'm just totally off base that'd also be good to know.
See hundreds of CS, EECS, DS and more students out on picket lines and supporting each other makes me so proud!   


The myth that engineers do not care and are uninvolved is clearly wrong!
I don't think the issue with CS is entirely due to low pay/benefits. CS is definitely overcrowded and deserve a larger share of the university budget overall, because it takes on a disproportionately higher teaching load.

What strike would do is put pressure to cut cost, which is already there. That's why CS is admitting fewer students and dropping graduation requirements right now.
The best way to support your GSIs is to post on Ed!  Make it known that you support them!
This is a really helpful post, thank you. I have a question about the $54,000/yr salary number. My understanding that is for 20 hrs/wk work. How can anyone expect to survive working only part-time? I know I am missing something so that is why I am asking, but it is unreasonable to me that people think they can take a part-time Job and that will support them. 

For examples, The literary workers in New York City are also striking right now. Many of them make around $40k/yr, have graduated from college, work full time and have to live in NYC.
This post is SO GOOD
I remember back when grad school was about school, and being a student was being a student...

...if someone referred to me as an ""Academic Worker"" I would be offended. I'm here to learn, and discover truth! I'm not here for a job. If I wanted a job, I'd have gone into industry.
Thank you Liam!!
Don‚Äôt forget defunding UC police.  You‚Äôre also on strike to defund UC police.
Fight for 66! ($66/hr and tuition reimbursement for uGSIs)
How would the strike lead to shorter office hours wait times? Higher wages would probably mean they hire fewer people right? That‚Äôs very simple microeconomics.
Stop harassing undergrads.
no on is gonna read this god damn book you just posted
I don‚Äôt go here. But what happens to your grades and Assignments? Is there concern over that or no?
Why don‚Äôt TAs just quit?

Everyplace is hiring.
Not exactly. In fact there are no discussions being held and (I believe) no OH being held either. As for Ed, the amount of support is nowhere near normal levels. Since Homework 12 is optional, I would assume most people have elected to focus their efforts elsewhere.
How does this reconcile with Justin scabbing?
I had the same question as well, as an alum who hasn't kept up with the situation. I had to re-read the post, but the OP does address it in the bottom of ""Why I'm on strike."" I take this to mean they're asking for an increase in headcount, and that puts pressure on departments / the school for higher hiring budgets? 

>**The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring.** This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.
Two separate demands at the bargaining table. Higher pay, as well as increased staffing. Also, happier GSI makes for better teaching in my opinion.
They're two separate demands. Yeah it does sound counterproductive at first to ask for more money AND more GSI positions, but honestly EECS is small compared to the entire UC system so even the higher cost per GSI is going to be irrelevant in the bigger picture.  Like increasing everyone's wages is going to cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year, so a small number of extra positions in one department at one campus is not a big deal, esp. if they resolve the UGSI / GSI pay gap issue (assuming it exists and I did my math right).
I‚Äôm honestly not optimistic about future CS undergrad exp. Waiting two hours for a 10 minute uGSI session (who barely knows the topic better than you do) does more than dissuading you from seeking help: it trains your ability to do independent work to the point where seeking help is not even a part of your mind when you enter upper div courses. The current revealed gap already seems unfulfillable, and just imagine how many hidden gaps we are missing here‚Ä¶
I think the additional hiring is for TAs, tutors, etc. not faculty.
This will come from UC central funding, not the department. UC has the money.
My worry is that if the university is forced to both pay more and hire more they just won‚Äôt offer classes every semester to balance it out
Very OP
Couple things to clear up. In reality they are working full time. They are working as research assistants, as well as student instructors. They teach, do their own research, help their professor with research, and have their own classes on top of that. They are not working 20 hours. They are working much more (Teaching + research). Next, there is a cap on how much they can work. They cannot get above 20 hours of pay. They are also in school for 5-7 years. Are we really to expect them to live paycheck to paycheck for that long? They are productive instructors and researchers/academics and deserve to make a living wage. They quite literally make this school function. I am glad the librarians are striking. The bay area is quite expensive as well. Grad students have also graduated from college. We want this to be setting a benchmark for academic salary and hopefully other schools/organizations will follow suit for fair pay.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs.

If Berkeley wants to remain competitive as a top grad school, it needs top talent. To obtain top talent, it needs to get as close as it can to what other schools can offer. If top graduate students stop coming here, Berkeley very quickly devolves into a teaching school. Without good GSRs to do the ""grunt"" work for them, PIs would be less productive. Without good GSIs that can alleviate the effort of teaching, faculty would have more work teaching, and be less productive. Faculty choose to remain at Berkeley, despite the lower pay, because of the human capital: other faculty and high quality graduate students.

So it is ok for you to think that Berkeley shouldn't pay grad students for ""part time work"", just understand that it would just lead to destroying grad programs here and improving grad programs elsewhere.

From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge. Knowledge creates technology, which has massive spillovers/positive externalities. Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.

Fuck off, and stop posting in bad faith about the most obscure corner of the proposal that 99% of people don't care about.
come back to reality
Context: This is for 20 hour GSI/head TA. This amounts to 54k a year, which is calculated based on the cost of living in the bay, as well as to make sure GSIs are not rent burdened, which is defined as spending more than 30% of income on rent.  This is the GSIs primary income. They are capped at 20 hours. They cannot get paid for more than that. For all their research and teaching, 54k what they should receive.
Holy fuck uGSIs are asking for A LOT more than what grad students get paid if true.
Ok, if you want to make more money than what a google internship pays, better become a C++ cow and work for Citadel.
Two separate demands. One for higher wages. The other specifically for increased EECS staffing. The increased staffing will lead to shorter OH wait times.
I personally haven't seen this behavior on my own picket line, but I personally have experienced jeering from some other picketers while walking to the library when I took a shift off. I really hope this isn't the norm for most picket lines, and I don't think it is. I'll make sure to talk to the people on my picket line for sure and some of the union leaders about this issue!
Fucker Carlson strikes again
Ah gotcha is this an eecs specific point?
Question for you, realistically what is the chance that both demands got fufilled? I wholeheartedly wish that can happen. I can definately see that EECS enrollment is impacted by short staffing and budget cut, and there have been lectures asking for more budget to the department as well. Hiring 50% more will improve undergrads experience, but bring this up under a post that advocate for GSIs higher pay is confusing as these demand conflits with each other.

It's not librarians. It is people at HarperCollins - literary workers in the publishing industry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html)

Well, I really want to support the strike so need to keep learning and will continue to do my best in that. Right now it seems you have lots of options, including coming back to school to get advanced degrees. Are they not allowed to work outside of the university? People like me worked 3 jobs just to be able to go to college and get my undergraduate degree. After college we worked 2 or sometimes 3 jobs to be able to afford to live where we live, had roommates and ate at happy hours. I am not unsympathetic, sincerely trying to understand but at the moment it doesn't sound like slave labor to me.
I'd be really interested in the net cost differences between Cal and similarly ranked programs because for instate undergrad there is a huge difference in cost vs. similarly ranked (mostly private) schools. Is that not the case for grad school?

And do note, I don't think Berkeley should not pay their part-time grad workers, but in my ignorance, I don't think $54k/yr is gawd awful pay. Median income in Alameda County is $45,882. Thank you for taking the time to give more food for thought. I appreciate it and do hope working conditions improve and a fair wage is worked out.
It's not obscure and it's abhorrent. Get the union to take it off so we can stop getting distracted by it. People DO care about it and it worries people that the union would be so stupid. What other stupid things might they do in the name of caring for their workers. For better or worse, members need to keep their leadership straight!
I‚Äôm just stating what the union is asking for / what the strike is all about
Devil's Advocate question. Why is it expected that GSIs be able to earn a living wage off of a 20 hour position? Both undergraduate and professional schools expect you to have negative net income, with the assumption future salary more than outweighs the costs.
Why would it be for 20 hours? My understanding is that you guys often put in 40 hours of work per week, so why not put in for reclassification as 40-hour per week full-time employees with the same salary? That is what I presumed was being advocated for this whole time, as it makes the most sense.
You have to keep in mind that the UC relies on the legal fiction that grad students only work 20 hours per week.
Unless things have changed since my day, uGSIs with 10 hour appointments make bank (well over $50/hour) thanks to the fee waivers.
So shorter office hours for EECS and longer for other classes?
That would really help the perception of the strike I believe.
Yes this is EECS specific but, to my understanding, it is the first time the UC has ever allowed bargaining over staffing for any department so this is a step in the right direction for everyone else
Sounds like it
The raise would bankrupt the department, but the union is saying the university should fund the increased staff levels AND the raises. The union site says the total cost of the whole thing is only 3% of the UC budget.
It‚Äôs super common for PhD students to be restricted from having any other jobs or if generous be limited to say 10 hrs/wk. For masters students it can be different, but PhD students are limited to the salary the UC and their department set for typically 5-7 years of their 20s and/or 30s.
You're missing the main point: grad students are not like undergrads. They're not like students at all, except for the first year or two of the program. PhD students in particular are expected to work extreme hours on their research, with teaching being something they fit in as they can. This research is not generally some self-directed thing for the educational benefit of the student. It is actual directed work necessary to maintain the universities standing, and continue to bring grant funds in. 

When I was a PhD student, my advisor made it very clear that he expected 60 hours of work a week. The fact that this is recorded as a 'part-time' 20 hours a week job is just a legal fiction that allows the University to avoid labor laws. GSRs and GSIs are direct employees of the university, and they are absolutely expected to work more than full time for that employer, regardless of what is put on paper to avoid paying benefits.
I think the point is we don't want grad students workers to have to work 2 or 3 full time jobs to survive. Again, they don't have much time on their hands after doing their own research, helping their professor with research, taking classes, studying for qualifying exams, as well as running EECS classes. I'd say they barely have enough time to do all that I just listed. Given that, finding outside work isn't that feasible in my opinion. For more perspective on understanding this, talk to some grad students and hear them out directly. I personally can only say what I've heard grad students tell me, but I'm sure if you talk to some yourself, you'll find some answers.
Nobody is getting 54k a year today. Mine is 30, many programs pay 24.

What do you mean by net cost? Tuition is funded by the departments.
It's about a lot more. You are focusing on literally the most controversial sounding piece of the proposal. UGSIs aren't that common across the whole system and you are trying to shoot down the whole strike because some relatively tiny group of people is going to make $66/hour under the current proposal (which is subject to change). You are totally ignoring the other 47000 people going on strike. See [https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/](https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/), like people literally cant afford to be grad students at Berkeley despite working 40 hours or more per week.
As a grad student I struggle with this question all the time and I don‚Äôt have a good answer. Because we do get tuition covered as part of our compensation package. One issue is that if we can‚Äôt afford to live here we will just go somewhere else where pay does have better correlation to cost of living. Another argument is that we should actually restructure graduate education as whole since PhD programs in other countries are considered jobs. 
If someone has a better answer I would love to see it! Because I support a lot of these initiatives and would love to get paid more but can make sense of UC‚Äôs ‚Äúlogic‚Äù
Because graduate students after the first year or two are basically working full time for the university for its benefit. At the beginning I think they all take classes, but eventually they're either in a lab 40 hours per week or they're teaching 20 hours a week and doing 20+ hours of research. 

I don't know much about professional schools, but I assume that students in them are mostly taking classes and doing assignments, rather than providing 40+ hours of valuable labor to their school.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs. 

If Berkeley wants to remain competitive as a top grad school, it needs top talent. To obtain top talent, it needs to get as close as it can to what other schools can offer. If top graduate students stop coming here, Berkeley very quickly devolves into a teaching school. Without good GSRs to do the ""grunt"" work for them, PIs would be less productive. Without good GSIs that can alleviate the effort of teaching, faculty would have more work teaching, and be less productive. Faculty choose to remain at Berkeley, despite the lower pay, because of the human capital: other faculty and high quality graduate students. 

So it is ok for you to think that Berkeley shouldn't pay grad students for ""part time work"", just understand that it would just lead to destroying grad programs here and improving grad programs elsewhere.

From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are *producers* of knowledge instead of *consumers* of knowledge. Knowledge creates technology, which has massive spillovers/positive externalities. Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.
What I'm saying is, according to what the union proposed on the salary adjustment, uGSI will get much more than grad students if the union won(66 vs \~30). So the pay gap between undergrads and grads will look even worse if you are implying grad students typically works more than 20 hrs.
Here's the thing. The UC budget is almost entirely salaries. The budget is also siloed, the medical centers/hospitals operate under a separate budget then the teaching parts.

What the union is proposing is firing/layoffs for probably 5% of the non hospital people (5% of the salaries, really) and taking that money and using it to up the pay of the people on strike.

It's not a bad idea, but it's just hard to imagine the university actually doing it 

I mean Elon musk just cut 50% of Twitter and that seems to be still functioning. So maybe the UC could do something similar.
So how is being able to get a PhD not a privilege? Who gets to go to school that long and not have to save money in order to do it? Doesn't getting a PhD generally increase your earning potential? I am not saying that I don't value education and in fact, I value education for the sake of it, but I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system. Which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing but perhaps someone should say that instead of saying they are rent-deprived.
Sooo, what I am hearing from you is that these employers (advisors, etc) are massively breaking the employment laws in California. It is interesting to me you would strike before reporting these horrendous breaches. Has that route ever been taken?
Will do. No one is suggesting 2-3 full time jobs, part-time jobs. Its sounding pretty privileged to me. I will keep asking and learning...
Nope. The most controversial is the defunding, deactivating of any police allowed on campus.
Wait, in what countries? Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc, and it's not like that up north...
So in some programs, the grant research directly tied to the dissertation, but sometimes the paid research might be different from the research for dissertation. Since 12 credit hours of research for a degree is separate from the 20 paid hours. 

Yes I support the strike and the initiatives being bargained for! I am not trying to undermine it with this. I just think the big picture of grad students as students instead of workers needs to shift at the university level across academia in general and thats a much bigger task.
>From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition.

Honestly, I'm really skeptical of this argument.  Competitive industries do not have labor strikes -- pay disputes are resolved by workers switching companies and not accepting offers at underpaying ones.   I'm guessing UC does not actually see that effect or they would have already been incentivized to act.

>From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge.

I think this is a more relevant argument to my question. It does seem to be a systemic problem though (UC if anything is put at a competitive disadvantage paying so much above market); I guess you need to start somewhere though. GL.
We are also advocating for 20 hour GSIs to be compensated at 54k yearly as well.
Ah, I missed the 'u'. Personally, I've always felt that it doesn't make sense to have undergrads receive the TA stipends with fee coverage, but I guess the department does need TAs. It does seem like a bit of a disservice to the other undergrads, though...

But yea, $66/hr plus fee waiver is kind of nonsensical for undergrads.
Sure it‚Äôs a privilege. For me personally, I didn‚Äôt feel like I could do it until I worked for a few years after undergrad and had some savings to fall back on because the pay is so low. It really depends on the field and career track as to whether it increases earning potential. For me, I‚Äôll make the same or slightly more (will take a long time to make up for these years if ever), but I hope it‚Äôll bring me a livable wage doing something more intellectually challenging than my previous track. Those who end up as adjuncts within academia, a path academia created for PhDs, may be on a worse salary trajectory than without a PhD. 

However, the UC has a stated goal of promoting diversity and inclusion within higher education. Right now, the pay is a huge barrier to that goal. Lower income students are less likely to get there in the first place, and they‚Äôre also much more likely to drop out due to financial hardship bc their stipend doesn‚Äôt cover the cost of living. After you graduate you‚Äôre encouraged to then go make low pay/minimal benefits for additional years as a postdoc in the hopes of landing one of the few coveted tenure track roles. Anecdotally, it‚Äôs obvious to me that a lot of students in my program get frequent/monthly parental support to supplement their income, which means their families are in a relatively comfortable situation. If the UC is serious about bringing a broader range of people into academia, pay needs to be higher. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just talk and academia will continue to be a place dominated by people with wealthy and/or professor parents.
>I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system.

They ARE trying to change the system, they see the current system as exploitative and unfair, and there are merits to that argument (see OPs post).  It varies department by department,  research lab by research lab, and class by class on whether it actually is exploitative, and if so, how much.

Some grad students have to be a GSI most every semester because they don't have any GSR funding, yet are still expected to do research.  If the research is advancing the status of their lab and furthering efforts of research grants (rather than themselves), that strikes me as quite exploitative.  If they are doing independent research on an esoteric topic that no one is willing to fund, the question is why should that be supported by taxpayers or tuition or.... ?  (Where else is the money coming from?)

Grad students who are primarily paid as GSRs, and whose GRS appointments from their PI's grants/funding are bumped to 100% in the summer months (this is allowed and happens in some engineering departments), and who have reasonable career paths in and outside of academia after graduation... These people probably deserve a raise too (hello inflation!), but they don't seem exploited.  There is zero recognition by the union that there IS training going on beyond just first year classes.  Grad students are generally much much less productive researchers than post-docs.

GSI's who are working more than 20 hours a week average on instruction tasks should immediately raise this to the instructor and more staff should be hired - this is not OK and is exploitative.  Extreme expectations on research time for GSRs is also not OK.

The demand for fully subsidized childcare really gets to me, even though I generally support subsidized childcare.  There are programs for low income people to get childcare grants and these should be expanded / easier to access / less waiting.  But there is no special reason a grad student (who could be married to a high paid tech worker) deserves free childcare more than a retail employee, and no reason UC should be responsible for implementing this huge social benefit (that democrats tried and failed to pass).

A sizable wage increase and some other things, I support 100%.  Not to ""both sides..."" this, but.... there is a side to it beyond the reddit narrative.  
(edit, typo)
You'd think so, but nope! The UC has explicit exemption from many of the employment laws that apply to all other employers. Neat, huh?
Graduate student positions are created as half-time appointments to enable students to spend the other 50% of their time on independent research. To encourage this, many graduate students are contractually prohibited from taking a second job  during the 20 hours/wk that we not compensated for. We are stuck in a position where we are only compensated half time, but not allowed to seek outside employment. This is what is causing a lot of the disconnect between public-facing UC messaging and graduate student demands. There is no way they will give us full-time appointments, so we have to push for higher compensation for what is on paper a half-time appointment but is in reality an all-consuming job.
The 50% threshold is actually because it‚Äôs a requirement for international students to be on student visas, not because PhD students are expected to work only those hours
>Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc,

Where are you getting this?
Most PhD programs in Europe pay very well with less teaching load, actually.
Interesting! Hmm, yeah if someone is getting funded by a grant from the government or however that works, it does seem complicated if all of the sudden they are twice as expensive.
If you are skeptical, go around a group of grad students and ask them where they had offers from and why they chose Berkeley.   


Competitive industries most certainly have strikes, but even if you assume that they don't, there are several reasons why grad school acceptance is not a perfectly competitive market, most importantly the fact that it is something that you can only choose once and switching costs are incredibly high. Your argument is basically ""I won't take a 100 dollar bill from the floor, since if it was real, someone else would already have taken it"".   


UC did not see the effect because grad students just accepted it quietly. Several departments pay an extra stipend to try to compete with other schools, but since the majority of pay comes from GSI/GSR appointments it was not enough.
Apparently few other ppl in the comments and them are referring to this post, and it's literally 66/hr vs half the amount for GSI instead of same pay.

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/
This is THE best post on this I've seen. Thank you. Helps so much!  And for the record, I did state that changing the system is not necessarily a bad thing but I was just looking for someone to say that instead of complaining that people can't pay their rent. Thank you again.
I'd heard the Regents are an entity unto themselves and somehow incredibly powerful. Maybe this strike should be the beginning a tearing that corruption down.
Exactly! It‚Äôs complex accounting. In stem especially we are often paid out of fellowships or grants, with GSI positions filling in gaps where needed. These grants are often funded by government, and the university takes a cut of the grant for admin costs while another portion goes to the student and student‚Äôs fees. As a result the university doesn‚Äôt pay much for GSRs at all but reaps the benefits of the work being done. So when it‚Äôs sold to us as educational experience and a degree, instead of a paid job, it‚Äôs a little bs. I imagine there are logistics that would go into how grants would have to be allocated to cover these costs without just having to ask for more money in grants, if the university continues to take a large percentage of them, but that is research I‚Äôll get into another day.

The GSI budget comes from the university/dept and so that is a whole issue that I rely on the union for because I have less experience on that front."

Going to his CS286B office hours to bug him about expanding enrollment sounds like a great way to REALLY piss him off. So does spamming him via email.

Look at the waitlist. Clearly there is a ton of demand. He knows that. Everyone knows it.

Demand is not the only or even main factor here. Room space and TA resources play a huge role.

While the move to 13.5 units in phase 1 adds to that stress in unfortunate ways, I'd encourage people to not make any rash decisions.  It is likely the department will also find additional capacity for some of the upper div classes. (No, I don't know when.)

In my view, the admins have somewhat underestimated the sheer interest that this field has attracted over the last couple years. I think ML/Stats classes have the highest interest/demand (for the better or worse) and much more resources needs to be allocated there. With prof. Sahai telling students to take EECS 126/127 before 189, we need to make sure to increase the capacity of 126 and 127 to at least 200 and above. However, there is perhaps a reason why they are limiting the enrollment: 126 and 127 enrollment usually drops like a rock once some students realize that they cannot keep up with the level of rigor in these classes. So to those people interested in 126/127 who can't even get on the waitlist, stay hopeful. Somehow it ends up working out every semester. It's quite a mess but it ends up working out.

This semester it may not be an issue, but if the tech industry continues to grow like it is doing today, UC Berkeley needs to find a way to address the exponential growth in demand for eecs. The eecs department, and UC Berkeley for that manner, cannot remain a top notch university if it cannot meet the demands of its students. I think we call all agree on this point?

I'd like to draw a connection to elementary/middle/high schools in my neighborhood: some of them are known to be ""good schools"" because of high test scores or whatnot. So does that mean they are better at teaching? Are the teachers better there?

When you have a bunch of top people in a school, naturally it's better. Naturally, great achievements happen at that school. Naturally, more people want to apply because they hear about the school's achievements. Naturally, more professors want to apply. Naturally, the school only lets the top professors in.

Naturally, this more established university has a lower admittance rate than newer universities.

So Cal and many of the Ivy Leagues and UCLA, Stanford, and CalTech are also said to have good CS programs -- and they all have low admission rates.

Not all rankings are meaningless, and even the most questionable ranking system probably has some truth in it. Its not logical to just dismiss these rankings because its unclear exactly how they measure a school's quality. I'm also curious why you think these notions are ""baseless"" and ""evidence-less.""

These rankings are for the school as a whole. I wouldn't trust them to tell me anything about the quality of my education.

> So if I got into the #1 university I'll get a better CS education than if I had gone to #5 or #7 on the list? Really? I don't buy it. That's why I believe their rankings can be dismissed. Now of course, you wouldn't go to some random college that opened up a year ago and expect them to have their CS program be as well run as in schools that have been in the business for like 40+ years. But randomly pick any school that you hear people talk about and it will be a fine school, if you personally like it.

As long as you like the school, you can't go wrong by going to get a CS degree at, for example, UCSD instead of Stanford or CalTech or Berkeley. At the end of the day it comes down to what you do with the educational opportunities that are given to you.

Furthermore, there are even even schools that you know of that suck in some of the metrics and they are still considered a  top school. Like Cal has bad CS class sizes and yet, we're fine here because we make it work. And guess what, it's still a top school in their rankings. 
> 
> Here's another way to see it. I think it's a bit like picking a country to live in (assuming you know the language and culture of any country you choose). Is living in the US better or worse than living in Canada or the UK? Is living in France better or worse than living in Switzerland? I mean, clearly living in the US is better than living in some poor country in the middle of a war, but if someone came out with rankings about which countries are the best to live in, would you believe their rankings? I wouldn't. If they tell me italy is two places ahead of germany or that Japan is 5 places worse than Australia I wouldn't believe them because they don't know enough. They can quantify rankings based on their own preferences but they can't tell me where is the best place for me to live . They're all good enough countries! The best country for me to live in depends on my own preferences. And on top of that, it really depends where I live in said country, and how I live, and so many other factors.

> OP, I think you are trying to extract too much from these rankings. I completely agree with you that comparing schools based on single-digit ranking difference is a subjective matter, and people should perform their own research to figure out what they want from a school. However, the fact that no ranking system can these subjective opinions is not be a reason to disregard the rankings completely. They do their best to capture the differences between schools.

A student replied:

> There is some good discussion going on here, especially with regards to how much we should regard rankings. I think a high ranking (in a particular subject) is more indicative of the faculty quality. Indirectly, this attracts top students, and hence, after years of this process, sometimes some people want to go to a particular school because of who they might be surrounded by (this includes other students, not just instructors). Along the lines, this gets blurred as an outright reason to attend the school, when it probably shouldn't; because, as stated above, going to a higher ranking school does not therefore mean you are learning CS ""better"". Being in a better ""environment"" however, thats kind of subjective, and entirely is based on what someone deems ""better"".
> 
> I picked Cal EECS over schools some people may not have (a couple ivies included; not bragging just making a point). Whereas someone else might have gone to the highest possible ranked undergraduate university they were accepted to. Are my reasons better? I don't know, I don't think so. So to the OP's point about what makes a school better, I think these things are indeed subjective and it may not be possible to extract a host of useful information. Not because they are doing an inadequate job at making the rankings, rather, some people just care about different things when it comes to picking a school. The rankings may ""try"" to capture that, but as most people may agree, its still incomplete.

I suppose I take issue with the fact that yes, the rankings are opinions that could be plain wrong and yet, I think, ever since they've started coming out annually, it's been an obsessive race to get into the top universities. People take them to heart too seriously. So in a sense, the fact that people take them so seriously, makes me want to hold them up to a high standard. But, at the end of the day, they are indeed just opinions of some people working at a news outlet. They never promised to be accurate. I should chill.
> 
> 2. There are over 2000 accredited universities in the U.S. so 27th position isn't bad at all. Though idk which rankings you're looking at because the us news one I'm looking at puts its at 30th. But w/e it's somewhere in the 20s-30s.
> 
> 3. You mentioned ""access to faculty"". How can such a thing be measured? It's so...unscientific, and that makes me highly skeptical of rankings. Also, I should have been more specific and should have said ""I wouldn't trust them to tell me anything about the quality of my education in my major"".
> 
> 4. UCSD is known (for some reason) to be a good CS school, but it's not known (for some reason) to be as good as Cal, MIT, Stanford so I used it as an example of a school that's not revered as the best out there but is still great (as far as its reputation goes).
> 
> 5. The schools that you hear commonly about (living in CA) aren't all ranked highest. UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara aren't regarded super highly in rankings but you hear about them a lot. I'm sure they have decent grad and retention rates. Nitpicking who has a few percent higher here or there doesn't matter. They're all great. Seriously, if your school makes it to the us news rankings, how worse can it possibly be compared to the top 30 in the rankings? Also, UT austin is 56 in the rankings and you see it as highly ranked--so yeah, whatever. the 56th position is also great. And so is 57th and 58th and so on. I really think if a school is known enough to be in the top 100 it's good. As long as enough people (students, faculty, and administrators) apply to be part of learning, teaching, and managing the school, it will be a good place b/c the school will be able to pick the best people out of those who apply. And the cycle of greatness kicks off from there.
> 
> 6. teacher-student ratio is actually one of the metrics they use to rate schools. What I'm saying is that we have a bad ratio in 61A and other classes and yet we're totally fine academically. And, we're still getting good rankings despite that. Personally, I don't care too much about teacher-student ratio because that's the average of the school and vary greatly between different classes.

Even more broadly, how do we know even MIT, Stanford, and Cal have good CS programs? What is it about them that make them good?


Well that got philosophical hella fast.
Research and innovation of the professors.

Has very little to do with the undergraduates or the education they receive.
