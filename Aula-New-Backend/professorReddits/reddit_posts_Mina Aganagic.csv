Mina Aganagic Office Hours (Math 1A prof)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cgwyj8/mina_aganagic_office_hours_math_1a_prof/,2024-04-30 09:22:34,"I'm trying to get credit by exam for math 1A and I have emailed Prof Aganagic twice without a response. Does anyone know when her office hours are this week, or how I could find that out? I know where her office (she seems to have 2?) is but I don't know if I could just knock at any time",
math 1a w/ mina aganagic,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10s0tz5/math_1a_w_mina_aganagic/,2023-02-02 13:04:08,"should i take math 1a with mina aganagic? Ive seen mixed reviews, and really confused!","If you have a background in at least derivatives, go for it. When I took the class, she asked us for our input on the grade bins. She was also a very accommodating and kind lecturer, even if sometimes her lectures could get confusing. I was fine because I had a little background in the content before, so you should be, too, if you have some background or watch youtube vids & show up to discussion regularly. Her exams were probably the most ""fair"" (based on HW) I've ever had here.
IMO she’s not a bad professor. I had her for 16A last year and while it took studying on my end to do it, the exams were OK and more similar to the textbook problems than what I’ve seen from other profs.
when did you take the class? was it when it was online over quarantine?
I took it during the pandemic when it was all online!"
Math w/Mina Aganagic,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xnwx6a/math_wmina_aganagic/,2022-09-25 12:41:51,"Hello! If you have taken a math course with this professor, what was her teaching style like/was it helpful? Were you able to perform well in class? Finals/Midterms/quizzes? I am inquiring about Math 1A specifically.","[Dr. Aganagic's RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=596854)

you have to remember that the students taking 16A are almost always going to be not-so-good-at-math students. So context as to the type of student is always going to matter.
Really? I have no idea why the reviews on RMP for Math1 are food for her and then the exact opposite for Math16"

Math54 and 1b concurrently?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cg6unx/math54_and_1b_concurrently/,2024-04-29 11:43:33,"Title\^ do you think it's possible. I'm intending math major, and I took 1a this spring with Mina Aganagic and am ending with a 95. Is this schedule doable with one other class for a french major/possible decals? ","It's usually recommended to complete 1A-1B before starting 54. This isn't just a UC Berkeley thing but universal across calculus education, as the material you learn in 1A-B is applied further in linear algebra and diff eq.
Both 1B and 54 end with differential equations.  Math 54 assumes that you already know the differential equations part of 1B.  It would be hard to do them simultaneously.
Don’t
If ur data science take 56 u can do it concurrently and 56 includes no diff eq"

Physics 7C Final Prep,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rb95za/physics_7c_final_prep/,2021-12-07 12:50:59,"I'm taking Physics 7C with Professor Mina Aganagic right now, and I want to use finals from previous semesters to prepare for the final. However, on Tau Beta Pi, the most recent finals with solutions are from 2005, and the professor has not given out any kind of study material....is there anywhere else I can look for more recent finals?",
Math 1A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f96tav/math_1a/,2020-02-24 23:45:18,Is it just me or is Mina Aganagic a pretty bad lecturer? I have a hard time following with what she’s saying. I’ve been learning most of the material through discussion. But when I ask people they say she’s one of the best lectures they’ve ever had!!,"same lol, i had to read the textbook to understand the concepts better. tbh i think its just a difference in the way we think/learn.
A lot of people don’t seem to understand/like her lecturing style, you’re certainly not alone. Personally I find it easy to follow, but that may be partially due to the fact that I took calc in high school so some things are review for me."
