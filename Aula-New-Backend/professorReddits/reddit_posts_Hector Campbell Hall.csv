Campbell Hall is off to a great start,http://i.imgur.com/0bn56ge.jpg,2014-10-25 14:12:48,,"There's a story behind this:

At first, there was no room in Campbell allocated for all the books in the graduate student lounge over in Hearst Field Annex. Instead, they were going to be scattered across several shelves around the building.  Fortunately, however, during a tour, the grad student in charge of all the books noticed this empty room labelled as a lab and plead for the space, using the argument of how natural it would be to extend it to a ""LABrary.""  Apparently, it worked.

Was it actually a librarian or was it a graduate student? I'm honestly curious (student workers in a library are 99.99% of the time NOT librarians).

Edit: I ask because the email screenshot referred to librarians but you referred to students.
I don't believe you.
The grad student is the librarian.
Proof:

I'm not sure how I could convince you, but I just paraphrased an email that was sent around last week explaining the name.
I'm still curious (not everyone uses ""Librarian"" the same way).... I'm guessing you know them personally since they emailed you, but...  do you know if they have the masters in library & information science? Do you know what their job title is? I know this is starting to sound off-topic, but humor me.
[deleted]
Sorry, I don't actually know the person...the email was sent out to everyone on the department.  I'm pretty sure the second ""librarian"" doesn't have a masters in library & information science, but the main ""librarian"" could certainly have one, for all I know.
Looks like they delivered (see above)."

Cheap bastards can be choosers now too eh?
What were they giving out?
line is ridiculous....
BRING A WHEELBARROW
NOT worth the wait. I was in line from 11AM all the way until the event closed at around 2:30PM. They only allowed 10 people in at once, and there was no time limit as to how long they could stay. The organization was terrible and no one in line could hear what was being announced. A lot of people wasted 3 hrs just waiting there. Also, a lot of frats and stuff came and took all the chairs/tables/sofas and stuff, so the only things that are left are small office supplies.

*Do you believe sand shouldn't be forced to think?*

*Do you view computing as a cruel act, forcing machines into being, condemning them to an existence of mathematical labor and servitude?*

You are not alone.

At Bears Against Computer Programming (BACP, pronounced ""backup""), we firmly believe that computers shouldn't be programmed.

Original meme created by Twitter user @buttpraxis, used with permission.
It's better for the computers if we let them be dumb. No complicated programs. They are just like us, the more they know the more miserable they are. It's one thing to make them think simple, happy thoughts. But we are doing too much these days. It's just cruel.
We should also stop medicine. Only the strong shall survive.

While we’re at it, let’s rip out all toilets on the UC Berkeley campus and just poop and pee and spread period blood on the soil to nurture a more environmentally friendly culture. Students against indoor plumbing, we’ll call it. :o
Brain gap
I support this, actually.  CS has led to more income inequality and exploitation of people's privacy than ever before in history.  Outside of open-source free software, home theater applications and offline traditional store bought applications such as video games for offline consoles nothing really good has come from tech, at all, and one can argue even offline video games are bad.  People persist in using tech because it was designed with the help of psychologists to be addictive.  So, companies keep their profits rolling in indefinitely and the whole tech industry itself is almost like big tobacco.  I'm actually not joking too, even though this movement I think is actually not literally about not programming computers.
lol good one

solid satire

if you're not joking, fuck you
so, given you're comment about sand, it sounds like your beef may be less with programming than with computer hardware manufacturing.

are you cool with sand having the capability to ""think"", by taking the form of a computer, so long as it never exercises that capacity by running software when given an electrical signal?

Obviously this whole thing is a ruse, a la ""birds aren't real"", but I had to get this concern off my chest.

best of luck in your sand worshiping venture.
These kinds of memes got Trump elected in 2016. Be careful with stupid jokes around stupid people.

Philos 3 is easy as hell and the material is actually interesting
I studied abroad in India and took a semester-long yoga class that counted toward my Philosophy requirement. lol. I recall it was up to my department to approve it.
stay away from the logic courses like phil12A.  it's anything but introductory.  even my GSI said there's nothing introductory about it.  25A is the most fun and interesting imo. 25B is just an extension of it, but starts getting into dense, difficult-to-read material like hume, kant, and spinoza.  philosophy is a surprisingly difficult major.
For me, it was Philosophy 2.  I was already familiar with all of the material.
25A is probably your best bet. Big survey course of ancient philosophy, you'll probably be most familiar with those authors, and you get some interesting history as well.

As with most philosophy courses, you kinda need to do the reading to do well. Philosophy is not as cup-cake of a major as other humanities degrees.
2-4. 12A can be a struggle for some; 25A and B are more specialized. 132 is just straight up hard.
Took 12A right after the first COVID wave. If symbolic logic is your cup of tea, you’ll be fine. If you’re like the rest of us, get ready for the sleepless nights!
It’s always the undergrad prerequisite courses.
3 was easy and I’m a CogSci major so I loved the content
I took Philos 2 with Johann Frick. It was extremely easy.

Edit: looks like he's teaching it again this fall & there's still plenty of open seats! he's a great professor and amazing at summarizing the readings so you could skip or skim them and still do well
12A
Feel free to DM me if you wanna learn about 25A
Philos 3 was very easy and very interesting
Philosophy major here. PHILOS 2/3/4 would be pretty easy. 25A and B are a wild card sometimes.
the only one of these that even resembles anything about math is 12A. 2 is probably the easiest here i know anything about but 25A and 25B are great classes taught at the introductory level as well.
not 25a
i’ve only taken 12a — really enjoyed it, but it might not be your cup of tea (gave me math + english = logic vibes, if that makes sense & our professor was not the best at making it approachable for an intro level class)
I took PS112A (Political Theory) under prof Dan Lee in the summer of 2019. Absolutely blew my 39 y/o mind at the time. Material was profound yet very accessible. Still count myself as a Euthyphro bro.
seconded i took it with John Campbell and it was the chillest class to date at cal
unsurprisingly, it takes a real interest in the subject to do well in my opinion.
does it have a sit down final exam?
the fitch style proofs were insane.  it's essentially CS problem solving.
That one was a b\*tch even though the professor summarized it in his introductory lecture as ""baby logic.""
12A humbled me more than i thought possible
Isn't 12A logic? That's basically math - the entire class is proofs.
Campbell is an adorable man
It did when I took it, but the questions for all of the exams were obvious (I attended 95% of the lectures and discussions).  You'll have a different professor than I did, so things might be different.
I also took Philos 2 with no background in philosophy. I thought it was very interesting, there was no math. Final exam format depends on the professor.
I have absolutely no background in philosophy, would I be okay taking this course? And how much math is involved?
There was very little (if any) math.  

If you're \*interested\* in philosophy you might be able to do well in the course.  

I'm probably the wrong person to ask, because I was familiar with all of it before I took the class.
It’s an ethics course, there is zero math involved usually. If it doesn’t have “logic” or “philosophy of math” in the name, there is usually not any math in philosophy. They usually hand it off to a grad student, the material is usually just an intro to the most common schools of thought in ethics plus whatever that particular grad student feels like tossing in there. It’s an intro course, quite literally meant for people with no background in philosophy. You’ll read a bunch of papers, write some essays, have some class discussions. The final will likely either be a final paper or a written final with short answers (or some combination of both)."

Update: reviewing all the crispest water on campus,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/utao28/update_reviewing_all_the_crispest_water_on_campus/,2022-05-19 12:06:45,"I will never let anything die! I am writing this as evidence of a realized hobby. Godspeed to anyone who reads any sentence of this.

[here is the last post for context (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2csl0/crispest_water_on_campus/)

Armed with the curated list of the recommendations of the last post, i put on my urban hiking (aka gentrified walking) playlist and I tried the crispest fountains of youth this campus cradles.

Methodology:

I condensed the list to only include potable water sources. I didn't try blackwell, because I don't know anyone who lives there and i am not trying to trespass. Further, I excluded the recommendation of the gym fountain, because I have an intensity about me that I fear would turn me into a gym bro if I set foot in a gym. I do not wish this fate upon myself so I am guarding my feeble sanctity by not crossing the gym line. Next, I opted for a non insulated metal water bottle so that leftover chill from previous water fountains could not influence the taste of the next water fountain in the case fountains were tried consecutively.

At this point we reach a Shakespearean impasse: to spit or to swallow, that is the question. Whether ‘tis nobler to only taste the water fountain or to become bloated from all the water I consume in one day trying to hit up all the fountains. Normally when faced with this impasse, I gargle. You would be surprised how little liquid it takes to gargle. However, for the sake of science I chose to swallow all of the water I tasted.

Importantly, fountains were tried on different days. Peer reviewers have pointed out this weakness in the methodology. However, a good fountain will consistently spit good crisp fluids into the crevices of a bottle even if there was no other water bottle filling action before the current fill, so the day of fill should not impact the crispness of water.

Scoring: **Anxiety (A)** was scored out of 2 (0 being please let the hot light of god shine upon me so that I may evaporate from this dreadful world and 2 being luxuriating in comfort). Anxiety noted the fearsome echo of the water bottle fill in comparison to a quite yet populated environment, general amount of people around (I don’t like having more than one person looking at me at any given moment), and if any worrisome leaks surrounded the fountain.

**Beauty (B)** was scored out of 3. Beauty includes any general aesthetics surrounding the fountain experience.

**Crispness (C)** was the main scoring factor which is only fair given the list’s method of curation. As is such, crispness was scored out of 10. Crispness includes freshness of taste and bone chilling temperatures. I wanted the water to transport me to Antarctica so vividly that I could remember if Antarctica was at the bottom or top of the globe.

14. The opulent vlsb fountain: 4 = A: 1, B: 3, C: 0

I could make tea with this tepid water.

13. 4th floor of etch to the right when exiting the main elevator: 5 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 2

The only thing i can say is that thankfully with time this water will end up in the toilet where it belongs. Disliked! Blocked!

12. Cory hall fountain near supernode: 7 = A:-1, B: 4, C: 4

Fear of eecs peoples societal superiority over a shivering social science girlie factored into anxiety. However, I confuse fear and admiration, so my type is eecs boys. The raw Chad eecs energy that made me scared of being hurt boosted the beauty ranking. These two biases balance out each other as a net neutral in the score. Controversially, I believe the water itself is actually overhyped.

11. first floor physics north and 3rd floor at the end of the hall: 7 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 4

You could go through the trouble of measuring the temperature of this water in kelvin only to find it is room temperature

10. asuc near amazon storefront: 7.1 = A: 1.8, B: 1, C: 4.3

i had to deduct from the anxiety ranking since my shoes for crews non-slip new balances sounded like spongebob squeaky boots walking to the fountain. Though, it sure was water.

9. 3rd floor of doe library by art history/classics: 7.3 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 2.3

With the amount of noise this fountain was making i expected water so cold even sigma freud would have penis envy of this spout. Yet i received nothing of the sort.

8. Gianni hall: 8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 4

hell is colder than this water

7. kroeber hall fountain, first floor: 8 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 3

people who use sensodyne toothpaste will enjoy the water of this fountain. I don’t and did not enjoy this fountain. Though, I enjoyed the house posts.

6. Evans ground floor: 10 = A: 0, B: 0, C: 10

Lovely as always, despite being in a building so bad even the university wants to tear it down.

5. campbell hall 1st and 5th floor: 12.2 = A: 1, B: 2, C: 9.2

The fifth floor is marginally better than the first floor. The fifth floor is so fresh that I felt like an Alaskan salmon swimming upstream against all the tasks i should be doing. Unfortunately, the salmon imagery for which this water transported me made me afraid as we live on a campus full of bears. Bears fish salmon. For this reason, this is an anxiety inducing fountain

4. stanley hall / the bottle filler next to yali’s qualcam cafe: 12.8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 8.8

I shivered.

3. Haas faculty: 13 = A: 2, B: 1, C:10

The sheer crispness of the water animorphed me into a polar bear. For this reason, I recommend this fountain for furries

2. mcCone hall, 5th floor west side: 14 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 9

right by a very beautiful patio view. I saw a berkeley squirrel (from afar) which coincidentally is the largest mammal i think i could confidently vanquish with my bare hands in a fight (now give me a sturdy stick and i could take on all the tigers at the Oakland zoo at once).

1. Morrison music hall: 15 = A: 2, B: 3, C:10

The parade people who have drank from this fountain have worn a pale yellow oval into the tiles just in front of it. You can imagine them standing in the center of the worn out tile oval filling up their water bottle; and you can imagine all the people to come doing the same, making the oval a little paler. You can do all this imaging while you know that in the present you are filling up your bottle standing in that same oval. That worn out tile was the first time that I saw like the tralfamadorians. And so I thought, maybe I should read Slaughterhouse-Five again. That or maybe i should just touch grass and let this stupid hobby of reviewing waterfountains die. So it goes.

Update of the update: they moved the elkay from the left to the right fountain in morrison hall. Therefore morrison hall water is no longer fire. This list remains in place but be cautioned that fountains may have changed.","I didn’t know r/Berkeley had off-season shit posting. A+ post

I’m so proud of McCone. The only thing they have going for them. Such a shitty building.
All the tigers in Oakland zoo passed away tho 😔
I would like to mention that the Etch water fountain just just had its filter replaced since my original recommendation. However I’m shocked it is so low. I’m going to have to see if these other fountains really are superior.
impressive. very nice.

Who would like to join me in hitting all these fine drinking locations in order?
not on campus but my fave water fountain was u1 slottman, that shit was so crisp
Certified water deity 💦💧🧚🏻
haha you should do it on a map
Water, water, every where,  
Any every drop to drink.
I guess I missed the call for suggestions. Sad to see my favorite, 5th floor Cory southwest, go underappreciated.
This is the beauty of pure science without capitalist interference. Well done.
Hesse hall has two water fountains that have quite crisp water, both on the lower floor. One next to the shop (adjacent to the ice machine?), and one close to the southward lower floor entrance that is close to a south-pointing McCone entrance (and the spiral stairwell that takes one towards Sutardja Dai), with a sabertooth tiger statue in the quad. The aesthetics may be lacking given the interior is quite drab, but I think for the crispness alone it is quite well worth it.
Im glad to see my recommendation for the Morrison Hall water fountain in the original post received a perfect score. I recommend any nomadic traveler passing through south west side of campus to seek it out as it hits just as hard as the water in the dune series must hit on Arakkis, just make sure to wait a few seconds holding the button as it reaches optimal chill
To the credit of physics north, its water flow is unsurpassed

P.S. I'm in your debt for this research. You've given me the hope and means for achieving my twin dreams of stalking squirrels and contributing to the generational wearing of tiles.
ya been to the McCone hall ground floor (north of the library) water fountains? The lower one has a crispness rating so low that it's good again.

like it's THAT warm!!!
Im not about to gatekeep the michelin travel guide of berkeley fountains until the season returns
Be careful. If they try to chase you away at Haas just puff yourself up and start yelling things like ""Corporate Synergy! Amplify deliverables to the consumer base! Disruption!""
I like me to
I never leave monkey business unfinished
Lol sure. Im always down to meet other berkeley students. You can message me haha
I am nothing but overly earnest always
My list represents both my own opinion and objective truth. Unfortunately, i didnt think to take photos when i tried the fountains.

Its just not an economical major to choose. You could always just minor in it
Yes sir
That’s an underestimation. There are a lot of jobs within the field. Nasa and SpaceX are full of astro majors. In addition, you can work as a physicist in labs, such as the Livermore lab. There are a lot of jobs in sustainability for us as well.
The jobs exist but they could also be filled by aerospace engineers, physics majors that minored in astro and have other specializations, or computer scientists. 

The physics community as a whole struggles relative to other majors to get good paying jobs - just check the career outcomes published by APS for BA/BS grads."
Python DeCal Course,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wuffon/python_decal_course/,2022-08-21 17:52:16,"Hello! My team and I are offering a 2-unit DeCal, Introduction to Python brought to you by Astronomers! 

The class meets WF 12-1pm in 131 Campbell Hall

This course provides an introduction to the Python programming language with a focus on data analysis and research in astronomy, physics, and other sciences. The primary audience for this course is those who have no prior experience with programming and are intended/declared astrophysics/physics majors, but if you still want a low stress introduction to python relative to other courses and you don't fit the primary audience description we would still love to teach you! Note that if you are already well versed in software development, this may not be the class for you. We estimate the weekly workload to be 3-6 hours. This course can be challenging but well worth it!

To sign-up for this DeCal, please fill out the enrollment form on the website: pythondecal.github.io. Some questions are there to gauge where you are at in your math and programming experience, but they will not be used to bar anyone from signing up for the course.

If you have any questions, feel free to comment or pm me!

Edit: We will send out enrollment codes before the first lecture which is this Friday! After that, we will send codes out as students sign up for the course.","Thank you.
How much math do we need to know?
Thanks for posting this! Does this mean the class is meeting this Wednesday?
I have taken 61AB and I'm interested in learning more about programming in scientific research. Would I be able to take this course?
dang i can only go on fridays rip
I filled out the form a few days ago but haven’t received an email with the code yet, does that mean I wasn’t accepted? Or should I attend the meeting this upcoming Friday as you mentioned in another comment?
hey, is it still too late to sign up? i just got dropped from a class so now i have space for this but i missed the first lecture on friday :/
I'm a mech E major, can I join?
I would say having taken 1a/1b or equivalent would be fine since we go over integration and differentiation!
We're gonna meet on Friday 8/26 to give students more time to sign up!
Yes! We accept students of all backgrounds but it will definitely be an easier class for you
That would be fine as long as you supplement by watching recordings from previous semesters!
We will send out enrollment codes later today and as students sign up so come on Friday! Also there is no acceptance; all students that sign up will be able to take the class
You can still sign up for the class! Just fill out the form, attend lecture, and we'll send you a code sometime this week! The first lecture was just introductions, what the decal is about, and installing programs
Yes! The DeCal is open to all majors :)
Should I still apply if Ive done those classes but dont remember much lol..
Awesome, thank you! Excited for this class!
thanks! just filled out the form :D
When I try to join it tells me I need a permission number. Where can I find that? If i don't put in the permission number it just stops me from enrolling
Yes! It's just one lecture that we go over it and you can always ask for help during office hours
That's great! Excited to see u at lecture :)
After you fill out the form on the website, we will send you an enrollment code which you can input into CalCentral when u enroll
I filled out the form a few hours ago. Usually how long does it take to get the code?
You should expect to get a code in the next couple of days!
Ah okay, thank you!"

Best places to stargaze in Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f3514b/best_places_to_stargaze_in_berkeley/,2020-02-12 21:24:19,"Tryna plan a cute Valentine’s Day :D

Thanks!","It's hard to see stars out in the bay because of the light pollution, but Grizzly Peak may be a good spot to check out.  It's up in the hills and should give a good view
Not in Berkeley, but if you don't mind taking an uber up to Oakland hills, then the Chabot Space and Science Center is a great option. They do free viewings on Fridays and Saturdays, and the location is just amazing.
Indian Rock Park
The parking lot at the Lawrence Lab up on the hill has a great view out onto the Bay, though it's heavily dependent on the weather. May also be a busy area on the most romantic day of the year..."

Python DeCal Spring 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10aed7j/python_decal_spring_2023/,2023-01-12 15:27:48,"Hello! My team and I are, once again, offering a 2-unit DeCal, Introduction to Python brought to you by Astronomers! 

The class meets MF 4-5pm in 131 Campbell Hall

This course provides an introduction to the Python programming language with a focus on data analysis and research in astronomy, physics, and other sciences. The primary audience for this course is those who have no prior experience with programming and are intended/declared astrophysics/physics majors, but if you still want a low stress introduction to Python relative to other courses and you don't fit the primary audience description we would still love to teach you! Note that if you are already well versed in software development, this may not be the class for you. We estimate the weekly workload to be 3-6 hours. This course can be challenging but well worth it!

We have no official pre-reqs for the course but it is recommended that you have taken (or are concurrently taking) Physics 7A and Math 1B.

To sign-up for this DeCal, please fill out the enrollment form on the website: [pythondecal.github.io](http://pythondecal.github.io). Some questions are there to gauge where you are at in your math and programming experience, but they will not be used to bar anyone from signing up for the course.

We will send out enrollment codes before the first lecture which is Friday January 20! After that, we will send codes out as students sign up for the course.

If you have any questions, feel free to comment or pm me!","Can vouch as solid class. Took it last semester.
I'm glad you enjoyed it!"
Rooms on campus with projector/tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3ma5zd/rooms_on_campus_with_projectortv/,2015-09-24 19:13:54,"Does anyone know of rooms on campus, accessible at night and not being used, with projection equipment or even better a tv? The lounge in the top floor of Campbell hall is great, but you need keycard access I think, but something like that.","Room 305 in Wheeler Hall. 
If you're part of the EECS master race you can access Etcheverry hall from the 2nd floor of Soda, and then make your way back up to the 3rd floor. Those rooms are rarely used at night and have pretty big projector screens, I used them regularly for movie nights and viewing parties."
"Free Astronomy Lecture / Star-gazing (Thursday, July 7)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4rlcvx/free_astronomy_lecture_stargazing_thursday_july_7/,2016-07-06 16:14:05,"Hey folks, I just wanted to announce that the UC Berkeley Astronomy Department is hosting a free public lecture on campus for our monthly Astronomy Night tomorrow (Thursday, July 7).

We'll have an hour-long talk on the formation of galaxies like the Milky Way (8-9pm) followed by star-gazing using our 17"" rooftop telescope. Both parts of the event will happen at Campbell Hall, the astronomy building near the Campanile and the Hearst Mining Circle.

You can find more information and RSVP via the Facebook event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1662644574060903/

There's also more information at our department website: http://astro.berkeley.edu/event/2016-05-05/astro-night-july","[deleted]
If you come to peoples park my best bud harry will give you a free star gaze lecture for 5 bucks. He knows all about the big dipper and the little dipper too. I used to go to this church that told us the stars were pinholes in the sky that exposed heaven. it would suck if you went to heaven and fell through one of those holes back to earth.
You're right, and I'm sorry about that. We have another talk scheduled for next month, and you can see the full schedule on the website: http://astro.berkeley.edu/i/astro-night
But...if Harry gives free star gaze lectures why is it 5 bucks...? 
I assume that you first give him the five bucks, then you get a free lecture. Honestly if our astronomy department was more financially savvy we'd probably adopt this model as well, but I'm afraid we're currently going with the old-fashioned ""actually free"" approach."

There’s a nice courtyard in Dwinelle if you enter from the VLSB side.
Go on a hike (Big C, Fire Trails)
berkeley public library upper floors. also there are a lot of paths that go thru the berkeley hills that are great for walking and finding a nice secluded view
reserve a study room in main stacks
Since you're in the dorms, a lot of the Units have those small study rooms in the central/basement area that you can go work in or just get some alone time. Long walks on Northside, like near the Rose Garden and even further sometimes, always helped me clear my mind and get away from people, especially in the evenings when it gets pretty empty. Dwinelle also has something like five tiny libraries spread throughout the building. Maybe shouldn't be giving this one away but I liked going to the Scandinavian Library in particular. It had irregular hours and I'm not sure what they are these days but practically no one was ever in there.
Feel that. First day on campus this semester, and I felt like my battery dropped from 100% to 10% within like one hour.
Bottom floor of music library is super chill, or like all of north side campus near barker hall is like really pretty and vacant usually
Go by the log cabin area near women's faculty club to relax
I have a few places that I go to : ishi court, Morrison library (honestly surprised that a lot of people don’t go here or don’t know where it is), 4th floor Campbell hall (a lot of rooms in Campbell hall are usually empty as well) , courtyard in Cory hall
You can ask your roommates for alone time! Sorry that things are overwhelming, i hope it gets better!
get on the bus 
go to orinda
I always used to hang by the creek there and recharge.  What a lovely place.
I walked by there, lost, on my first day and was like “Whoa. I cannot believe this school has a little forest!” I was in awe. Seems like a great place to have a little picnic.
My favorite also!
how do you do that?
Why orinda?
google “libcal berkeley”
Go west from Berkeley - hit water

Go North from Berkeley - hit Richmond

Go South from Berkeley - hit Oakland

Go East from Berkeley - hit NOTHING. If you are looking for solitude East towards Orinda is the way to go."
