Matthew Jurow Chem 3AL,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gvjcre/matthew_jurow_chem_3al/,2020-06-02 17:20:19,hello! so i was under the impression that peter marsden would be teaching 3AL over the summer but i think they changed professors to Matthew Jurow. Does anybody have any experience with this professor? Any tips?,"I just had him this past spring sem and his lectures are very dry but most of all the concepts youâ€™ll need for labs are covered in lecture. He leaves most of the grading and stuff up to the GSIs.
Yeah, it looks like they did. Would like to know as well.
He also reuses a lot of problems from previous exams on his final. Some word for word. 
His lectures are conceptual but dull in presentation. He didn't require attendance so watching online at a faster speed is better. I would say if you want the A, ask your GSI on how they want stuff done because most of your grade is dependent on them. Some are lenient and others are not.
I had him for both 3AL and 3BL. I was able to get an A both semesters. Lectures are a bit boring, but he always gets straight to the point. He tells you exactly what you need to know. Most of the grading is determined by your GSI. Just make sure your notebooks are detailed with observations and collaborate with others on the pre/post labs and you should be good to go. Jurow is an awesome guy and really cares about his students, so don't be afraid to reach out to him!
Same, just saw the email he sent out"
