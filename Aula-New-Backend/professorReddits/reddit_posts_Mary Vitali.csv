Math 53, Suncica Canic

Physics 5A, Andrew Charman

English R1B, Alba Tomasula y Garcia","Looks good to me, that's a very standard freshman/sophomore year schedule. Two classes for your major, one for school requirements, and one for fun (and maybe school requirements). 

And the best way to prepare is to just take your mind off of it and enjoy your break! If you haven't done any calc in a while you *could* do a bit of recap (look over a math 1A and 1B syllabus and make sure you're at least acquainted with everything) but really only do it if you're stressed. You'll be best served just resting up and establishing a good daily routine again
Your schedule looks good, but just a little heads up on 5A.

I took physics 5A first semester and my friends took Charman 5B and 89. Long story short, I highly recommend you review math 1B stuff and even get a little ahead on math 53 for 5A. Some topics from math 53 that show up early in 5A are vectors, some multiple integrals (gravitation), vector calculus (force along a path), and some basic partial derivatives. You don't HAVE to know these as they will be taught but it makes the physics easier if you already know the math.

5A was a pretty challenging class and Charman is notorious for being a tough professor to have because of general difficulty (exams and assignments) and course load. He has mixed reviews on Rate My Professor but his classes are generally considered difficult regardless. If my expectations hold, 5A with Charman will be quite tough. Best piece of advice, find a study group and go to OH/HW parties.
canic is great, shouldn't be too bad. Go to office hours!!!!
Language classes are hard. Even if the grade distribution is good, they can be more work than youâ€™re expecting. Meeting every day is a lot. Just keep that in mind."
