17 units okay for transfer?,https://i.redd.it/pybrfjf9g8cb1.jpg,2023-07-15 18:50:05,"Hello! I’m an incoming transfer student majoring in Anthro and interesting in minoring in Native American studies. I am wondering if taking three 4 unit anthro courses,1 NA studies course, and a 1 unit p/np course would be doable and not too difficult for my first semester. I would like to participate in research and join a club as well.

This is what my schedule currently looks like","Doable. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to explore the campus. Congratulations on getting to Berkeley and good luck!
Hey! I feel this is definitely doable! I have done a similar schedule while working a job and being involved with clubs. (If it does feel like too much for your first semester here, you can always adjust your schedule pretty easily - our anthro department is so sweet!)
 
Good luck!!
Very doable but I had the same unit count transferring in and dropped it to 13 (aka the recommended workload for new students) LOL just play it by ear
Looks fair to me but I’m planning on 20 units (art history/anthro double major)
Looks like you have plenty of free time in the mornings and on Friday. You should be good!
Congrats Maggie !! Enjoy the campus life then hit the books hard.
I'm a transfer, be careful. 4 units at CC =/= 4 units at Berkeley. I killed it at CC with 15 units and here I'm dying with 13. A bunch of classes have sections that take up even more time
Also, you and I actually share a class together based on this schedule so if you need anything/have questions about cal anthro feel free to pm me!
That’s crazy I’m in 25 units tho (philosophy/media studies/architecture triple major)"
