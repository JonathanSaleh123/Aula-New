BSC Interim Executive Director Fired,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/owucgr/bsc_interim_executive_director_fired/,2021-08-02 19:55:45,"Today's BSC Members Digest included a letter from the Summer Committee President announcing that they and the rest of SumCom voted to end Teena Lorie's, the former BSC Interim Executive Director, contract on Thursday, July 29th, citing a number of issues, not the least of which was the fact that she never moved to Berkeley.

Thoughts on her/the situation? I wasn't aware there were issues until quite recently.

For anyone who's been around for a while or was here during the previous ED's tenure, what did you think of Kim Benson, and how does she stack up to Teena Lorie?","[deleted]
This sounds even better than the Cloyne drama from way back when over whether white people should be allowed in the library.
For real, the BSC has more turnover than a pie shop.

Victor was in ""Member Resources."" I don't think the BSC has an HR department because it's supposed to be the Board of Directors' job to hire and fire staff ðŸ¤”

I also didn't know about how Kim refused to leave. LMAO. That has the same energy as Trump refusing to concede ðŸ¥´

I guess I'm lucky I never really had firsthand experience with their incompetence (especially Steve's)â€”except for Teena Lorie as of late.

Edit: Bonnie's like the only employee who's left the BSC of their own volition in who knows how long, lol
Iâ€™m so glad Kim & Steve are gone! BSC really needed fresh blood. Steve is literally the laziest person Iâ€™ve ever worked with! And Kim - I donâ€™t even know where to start. She looks unassuming at first but anyone who has worked with her for any significant length of time will come to realize that she is a dictator! She bullied me & literally made my life a living hell, while I worked there! Plus she was also having inappropriate relations with one of the students she was supervising. All the staff knew but they were all too afraid of her to speak up! Idk how Teena Lorie was, but literally anybody would be better than Kim Benson!
i need to know the story behind the cloyne drama omg
LOL

Did you hear about the Loth drama in fall 2019 where they were given a laundry list of ways they needed to change their ""cultish ways?""
Same
Oh my god, no. Do tell.
I'm not sure how I even came into possession of it, but they were sent a letter by the Board in fall 2019 telling them they had to stop voting by consensus (Ã  la the Quakers, which a student housing cooperative is decidedly not), stop having parties that promote substance use (lol @ CZ's used whippit collection and bong graveyard Bonnie & co. had to step over at manager training in spring 2020), use regular locks instead of a keypad for entry, keep better track of guests and boarders, *actually charge boarders*, and way more by the end of last spring.

The list was *exhaustive*. I have no idea if they've changed their ways. The letter even threatened to transfer all the current residents so they could re-theme the house, which is what happened to Cloyne."
Best housing for incoming freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bk3s5h/best_housing_for_incoming_freshman/,2019-05-02 20:14:35,"Hereâ€™s my list of all the random housing questions I can think of as I fill out the application (which keeps crashing...)!

Iâ€™ve looked around the housing website a bit, Blackwell is def the nicest (prolly most peopleâ€™s first choice lol), but how do the others stack up? 

Unit 3 says renovated but Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s not as nice as 1 and 2. Speaking of which, what are the main differences between 1 and 2? 

And in terms of Foothill, Iâ€™ve heard lots of negatives like that itâ€™s antisocial and has pest problems, but the setup looks nice, whatâ€™s the overall deal there?

And then for Clark-Kerr, does it feel isolated from the rest of the campus socially or do CK students still socialize plenty with everyone else? 

Hesitant to ask this, but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not the only one. What are the communal co-ed bathrooms like? Does it take awhile to get used to?

Lastly, what are the argument for 2 vs 3 people in a room?

How to become president (or prime minister or any person of power)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3armle/how_to_become_president_or_prime_minister_or_any/,2015-06-22 16:15:15,"Greetings compatriots of the university institution.

I am an incoming first-year pursuing an Industrial Engineering and Operations Research degree planning to enter Haas School of Business.

It is my great desire to become a man of power in this world. A man that will bring about change, who will be forever commemorated in the annals of history. I have read Machiavelli's The Prince, the Communist Manifesto, and The Art of War, as well as the book Freedom's Orator (having written that ""optional"" book report Berkeley suggested). I have developed a strategy, but now, I need advice on how to develop the tactics.

Those who wield power, such as EECS and Chemical Engineering Majors, ASUC Executive Board, and Janet Napolitano, how does one maneuver his way up the social and corporate institutions? Should I begin by interning for ASUC or the Chancellor's Board or the Berkeley Secret Police? Or should I try writing for the Daily Cal as op-eds on important affairs such as ""Have your butt eaten too,"" ""4 fun majors at Berkeley,"" ""Tips on Sex in Main Stacks without getting caught"", and racial biases in media that color the portrayal of the oppressed masses of minorities such as African Americans and Asians. Or do I ally myself politically with large alliances on campus - the Asian dance groups, the Asian Christian organizations, the Asian business organizations, or Greek Life?

My initial plan is to run for ASUC President right from the start. ""Absurd!"" you might say. Fear not. I am not like the other foolish first-year who ran for president ""under the name of the god who is based."" I plan to bring REAL change on campus. My first plan is to bring quarter machines to campus, because change is often needed for laundry. My second plan is to provide free changes of clothing using the money of the bourgeoisie - Janet Napolitano. My third plan is to publicly label all the pre-medical students with a red star, as their threatening individualistic competitiveness undercuts the good for the common people.

Also, should I AP out of Math 1B?

Also, Bernie Sanders 2016.
If not, then Donald Trump and Oprah 2016.

That is all.
",">Also, should I AP out of Math 1B?


Yes, assuming you got a 5 and actually understood the material.

I like you.  Please stick around.  You can be like the commie version of /u/roidsbear
All of the people you mentioned - President Napolitano, the ASUC, the Daily Cal writers, the EECS Wizards - they are nothing but puppets.

There is only one person who wields true power here, and his name is Guy Fieri.
I deeply appreciate the effort put into this post. Also yes definitely ap out of 1b.
Given my time at Berkeley I can't tell is this is real or not.

Do not AP out of 1B, Math 1B at Berkeley is significantly harder than AP tests.

Any class at Berkeley is significantly harder than AP classes.
Wait what's the point of doing that tho 

Taking a lower math allows you to learn the base material better and should improve your GPA right
Summer reddit has the best shitposting, no contest
[deleted]
It's all fun and games until serious Facists join.
>Taking a lower math allows you to learn the base material better

Unnecessary if you already know the material well.

>should improve your GPA right

Not if the class is full of people who think the same way and who have also already taken an equivalent course elsewhere and already know the material. Then you're just back to square one, except it's even worse because you already know the material too, so you're just repeating stuff and it's boring.
Not in a notorious weeder class like 1B it doesn't!

I took 1B thinking this and discovered that literally everyone else had the same idea.  It sucks, don't do it.

"fall 2022 course review: cs170, data140, cs61c",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/100duku/fall_2022_course_review_cs170_data140_cs61c/,2022-12-31 22:44:59,"**CS170 (Nelson/Demmel):** 

*Rating*: 5.1/5

*Content*: In 170, you cover really interesting theory concepts including time complexity analysis, algorithms for graph traversals & shortest paths, dynamic programming, duality, and reductions to NP-Complete problems. I'd consider the pace to be pretty reasonable -- there are times when the class moves quickly through certain algorithms, but for larger things (like linear programming, reductions, dp) you're given a few lectures to sort of grasp the topic. The homeworks are generally interesting problems -- although often there are 1-2 very difficult questions -- and I'd definitely recommend having a study group to work on the homework together with. There's also a project where you get to write algorithms to find some solutions to a NP-complete problem, which is super super cool.

*Teaching:*

**Nelson** is likely the best professor I've had. He does a really good job of taking concepts and starting from the beginning, while also showing how to build intuition to understand why an algorithm works. He sees pitfalls people can run into as he's teaching and addresses them, and is really good at tying new concepts back and ""bringing it all together."" He's also just fun to listen to and seems really passionate about most things; I really loved attending his live lectures. 

**Demmel** is definitely an above average lecturer. One thing I really enjoy that he does is show a lot of real-world examples of how to apply some algorithm, and help visualize things that are often stuck in theory. The downsides of this is that there were a few points where it really felt like stuff was ""proof by example"", and as someone interested in the reasoning behind stuff, meant that there was a bit of textbook reading kind of required to supplement that. He also sometimes starts his lectures with 20 minutes about what he is going to be talking about during the lecture, which can feel a little bit like a waste of time; I think connecting things together at the end, after we've learned the concepts, might be a bit better. Having said that, he is very receptive to questions and seems to also enjoy teaching.

**Course Staff**: I feel like I learned so much from discussion -- I attended a few but the discussion TA I ended up going with (Wilson) was so good at summarizing key topics and helping us figure out how to apply them to the problems. Feel like discussion helped me keep on pace with the class a lot, and was often pretty useful for homeworks as well. The one thing that **really bothered me** about this class was office hours -- it felt like the course staff I interacted with there either didn't understand how to arrive at the solution to a problem, or didn't want to take the time to explain it; it felt like there was a lot of ""ok this is just how u solve it"" and not a lot of help with conceptual understanding, which I found frustrating. I do think homework parties were very cute though, and was a good initiative to have here.

*Difficulty*: This class definitely takes a lot of time, but it does feel like time invested pays off -- like the concepts are difficult and oftentimes hard to grasp at first, but it doesn't feel like exams or homeworks are there to ""trick"" you; if you watch lecture, take notes on relevant DPV things you don't understand, and put time into understanding discussion problems then you'll see results. 

*Usefulness*: I think the coding portions of the homeworks are probably the most useful thing you can do (after 61b) if you want to prep for tech interviews. I was recruiting while taking this class and I'd literally learn something and then code it in an interview the next week. I'd say biggest topics here were time complexity analysis, BFS/DFS/Dijkstra's, and also sometimes dynamic programming. Also, generally, I think understanding some of this stuff -- like what is NP-Complete? what is a dual? etc -- is good because these were always concepts people talked about before that I had 0 clue about.

*TLDR?* Would highly recommend this class. Probably my favorite class at Cal.  
 
_ _ _

**Data140 (Adhikari):**

*Rating*: 5/5

*Content*: In 140, you get a really in-depth understanding of probability. You explore really cool problems ranging from stuff you might have seen before, ""what is the expected value of this dice roll?"" (eventually, ""what is the expected value of a dice roll with possible values based on a different dice roll""), to things you've likely not thought about, ""if I don't know the rate at which this coin is heads, how do I update my predictions as I simulate to make a good guess?"". The class shows a lot of interesting results for stuff you've likely not seen before -- poissonizing the binomial, and seeing the math behind that (& that two results are independent), is probably the first thing that blew my mind here. Really beneficial to gain a broader understanding of the likelihood of things happening, focusing on probability & the math behind it but also inference, regression & predictions, and things that happen to simulations over time.

*Teaching*: 

**Adhikari** is a really great professor, and the reason there's a ""likely"" in my comments about Nelson above -- the two are probably tied for my favorite professor at Cal. The thing she does really well is understand where students are going to get stuck, and take a lot of steps to make sure that you don't get stuck there. She teaches probability in a very different way than your past courses probably have, focusing on the ""why"" and the conceptual reasons behind it, which helps so much in, again, building the intuition that is needed to solve problems (rather than just trying to pattern match). She also seems to genuinely care about students, and is one of few professors I know who's super active on Ed answering questions; her communication through the strike especially was really above-and-beyond. Would highly recommend taking the course with her.

**Course Staff**: I only had positive interactions with course staff -- I feel like there was a lot of really good OH support that helped with both the conceptual but also how to approach problems, and showed you what to consider. Weirdly, OH doesn't really have any sort of queue system most of the time so it can take some time to receive help, since you just kind of have to hope the course staff there goes to you next. For discussion, my TA (Ziyue) was also really good at explaining problems and walking through all the relevant steps, and it definitely felt beneficial, if sometimes a little slow (in terms of covering very similar problems).

*Difficulty*: Very much like 170, this class takes a lot of time, but it does again feel like time invested pays off. For homeworks, they take a lot of time -- I do think one of the complaints I have with this class is that homeworks at times feel like ""oh you did a really basic application of this idea in discussion, now go solve a super hard-and-complicated version that is not always super motivated"". You learn a lot of cool results in homeworks and labs, which is great, but I do think the gap between discussions and homeworks should be closed a bit by having discussions show more difficult applications. For exams and quizzes, they're super reasonable and feel very motivated by the material you've prepared -- if you review homeworks, textbook problems, and past exams (if applicable), you will see results.

*Usefulness*: I think a lot of this probability stuff is very useful to build on, especially through using some of it in machine learning. The class also emphasizes problems that are pretty useful for quantitative trading interviews, so if that's a path you're exploring, this is probably a class to take. Honestly, also just loved all these concepts, and think the class is very very worth taking just to get a better conceptual understanding of it all.

*TLDR?:* Definitely also take this class. I think this class was branded to me as ""easier 126"" but I feel like because some stuff was a bit slowed down, it really helped me to get conceptual intuition that some of my friends in 126 didn't seem to get. I also heard of it as a ""harder 134"" but looking at what my friends learned from 134, if you're actually interested in probability -- and it's applications to cs/ds -- 140 beats it by a lot.

**CS61C (Garcia/Yan):**

*Rating:* 2.5/5

*Content:* This class has a small introduction to C (primarily just learning abt stack/heap and memory allocation, as well as why it's 'faster' than python), stuff about number representations an floating point, introduction to the assembly language risc-v, understanding CPUs and datapath pipelining, and then covers caches, virtual memory, parallelism, etc. Basically the computer architecture. 

*Teaching:* 

**Garcia:** Garcia is a very passionate lecturer, and he clearly cares a lot about teaching. His teaching is very ""big ideas"" oriented -- this is cool most of the time, but can get very frustrating when he spends more time on history than on understanding the deeper-level of how does this thing actually get implemented and why does that implementation work. This leads to a disconnect where HWs/Discussions seem to often be the first place you learn actual implementations of material or how things work -- which is generally not what is supposed to happen -- but it happens because the depth of lecture can be pretty low, focusing more on breadth. Having said that, he brings a lot of fun to the classroom, and keeps people excited, while also connecting with students.

**Yan:** Yan is a good lecturer -- she also seems to care a lot about students and has a really good way of explaining things that articulates kind of both what we're expected to know, but also goes a bit deeper. Her lectures are good, and generally communicate the necessary info we need to know, although sometimes also run into this ""big ideas"" problem.

*Difficulty:* The course content itself is difficult -- it covers a lot of things in a pretty fast-paced manner. The course, as it was run this semester, however, was not. The midterm was designed to be super short (completable by TAs in 15 min) and primarily ""C and D-level questions"". The final was also very short (4 pages) and, partially due to strike, tested concepts at a low level. Here, it didn't feel like time put in equalled results -- felt a lot more like you didn't have to put much time at all to do well, and fully understanding the concepts didn't help you at all; the only thing you have to worry about is like small arithmetic errors, which is pretty frustrating. Content was just not tested effectively. The reasoning behind this is likely the 'As for all' thing they were doing -- which is an interesting idea in theory -- but was not implemented super well. The messaging itself was kind of sad, because it made you feel like you had to get an A to feel competent, and it ended up meaning that you could get a super good grade without putting much effort at all, which harms understanding pretty heavily. The main difficult thing ended up being having to learn all the key concepts through HW guide videos to answer those questions, and then trying to do well on projects, which really only tested a small portion of things.

*Usefulness:* I'm sure this class is super useful in regular semesters. Some of the stuff seemed pretty cool, especially understanding how the CPU worked. However, I feel like I exited not learning a lot, because the reduced difficulty of everything meant it felt like there was no reward to actually getting the concepts, and it ended up being pretty easy to pattern match on HWs with the guide videos, or get through everything (besides projects) with minimal understanding, so there was no real incentive to learn more.

*TLDR:* If you want an A, or grades are generally important to you, take this class in a semester with 'As for all'. If you want to gain a deeper understanding of concepts, I'd recommend waiting it out, though.


Hopefully all of this info is helpful to people. Feel free to ask questions below, and leave your own reviews for these courses. And Happy New Year!","wtf is this As for all bullshit
Did you find the workload doable for these 3? Cuz I am gonna take 61c, Data 140 and math 110. I want to add breadths but I am afraid itâ€™s too much work.
[deleted]
3) 61c: was the difficulty of the course different in only the midterm and final? (so hw/lab was the same?) If so, you also mention ""The main difficult thing ended up being having to learn all the key concepts through HW guide videos to answer those questions, and then trying to do well on projects, which really only tested a small portion of things"" so I don't see how the class harms understanding since I think the bulk of understanding comes from hw/project.  
""However, I feel like I exited not learning a lot, because the reduced difficulty of everything meant it felt like there was no reward to actually getting the concepts, and it ended up being pretty easy to pattern match on HWs with the guide videos, or get through everything (besides projects) with minimal understanding""

So it sounds like the actual hw was easier?
were you the one to score 100% on both Data140 MT and Final?
Sounds like a slogan for freshmen who obsess over their GPA
Ya, I found this to be doable. There were some weeks where it felt like a lot but I also had some weeks with a lot of free time. Also, note that I have a job for 20 hours a week, so if you don't have that, I feel like you'll def be good with this and some breadths.
I am not very good at thinking about how time passes (mostly because when I work on something, I am p bad at focusing so i do like four things at a time & also I tend to like not have a consistent schedule week-by-week). In terms of general workload, I thought 170 took the most time by far (HWs are many hours, reading book and understanding stuff + lectures takes time), 140 was a lot less (some 70 knowledge carried me through this, HW still took a few hours though for sure), and 61C was very minimal (outside of projects, which I would grind in a day of just focusing on project). 


For 140, I think the thing Adhikari did was focus on the proofs. Like really walking us through the math behind why something worked, and pointing out common mistakes along the way. I think a specific example from this semester is the lecture where she talked about birthday paradox/matching problem, and different ways to approach and understand that. I think being walked through that conceptual stuff was what helped me the most, but totally understand people learn differently :)) I think also for base understanding I did have CS70 knowledge, so maybe she didn't start from the basics and I didn't notice -- but I don't remember ever having a feeling that I just had to ""accept"" everything.

As for discussion, I do think my TA did a good job helping us think about what questions we should ask here when thinking about how to approach a problem, and next steps. Ya, there was some times where it felt like walkthrough, but I think she paused for understanding and gave time for people to talk with groups and try to solve stuff together, although I agree there could have been more for sure.
oh, to clarify, by a ""few"" i meant I tried a few different TAs :)) I'll answer the rest of the qs after new year hehe
For HW, there were these HW guide videos that I mentioned you could basically pattern match, and HW is unlimited tries -- so it's pretty easy to do well on the HW if you just guess a bunch of times; the difficulty in that sentence refers to trying to understand why the answer is right, if that makes sense. Like to ""get it"" was difficult (especially without as much corresponding lecture help, but to ""do well"" was not so much. I think projects were great (although we didn't do the parallelism one, because of strike, which was so sad), but they don't test all parts of the course -- so I gained really in-depth knowledge of specific things for sure but there was a bunch missing. Maybe part of this is just because we didn't get the 4th project but also if you look at topics vs what projects cover, you'll see a project really can't go over all the key points.

Hopefully that makes a bit of sense lol, but totally down to clarify more :)
No, not at all LOL
Thanks!
Just curious, what kind of part time job are you working on? I am also looking for part time work.
You did these three classes with a 20 hour work week? That's impressive I'm ngl. I'm planning my schedule for next spring and was thinking of these exact classes but the workload seems daunting
[deleted]
do you know if the semester had different homeworks? or was the hw guide a new thing this semester?
I don't think you're dumb at all. I definitely had to spend a lot of time reading up on stuff and solving problems on my own -- discussion by itself is not enough, since there has to be some level of like self-learning and frustration with the content to grow. I guess I kind of just expect that to happen though, since that's part of the process of learning -- I just felt like discussion helped me a bit in guiding some of that frustration and also gave me points to start for when I was working on my own.
Ya, the guides are made during the semester. I think homeworks are also changed slightly, but not totally sure.
Doesn't that mean you could just not look at the hw guide in order to feel like you learned
I mean ya, I also could have just learned all the concepts myself on my own time -- you can do this in any class. I just felt the class struggled with giving an incentive for people to develop content understanding. 

Also, as I said, I felt there wasn't enough actually lower-level work in lecture to understand sometimes what the homeworks were even asking, so HW guides were necessary, and sometimes detrimental.
ah i see. ty for answering! i wonder how previous semesters did hw since garcia has taught the class a lot, so if his lectures dont go to the needed depth, then yikes"
