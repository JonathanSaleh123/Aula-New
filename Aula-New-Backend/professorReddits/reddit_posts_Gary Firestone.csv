Advice on MCB135A and MCB150,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14bdf7a/advice_on_mcb135a_and_mcb150/,2023-06-16 18:10:44,"Hi! 

I'm starting at Berkeley in the Fall as a transfer student in MCB, and I'm trying to choose between taking MCB 135A (Molecular Endocrinology) with Prof. Gary Firestone or MCB 150 (Molecular Immunology) with Prof. Robert Beatty. I'm sticking to only one MCB course for the fall since I have to take Chem 3B as well, but both courses seem really interesting and I can't choose between them. What would you recommend is best to take for the first semester, while also balancing it with 3B workload? What has your experience been with either one of the courses? I appreciate the help in advance :)","both are great in terms of content and instructor. so it really depends on your interest on the content and your schedule. also 135a is offered in fall while 150 is offered every semester
Haven’t taken 150 but I’ve heard that it has a higher workload. Firestone is a great professor and the class was super interesting, so I’d recommend 135A"
