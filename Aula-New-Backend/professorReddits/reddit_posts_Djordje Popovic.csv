Who is the Most Fun Professor You've Had Here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17w0z4l/who_is_the_most_fun_professor_youve_had_here/,2023-11-15 11:04:15,I'm trying to find a professor who seems like they understand fun. Someone you may have run into at a bar or who generally seems to support student engagement and entertainment. This is for an interview hopefully so please let me know if anyone comes to mind.,"Professor Darren Zook!!!
Filippenko in the astronomy department (seriously an intellectual and comedic powerhouse) and Landreth in the English department (heâ€™s so funny and his interpretations of literature are so beautiful and entertaining to hear)
Professor Lowhorn
[deleted]
I really loved Professor Beatty (he was my professor for MCB 50 and 55). He was really energetic and sassy. I also loved Professor Gibbs (she taught the second third of Bio 1A - she does it in the spring). She was teaching challenging material, but she was practically jumping around Pimentel Hall at 8 am.
For me itâ€™s Professor Lowman heâ€™s just so sassy in class and laughs at the chatâ€™s chaos lmao
unpopular opinion but Shobhana Stoyanov in stats was hilarious lol, she also cared way more about her students than most professors I had during my time at Cal.
James Campbell!! Literally ran into him at a bar during dead week!!
Pete Marsden for sure
\[Disclaimer: 20 years ago, but I think he might still be around\]

Prof. Wenk in Geology.

Back in my day he organized week-long field trips out to the desert. The trip was a whole upper div course. Hiking and sightseeing all day. Every night camping with steaks and things on the campfire.

I can't recall if there was beer, but it was 20 years ago so probably.

Best class I ever took. Awesome dude.

I think we all got an A too.
Josh Hug. He has a really cool taste in music (Aphex Twin, Melt Banana).
Prof. Adhikari fs 8)
djordje popovic!!!!
Daniel Neumark 

Heâ€™s likeâ€¦cranky AF and salty to the core.  He has the sense of humor you might expect from the captain of a crab fishing ship during a snow storm in the Arctic circle.  Heâ€™s constantly on the edge of being really pissed off but heâ€™s just polite enough to make wry jokes at nobodyâ€™s expense.  

Also Udi Isacoff is a real treat if youâ€™re ever taking any neuro courses.
John Arnold for gen chem!
Professor Hilfinger ðŸŒš
Lynn Huntsinger. Rangeland Ecology professor. She came to UC Forestry camp and at the end of her guest lecture week took out all the of-age students to the local dive bar. She is seriously a hoot.
Norman Sheu
Dan Garcia for sure

I love Bill Whiteâ€™s classes in Anthro but Iâ€™m not sure if he is teaching next semester
Norman Sheu, his lectures are great and he is a very fun person once you get to know him.
darren zook!
professor lawerence cohen, he teaches medical anthropology
Charles briggs anthro
prof firestone & prof ball!
Davina Chan sheâ€™s the best prof Iâ€™ve ever had in my life she really changed my outlook on life, besides all the academic stuff she taught me how to live life outside of school, she taught me things that I apply in my life daily. Will forever have such respect and appreciation for her.
Jim Campbell, Jean Ahn, Peter Bartou
Alex Craghead
Dan Garcia so far
61C with Garcia
my goat anant sahai
Shawn Chi
Mark Hellerstein
anant sahai
Professor Landreth in the English dept. That guy's a hoot!
Jerome Baggett, Sociology dept
Paul Fine
Mickey
jrs, man of duality
Jean Ahn
Ryan Edwards
might be a niche class but Professor Ben Hammed for COMLIT 100A
Either Dr. Mardsen, Dr. Lowhorn, or Professor Ball
Prof. John Kaiser, Sociology is awesome! Definitely seems like he knows how to have fun and how to chill
I'm a such a stan for Zook!!!
was gonna say this but i knew someone would have already commented lmao
Heâ€™s the best!
I'm with you there! He's so energetic and goofy!
Fr
lowhorn makes physics tolerable <3
Big ups to the 61c legend
yes yes yes
Also, I can't forget Dr. Shusterman from Chem 1A! She was absolutely legendary!
Loved Beatty omg
Agree ^^
I was going to say him as well. Iâ€™d love to get a beer with him. He was always fun in lecture, and seemed to really care about his students. Iâ€™m sure he would be amazing to hang out with outside of the school setting. Also, Jeremy Sanchez who is in the Stats department. He always seemed down to earth and like heâ€™d be cool to hang out with. I hated Stat 20, but loved him as a teacher!
is that the philosophy one?
I second this. I had 2 classes with him and he was so fun!
duuuude heâ€™s so chill
The goat himself
Spot on description! I like Neumark a lot- some of us can appreciate the curmudgeonly among us for their honesty and refusal to put on airs, if nothing else.
This has to be a joke
I love how he teaches heâ€™s such an amazing prof
I took his folklore class to fulfill a req and it was one of my favorite classes I took at Cal!
which Lyapunov function u used to show convergence?
Best guy to get a beer with. 

(But wait until youâ€™ve graduated! ;))
Econ 100A
