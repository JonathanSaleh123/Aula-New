R&C Requirement Help!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14ch4f7/rc_requirement_help/,2023-06-18 03:29:28,"I'm an incoming freshman trying to fulfill my R&C Part A requirement (1st semester). I'm deciding which course to choose. 

***My main goal with the R&C Course I take is to improve my ability to write (specifically things like application essays, personal statements, resumes, etc) creatively, engagingly, and convincingly. (I'm not that focused on reading and analyzing heavy literature)***

Which of the following course best specifies **THIS PARTICULAR GOAL/PURPOSE?:**

ColWrit R1A: Accelerated Reading and Composition

ColWrit R4A: Reading and Composition

ComLit R1A: English Composition...

Rhetor R1A: The Craft of Writing","I had the same goal and took RHETOR R1A and it helped me a lot, I really loved the class. It depends a lot on the instructor and how they run the class though (I had Ryan Ikeda and he was awesome!)
ok"
