Math 53 with Suncica Canic,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17rsthp/math_53_with_suncica_canic/,2023-11-09 17:32:54,Has anyone of you had experience with Prof. Suncica Canic? I would like to hear from you please🙏🏻,"Last year her lectures were 5-6:30 and a lot of people stopped going very early on since it was hard to focus that late in the day, but I don’t think her style of lecturing (sit down and talk while writing on the iPad) really helped matters

Fortunately, if you don’t show up, her notes are very good, so you won’t be totally lost (also the Stewart textbook is pretty good)

Her office hours were very sparsely populated since they were after lecture and everyone would just want to go home, but they were good for enriching your understanding of a topic provided that you already knew a bit about what was going on (if you’re totally lost on a topic and don’t know where to start with it, the book and the GSI office hours are probably your best bets)

Homework can be long but is graded on completion, but still not as long as some other professors who teach 53

I enjoyed her class and I might ask her for a letter of rec later but I definitely had to make an effort to keep myself engaged that late into the day, and most people (no disrespect to them) weren’t willing to stay engaged for that long

Her lectures are 8AM/2PM this semester.. but I'll probably go to the 8AM one.
Thank you so much for your detailed answer. I wanted to ask about the quizzes and the final exam. How hard were they and what would you recommend to get good grades in them?
Lemme know abt the course first haha
The quizzes are written by the GSI and can vary, you can afford to miss or do poorly on a couple since they’re weekly and have two or three drops out of like 13

The exam questions aren’t much harder than the book problems, just do your homework and you should have plenty of practice

Note that she does applied math/differential equations for a living so at least one problem will likely have some physical interpretation around it (which I consider to be a good thing)

Also don’t be afraid to use your paper, pencil, arms, hands, or desk as a prop to help visualize a surface or graph—53 is much improved by spatial reasoning and visualization

Edit - assuming you can focus that early in the day, the 8 am lecture will be far less populated than the afternoon one, so you’ll be able to ask more questions and get good seats more reliably which I enjoyed

Additionally you’ll be able to make some small talk before lecture and be able to ask content questions before everyone else
>Fortunately, if you don’t show up, her notes are very good, so you won’t be totally lost (also the Stewart textbook is pretty good)

Hi, I am wondering whether she posts recordings after lecture?"
Emiliano Gomez or Suncica Canic for Math 53?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y93qu7/emiliano_gomez_or_suncica_canic_for_math_53/,2022-10-20 10:03:00,"I'm trying to plan my Phase 1 classes for next semester, but I do not know which teacher to take for next semester. Apparently, Gomez was a Math 16B professor previously.","Gomez is one of the nicest professors I've taken, and he always makes class fun to go to.
Canic is usually the best 53 prof out there, this is Gomez’s first time teaching it so no clue
Canic 100%, amazing professor, beautiful notes
Both are very competent instructors, so take whatever section is most convenient. Shouldn't be a radically different experience either way."
James Sethian vs. Suncica Canic for Math 53?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h0hy7m/james_sethian_vs_suncica_canic_for_math_53/,2020-06-10 12:18:07,"I'm trying to take Math 53 for my first semester (tested out of Math 1A, maybe Math 1B depending on AP test results; doing Math 54 this summer). 

I've heard good things about Prof Sethian and it's an 8 AM lecture which is better for me since I'm a morning person. However, it conflicts with SCANDIN R5A which I've heard is a relatively R&C course; there's another slot for MATH 53 in the afternoon w/ Prof Canic. Who should I go with? Should I try to keep Prof Sethian and drop R5A, or go w/ Prof Canic?","I took Sethian for 54 and I thought he was a great professor! However, our class was curved down due to high exam grades and everyone received one grade lower than they expected. 

Also, you can always take Scandinavian R5A another semester! To be honest, decent math professors (for undergrads) are hard to come by so I recommend you choose classes with good professors rather than to knock out requirements early.
I took it with Canic last fall (2019) and the exams were easy! Her class was pretty chill overall, although I will say the grade distribution was rather odd. Ended up scoring 98 on the second midterm and 92.5 on final which clobbered the first midterm, got 100% on quiz grade and homework grade but still ended up with an A- rather than an A. She’s not the best lecturer in my opinion but is definitely caring and actually has a heart LOL. Would recommend her class!
The Sethian curve is ridonkulous
Makes sense - I'll go with Sethian for 53 then! I'll just do the R5A class next spring then. Thanks!
Oof that's a weird grade distribution. Will definitely take it with her then - thanks for the advice!
Ouch - really? I thought that Canic had bad curves because her exams for easier?
That's not what laka means by curve -- Canic curves to a higher average grade per Berkeleytime. She's also a decent (although not great by any means) lecturer, and the vibe of the class is pretty chill. Exams are easy and just require precision, and HW is all just completion. She often finishes lecturing 10-15 minutes early which is a plus. For lower div math, you probably just want to take the section which is curved to a higher GPA unless the professor is horrible (e.g. Ming Gu Math 54 this fall).
Holy crap I just checked berkeleytime and u/lakalaka1 is right - his curve is HARD - he gives <15% of students an A. Yea Imma go w/ Canic - thanks for the heads up!"
Math 53 with Kelli Talaska or Suncica Canic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bgmwcg/math_53_with_kelli_talaska_or_suncica_canic/,2019-04-23 15:50:58,"I am planning taking math 53 on 2019 Fall, but I can't decide between prof. Kelli Talaska and prof. Suncica Canic, any insight?",I've heard a lot of good about Canic.  Can't speak to Talaska but definitely try for Canic.
Math 53 With Canic,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18ytvog/math_53_with_canic/,2024-01-04 17:12:14,"Hello, I'm an intended applied Math major who did utterly horrible on Math 53 in the Fall and retaking it this spring with professor suncica canic. I was just wondering how the prof was? On the syllabus it is mentioned that this prof doesn't curve but their grade distributions seem pretty good? Would appreciate feedback on how they are. Thank you!","Had her in Fall ‘20 and thought she was pretty good. I remember her being an effective lecturer. But of course, as with any math class, most of my learning/developing of skills was done through exercises in section, asking questions, and grinding out hw psets. This part is facilitated by having a good GSI too."

Math 53, Suncica Canic

Physics 5A, Andrew Charman

English R1B, Alba Tomasula y Garcia","Looks good to me, that's a very standard freshman/sophomore year schedule. Two classes for your major, one for school requirements, and one for fun (and maybe school requirements). 

And the best way to prepare is to just take your mind off of it and enjoy your break! If you haven't done any calc in a while you *could* do a bit of recap (look over a math 1A and 1B syllabus and make sure you're at least acquainted with everything) but really only do it if you're stressed. You'll be best served just resting up and establishing a good daily routine again
Your schedule looks good, but just a little heads up on 5A.

I took physics 5A first semester and my friends took Charman 5B and 89. Long story short, I highly recommend you review math 1B stuff and even get a little ahead on math 53 for 5A. Some topics from math 53 that show up early in 5A are vectors, some multiple integrals (gravitation), vector calculus (force along a path), and some basic partial derivatives. You don't HAVE to know these as they will be taught but it makes the physics easier if you already know the math.

5A was a pretty challenging class and Charman is notorious for being a tough professor to have because of general difficulty (exams and assignments) and course load. He has mixed reviews on Rate My Professor but his classes are generally considered difficult regardless. If my expectations hold, 5A with Charman will be quite tough. Best piece of advice, find a study group and go to OH/HW parties.
canic is great, shouldn't be too bad. Go to office hours!!!!
Language classes are hard. Even if the grade distribution is good, they can be more work than you’re expecting. Meeting every day is a lot. Just keep that in mind."
Math 53,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fu1ms2/math_53/,2020-04-02 21:24:23,I am a MCB and math double major and I wanted to know who to take Math 53 with: Suncica Canic or James Sethian. I would really appreciate any feedback ! :),"Canid is a fun lecturer. She puts cute animal pictures in her lecture cause last semester they were 1:30 long. She’s also quite easily approachable. I remember during lecture, what I did was after she showed a cute animal picture on the slides, I would pull up one on my iPad and point the screen towards her. She literally was trying to hold back her laughter. Also on Halloween, she brought candy for the entire class.
I've heard canic is alright. I've heard sethian is a challenging grader.
I took 53 with Canic last semester. She's a decent lecturer and a very nice person who really cares about her students a lot. She assigns quite a bit of homework (they're all problems from the textbook), but it's just graded based on completion. Make sure you actually do them though because her test questions are pretty similar to the homework problems. Also her tests were really easy last semester, but I think that might have been because it was her first time teaching 53.
I had Canic last semester. I went to lecture the first few weeks but stopped because I thought she wasn’t a good lecturer so I just ended up reading the textbook. The tests were really easy though."
Math 53 math 1b professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h9bbj0/math_53_math_1b_professors/,2020-06-15 00:26:27,"Assuming I get a 5 on the bc test I’m taking math 53..
Looking at the fall classes the professor who teaches math 53 in the fall is James Sethian and suncica canic. I prefer james bc the time the class are in the morning from 8-930 while canic is 5-630 which I prefer not to have.
Math 1b has Alexander Paulin morning 8-930 and 3-430( I’ll go with the morning).
How do you compre the two teachers for math 53?","ratemyprofessors.com and berkeleytime.com

Canic writes easy exams and gives a reasonable amount of homework, but your grade will be curved down. I personally enjoyed her class since she has a great attitude."
