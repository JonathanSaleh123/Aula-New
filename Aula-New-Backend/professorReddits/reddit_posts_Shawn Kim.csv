Challenging but Rewarding Class Recommendations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ckwh1o/challenging_but_rewarding_class_recommendations/,2024-05-05 10:28:13,"Recently took UGBA 102B with Shawn Kim. It was very challenging, but I felt like I grew as a critical thinker and flexed parts of my brain that I have not used before. I was wondering if there were any recommendations for classes from any department that made you feel like you grew fundamentally as a thinker?","Math 110
CS 61B, CS 189
CS182 with Sahai is amazing 

From my experience: CS182, EECS127, EECS126, CS189, CS162, CS180, PHILOS 12A, CS61B, CS61A, CS285, CS184

From what I've heard from other people: CS152, EECS151, EECS106A + B, CSC267, CS 294-158

Classes I didn't find hard but interesting: DATA100, DATA8, DATAC104, ANTHRO160AC, MUSIC 25A, GEOG130.
I nickname 102B as teaching “consulting math”. Small snippets of math but when used right could bring out some good insights
ME C180
Info 159. Not crazy challenging, but goddamn it taught me a lot. I think some people struggled with the coursework.
You want challenging? Data 104
Can’t recommend this class enough
61A with Hilfinger had a high work to idea ratio. 61B with Shewchuk was just a snoozefest. 61C, Great Ideas In Computer Architecture, with Garcia was just *awesome*.
I agree - I was told that Shawn Kim's 102B version was called ""Strategic Cost Management"" at Wharton. It really made me use math in ways that I did not consider before. I really enjoyed it!"
