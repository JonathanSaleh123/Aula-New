How is CS170 with Alessandro Chiesa?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6y3j6/how_is_cs170_with_alessandro_chiesa/,2020-04-23 17:07:20,"Avishay Tal and Umesh Vazirani are teaching Fall 2020, and Alessandro Chiesa is teaching Spring 2021. I'm thinking of taking 170 Spring 2021, and was wondering if any of you have had any experience with Chiesa--what's he like? How's his grade distribution? Is he a good lecturer?","according to my friend who's in 170 rn, Chiesa is a god-tier professor.  Heard nothing but great things from him. He's a really effective and engaging lecturer, and is really knowledgeable.
Chiesa and his italian lessons are the best.
I like him better than Prof Nelson currently in 170. He gives concise and sharp mathematical justifications and reasoning, simple but not overwhelming in logical jumps for lecture. Approve"
Rate my schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15f2yar/rate_my_schedule/,2023-07-31 22:14:31,"Does this seem doable? For reference, I got a B+ in 61a and took an algebra-based physics class in high school. I've also self-studied the discrete math portion of 70.

Does anyone have experience with stat 33b? Also can someone send me a recent syllabus for BioE 114? The last syllabus on TBP is from a covid semester.

Rather tough but doable. Would recommend taking an easier schedule, probably swap out a technical with a breadth.
this is definitely going to be a grind if you go through with it
Is it doable, yes. 
Is it going to be tough, yes. 
Your going to be in straight grind mode the whole semester."
