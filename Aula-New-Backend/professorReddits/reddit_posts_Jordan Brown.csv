Former Cal QB Rodgers has gone insane,https://twitter.com/mattschneidman/status/1456669781382287361,2021-11-05 12:48:46,,"We can blame it on Butte College
brain like berkeley
Mf took dewormer üíÄ those concussions must be really getting to him
Why are all of our famous athlete alums terrible people. Kidd, Desean Jackson and now Rodgers
Former *Butte College QB
Hopefully his views on science are not representative of Cal.
And people say that Tedford was successful because the team's academics were awful ...
Wait, can anyone tell me what happened? I did some Google search and if he's truly allergic to some ingredients in the vaccine, and he did get tested every day, I don't see there's a problem?
If I sold myself to the NFL devil, I'd be insane myself.  Remember CTE?  Rogers is a prime example of this damage.
@PatMcAfeeShow Rodgers says he's in the ""crosshairs of the woke mob"" and references cancel culture.

""I didn't lie in the initial press conference.""

Says there was a ""witch hunt"" going on across the league about vaccination status.

It's his personal choice to take the vaccine or not. I don't understand why people are getting so riled up. But, I do agree the references to ""woke mob"" and ""cancel culture"" are pathetic.
Typical Berkeley, today‚Äôs rules don‚Äôt apply to me‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs just from an older class..
Damn, I went to Butte prior to Berkeley. So is my school‚Äôs rep just fucked either way here then?
>""I consulted a good friend of mine, Joe Rogan, and I've been doing a lot of the stuff he recommended in his podcast.""

hahaha
The inventors of said drug won a nobel prize for its use in humans and something like 1 billion plus doses have been administered, again, to humans.

Thats like saying people are taking dog anxiety medicine because dogs can be perscribed xanax, or gorilla painkillers because they have been known to take acetaminophen.

At least we got Jaylen Brown.
roughly 98% of students are fully vaccinated. The other 2% are not on campus or have some rare exemption https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/immunization/
And Joe Rogan is his source of medical advice? Want to weigh in on that one?
Even if the allergy thing is true, he was dishonest from the start.  Over the summer he said he was ""immunized"" and he used ambiguous statements to suggest (but not overtly state) that he had been vaccinated.  The team (or league?) also has a policy that all non-vaccinated players do postgame interviews with a mask; Rogers did all those interviews unmasked, potentially putting reporters and others in increased danger.  And now he's doubling down.  Instead of admitting he did anything wrong, he's lashing out at anyone who suggests he behaved improperly.
If everyone got the vaccine, we would be out of this pandemic fully and no one would have to wear masks.
It's not his personal choice, because his choice affects the health of those around him.  He walks around in close contact with others without a mask on (in violation of NFL rules).  His teammates should be super pissed at him for lying about it.
butte is chill, the internet is not
Yes, it‚Äôs a drug used to treat humans, but it is still a dewormer. It‚Äôs approved to treat parasites like roundworms and threadworms in humans, not viruses. Winning a Nobel prize doesn‚Äôt make it a magical cure-all.
Oh we for sure have some amazing pro alums too. It‚Äôs just disappointing we have people like Rodgers doing stuff like this
Well he was getting awfully close there for a bit before he turned it around. He was in a hit and run and had illegal firearms in his car when was in Buffalo.
And Alex Morgan
Does that percentage include the men's football team?
Right? If he'd stopped at the allergy part I'd be skeptical of his stance, but would keep an open mind to his position before I knew more. 

But saying you went to *Joe Rogan* for advice instead of doctors, then jumping in on calling neutral public health measures ""wokeness"" and consequences for not following public health measures as ""cancel culture"" just shows he's drunk some reaaaaaly strange coolaid and has terrible critical thinking skills. Fuck right off with that shit.

Edit: He also routinely doesn't wear a mask, including at interviews and a recent Halloween party right before he announced the positive COVID test. Broke rules, got infected, proved why the rules are there in the first place. So, yeah, there's a goddamn problem with his actions. See [this](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32545222/aaron-rodgers-tests-positive-covid-19-rules-unvaccinated-nfl-players-packers-qb-return-more).
Ok, but you know not everyone will get the vaccine due to health conditions or religious reasons.
Fair, but why are we getting so upset about what his decisions are?
Thats a strawman, I never said it was a magical cure-all. I didn't even imply that. But its pretty safe to assume Aaron Rodgers got perscribed it from a doctor, not a veterinarian.
and Cameron Jordan
It should. It also aligns with this [article](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/11/05/sharks-cal-football-breakthrough-covid-19-cases-bay-area-athletes/):
99% of players are vaccinated, but there are players that have tested positive.
It's funny since I'd wager a majority of those people talking BS about health conditions or religious reasons were all vaccinated as a kid, but it's only a problem for them *now* because COVID's become political and Democrats say you should get the vaccine so they automatically jump through any hoops to do the opposite so they can ""own the libs""
Because he lied about being immunized and now he keeps trying to legitimize his lies. Everything is fine, but he just can‚Äôt come clean.
The comment you initially replied to never mentions animals, you added that.

And the whole, ‚Äúbut his doctor prescribed it‚Äù line is a very weak argument. Doctors take one year of basic pharmacology in med school, they are in no way experts on off label uses of medications. The FDA, which is the authority on this and studies drugs deeply, has not approved Ivermectin as a COVID treatment. In fact, it has specifically warned against it. Rouge doctors are out there, but the off label prescription of medications, especially when specific warnings have been issues like this, is dangerous and is exactly the kind of behavior that could result in the loss of a medical license.
Joe Rogan a doctor now?? ü•¥
Uh, that‚Äôs the polar opposite of a strawman.

And unless Rodgers has parasites, that doctor had no business prescribing a drug that has not demonstrated reliable evidence of benefit - but there are idiots in medicine just like there are idiots in football.
Yeah he‚Äôs a class act, love him
Then the 20+ sidelined due to covid are 98% breakthrough? Yeeikes
All speculation
And how or why does this affect you to have such a strong opinion about it, even though I completely agree.
That is the meme though. Most corporate media refers to it as specifically horse dewormer.

Many countries around the world are using it in the fight against covid, to varying degrees of success. Obviously we need more research to be done.
Lol? I think he is a comedian and cage fighting comentator.
It affects us all when celebrities preach ignorance that is viewed by millions of people and, inevitably, inspires others to follow suit. Especially in a culture where athletes tend to be our children‚Äôs‚Äô role models.
Oh man, you‚Äôve really drunk the Fox News Kool Aid. The whole vague ‚Äúmany countries‚Äù are using it effectively and we need to study it is such a trope. Sure, go ahead and study it, but there currently isn‚Äôt a single clinical study that shows Ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID, which is the benchmark that we use to prescribe drugs. 

What we do know is that the vaccine is very effective in preventing COVID with very low risk.
I seriously doubt anyone's decision to definitely not get the vaccine is because of Rodgers. Additionally, an athlete can still be a child's role model even if one doesn't agree with all the decisions. Not everyone is perfect nor should you agree with everything that person does.
 ad hominem attacks are usually great ways to indicate that you are winning the debtate lol.
 Most of the countries in Africa, India, Japan, and more. All over the world and in countries with low vaccination rates. Its a very priviliged position to tell these countries that they should only rely on the vaccine, when their population might have little access.

And im not even saying to take it instead of getting vaccinated or without a perscription. And as I said, obviously it needs to be studied.
Lol okay
Show me any clinical study that shows that Ivermectin works as a COVID treatment.
[google is your friend](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33278625/) . Its not much, but its enough to warrent further research. Im not even claiming its appropriate for the majority of people lol, just odd to see such fierce opposition and politicization. Good luck to you though.


Also it unfortunately tests it alongside Doxycycline so its inconclusive.
It‚Äôs a small, inconclusive study from Bangladesh. This doesn‚Äôt provide any evidence that it works. Nobody is arguing against real studies being done, but you can‚Äôt draw any conclusions from this, nor does it justify the widespread prescribing we‚Äôre seeing in the US."
