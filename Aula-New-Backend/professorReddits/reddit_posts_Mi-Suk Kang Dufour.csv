Can the Public Health Department actually fix their enrollment?,https://i.redd.it/kxw0sokuq4gc1.jpeg,2024-02-02 00:07:37,"Stop giving hope by having ""open"" sections if you're going to cap the overall class. It literally doesn't make sense that there's like 3 open lab sections with more than 5 seats open for each, but the lecture has a waitlist, and even if you try to switch to the open one, you will still be waitlisted. Like that shit doesn't make any sense at all. For other departments, simply switching to an open section will get you off the waitlist. I understand that the teaching team needs to have a manageable workload, but there's a section with ONLY 18 people in it, and the cap is 30. Can someone actually explain the reasoning behind this in depth????

I really loved the class so far and did the labs early, did optional HW to study for midterms, even answered some questions on Ed. All for that to go to waste because of a questionable enrollment policy.","You are on the waitlist for the lecture here
I don't understand this. Say a class has room for 300 students (determined by phyiscal capacity of the lecture hall, say). The course has hired 6 GSIs, each GSI teaches 2 sections. Say each section can hold 30 students. Should the section sizes automatically be capped at 25 instead to ""align"" with the lecture? That wouldn't make any sense...
It's not separated like other classes. The class has a lab component and a lecture component combined
The funny thing is-- the lectures are online but the labs are in-person (but they made it non-mandatory). I just don't understand how much of a mindfuck this is because there is literally a section with 12 seats open, but the ""lecture"" itself has a waitlist. They even grade the waitlisted students so I don't realize the ""manageable workload"" reasoning here, seeing as this is a class that uses R and have autograder for most assignments, except for some that are writing questions. Even one of the GSIs were confused about this enrollment policy LOL
They grade waitlisted students because as people drop, those students will be enrolled in the course. The waitlist doesn't exist in perpetuity, as students realize they won't be able to enroll, they drop the class, and grading workload decreases. Everybody knows that total size of class at the start of the semester will be much greater than the actual size of the class for the bulk of the semester....
Right, that makes sense but the fact that my waitlist position hasn't changed since I enrolled in the class even with all those open seats is crazy to me. I even unenrolled from the class and joined the open section (as instructed on Ed once the seats have been published to non-majors). I got in the waitlist again after that with the same position I was in. I thought it was just an error or a delay in processing so I waited for 2 days, but I'm still not in. And hence why I got that response that doesn't make any sense to me."
PBH 142 advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s9vhwi/pbh_142_advice/,2022-01-21 21:51:14,Could anyone who took this class before (with Kang Dufour) give insight into how hard exams are? I’m a bit nervous after we started learning coding hahahah,"I took it the summer 2020, so maybe it was a little easier compared to now, but from my experience the first and third parts of the course is more “coding” focused, in R,  while the second part of the course is more “stat” focused. Doing the hw and labs early will make the first and third parts easy. The “coding” is pretty straight forward since ur just making graphs, plots, etc. Because the second portion is heavy on the stats side, if u give yourself enough time to understand the statistical concepts, u should be good.
Thank you so much"
