"Julia Elkin, struck by driver in Berkeley, died Monday night. Julia was 37 years old. She had a deep passion for making communities more resilient to climate change.",https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/2024/02/27/traffic-safety/berkeley-resident-julia-elkin-traffic-fatality/,2024-02-27 12:46:42,,">The nurse asked the driver if she was OK and urged her to take a seat. But the woman just stood there. Looking at Elkin, who had come to rest face down on the ground 10-15 feet from the intersection, the driver said quietly, ""I did that.""

Important to remember that every single person driving a car is just one ""small"" slip-up away from becoming a killer, and that will haunt you for the rest of your life. You are a good and safe driver...until you're not. Keep that in mind when you're driving and your phone buzzes in your pocket, or you're approaching a stop sign and thinking of rolling through because you don't see anyone around. *Just one bad decision* is all it takes.

Also, the article tries to frame this death as somehow being caused by the design of Marin, but this ignores the larger systemic issue. The problem is not confined to Marin, or even to Berkeley as a whole. The problem (which most news outlets don't have the courage to address plainly) is that Bay Area drivers have universally become sloppier, more reckless, and more violent since the pandemic. I bike to work and there is one particular intersection near Ashby BART where drivers run the red light EVERY SINGLE TIME. And not just ""barely missed it"", I'm talking a few seconds after it turned red. And the number of drivers I see from my vantage point on the bike with phone in hand, eyes darting up and down from the road every 2 seconds, is frankly shocking. We stopped enforcing traffic laws, and as a result drivers *do not give a fuck*. The number one thing we can do to stop these killings is to bring back widespread traffic enforcement, forcing drivers to rein in their horrible sociopathic behavior.
Really sad... this lady worked with my sister.
Marin avenue, at a bare minimum, needs to be reconfigured so that it is physically impossible to come barreling down the hill; if the city doesn't make it one-way all the way uphill, you should be forced to make a turn if you approach an intersection heading downhill.
As someone who rides a bike in berkeley, the drivers need to be more careful. The amount of times I’ve almost been hit by a negligent car driver is insane. Pulling out of parked spots without looking, running a stop sign, running a red light, squeezing me into the edge of the road… that being said, I do appreciate all the good drivers and let them know I’m grateful with a head nod. Always look for the head nod, we consider it as the utmost sign of respec for keeping us safe
If you walk or bike in Berkeley please assume no one will stop for you even when it's your right of way. Only pass once you've made eye contact and they've stopped. Otherwise there is a decent chance that you'll get hit. The drivers here are really bad. Lots of old people, lots of just bad drivers, lots of reckless drivers who don't care, and lots of entitled people who will break the rules but get mad at you if you break them. Please be careful, Berkeley can be a toxic mix of the above and that makes it dangerous for the average normal person.

many many people have been killed on Marin because it is a highway through a neighborhood. Drivers share responcibility with traffic engineers that prioritize average speed over lives. 

One lane each way, 15 MPH, bulbouts, raised crosswalks, lights, signs, etc.
The lack of actual stops in Berkeley is disgusting
It’s a total failure of our society that the elderly really have no choice but to drive or starve/have no social life. You’re absolutely right, they shouldn’t be on the road but what choice to people have?
US public transit might be shit, but Bay Area public transit is objectively very good and in places even world class! If you want to get around via public transit around here you absolutely can! I do.

Let's not mince worlds - the Bay has been and still is investing ungodly amounts of money into public transit and despite our endless complaining it's actually pretty damned good, if we're honest. I've lived in many places around the world where people say they have ""incredible transit"". And the Bay Area stacks up extremely well against those places. BART specifically is a marvel of engineering that most visitors from places with ""good transit"" can't get enough of. Our busses are numerous and frequent for the areas they serve. Muni has absolutely insane coverage that no European city has. 

The only real problem is that we perceive transit as something that's a throwaway or a social service exclusively for the super-poor. And apparently we don't respect the super-poor very much because we let our transit be filthy and dangerous.
do it for ashby too
No no no, clearly the answer is just MORE COPS!!!
I'd argue that in Berkeley, it is the older folks and elderly who are the biggest opponents of making any changes to road usage (i.e., the bike lane fiasco on hopkins where parking spaces were suggested for removal at a the site of prior  accidents/fatalities involving cars + pedestrians / bicyclists). Their position is that removing parking threatens the elderly and disabled, ADUs can't be built in the hills because more people = hard to evacuate (I don't understand how they can make this argument when they fill their garages with shit and then park their multiple cars haphazardly on the sidewalks, blocking traffic flow for 1 and 2-way traffic and forcing pedestrians into the road..). I just can't with them. They've backed themselves into this corner and we all, including them, suffer because of their lack of imagination and unwillingness to evolve.
[deleted]
Tell me how easy it is for an elderly person to do their shopping via public transit when they live in the Berkeley hills.    The bus system stinks
Sometimes the answer is just more cops. Not always. I'd even say rarely. But in our case - yeah, we have a shortage of cops and we are not serious about enforcing the rules of the road. Everyone knows that unless you murder someone with your car you're probably not going to get in trouble.

So why would anyone follow the rules and drive safely if there are zero penalties for not doing it? Seriously, how do you think we can convince people to drive safely if there's no tickets and no cops?
One of the most eye-opening things I remember about living in Madrid as an American study abroad student many years ago was how many elderly people were just out and about, living their lives, seeing friends, and taking the bus/metro wherever they wanted."

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There’s a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don’t do that. While I’ve visited many times, I’ve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It’s mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we’ll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you’ll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it’s remarkable how many people I know who haven’t ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley’s best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won’t be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you’ll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don’t think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you’ve ever taken the 51B down University though, you’ll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I’ll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>• Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>• Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>• Visit the Little Farm (it’s a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>• Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris’ favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There’s also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you’re here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you’re there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven’t ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha’s hand. Don’t get cherimoya fruit though—I accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can’t even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it’s the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area’s fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don’t think their parties are exclusive? I’ve never asked. It’s a tradition though, and they’d probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn’t substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you’ll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there’s no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it’s a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn’t stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they’d let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn’t interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they’re much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it’s surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day’s moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you’re further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you’re trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn’t need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer’s markets** *You’ve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There’s a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine’s Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you’re looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley’s indie bookstores:*

>• Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>• Moe’s  *If you’re looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there’s also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>• Pegasus  
>  
>• Mrs. Dalloway’s  
>  
>• Half-Price Books  
>  
>• Eastwind Books

* **Stop into a store you’ve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they’ve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you’re closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I’m going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn’t a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the “Hell Summer” that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, “the poetry reading is out of control,” uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here’s*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I’d begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It’s hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it’s now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it’s good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There’s a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber’s Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he’s inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can’t walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I’m unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you’re looking for something wholesome, this Cal student’s** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it’s so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don’t exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he’s accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country’s history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it’s spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it’s haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don’t need to listen closely.*
* Oakland—Mountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some… mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it’s worth the trip. It’s a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can’t believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they’re filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It’s gothic, but it’s also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany—Albany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I’ve ever taken--I’ve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you’re willing to do a little bit of exploration. There’s a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It’s a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany—TEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland—Lake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There’s a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children’s Playland.*
* Oakland—[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I’m mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland—Jack London Square *I’d sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you’re into that. There’s also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London’s Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There’s also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don’t be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You’ll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill
* [Mark’s Yard Art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mark-oliviers-yard-art)
* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you’re lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There’s a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren’t an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire’s before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it’s near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I’d call it romantic.)","I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:

Check out the archives and the Bancroft Library. There's a bunch of really cool old and rare books and a lot of Cal related historical documents. You can't check anything out of the building though, you can only look at it in the reading room.
To add onto the bit about fire trails:

This section in particular (starts from the stadium, goes up to Grizzly Peak) is my absolute favorite hike in the entire area. It's a pretty steep climb but if you're a good hiker or runner then it should be very doable. 6ish miles roundtrip. When you get up into the hills you can see a huge chunk of the East Bay and into SF - and then you realize how small Berkeley is compared to the rest of the world. It's also a great place to meditate.

Walking across the Golden Gate, and looking at Berkeley/Campanile tower is an amazing perspective! Then go up the tower, and look back at the Golden Gate.
1) stay up all night watching stars at Fire Trails contemplating just how big the universe is

2) storm the field after a Big Game victory


3) eat a Top Dog after a long day of classes. As you order, think about how you’re standing right where Steve Wozniak would have ordered his first Top Dog. Don’t think too long, or the cashier/chef might yell at you 

4) Build something cool. Even if it’s stupid and you’re the only one that will ever appreciate it. It’s worth it
The pier trespassing is dangerous... Could end up with someone dying. I don't recommend.
You know, I feel like I'd appreciate this a lot more if I wasn't stuck at home for my last semester :( 

great list, though, and maybe I'll just have to come back after I graduate...
Find someone who has a code to the Essex Baths.

See a concert at the redwood grove

Meditate at the Berkeley zen center (can combine with a trip to Berkeley bowl)

Attend the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary Easter celebration hosted by the Nuns of perpetual indulgence.

Find the concrete slide in the Castro. Take a walking tour while you're at it.

Swim at the hearst women's gym pool at least once - it's covered in marble and old statues, and has a great view of the campus.

Catch the art students' semesterly print sale days. Extremely cheap awesome art.

Speaking of art, you can check out a priceless piece from the University - and switch it out every once in a while for something new.

Not quite Berkeley specific, but gaze at the stars while taking a late-night cliffside swim at the Esalen center.

Go go Land's End. It's beautiful.

Take advantage of the SF museums. They're fantastic. They also do free days every so often, if you don't want to pay ridiculous admission fees. Just get there early.

Children's Fairyland is not creepy! It's cute, and it's over 70 years old, which is cool. Rumor has it that it inspired Walt Disney when he was planning Disneyland.
A must do for any EECS undergraduate

Spend an all nighter in the depths of Soda Hall working on cs project due the next day
Wow I grew up in Berkeley and gotta say you've hit practically every spot I can think of! I personally also enjoy Panoramic Way as a walk up to a nice view, and would add Point Isabel to the list of places to visit if you're into dogs.

Really enjoyed reading this and extra thanks for sharing the 1999 blog
It's a very minor point, but ""find a strange fruit"" might be better worded ""find rare fruit"" or ""find unusual fruit"".
this is very helpful for people who havent visited campus yet cuz of covid, thanks!
Watch a football game from T1GHTWAD HILL!
Thanks for these excellent suggestions! I just checked out *American Heiress* on your recommendation. As an undergrad, my friend John used to live in that apartment - I think he said they still had bullet holes in the wall.
Adding on:

\- Read a book in Morrison Library

\- Visit Cheeseboard Pizza at least once (but probably 100+ times).

\- Get sushi at Kirala

\- Take BART to SF on a free weekday and explore the city, visit the de Young or Legion of Honor, get lunch, go to Blue Bottle Coffee at the Mint

\- Visit the Old Rose Garden at the Botanical Garden in May -- all the roses are in bloom and it is stunning

\- Swim at Strawberry Canyon pool in spring/summer

\- Visit a coffee shop so many times that the staff know you

\- Take grad pictures around campus; cliche, but as an alum, I LOVE having these
As a 2020 transfer, this is very sad. Hopefully I can stay in the area after graduating and doing some of these next year.
22. Not get rejected

~ An applicant preemptively crying over my rejection this thursday
Should have included attend the Big Game!
Underground steam tunnels should be there too
Mostly food related—

Get some food from the Buddhist temple in South Berkeley, Vik’s Chaat, Ethiopian food (Addis; might be in Oakland).  

Tilden—play golf/whack a bucket of balls at the driving range.  It’s a pretty course and the three-tier driving range is pretty cool.

Bike the bike trail along 580 to Richmond and check out the Rosie the Riveter installation.  If you are lucky, a park ranger will be present to answer questions.

Ride your bike around town at night.  It’s fun!

Frolf.

Do the sake tour (if it’s open).

Berkeley Bowl—best grocery store EVER.  Get the Odoriko tomatoes if they have them.

Kirala—chawan mushi is like an ocean French kiss.
This is the coolest post ever, thank you

For now, I've got one that you probably know too well by now:

Your home. 


Stay home, please? 
We need this thing to go away.
Hey, I love you and this post
This is so beautiful. Tysm <3
god i miss trawling through urban ore on a sunny day 

the south berkeley farmer's market is also amazing too and if u have calfresh u can get $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce!!!
While you're at the Rose Garden, go through the tunnel by the tennis courts to Cordonices Park and ride down the concrete slide on a piece of cardboard. There are usually a few pieces lying at the bottom. (Do not attempt sans cardboard.)

You should add in some stuff in San Francisco since it's easily accessible to us. Great list for Berkeley though- both the campus and the wider city.
Have ramen at Marufuku in Japantown :D
this is late but what’s wrong with cherimoya?
This is one of the best posts I've seen on things to do, ever. Thank you stranger! Making me reminisce on so many positive memories of Berkeley + the Bay area. Truly unlimited things to do. I feel so thankful. If I do even teeny fraction of these things, I will be happy<3
Isn't Bancroft closed to people without special access? I tried going in during 2019 but they didn't let me :(

Will add to check out all the Berkeley libraries, Doe itself has at least 4 smaller libraries within it.
I adore that trail, but good god that one slope midway though is terrifying
hope you'll be able to visit someday; most of these things will probably be here once you do (: and I hope your last semester goes as well as it can!
the heart women's gym/pool is a fascinating and beautiful old building!! i had no idea it existed until i took a final in there lol
the man's had a glorious career, there is no doubt! didn't know about his involvement in UC directly though (beyond the work in Claremont), most of my knowledge only goes as far back as John Galen Howard. very cool!
children's fairyland was my childhood. no disney could ever attempt the beauty of that place tbh.
not just a rumor, that's a fact! and I should have corrected that by now haha my Oakland neighbor who reads my newsletters said the same. unfortunately I can only speak from my experience walking around it when it's closed due to covid, and that's a bit eerie. always wanted to go inside, maybe someday /:
That place is terrifying and it made me scared as shit of puppets. So I have to disagree with you
Previously WEB. Previously 260 Evans.
I hate that I did this, but also glad I did for the experience lmao. CS projects and all-nighters mix well together
updated; is ""strange fruit"" used as a euphemism on the regular? I haven't ever heard it outside of the context of the song
Because of the association with the protest / anti-lynching song?
oh whoa that's wild!! cool that they preserved the history, but also kind of disturbing, but also I'd totally pay to set foot inside and see (': and I hope that you like American Heiress! Toobin is fairly well-respected, but it's clear that he's got a certain angle and sometimes the way that he editorialized to that was annoying.  Kind of reminded me of listening to Serial honestly--good storytelling and the character of the people really comes through, but you also have to wonder what they're leaving out. I'd love to read Patricia Hearst's memoir if I ever come across it!
I also recently learned that Morrison Library loans out original artworks to students! If I were a student again I would definitely take advantage of this.
Wait how do you find these?
many of these are fine to visit in a mask, I think we all agree that we need this to go away but depriving your life of all pleasure until then is not the way to go about it
it was $11 for one fruit lol
Haha yeah - I remember the first time I went there and tried to run up it. Even to this day I still remember how difficult that was!
It's a commonly understood phrase, yes. The song was capturing a phrase used at the time, and it is used sometimes now.
Because of its association with lynching, of which that song is part. The phrase exists beyond the song.

For anyone who has not heard this Billie Holiday classic.
I'll be relieved if Toobin doesn't hypnotize me into jerking off in public.

Look for the steam
oh lol I didn’t see the word “accidentally” until now
Indeed it does. Even beyond that historical meaning. The context OP provided rendered it harmless.
As an art historian I agree with your comment completely! Glad that you were not charged. Out of curiosity, what was the work?
I totally understand your position, I didn't think it was malicious by OP"
