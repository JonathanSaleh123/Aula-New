Has anyone taken a class with professor Brad Delong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/esfo7x/has_anyone_taken_a_class_with_professor_brad/,2020-01-22 10:03:16,"He seems to be pretty knowledgeable and his lecture was funny, but I am reading polar opposite things online. Could anyone give me any insights about him or his class?","People do seem to polarize between ""lively and informative"" and ""disorganized and digressive""..."
Anyone in ECON135?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10pmr7v/anyone_in_econ135/,2023-01-30 19:20:48,"Can anyone in ECON135/Previously taken ECON135 with Brad Delong tell me do I have to do the reading? I am very confusing about the course rn since the lecture is very lack of focus and the reading is so long that make it almost impossible to complete (\~200 pages/week??), I wonder how can I do well in the course? what does midterm/final exam looks like? Is grading generous? As Berkeleytime shows?

Thanks!","I took 115 with him and you absolutely had to do the reading. Fwiw, he gets easier the longer you stick with him. Id also recommend something like natural readers or similar app that can just podcast the reading for you. Good luck!
Thanks! What's the exam looks like? Is it the Multiple choice/short reponses...etc.?
The one i took was multiple choice and purposely extremely hard, but fortunately he made it a very small amount of the grade. Idk what 135 would be though, i imagine it would be a bit more quantitative - hopefully someone else chimes in here"
Should I take History 160 or Econ 115?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/do0dvx/should_i_take_history_160_or_econ_115/,2019-10-27 15:46:02,"I can take either class for polecon and I could use some advice. Brad DeLong is teaching 115 next semester. Should I avoid him by taking History 160? 160 is being taught by Christoph Hermann, who usually teaches in the sociology department I think.",Have only had Hermann in sociology courses (took his economic sociology and sociology of work courses) and it was fine.
