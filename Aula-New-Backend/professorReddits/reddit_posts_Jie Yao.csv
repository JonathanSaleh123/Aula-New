Mat Sci 45 without the Lab,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/161zr26/mat_sci_45_without_the_lab/,2023-08-26 09:30:17,"Hi! I wanted to ask if anyone has taken Mat Sci 45 without the lab with Jie Yao, since he is teaching the subject this semester, and how it went for you. Thank you!

Also if anyone is in Mat Sci 45 this semester do you guys want to make a discord?","It was absolutely terrible, prepare to suffer
He is a very very boring lecturer.... I almost fell asleep like everyday. I thought mat sci would be an interesting subject and I was excited to take the class but fr he has ruined it for me. His tests are pretty difficult and were much more complicated than the homework or lectures so make sure to strategize. They're also very long for the short time period so bring a watch and skip questions if you need to. Bring a calculator and write as much random stuff to get partial credit as well. Try to find a partner to do the homework with because they are tedious and require a lot of textbook reading (they did for me at least). I believe last semester (when I took the class) was his first time teaching the course so maybe your experience will be better! Good luck !!
How would you say would be the best way to study and prepare for his midterms and finals? Also were his finals structured the same as his midterms? Thanks
He lets you have a one sided cheat sheet on the exams so your best bet is reviewing everything and cramming it onto that sheet! His midterms and finals are structured basically the same, just final is longer and he allows i think 3 cheat sheets or something."
Taking Math 1A + MSE 45 freshman year,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14o1423/taking_math_1a_mse_45_freshman_year/,2023-07-01 10:48:11,"Hi! ME major here, was wondering if the combined workload of both would kill me this semester? Ive taken Calc AB/BC and ended with B’s for both courses during my HS time. I got passed the AP Chem test sophomore year. Im part of the prep program this summer and will be reviewing chem as a result. I enjoy chem but Im worried about workload between MSE 45 and Math 1A being too much? Ik ill have to be spending more time on Math 1A studying and have read online MSE 45 is plug n chug..idk last time someone told me that, a class was very not that way? Im thinking of taking it with no lab too. 

Thanks","Ur chilling, it’ll be fairly low workload
Just a forewarning, MSE 45’s professor wasn’t that great last semester, and you basically need to learn how to all the homework from the textbook.
is the professor’s name: jie yao?
thats the professor teaching mse 45 for fall 2023
RIP, he was not good. His slides won’t be much help with homework problems so the textbook will be your best friend. He was also very late at grading homework. One of our homework assignment’s grade was released AFTER the final exam, so we didn’t know what we did wrong and how to do that type of problem and it ended up being on the final.
o….okay good to know. was everyone suffering
yeah pretty much. For clarity, I scored 52% on the final, and got a 65% as my total grade percentage, but it curved to a B in the end."
First semester courses for aerospace engineering transfer student,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1di1mv7/first_semester_courses_for_aerospace_engineering/,2024-06-17 09:00:47,"What do you guys think of this schedule for the upcoming fall for a transfer aerospace engineering student? The only thing I am a bit worried about is Friday with the back to back classes but I believe public health and aerospace engineering 1 should be relative easy and relaxing. I also heard there's Berkeley time so classes don't really start till 10 min after their proposed time. 

Are there other upper division H/SS classes that are easy so i can fulfill the two upper division H/SS requirements? Thanks in advance!
