"rate my schedule, advice/insights",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/192wjen/rate_my_schedule_adviceinsights/,2024-01-09 17:58:04,"hi! i am a freshman (2027) pre-med taking these classes and would like to know if this schedule is feasible, if you have any advice for the courses, or if you have reviews on the professors. please let me know!

* CHEM 3A - Peter Marsden
* Theater 25AC - Angela Marino
* BIO 1B -  John P Huelsenbeck, Michal Ilana Shuldman, Benjamin Wong Blonder, Benjamin K Blackman
* R1A
* Decal","This is a reasonable schedule in my opinion! Marsden has optional HW (you would still want to do it because the HW mirrors the exam) but if you don't feel like doing it you'd always have the flexibility!

BIO 1B is not set up like a weeder class compared to BIO 1A, but it is still a difficult class because of the memorization. The labs are fully done in-lab, so there's no lab report or anything like that due after class.

I haven't taken the rest but this seems very reasonable
Marsden is the best professorv
OMG! THR 25AC is going to be an absolute blast! I had a different professor for that class, but I had Angela for THR 119 and she is the absolute best! Sheâ€™s really understanding about mental health, time conflicts, etc and just wants to encourage discussion :) Of course THR 25AC tends to be a bit bigger than the upper divs, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll be the same in terms of vibes :) Hope you have a great time with her!
hi! no advice but i wanted to say im also taking similar classes w bio 1b:) also pre med! we got this fr
Marsden is amazing! Have fun
The only note is that I believe the BIO 1B and CHEM 3A finals are usually back to back on the same day, but if youâ€™re alright with that, then it looks good!
thank you so much!
what were your thoughts with THTR 119?
yes yes!!!
My class experience was a bit interesting for THR 119. Because of the events in October, our class discussions turned away from actual reading material. A lot of my friends in the class disliked it, but I previously felt like she made a safe space in the class and it was very nice to be able to talk about whatever. The only bad thing is she randomly drops assignments on you. Our final felt like it came out of nowhere. However, I had a lot of fun in the class :)"
Niren Murthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11qtzli/niren_murthy/,2023-03-13 19:26:18,"I do not like. I do not enjoy. In fact, I despise. Niren Murthy. You cannot teach. You get so much wrong. Your lecture ends and Iâ€™ve learned nothing. Itâ€™s not me, itâ€™s you. Worst of all, I think you think youâ€™re doing a good job. You have not deterred my passion for biology. Instead, you have only made me realize how easy it must be to have a decent h-indexâ€”you donâ€™t even need to understand the material, you just need to make friends in research and project confidence! 

Goodbye and good riddance. By the way, I recommend you review The principles of organic chemistry. Your colleague, Dr. Marsden does a great job explaining if you need additional resources.

Hello Dr. John DueberðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜©. We have been waiting for you.","awful professor but I don't despise him.  Hoping dueber is better.
Literally true. Murthy useless, BIOE 11 high key useless class. If the stupid department didnâ€™t mandate it, people would just take CHEM 3B
fax. Murthy just says a bunch of unrelated shit and acts all esteemed. Iâ€™ve heard him fuck up the most basic ochem shit itâ€™s just embarrassing. I donâ€™t know why we have to learn from someone who A) doesnâ€™t want to be there//doesnâ€™t work hard at teaching and B) fails so badly at his job that like 80% of kids donâ€™t go to his class. 

Iâ€™m ngl, I could have aced his midterms after studying for three days and never watching a lecture. Such a fucking waste of my time."
