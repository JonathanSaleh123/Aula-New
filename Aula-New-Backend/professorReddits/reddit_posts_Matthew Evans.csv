How many courses do you recommend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14wf174/how_many_courses_do_you_recommend/,2023-07-10 20:06:55,"Hello, I am an incoming freshmen and am currently taking two courses during the summer session.

This is my planned fall semester courses! Since I am an international student, I have to take min 13 credits. Should I take more courses? Is this okay?

Thank you
