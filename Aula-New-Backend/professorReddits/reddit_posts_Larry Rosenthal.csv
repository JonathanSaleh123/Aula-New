Pub pol 101 w/ Larry A rosenthal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/107qk16/pub_pol_101_w_larry_a_rosenthal/,2023-01-09 13:25:55,"I’m taking data 140 this semester which I’ve heard is a really hard class with a pretty heavy workload. I need to take Pub Pol 101 for my other major (Media Studies), but I want to make sure this class in manageable with data 140. So I was wondering if anybody knew the typical workload for this class and how this class typically structured.","The class is not challenging at all. Most of the workload in the class is this group project where you write a policy proposal over the course of two months, but that is pretty managable. The class is a little weird at first because thinking as a policy analyst was new to me, but I got the hang of it. I would say its like a 6/10 for difficulty.
Thank you so much for your reply! Did you take it with Rosenthal? If so, how did you like him?"
