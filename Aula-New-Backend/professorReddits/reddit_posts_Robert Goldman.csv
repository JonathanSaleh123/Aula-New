America is on Strike | Robert Reich has been the Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley since January 2006.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZqEL1_E2OY,2021-10-23 07:58:34,,**RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AS A % OF PURCHASING POWER** ***NOT*** **AS A DEFINITVE QUANTITY #.

"On Friday, UC Berkeley professor of Sanskrit Robert Goldman and his team celebrated the upcoming publication of the final book of a multi-decade research project — the translation of the about 50,000-line Sanskrit epic poem ""Valmiki Ramayana"" into English. The poem is 3,000 years old.",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/11/20/uc-berkeley-researchers-complete-decades-long-translation-project/,2016-11-20 23:49:48,,"This is the most famous Hindu epic, every Indian child knows it and most of the (PG parts, anyway) story. Very exciting story. 

One of the core ideas, to me, is that everyone, including the most supreme gods, have their fatal flaws and personality weaknesses, and even the evilest demons have their good sides. Another one is that often in life there is no clear moral choice, and making the right choice seems impossible, even to a god, which brings up the question of what it means to be a moral person at all.

Featuring: 

- a jealous queen that gets the king-to-be, Rama, exiled from his city (turns out: Rama is the incarnation of one of the 3 supreme gods Vishnu), so her own son would be crowned king

- a demon disgusing himself as a deer in an incredibly clever plot to kidnap Sita, Rama's wife

- the demon Ravana taking Sita to his island kingdom fortress of Lanka (Sri Lanka)

- how does Rama cross? He gets his army of monkeys to build a bridge of stones all the way from India to Lanka

- an incredible and lengthy battle between Rama and Ravana, including Ravana's brother Kumbakarna, who only wakes up every 3 months and then eats everything in sight, and Hanuman, a monkey god (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman), lifting an entire mountain on his back all the way to the battleground because he couldn't find the herb he needed

- Rama crowned king but the people of his city think his wife is impure (since Ravana kidnapped her), so by public opinion Rama is forced to exile his own wife. (being a good governor vs being a good person question here, Rama knew Sita was pure)

Leaving out a ton of exciting details. Any translation should be fine [although Goldman's one is sure to be interesting!] (https://www.amazon.com/Ramayana-Shortened-Version-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039679), but I do like illustrated versions (https://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Ramayana-Children-India-Epic/dp/8184682425) as well.

If you're looking for a story with more philosophical questions about good vs. evil, morality, and justice, check out the Mahabharata, an even more epic tale. At one point the ""good guys"" gamble away their wife during a dice game. This is where the famous Bhagvad Gita comes from, which is where Krishna and Arjuna talk about the justness of war.

Stoked on it.
If every  Indian  kid knows the story  then what did Goldman do that is new?
Agreed, but 100A is not going to teach you how to read the Ramayana; learning Sanskrit takes a looong time, and lots of dedication.
So this poem is incredibly long. Not as long as the Mahabharata, which is 200k lines and I think the largest epic ever written, but 50,000 lines is very sizeable. For comparison, the Odyssey is at 12k lines. Originally mostly passed down through oral tradition, it's easy to see how details would get changed through the generations.

And since it's so old there've been many variants, pages that were lost and later rediscovered, and numerous translations from Sanskrit to other languages throughout the years. It seems like this is the first direct translation from the original Sanskrit, of the entirety of the Ramayana (however much historians have discovered thus far), so I guess current translations either are missing large sections and/or are unfaithfully translated. He says

>While other translations of the text exist, Goldman and his team are the first to translate the critical edition. According to Sally Sutherland Goldman, a co-translator of the last three books and the associated editor, the critical text is most likely current academics’ best approximation of the earliest version of the poem.

>Goldman said that as the poem was passed down orally before being written down, many variations became prevalent. The critical text attempts to remove such alterations.
oh absolutely, i meant more that the course gives you an idea of complex the language is and why it is so difficult to do translations of the longer, older works"

If anyone (or someone you know) has a copy they be willing to part with I’ll happily pay you for them, or, if you know places online where folks sell old readers that would also be helpful information. Basically, I’m super fucking sad and annoyed I lost these giant ass binders of all these amazing texts and translations that are stupid hard to get a hold of.",

Robert Reich was the Secretary of Labor under Clinton, and Lanhee Chen was the policy director for Romney. So they have immense amounts of real-world experience. Not sure why you think they're career-academics. "
