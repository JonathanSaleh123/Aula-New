If this is serious: that professor doesn‚Äôt understand what education or happiness is.

If it‚Äôs a joke: good parody of Berkeley STEM professors.
Omg what class is this
not me reading this, thinking ‚Äúthis cant be real‚Äù, and then finding out im in the class and seeing that it is, in fact, real.
This is a journalism class lmao it‚Äôs obviously a joke
If its not a joke, I would urge you to actually reach out to whoever oversees the department. They can't be really this tone deaf cuz....
At least they‚Äôre hypothetically sunning themselves and not mooning ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Who the hell hangs out in dwinelle plaza
Nah prof is trolling. Drop their name and pronouns
No. You should send this screenshot to the dean. This is stupid.
Pretty sure it's just a joke chill lol, I'm sure they would have gotten in trouble for it or had it reviewed by someone in the department beforehand.
I had a professor back in 2014 do this to force people to drop the class because of how large the wait-list was. He walked back everything on the second lecture once enrollment dropped to reasonable levels.  Don't know if this is troll or not. The problem was the budget for the class was nonexistent.
what the fuck, this sounds like something the prof should get in trouble for. maybe contact the Student Advocate‚Äôs Office. This is super messed up
why is it just her
I took Drummond's San Quentin prison class and he was the nicest most chill professor I've had at Cal lol
If this is a joke, it's in poor taste- I've also never seen a joke that long before. 

If it's not a joke, it sounds like someone needs to be reported to the dean of students, who regularly peruses this sub.

In either situation, this is not appropriate in a syllabus. No professor should even imply that they will secretly police your free time outside of class nor should they insist that this needs to be ""your #1 priority."" Even joking about that at a school like Cal is going to rile up your students and drive some of them to risk their mental and physical health to be the professor's personal trained seal. 

If you get a bad vibe on he first day of class, drop that class as fast as you can.
Most considerate and compassionate Berkeley prof
Bro name the class
Wtf is this?? Please report this sad excuse of a man. Is anyone noticing his complete emphasis on females ‚Äúsunning‚Äù on campus?
Professor's namd is William Drummond
Well, I guess it will help weed out all the people who aren't narcissists or sociopaths or those willing to live in a world dominated and run by narcissists and sociopaths.
Just sent an email and complained to the dean about this Professor ü§†
Pretty sure it‚Äôs just a joke (although in very poor taste) and as another person already said here this is probably just a way to g we students from over enrolling in the class. This could also be a social experiment.
Sanest professor at Cal
the section literally says ""capital offenses,"" it's an obvious joke. I suggest removing the sticks from your asses everyone.
That can‚Äôt be real.
i‚Äôd choose a backup still show up and get ready to drop if he is off his rocker like this fr
What an annoying menace
 journalism professor trying to make his class relevant LMAO
Gives professors a bad name.
Wtf
Sent you a DM!
The uneducated think that the sun revolves around the earth and the educated think that the world revolves around them.
Seems about right for a Berkeley class. Fall semester hasn't even started yet and I've already had to turn in an assignment for one of my courses.
No, this is not normal. This is psychotic. 

Name and shame.
drop the class
This is genius form the prof. A section called ‚Äúcapital offences‚Äù clearly isn‚Äôt serious, esp if you actually read the rest of the syllabus. Even if you are a bit slow you might email the prof and quickly get it clarified. But if you especially inept, you‚Äôll get scared and drop the class and freak out, this sparing everyone else in the class so that someone on the waitlist with critical thinking abilities can join instead
Seems reasonable

This ain't summer camp, people. It's the greatest university on the planet.
This feels super fake because OP isn‚Äôt willing to say which class this is for.
CAPITAL OFFENSES
them suddenly became her. odd?
This can't be real. If so, that prof sounds like a fucking maniac.
They clearly haven't seen the nonsense that goes on at high schools these days and how they hand wave any disciplinary actions that should be taken and instead send troublemakers back to class.
I wish it was and theres more to this

William Drummond, Journalism 100
The dean of students actually checks this sub regularly- please name and shame.
For real!!!
Journalism 100
LMFAO YEA IM OUT
Which class!!!
It has to be a joke, right?
Check back in 1974
I eat there sometimes.
William Drummond, he series
underrated comment
I would assume so, but theres more like this on the syllabus that makes me wonder if its a joke
Ngl this is probably what Drummond is doing
Cuz girls are def lazier than boys according to this prof /s
lots of people who write professionally seem to think that its better to replace the generic ""he"" with the generic ""she"" instead of just saying ""they,"" unnecessarily gendering their writing.
I think like 80% of the people who take J100 are women, I took that class and there were like 2 guys. That‚Äôs prob why, at least to give him the benefit of the doubt
Don‚Äôt know why this is getting downvoted. As someone who has taught, the syllabus is supposed to outline the course and various policies. It‚Äôs not supposed to have joke policies because that undermines the very point of the syllabus. If the instructor wanted to make this joke in class or something, it would still be a lame joke but a different issue at least.
got you, Journalism 100 with William Drummond
yup! class is Journalism 100
This is the Berkeley sub. Not the most socially intelligent people. Instead they‚Äôre hunting down this professor and trying to get him fired
LMFAO FR
William Drummond
They said who the professor and class was multiple times in the comments?? Lol read the thread before commenting bro
Go on
A Freshman level journalism class? Really?
What a horse's ass.
Edit his Wikipedia page. ;)

I would think but theres more like this on the syllabus
Do you sun yourself there?
Who jokes like this on a syllabus though? Like‚Ä¶ if it were an announcement, I‚Äôd get throwing in some jokes but the legit syllabus?! This is firm mental.
Why don‚Äôt you just email and ask them directly, probably the only way you‚Äôll have your question answered correctly.
It‚Äôs a journalism course. How fast can he really crank up that conveyer belt?
sure! here it is word for word: 

If you don‚Äôt plan to work harder than you ever have, you don‚Äôt belong here.  My   
advice is ‚ÄúSal, s√≠ puedes.‚Äù (A Spanish saying meaning, ‚ÄúGet out if you can.‚Äù) We   
have a long waiting list of students ready to take your place. 

&#x200B;

This class should be the number-one priority in your life.  You must be willing to   
put aside other pursuits, obligations, commitments and relationships, especially   
relationships, for the next 16 weeks.

&#x200B;

If your sister or brother plans to get married, please tell the sibling to hold off until   
this semester is completed.  Attendance at a wedding is NOT grounds for missing   
an assignment or a class.
no?? the [20hrs/wk meme](https://imgur.com/O4ShtpG) by Sahai (EECS) is the OG version of this shit
Nah he‚Äôs fully being serious, he‚Äôs had hella issues with misconduct in the past LOL
NO WAY LMAOOO I TOOK HIS CLASS IN THE FALL
Maybe its intended to weed people out? It just seems so cartoonish. If the guy is serious, he's a complete joke of a human being,  Any prof doing this has his/her head deeply embedded up their own ass, but journalism in particular? In 2022?? Give me a fucking break.
Depends on the day. It's been foggy af in the mornings lately
how would I go about that? I dont wanna seem rude and get the prof mad yknow
No way this isn‚Äôt a troll
This much makes it more likely to be a joke
What class is this?
Either fake or holy yikes
While I can't really put this level of narcissism beyond academics, I'm really struggling to believe this. If its real, spill the beans. Use a burner if you must. This prof if either a comedic genius or the Terminator.
holy late capitalism batman
thanks for the link
Yeah Im dropping this then LOL
Well if it's not a joke and the prof gets mad I'd just suggest dropping the class and notifying the dean tbh
I‚Äôve had a professor like that. Told one of the students that she didn‚Äôt care if he had to work to sustain himself. His sole focus should be the class. Some profs are just power hungry af.
yea, thats why im like idek anymore
he also mentioned how you need to use quotes around the word indigenous when referring to native americans lmfaooo (See below)

Don‚Äôt use ‚Äúindigenous‚Äù to describe a human population, unless it is in a   
quotation.

Had a prof during COVID give us extra work because ""we didn't have to worry about coming back and forth between classes so we should have more free time""
When I started at Berkeley as a ‚Äúnon traditional‚Äù student (re-entry), everyone kept telling me I ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be able to work‚Äù while in school. I was like ??? Are you all implying no one who attends this university can successfully attend classes and hold down a job? It‚Äôs such a removed mindset and totally out of touch. I work 4-5 nights a week and have a 4.0 (so far lol).
Name them or else I don't believe you
...Everything I've read in this thread about the prof is pretty unsettling. If I were in your shoes, I'd report this guy to the department because the fact that some people are saying that he's shown this kinda behavior in the past and that they also think he's not 100% joking - that would really make me feel uncomfortable if I were in the class.
what class is this?
This is a phys ed class?
If this is a 100 level class you should 100 percent report them to hire ups. This is insane. Are they a new adjunct? Please update us!
You're taking the piss
When I went to Berkeley, I had a full schedule and also worked full time. At one point I met with a counselor to make sure I was on track to graduate and I mentioned it to her. She was in complete awe and remembered me months later when she ended up at my work and said hi. She was also really supportive during the meeting and gave me advice on the next semester‚Äôs schedule and everything. It can be done!
It was at my community college. I won‚Äôt say the name bc I‚Äôm trying to stay anonymous on Reddit
Journalism 100 with Willian Drummond
Totally! And obviously there‚Äôs a huge world in between - teenagers who work weekends at a boba shop are *still* working and going to school, and those who work full time (40ish hours a week) are much rarer, but the weird sentiment that *obviously* the academic workload would just be So InTeNsE that I‚Äôd have to be crazy to also want to pay my rent and eat with my own money is so patently false and seems to just underscore the disconnect between academia and ‚ÄúThe Real World‚Ñ¢‚Äù
I worked my entire time at Cal! Everyone kept saying I shouldn‚Äôt, that you need to start your first semester with just school to feel it out and see what you can manage. But that just isn‚Äôt realistic for a lot of students. I needed the money, so I started off part time, then I got a job offer I just couldn‚Äôt refuse and ended up doing that for 3 semesters. Full time is pretty extreme for most people, but I think part time is entirely manageable for any student who puts their mind to it. Not everyone has parents who can just pay all the bills and loans only cover so much.
I compromised, and work ‚Äúfull time‚Äù in my industry, which is 27-30 hours (bar/restaurant)."
