Linguists 100 with Lev Michael . Prof feedback please?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d5h01e/linguists_100_with_lev_michael_prof_feedback/,2024-05-31 23:48:08,Rate my prof says he’s good but scary reviews here on Reddit. Can someone who’s taken his class in the last 2 years pls weigh in ?,"took sp23 and got an a+, one of my favorite professors that sem, always took time to ask for questions and answer them thoroughly, excited about the subject, exams were all open notes and on the easier side (all midterms average above 90%), etc. overall i would say to take it with him teehee

one thing i would say is that he doesnt like to read over all the text on the slides and moves through them quickly…taking notes is somewhat difficult in class but he uploads everything after
Thanks , that was very detailed and helpful"
