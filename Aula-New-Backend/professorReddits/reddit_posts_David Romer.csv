Attention incoming students thinking of an econ major!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2cxym/attention_incoming_students_thinking_of_an_econ/,2022-04-12 16:58:36,"The Undergraduate Women in Economics at Berkeley is hosting a high school outreach infosession!

Hear from Cal Econ professors (Christina Romer (former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration), David Romer (author of a textbook in graduate macroeconomics), and Martha Olney (winner of local and national teaching awards and author of several leading undergraduate economics textbooks)), current PhD students from the Econ Grad department, and current undergraduates about the economics curriculum at Berkeley (and anything else you'd want to know about (student life, culture, post-grad careers, clubs, etc.).

This event will be held on April 21st from 7-8:30pm PST. If you're curious to know what you can do with an econ degree, connect with current Cal students before even stepping foot on campus, and want more insight into the Cal community before making your college decisions, then RSVP at this link!: [https://forms.gle/FDj56dE7XBBdjyLy7](https://forms.gle/FDj56dE7XBBdjyLy7)","View in your timezone:

econ 2 textbook,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10ajw84/econ_2_textbook/,2023-01-12 19:29:30,"Is this libgen textbook I found the right textbook for econ 2? It's ISBN is different from the Econ 2 bCourses ISBN but the cover, title, and description all look the same.

The international version of textbooks usually have different units for the problems, so I hear. I also start econ 2 on the 17th (rip)."
"Data Science major, business/industrial analytics explain please",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mpzrms/data_science_major_businessindustrial_analytics/,2021-04-13 03:49:53,"The data science website describes the business/industrial analytics as the following, ""*Courses in this domain emphasis are heavily impacted, and often restricted by major to enroll. It may be difficult to complete this emphasis given these restrictions. Students are advised to make appropriate alternate plans.* ""   


Can someone explain what this means? If I am understanding this correctly, are all the classes restricted? Or only certain classes. If so, does that mean that if this does happen to me, I would have to submit the applicaiton form again to switch domain emphasis?","As a DS major you don't get registration priority for classes in your domain emphasis' major. First priority for business classes goes to business majors and you get to compete for remaining seats with the rest of berkeley.

In practice what this means is that you'll get the classes you need to graduate but may not get the classes you actually want.
I wouldn’t worry about it too much.  There are only 3 classes, spread out over 4 years, with enough class options.  I don’t see any classes in the BA list that you’d have to really worry about getting in except for Econ 1/2 depending on prof.

For impacted classes, proper course planning using BerkeleyTime, being on time when you register, and knowing what to take in Phase 1 as opposed to Phase 2, will all help tremendously.

will AP macro econ or community college equivilence suffice for Econ 1/2?
how about the econ emphasis?
>ith this? Like do we just get waitlisted straight away

Heyy! are you interseted in the same DE? I will be talking to an advisor on tuesday and maybe I could let you know! :D feel free to DM me
Yes it will.  But you would undoubtedly need to take both Macro and Micro in order to articulate.
I think a couple of them like C103 and 121 are reserved for Econ majors, but the rest should be open.
Since I have AP Macro, can I take micro at a cc to clear the prerequisite? Would that count as taking both?
Aside from Econ 1(Which I plan to take), Econ 100A/B (Which I plan to take), and Econ 140(Which i dont plan to take), it seems like all the classes have reserved seats. Would it be feasible to do the econ emphasis or should i pivot to something else like cognition?
You would have to have a 4+ first for the AP Macro/Micro class(es) in order to think about articulating this class.

To answer your question, I’m not sure, never had anyone ask that to me before.  Most students who I know of either take both APs, or take both at a CC.  That’s more of a question to ask the SIS clearinghouse, but my guess is probably yes.

After mentioning all of this lol, if the right Econ teacher is teaching either Econ 1 or Econ 2, you probably want to take the class at Berkeley regardless.  For example, the husband/wife duo of David and Christine Romer in the past have taught Econ 2 every Spring.  (Except for this school year when they taught it last Fall.) Christine Romer served on President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors as the chairperson.  David is also very influential in the world of Macroeconomics.
None of those 3 have reserved seats.
I dont plan on taking econ 140 however. Is there another class that I can use to complete the econ emphasis that isnt fully reserved for econ majors?"
