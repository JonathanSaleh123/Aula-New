"At Berkeley, a New Generation of ""Ethical Hackers"" Learns to Wage Cyberwar. For Cal professor Doug Tygar's students, there is an added incentive: every bug they catch through HackerOne also gets them points toward their final grades.",https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/at-berkeley-a-new-generation-of-ethical-hackers-learns-to-wage-cyberwar,2017-11-24 21:13:00,,"[deleted]
We do get paid in money.  You get whatever money you make from bounties.  Your class points are partially based on how much money you make.  It basically says that in the article."
Which is easier: CS70 or Math 55?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ep684e/which_is_easier_cs70_or_math_55/,2020-01-15 10:33:39,"I'm a Cogsci major and am not really a fan of math. I heard Math 55 is easier but I also read the teacher this semester is not the best.

Math 55 is with Olga V. Holtz and CS70 is with [Babak Ayazifar](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/ayazifar.html), [Doug Tygar](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/tygar.html).","Math 55 is known to be easier because they exclude various non discrete math topics covered in 70 like RSA, computability, etc
Don't know much about the instructors, but regardless of that, Math 55 will almost certainly be much easier. The class covers a smaller range of topics, in less detail. For comparison, people usually many hours (like 10+) on each week's homework for CS 70, where 55 is probably a few hours at most. Also, in CS 70 you'll be with a lot of intended CS majors who are very worried about meeting their GPA cap and so forth.

All that said, I should say that I found Math 55 to be pretty unfulfilling (and frankly a little boring) and probably would have rather taken 70. If you care about learning the material in significantly more depth, I would recommend that. But if you don't care much about math-y stuff and just want to fulfill your Cogsci pre-reqs, Math 55 will be the way to go.
Definitely 55. 70 covers a lot more material and goes much more in depth in a shorter amount of time (so we can spend the rest of the time for probability theory). Also the class has a lot of CS intended students who care about their GPA so the curve might be a bit tougher. I recall looking through math 55 homework and exams from my friend and seeing the difference in the level of difficulty from questions in 70.
Holtz is a great professor but is not going to be easy if you're not a fan of math.  I would say 55 will likely be more difficult than 70 this semester in terms of mathematical difficulty, based on my experience with Holtz's 55.  I'd probably recommend taking Math 55 in the Fall if you can wait a semester, because both classes probably will be relatively painful.  

I would take most of the advice you hear with a grain of salt because even if 55 is ""easier"" on average it also varies much more.  CS 70 is consistent in that it isn't usually taught very well from a mathematical pedagogy perspective.
I took 110 with Holtz and would guess Math 55 with Holtz will be similar in difficulty to CS70
No idea who you took 55 with but I did very well in Holtz's last time teaching 55 and easily spent more than 10 hours on the homeworks each week, they were very difficult usually.  But they were very fun and I learned a lot from them!
Classes are what you make of them. its quite possible you would have had to spend 1.5x the amount of time you did in math 55 than cs 70 to do well in the latter.
Maybe it's possible but I'm fairly certain it's not since Math 55 was also much more work than many of my math upper divs (for my level of mathematical maturity at the time of course) and Holtz's problem sets consistently had problems which were just objectively more difficult than those you'd find on a CS70 pset.  There were IMO level problems occasionally.  Maybe the grading was less harsh?  I don't know."
"100 computer science students are in an experimental ""cyberwar"" course from Doug Tygar. Students have joined the community of so-called white hat hackers at HackerOne, a vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform. The program is a first for HackerOne in working with a higher ed institution.",http://edscoop.com/students-learn-to-think-like-a-hacker-in-uc-berkeley-experimental-course,2017-11-08 21:29:58,,"I'm in the class, it's pretty cool.  I hope Professor Tygar can get it added into the standard EECS course list (it's currently a special topics course) and really nail down the curriculum in the next couple of semesters.  There were definitely some growing pains, but it'll almost certainly improve after this experimental semester.

I don't think so and I don't know.

Probably not, because there are no weekly readings, assignments, or projects.

The only assignment for the class is to claim bug bounties, and then make a short in class presentation on them.  He also does some lectures on common vulnerabilities and tools, as well as some guest lectures.  He might post the slides from those things but I'm not sure how useful they would be on their own.
There's no readings, the only assignment/project is ""find vulnerabilities in companies on HackerOne"""
