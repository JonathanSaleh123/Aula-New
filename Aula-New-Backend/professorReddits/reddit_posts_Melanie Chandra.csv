english 141 skill level,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qgj2oj/english_141_skill_level/,2021-10-26 16:24:39,"sorry for all the repeated posts! so i'm freshman in l&s and a hopeful creative writing minor and i'm thinking of taking english 141 next semester (modes of writing w/ melanie chandra — it would get both my l&s art/lit breadth out of the way and count towards the minor). i have a fair amount of experience in creative writing (i've had my poetry + short stories nationally awarded, published, and nominated for anthologies) so i don't rly want to take a class oriented towards beginners/people who have never written before; is 141 targeted towards complete beginners? i'm a little wary abt applying to english 143, since they're super selective, so i'm in a bit of a bind. any advice appreciated!","You don’t need to have any creative writing experience to take 141 but it’s totally fine if you do. Though I’d also recommend shooting your shot at some of the 143’s, you never know, and if not you’d still have a good fallback in 141
definitely apply to 143s! you can always just take 141 but it's absolutely worth shooting your shot, especially since it sounds like you have some really solid samples to submit"
