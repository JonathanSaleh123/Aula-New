100B Nicolas Depetris Chauvin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zz253o/100b_nicolas_depetris_chauvin/,2022-12-30 06:41:34,Does anyone know anything about Nicolas Depetris Chauvin? He's the professor for Econ 100B and it seems like he's a new professor,"I had him for ugba 101a, kinda condescending and not the best at explaining concepts

For real
Are you kidding? I had him in econ 100b. He is super nice and he made a dense course very approachable."
Nicolas Depetris Chauvin in ECON100B is pretty GOOD,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10r8rw7/nicolas_depetris_chauvin_in_econ100b_is_pretty/,2023-02-01 14:46:17,Thick accent + Funny + Smart = GOAT Professor,"You sure?
Francais ?
I had him in Spring23. Best Berkeley professor ever. He knows his macro. Makes you work hard on weekly problem sets but he is super responsive both in class and in Ed. Nice grader. GSI was also awesome. This was my favorite course."
ECON 100A or 100B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11fg2vj/econ_100a_or_100b/,2023-03-01 12:05:26,"The professor for 100B is Nicolas Depetris Chauvin. He has no reviews at all so does anyone know about him?

What about Zheng Huang? Are they a good professor for 100A?","Taking 100B with Chauvin right now, so far so good donâ€™t really have any complaints
I would highly recommend 101B with Jon Steinsson if itâ€™s offered next semester. One of the best lecturers and a star researcher in the department - heâ€™s clearly very passionate about teaching macroeconomics, and the material is fantastic - heâ€™s in the process of writing a textbook based on his version of the class so he basically gives everyone access to a wonderful in-depth explanation of the lecture material on day one. The workload is probably one of the lowest out of all the 100/140 series classes (like 5 short problem sets and 2 exams?) and the curve is usually very very forgiving. 101B also has exactly the same prerequisites as 100B, and doesnâ€™t use any fancy math unlike 101A and 141.
I took 100A w/ Zheng Huang last summer. The problem sets and exams were straight forward. Huang was very good at explaining concepts. I had no complaints.
I took 100B with Hawkins last semester, but heâ€™s not teaching right now (some people said he left). Iâ€™m with Jim Campbell for 100A right now and I absolutely love him! Heâ€™s amazing and his lectures are engaging. He very relatable and he works out how to do the problems and apply what you are learning instead of only lecturing on the conceptual.
what math did you need to do well in the class?
Can you share any tips for this class in particular? Taking it over summer 23!
Yeah thatâ€™s all good but a midterm a month is a bitch for folks taking many other classes.
Math 1A and 1B are more than enough for 101B. They teach partial derivatives and a few other basic ideas from 53 along the way but theyâ€™re very easy to pick up because the class isnâ€™t computation heavy and itâ€™s just a handful of operations applied in predictable ways to rather simple functions.
Thatâ€™s true. Three midterms is no fun. I do like how it takes the pressure off a little. In classes with only one midterms thereâ€™s a lot more pressure to not fuck up. That being said, I did have three Econ midterms in one day this semester. That was brutal. So I guess it does just depend on class load. After that I feel like I can accomplish anything though! (wellâ€¦until I get my grades backâ€¦then Iâ€™ll probably just cry ðŸ’€)
For Campbell?"
