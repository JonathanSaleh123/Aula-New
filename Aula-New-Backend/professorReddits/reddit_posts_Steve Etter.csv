Econ upper divs ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c9wavc/econ_upper_divs/,2024-04-21 16:41:22,"I’m making my schedule for the upcoming semester. Any thoughts on the following courses based on your experience?  

UGBA 131 with Prof. Steve Etter
ECON 165 with Prof. John Nelson-Mondragon
Econ 191 with Prof. Ben Handel

Thank uu ;)
","I have only taken Econ 191. If you want to do a senior honors thesis you should take this course since (you either need to take 191, H195A, or an upper division research seminar). Or take the course if you have a couple topics you want to research on a deeper level (you have to propose three research ideas, and you pick one). It’s cool since you get a finished research paper that you’ve written at the end of the semester. Classes were one day a week for three hours. The first half was usually one the GSIs teaching research methods, econometric methods you can use, going over coding stuff, etc. the second half of class was various professors and research coming in to talk about their own research. No midterms or final, just turning in things like proposals and data analysis, basically building up to the final paper which is 20-25 pages long."
