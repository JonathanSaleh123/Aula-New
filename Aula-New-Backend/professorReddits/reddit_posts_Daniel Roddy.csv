best english r1b professors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yispix/best_english_r1b_professors/,2022-10-31 16:43:34,hardly any of them show up on ratemyprofessor. any profs in particular i should try to go for/avoid?,"Many, maybe most of these classes are taught by GSI’s, so there won’t be much out there on RMP.  I would just take a class based on the subject itself and if it interests you, and maybe do some research on historical grading on BerkeleyTime if you are looking for classes that have higher GPA averages.
I’ve heard R4B profs are not chill compared to R5B and R1B, but I wouldn’t take my word for it I just heard that from someone else
Daniel Roddy - He teaches History R1B"
