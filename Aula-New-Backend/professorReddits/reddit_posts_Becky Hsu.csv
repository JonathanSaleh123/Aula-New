Which professor impacted you positively?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1djbilj/which_professor_impacted_you_positively/,2024-06-18 22:29:28,Who are the hidden gem professors of Berkeley?,"Adhikari with data 140 üí™üí™
Robert Reich‚Äôs class sticks with me so much years later even though it had nothing to do with my major
David Presti is such a gem !! Genuinely a very supportive, approachable, and inspiring professor to talk with if you‚Äôre interested in consciousness, neuroscience, or psychedelic science =)
I regret that I didn‚Äôt build a better relationship with him, because Dr. Crockett in the Philosophy department struck me as a very sincere, compassionate, and positive dude. I basically did not show up to his class all semester due to some medical issues, and he went way above and beyond to help me try and finish his course. Gave me an incomplete I really didn‚Äôt deserve, and even emailed me pretty regularly to try and get me through the course after it had ended. He didn‚Äôt have to do that, and I‚Äôm still grateful for the amount of effort he put into trying to help me out (even though he was essentially a stranger). From the lectures I did attend, he was also an extremely talented teacher, and he always made a lot of effort for his students. Honestly seems like the kind of guy who just actually really does care about his students, and will go above and beyond for them. Very solid dude, take literally any of his classes, you won‚Äôt regret it.
Pete Marsden. Love that guy
Professor Paulin
John DeNero and Dan Garcia made me fall in love with men I mean CS
Trevor Murphy.
Absolutely love Professor Beatty who teaches MCB50
Professor Zook in Poli Sci, man is a living legend.
Really enjoyed josh hugs 61b
Kara Whittman just joined the English department but she is amazing. All around inspirational, compassionate and kind.
Edwin Lin, Mark Tanouye, Ivo Duijnstee, Richie Kim
If you take a Philosophy course, take it with John Campbell.
Professor Kim Shelton in the classics department was one of the most influential people in terms of helping me figure out what I was interested in, and she is such a fun professor and mentor. She is probably the only reason why I didn‚Äôt drop out in my second year when I realized I didn‚Äôt want to major in CS and wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to switch to.

Ani Adhikari, Micheal Jordan, Dan Garcia, and Jitendra Malik are all excellent lecturers in CS/DS and I loved their classes a lot. 

In classics/Ancient Greek and Roman studies, I really, really liked Ferrari, Murphy, Shelton (of course), and Pe√±a. Ferrari‚Äôs class on classical literary criticism was one of the most formative classes I have ever taken.

Honestly going to Berkeley was an incredible experience for me because of the professors I had and classes I had.
papa denero
Shustermann 100%
Really only one prof in my time at Berkeley didn‚Äôt impact me positively‚Ä¶but as time has gone on, I‚Äôve even learned valuable lessons from that semester as well.¬†

All the profs I had in the ME department had such a positive impact on me becoming the person and engineer I am today. Special shoutouts would go to Packard (üôè), Dames, Johnson, Kazerooni, Carey, Frenklach, Anwar. Also the shop guys and grad students that teach you everything you don‚Äôt learn in the book.¬†
Lisa Yan!! She‚Äôs inspiring
Physics department. Chieng I . When I transferred here I took his class for Quantum mechanics, but I basically failed the midterm. During class he went over the histogram of our scores, me feeling horrible over my first bad test grade, he then continued to talk about when he was in a bad position school-wise and how he overcame it. Explaining that the textbook is only 60 percent of how you learn and the other percentage is based on people. Every friend, professor, gsi, or tutor has the possibly of teaching you something you have not known, whether it be a new perspective or key idea. Once you start getting into upper-division courses there is a lot less content to help you learn, so you have to learn how to speak to people and how to read a textbook.
Naomi Ginsburg in Chemistry. A dedicated, wonderful human being.
Paul N. Hilfinger

One of the only (technical) courses I took where I still retain both the knowledge and life lessons learned

Runner up is Jim Pitman, the usual Stats 134 professor. Since human intuition about probability is so bad, he really emphasizes getting comfortable with the raw numbers and your computations with them, even if they don't ""feel"" right
How quickly people forget, the best prof at Berkeley I ever had was Professor Josh Hug.  I was lucky enough to have him for 2 classes, Data 100 and CS 186, plus working under him for Data 100, and doing research for him.  I think he‚Äôs back from his sabbatical this Fall.  I feel bad that I haven‚Äôt talked to him in 3 years, I probably should say hi.
I really liked the SLAV classes I took from Eric Naiman, who is still there, and Olga Matich, who has since retired. I was an engineering major and the first class I took was I think a breadth requirement, and I took two more from the same department because I liked them so much. 

Prof Matich had a sort of teasing banter with her GSIs, it was very entertaining. We got invited to one of these literature department paper readings where the researchers critique each others papers, and it seemed pretty aggressive to me, but that was just a critique session. It was eye opening.
Julia Fawcett for theater. Jose Ramirez for Cog Sci 131 (class was hard but office hours were great)
Lisa Pruitt in the ME department. Almost everything she taught over the course of a couple materials engineering classes has stuck with me, and i use on a regular basis in my professional career. The definition of an inspirational professor. She did not let her unrelenting care take away from her ridiculously high standards either.
Arman Catterson (Pshych 101)

Honestly, one of the best professors I‚Äôve ever had. His honesty and reality checks that he gave us were awesome. He was such an advocate for our education and being real with real life possibilities. Always giving us resources for stuff outside of class and staying after to talk about grad schools was amazing. I have so much respect for him
Seth Lunine in the Geography department, great professor and an even better person
Thomas Scanlon, Will Fithian, Anant Sahai, Michael Ball, Ryan Hass, Ivan Danilenko
Ani Adhikari, Yun Song, Anant Sahai
Prof. Katharina Kaiser is a gem
Zachary Lamb, Chip Sullivan
Professor Samuel Otter.
Professor Celeste Langan.
Pablo Gonzalez!
Mary Kelsey - Sociology department!
James Campbell!
Ansell (political science) doesn‚Äôt get enough credit because this website is made up of elitist mouth breathing CS majors with a superiority complex.
Munis Faruqui, hands down. Great professor and an equally amazing person.
I guess not technically a professor, but Ted Moore and the other combo leaders in UC Jazz do a phenomenal job.
Etter for UGBA 131 and 137. These courses are tough material-wise but taught masterfully and Etter is one of the only professors I would actually get a beer with outside of class. Have heard his name come up in interviews and coffee chats multiple times after graduating - just a sign of his remarkable impact on Berkeley. If you are considering a career in investing or markets these are your exit tickets.
patrick russell in the theater department is genuinely one
of the best people i know
Americ Azevedo ENG130AC 

RIP Prof ü´°
Jesse Nathan in the English department was nothing short of a blessing
Andreas Glaeser and Ron Gronsky (both probably retired) in MSE were most impactful for me. Chris Dames and Tarek Zohdi in ME were also excellent.
Professor Hubert Dreyfus, RIP.
Jason Corburn, genuinely nice guy, great class (inspiring guest speakers), and his research is inspiring
Austin Hedeman! I‚Äôve never seen someone care for their students as much as he does. And an amazing teacher‚Äîchanged my life!
DAN GARCIA IS THE GOAT
Joelle Frechette, CBE 150A/B
Josh Hug
Andrew Charman. Absolute beast of a teacher but be ready to go through hell and back to get through his class. Worth it though. 

I know there's been controversy with him but I do think that Jonathan Shewchuk's CS189 was game changing for me.
Dan Portnoy - while he's tough (his bacterial pathogenesis class is intense), he's such a passionate and energetic teacher (although I wish his slides were more organized)

Alexis Shusterman - I had her when I took Chem 1A; she was so fun and energetic!

Britt Glaunsinger - she talks about viruses like she's telling a story. She should be nominated for distinguished teaching award!
Nasser Zakariya in Rhetoric. Does a lot of cross disciplinary stuff with history and philosophy of science that might appeal as an elective to the mostly STEM bent of this sub (the undergrad classes I took with him all had ample STEM students). Very smart and incredibly kind, let me take a grad class w him in my final semester and it was the most enriching class I took at Berkeley
Ethan Shagan! Best lecturer I've had. I audited his History of Religion class last semester and every class was fascinating.
love paulin
Paulin is universally loved and I agree with that sentiment
Ribet!!
Richard Huntsinger at Haas. I‚Äôve never had a professor remember my name before and while it‚Äôs a small gesture, it impacted me a lot. It helped me get out of my shell in my classes/office hours and gain overall confidence in my academics at Berkeley. Something that as a transfer student, I really struggled with.
Oliver Arnold is the professor to take for Shakespeare, hands down. I thoroughly enjoyed my research seminar with him last semester.
Kevin Padian, Margaret Conkey¬†
Robert Kaufman's class on poetry is one of the only courses not related to my career that I still think about after graduating. Great guy, and his class really made me view the world differently
The One and Only OG, Prof Hilfinger
Victoria Robinson from Ethnic Studies was so inspiring. I also ran into her fifteen years later and she remembered me, which was really impressive. I was not that great of a student.
Seth Lunine! I loved GEOG50, and I‚Äôve heard great things about his upper div class and really want to take it, though it seems to be popular and gets full pretty fast. Really caring and thoughtful guy, and knows CA and the bay so thoroughly! He slayed lol
ren ng, cs184
Becky hsu
Laleh Behbehanian in Sociology :)
Not sure if he teaches any undergrad courses, but Professor David Oppenheimer at Berkeley Law. I did URAP for the Berkeley Center for Comparative Equality and Anti-Discrimination Law, which he heads, and I have never met a more compassionate person in my life. 

For the students who couldn‚Äôt afford to work for free, he and his wife set up a fund that they paid out of pocket to compensate students who needed it. He also invited anyone who couldn't go home for the holidays to dinner at his own home for Thanksgiving break. 

On top of all that, he's a favorite at Berkeley Law (which is so hard to do teaching Civ Pro, lol), was a prominent civil rights lawyer, and has a storied career fighting against discrimination. 

The guy‚Äôs a hero in my book and the kindest soul you‚Äôll ever learn from if you‚Äôre lucky enough.
Professor Lilla Balint hands down
Dr. Harry Edwards.  Tremendous class.  Still think about it 46 years later.
Peyrin Kao in 161 and 188, Dan Garcia and Lisa Yan in 61C, and Armando Fox in 169 and 169L.  Tbh i didn‚Äôt go to any of my nontechs so idk those profs, but presti seemed fun for a bit in drugs and the brain :))
yokotover /s
Olga Holtz
Another one is Professor Ricky Vincent! He is a Panther Cub, meaning his mom was in the Black Panther Party and he is a Berkeley local. He taught a summer class on the music of the BPP, he's also an old head who loves to crate dig. GOAT.
Same!
Yes!!!
Yeah she was my favorite professor and she was super kind
Unfortunate that he retired!
Love his class! Very relevant to a lot of the work going on on with interpretability in LLMs. I missed the final for his class because I had it written down on the wrong day and then got very sick right before the exam and was too feverish to recheck the time and he let me take it later and only docked me a letter grade for it. He was very kind and empathetic and he told me I should maybe go get evaluated for adhd which I got diagnosed with last year.
Crickett is legit
He's a mensch, for sure. Kills me he's only a lecturer.
Crockett is incredible. So happy to see him named here.
I'm taking a summer course with him right now. He does seem exceedingly smart in his lecture style concerning moral philosophy.
deserved the distinguished teaching award
Hahah, Garcia 61C is one of the best classes I have ever taken!!
i had him many years ago and remember him being a nice guy, really good lecturer and also a huge Godzilla superfan lmao. 2024 must've been one of his all-time great years
The OG in the classics department!!
His Hell Class is the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
he‚Äôs such a great guy, genuinely is passionate about his field, and loves to teach! I still get emails and notifications for career fairs and resume help despite being in his class over a year ago!
i recommend his global studies too!
+1 to Edwin. Wrote me letters of rec for PhD programs and got in! Great guy.
Just had Edwin for soc 005 and wish I had him for a better class bc the material was so boring but he still put his all into it lol
papa john üçï
I took E7 with Packard, he was a legend. Loved Dames heat transfer class too, took it in '16
lisa is awesome
no
Sahai üòç
Idk about Sahai ü´†ü´†ü´†
Did you take 176?
True story.
Zachary is goated
He's fantastic. Loved his Moby Dick class even though I didn't finish it
Yes! She was my de facto thesis advisor! She was so kind and attentive and engaged in my learning! Glad to know there are others who felt similarly!
Yes! She is wonderful.
Ansell was awesome. Also really liked Dan Schnur for Campaign Strategies, Media, and Message.
Ansell is legit. His grading system is very fair and straightforward, and he really makes you feel part of the class.
I love Americ. He once talked to me on the phone during an acid trip. No lie. I used to attend his full moon tea parties where we talked about consciousness and shit
I was also heart broken to have missed his celebration of life. His wife was so sweet to all of us and I wish I would have made the time to support her in her move. I still had so much learning to do then, I let the stress of life come before being present then. So silly to have missed the mark so bad after all he attempted to teach me. Obviously I wasn‚Äôt listening yet. RIP Prof Azevedo
He did?! Noooooooo. I just got here üò¢. Is he still affiliated with the school or do research?
Lisa is hot
No, I took Stat 135 with Yun Song
Nah. He came to film his documentary this past semester, so I met him then but no longer here. He's active AF on LinkedIn though.
Damn, he‚Äôs one of my favorite economists. Was looking forward to potentially meeting him. Thanks for the info"
People looking for a COLWRIT R1A class (6 units) for Fall,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ny0sda/people_looking_for_a_colwrit_r1a_class_6_units/,2021-06-12 00:00:11,"Just making this post for people in this situation. This is a pretty heavy class with loads of outside work. However, I took it last sem with Prof Becky Hsu. She was amazing. Really understanding and most importantly made the classes fun. She gave really personalised advice and sometimes stayed to help us through some assignments and writers block. Hope this helps students wanting to take the class next sem!!","Hi u/Saiachalla, would you recommend taking COLWRIT R1A for my very first semester coming into Berkeley? My English language proficiency and reading comprehension is probably average. Thanks.
Hi! I‚Äôm considering making Prof Becky Hsu‚Äôs course as a backup class. However, I‚Äôm a bit alarmed at the workload that she expects outside of class. Can you expand on your experience? Is 12 hours of outside class time workload doable?
Hi! Im a first year here, and I have to take COLWRIT R1A next semester, but since I'm trying to be pre-med, so I don't really have enough time commitment towards an English class. I was planning to take a different professor's class, do you know the difficulties of any other COLWRIT R1A courses? Thanks!
Hey there! It‚Äôs perfectly alright to take it in your first semester. In fact it might be easier to do it then as the first few classes at Berkeley might be a bit easier than classes further into the years so workload-wise it might be more manageable. I tried to do it first semester but wasn‚Äôt able to enrol. Also, since it‚Äôs a normal semester, they have pretty long time frames for assignments allowing you to work over a few drafts before you get to a final product.
Hey there! If this is the workload that you see on the left side of the page where there‚Äôs the course description, those are calculated by unit count. However, it is a 6 unit class after all and there are pretty long essays to write (5-7) pages. However, you will have to write drafts, submit them, get feedback and then proceed to write the final version of the essay. The assignments are all directed to help you write your essay so I never saw them as extra work. Hope this helps!
Thank you so much for the reassurance!
Thanks!"
