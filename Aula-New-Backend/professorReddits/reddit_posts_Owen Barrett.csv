Math 113 Spring 2024 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1778p93/math_113_spring_2024_professors/,2023-10-13 14:05:14,"Hello looking for advice on math 113 professors for next sem. 

Options: Nicole Gonzalez, Kendric Schefers, Owen Barrett, Jikang Wang, and Aleksandra Utiralova

For reference I am taking math 110 this sem and haven taken all the math 113 prereqs. ","[deleted]
How hard is the final for her class? I have midterm in an hour and I am very behind so i don't think i will do well. Going to need to clobber."
Math 110 and 113 professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1807002/math_110_and_113_professors/,2023-11-20 19:06:33,"Phase 2 about to open, I'm still unsure whether I'm taking 110 or 113 next spring. Right now 110 only has Frenkel, and 113 has Corteel, Barrett, Shinko, Schefers, Gonzalez, and Utirilova.

Which class should I take first? Or can I just take them at the same time?

Also, if anyone has any recommendations about 113 professors, would appreciate it!","I liked Owen Barrett for math 113, but that’s just my experience.
I know this is late but could help others in the future . I think taking 110 or 113 first both have their advantages. With 113 you will learn to define the abstract concept of vector spaces as they relate to other structures (groups, rings, fields), which is a more “pure” way to do it as you won’t limit yourself to one idea. But with 110, it will ease you into the abstractness by starting with an example of an algebraic structure so that when you get to 113 you have a feel for it already. I guess if you don’t know how to prove things I would do 110 first but if you are comfortable with proofs then 113 will be good. I think many 110 professors help students with how to prove things as not all students in the class are mathematicians (lots of engineers and physicists as well). 113 they assume you know a lot of it

As for professors, I had Barrett, who is extremely smart and will always have his door open to you. Though you will have to supplement the lectures with thorough reading of the text."
