WHOOP. WHOOP. WEST VALLEY COLLEGE REPRESENT!!! ðŸŽŠðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
Damn so easy to get into berkeley through community college. What's the point in trying so hard in high school lol
What's the grad percentages for transfers, historically (obviously)?  Same data for HS admissions, if you have it, please?
I literally had to work hard at cc too. They donâ€™t just give out acceptance to uc Berkeley to anyone. Smh
You get an extra 2 years to take classes at a top university.
I dont think the UCs would track that all the way thru.  CalAnswers wouldnt have that much granularity exposed to figure that out manually.  Although that would be very interesting data to know.
I think it's fair to say that for your typical sheltered suburban kid who went to a competitive high school, getting in from CC is way easier than getting in from HS.

Not necessarily the case for everyone though.
Wow. Youâ€™re pretty bad."
