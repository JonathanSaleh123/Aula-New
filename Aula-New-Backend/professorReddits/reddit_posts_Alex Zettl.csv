Cs 70 + Math 53 + Physics 7A doable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kllr8y/cs_70_math_53_physics_7a_doable/,2020-12-27 23:22:03,"Hi fellow bears!

I was wondering if you thought this combo  (Cs 70 + Math 53 + Physics 7A) is reasonable/doable. (I also don't need to declare)

* Cs 70 with prof Rao and Shyam Parekh
* Math 53 with prof Zvezdelina Stankova
* Physics 7A with prof Alex Zettl","yes. math 53 can be a bitch though. and I heard horror stories of 7A pandemic edition. so who knows
sounds very do able. 53 and 7a are relatively light conceptually compared to 70. the struggle will be if midterms are all around the same time otherwise 7a and 53 problem sets aren't bad at all
yup
Stankova did a great job on 110
7A is relatively light, but the midterms are super tough. A 29% was a C on the second MT, so curves help a ton.
hi 26unitsguy! How's it going? Are ya keeping it together with _this_ workload?

Edit: But are you serious?
yeah it was honestly just midterm season that drove me crazy, rest is manageable. Even finals/RRR week was okayish tbh

And yeah I'm serious, maybe add a good breadth like phil 12A to the mix too"
Physics 7B Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/77adgj/physics_7b_professors/,2017-10-18 15:52:44,"I'm seeing two different lecture times for physics 7B. For the TTh one, the professor listed is Alex Zettl, but there's no one listed for the MWF lecture. Reviews for Zettl seem to be good overall although they do say his tests are difficult. The MWF Friday lecture fits slightly better with my schedule, but I'm worried that I'll end up with a worse professor if I choose that. Is there anyone here who's had Zettl who can say whether it's worth signing up for his lecture or not? Thanks!","Same boat as you actually but I'm stuck with MWF lecture cause conflicts with the other :o anyways I've had Zettl for 7A before. He's a good lecturer imo and tries to not keep the material too boring. But his tests are definitely brutal. He curves them fairly but he keeps the raw scores pretty low so you just feel fucked while actually taking it lol. I think averages on the midterms/final were around 50-70% and 7B ones are definitely lower than that. 
I had Zettl for 7B Spring 2016. He's a great lecturer able to explain things well in E&M. He is okay in explaining thermodynamics but lower div thermo has a lot of really weird convention so can't blame him.

I agree on the brutal exams. He gives you a break on 1 of them; the other 2 you really need to do a lot of practice to get ready.
Yeah that's pretty rough. I'll probably end up going with the MWF anyway, so let's hope for both of our sakes that the professor is good. Hopefully they'll release the name soon, but I know it took them a long time to do that for 7A this semester
Thanks for the input. I wish they'd release the name of the other professor, so I could make a more informed decision. The physics department seems to be kind of late on that. Oh well
Yeah have to get used to it. Maybe try open appointments or contacting physics. Unsure if you have any luck though."
Physics 7A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/drd3d7/physics_7a/,2019-11-03 21:21:13,"Wondering whether to take Alex Zettl or Ahmet Yildiz for physics 7A next semester, both have good reviews but looks like Yildiz has a more generous curve, wondering if anyone has ever taken these profs, and or have advice

Thanks!","anyone else feel queasy after eating foothill tonight?
I have Yildiz and his exams are definitely harder, resulting in the larger curve
I took Yildiz spring '16. His final used problems straight from the textbook. I lucked out and managed to recognize two of the problems, saving my ass.

u/BleuFlamer1 I might have his old 7A shit if you want it to get ahead on break.
can you send me his shit too please
Ill send it sometime this weekend if i can find it on my old laptop. Im swamped with school shit."
