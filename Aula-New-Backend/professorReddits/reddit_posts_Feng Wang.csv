Physics 7B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dremvc/physics_7b/,2019-11-04 00:07:53,I'm taking Physics 7B for Spring 2020 and I'm still not sure who is a better prof to go under? Catherine Bordel or Feng Wang? anyone has any opinions,"I had Feng Wang for 5B and it wasn't great. The problem sets were dull, the exams were written poorly, and the lectures were pulled straight from the book. 

2 stars, would not recommend
Bordel wasnt too bad, honestly I had a tough time at the beginning of her 7B class, but when I started going to her office hours it really helped! 
Her tests are not easy, but they're fair for the most part.
I had him for 5C and this is consistent. Although the final was reasonably well written. He is relatively easy and a pretty nice guy and probably fine for 7B though. 

He doesn't really do demos and a valuable part of my 5B experience was watching the professor shock himself so you might miss out on that."
