"Those who have taken her, how tough is Ronit Stahl?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10a89b4/those_who_have_taken_her_how_tough_is_ronit_stahl/,2023-01-12 11:28:26,My only non-major class this semester is History 7B and I'm crossing my fingers it's not too intensive,"Not sure if the class has changed, but it was really easy when I took it with her two years ago. Very little reading compared to other history classes and easy exams. She gave out weekly assignments that could be incredibly tedious, though.
Hopefully it's the same then, I can do small assignments way better than I can readings. I know the lecture is in-person but the discussion is online"
