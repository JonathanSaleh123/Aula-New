Who is (or was) your favorite UC Berkeley professor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5ryme7/who_is_or_was_your_favorite_uc_berkeley_professor/,2017-02-03 19:51:46,"Honestly, I just wanted to create a much different subject than the current threads, and also one that gives an advantage to current or former UC Berkeley students. My answer is in a comment.","Hug was a cool guy
Professor Alex Filippenko in Astronomy. He was highly entertaining! Favorite class at Cal by far and fulfilled a breadth requirement too! 
Professor Shenker has been by far my favorite professor. I have never met another human being that is as passionate and caring as he is, and it really shows in his lectures. He did an amazing job of not only doing his best to teach the class about networking, but also trying to show us some things he has learned about life. I will forever be grateful that I was able to take 168 with him last semester. 
Why pick just one? Berkeley has so many fantastic professors :)

A few that really stood out to me, for various reasons:

* John DeNero - CS 61A is my favorite class here, and a lot of that is due to the dedication John has put into making 61A a great experience, despite it's ballooning size.
* John Arnold - I think Chem 1A was the very first lecture I went to as a student here (bonus: surprise rotating stage in Pimentel). Super clear lectures, plus he dressed up for halloween :P
* Dan Garcia - I've technically never taken a class with him, but the past semester videos for when he taught 61C helped me a ton while I was taking that class.
I had two favorite professors: Professor Presti, in the MCB department, and Brian Harvey, a senior lecturer in the computer science department (now retired). Professor Presti just seemed like a true Renaissance man, interested in and knowledgable about a wide amount of topics. Dr. Harvey taught 61A and other courses for many semesters (back when 61A was in Scheme), and presented himself in a wonderfully unpretentious way. His casual style of dress and manner and his clear expectations made computer science very accessible for me, and it was the only CS course at Berkeley I got an A+ in.

Pitman for 134 was great.
Hubert Dreyfus, Martin Malia and Martin Jay. I go back a bit.
Professor Shewchuk (CS 61B): Awesome lecturer and I love his snark. A lot of people thought that he talked too slow, but as someone coming out of 61A feeling a bit overwhelmed, the pace was great for me. 

Professor Isacoff (MCB 160): A chalkboard lecturer in a field of powerpoint presentations, and made MCB interesting when I thought nothing could. He was enthusiastic about the subject material and it came across to students too. 
Caught between Dandelet and Norena. Both Excellent lecturers.
i'm only a first year, but my favorite so far is Jonathan Sheehan in the history department. he's just so enthusiastic about his work. i haven't taken a midterm yet though, so he might not be easy
There are a lot of great professors on campus.

Nothing has ever made me as excited to learn as sitting in a lecture hall and being spoken to by John DeNero in CS61A on my first day as a student at this great school.
professor alan ross. you can read up his profile. there are some classes you can take as a non business major truly an eye opener
Prof. Christos Papadimitriou. Had him for CS170, what a great speaker.
Burawoy for sociology. Incredible man. 
Steen, Brilliant, Gokturk, Palmer, Moran. 
Kevin Padian in IB (comparative vert paleo) and Professor Morse in Nuclear Engineering
I have a fewâ€”prof. Stacy in the chemistry dept is a great teacher. I've never taken a class with her but I've helped TA and she really cares about her students. To echo that, Pete marsden is another cool dude in the chemistry dept, lectures in o chem, not a full professor, but super kind. In psych, dr. Kriegsfeld  in behavioral neuroscience is a little eccentric but in the best possible way, a man after my own heart with a great sense of humor. 
O'Reilly for Mechanical Engineering!
Reich
Wetzel.

Prepare for the lectures of a lifetime.
Donnett M Flash, the conservative Caribbean (Jamaican?) political science teacher who taught POL1/American Government--woman changed my life and how I saw politics, turning me from a typical campus Marxist Kiddie Commie into a staunch arch-capitalist--she also taught me more about American government than most Americans seem to know.

That woman also was a stickler for standards--no improper grammar or misspellings on her watch, even for PolySci!
O'Reilly, Zhodi, and Hedrick in the ME department.
Prof. NoBody
Professor Billy
EE40?
Professor Shenker is awesome, I can attest to how much he cares. EE122, Fall 2012. It's in the middle of dead week and a student posts a question about some shit that he reaaally should have been familiar with at that point. The man himself replies with his phone number, saying something like ""Call me. You need to understand this for the final."" In my time at Berkeley, that was the only time I saw a gesture like that from a professor. Not that I'm knocking on the rest of the faculty, but I just want to highlight how above-and-beyond that seemed to me.
I still use ""brianharvey"" as my wi-fi password.
Presti is fantastic!
As an atheist, it took 61a and b with Hilfinger to understand the concept of God's wrath. Truly a valuable education.

Padian was legit
Thank you for being the one to finally name a female professor! I guess I should expect androcentrism from redditers, but it's still dismaying. 
lulz why the downvotes 
61B

Now that I think about it I've only ever had two women profs, dr. Stacy and dr. Maus (social psych). I wonder what the demographics of professorship are? 
unclear lol
Apparently 30% of the faculty is female (diversity.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/diversity-snapshot-web-final.pdf), but that varies across departments, and it's probably way less in chemistry."
