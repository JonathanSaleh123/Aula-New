This week we tragically lost one of the brightest rising stars in computer science. RIP Michael B. Cohen. (x-post r/compsci),https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3468,2017-10-01 02:32:23,,"Also [this](https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/3915/) blog post from Luca Trevisan (Berkeley CS Professor). This is indeed a painful loss. Rest in peace Michael.
I don't want to speculate, but could this be another carbon monoxide incident such as the one that occurred earlier this year?

"Michael Cohen: ""For me as a professor to ask students to walk across Sproul Plaza, it is unethical. I'm (asking) my students to choose between their physical and mental safety for a grade."" 130 Cal faculty members signed a letter calling for canceling all classes for duration of ""Free Speech Week.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/14/uc-berkeley-staff-members-express-safety-concerns-free-speech-week/,2017-09-17 00:44:42,,"[deleted]
I never crossed Sproul to get to classes. Why do classes need to be cancelled?  Students can access campus from a different area. 
Where would the source of harm for ""physical and mental safety"" come from? 
So them seeing people they dont agree with is a threat to their mental safety? 

The rednecks are right, you guys are absolutely pathetic. 
For real. I sorely miss the days where the default response to people saying things you didn't like was ignoring them. Now everybody's perpetually in a ruffle about their sensibilities.
Yes. 

Berkley students are without a doubt the softest and most mentally unstable people i've ever seen in my life. 

I grew up in an area where a wrong word could get you bashed or even shot/stabbed, where people fight over any disagreement, but berkley students are absolutely unbelievably fragile and so willing to get violent and have complete emotional breakdowns for frankly, no reason. 

Last week i saw 6 students punching walls, crying and screaming, curled up and breaking down... because their favorite coffee shop was closed for the day cos the manager got sick. There was another coffee shop litterally right across the road! Not 20 meters away! 

This school does NOT prepare its students for the real world. A real world which frankly, is gonna eat all of you alive. And also if you put on a resume that you're a ""berkley revolutionary/antifa"" you'll never be hired, business owners in Berkley frankly hate anyone associated with antifa/BAMN/etc... 

And if you asked a boss for a week off so you could go protest/""punch nazis"", they'd say ""okay, but dont come back monday"" 
I don't think these professors are very good at troubleshooting. Imagine if a student said ""I'd like a pass on writing this paper because the source I wanted to use the most wasn't available at the first library I checked."" What about other sources? What about other libraries? Would that excuse fly?

I mean is this reason for missing class any better? ""One route I could take to class might take me through protesters, and they might not be peaceful, so therefore all classes should be cancelled university-wide.""


These people are insane. They honestly believe there's no difference between words and actions. 

For example, if i said say ""we need better border controls"" to them, me saying that and holding that opinion is violence against them and others, so in their mind they're justified in caving in my skull with an alluminum bat. Litterally for just holding an opinion different to theirs. 

Im no fan of the right-wing and fuck the alt-right to hell, but at least they understand there's a difference between words and actions. 

These antifa people hold the same mentality of the khmer rouge. 
And some are frankly insane. People are being beaten with bats because they say something a few (violent and absolutely psychotic) students disagree with. 

I'm no republican, far from it, but i feel like i'm in Mao's China or Stalin's Russia when i'm on campus, that one wrong word, one cage egg, one non-fair trade coffee and i'll be chased down and beaten. I do NOT feel safe on this campus and it's not the right wing or ""fascists"" who make me feel unsafe. Its the people constantly saying THEY feel ""unsafe"" by different opinions. 
For real.

> Antifa protesters literally throw a fence through a building

i slep

> Police come onto campus to prevent that from happening with Shapiro

THESE POLICE MAKE ME FEEL SO UNSAFE"
"Michael Cohen: ""In the past — Occupy in 2011, the Wheeler Occupation in 2009 and (even) FSM — UCPD has had a very, very heavy hand with student protesters, employing violence as a first-order response. It was very heavy handed and (has) obviously dialed back."" This follows the Robinson-Edley Report.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/10/uc-polices-approach-handling-protests-evolved-recent-years/,2017-02-11 00:24:32,,The SEIU and a particular person at the NYT was behind the violence as well.
"UC Berkeley research fellow, rising star in computer science dies at 25",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/04/uc-berkeley-research-fellow-michael-cohen-rising-star-in-computer-science-dies-at-25/,2017-10-04 16:31:36,,"Sounds like a massive loss -- and not just for the academic / scientific community, but for his family and the people in his life who loved him. It's amazing to wonder what he would have accomplished over the next 20, 30, 40, or even 50 years of his life had he lived. Very sad.
Natural causes? What kind of natural causes gets someone at age 25? Really sad.
I don't think any of those quotes are hyperbole; that kind of publication record is pretty much unheard of, no fluff or filler either.

That's a heavy fucking hitter right there.
Sad to hear. RIP

For anyone else curious, on MathSciNet: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publications.html?pg1=INDI&s1=1115795

The arXiv is more comprehensive for recent papers, but does a poor job of distinguishing among authors with the same first and last names. (The mathematician Michael P. Cohen is included in that search, among some other Michael Cohens.)
I agree, I had never heard of Mr. Cohen before this sad news, and the only thing more shocking than his young death is the amount of respected work he produced at such a young age. He ""co-authored at least 30 published papers in the past three years""? I think I've barely **read** that many papers in the past 3 years."
