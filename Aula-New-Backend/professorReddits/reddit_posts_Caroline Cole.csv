Pass/No Pass R&C Requirement?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dn4x0j/passno_pass_rc_requirement/,2019-10-25 15:28:03,"I’m currently taking ColWrit R4B (for Part B requirement) with Caroline Cole and am doing poorly with the class, specifically with the essays. Is there anyway to change this to pass/no pass, even though CalCentral doesn’t allow me to? I would just take the P and retake the requirement.","You can’t retake Ps.
any update?
But you can take a different R1B, which makes this more complicated
But I’m not sure if I can change it to p/np in the first place..."
