Geog 20,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/19djgu8/geog_20/,2024-01-23 00:05:53,"For those of you who have taken the Geography 20 breadth with Sharad Chari, does going to lectures matter? I need to fulfill Historical Studies Breadth and this was the only class for that but I have a schedule conflict with the lectures and another class. Only attendance at Discussion matters and lecture attendance is not mandatory. All quizzes are online and the final is take home so if I'm taking it P/NP, will I be able to pass it without going to lecture but still do the readings. Thanks in advance.",
