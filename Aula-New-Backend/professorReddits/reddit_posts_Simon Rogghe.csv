R1A/R5A Recommendation,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dqtdny/r1ar5a_recommendation/,2019-11-02 17:51:21,"I am considering taking either French R1A(Susan A Maslan, Simon Rogghe) or ScandinR5A(Wellendorf) next semester. I wonder which class has a lighter workload and is easier. Does anyone taking these classes have any suggestions?","If you want an easy R1A class you should sign up for theater R1A, there is no workload at all for that class
Anyone in French R1A right now?
what do you do or learn in that class? No homework at all?"
