Paul N. Hilfinger :,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fnc5zs/paul_n_hilfinger/,2020-03-22 19:17:16,"""At this time, we have not decided within the department how we will deal with the GPA cutoff for admission to the major"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3.3 -> 4.0

RIP intended CS","He was referring to the PNP for CS prerequisites, not increasing the cap for the major.
Please understand, not decided does not mean that there are not discussions. Everyone is trying to find the most fair policy to accept and allow P/NP grades, we just have not decided what is best.
""At this time, we have not decided within the department how we will deal with the GPA cutoff for admission to the major.¬† However, I will keep all information needed to reconstruct letter grades, so as to be ready for any decision.""

Context clues my dude. He's referring to the P/NP news, not raising the cap.
I don‚Äôt think they can change anything for anyone pre-cs rn, prob class of 2024 is screwed
Not like it matters anymore the cs job market is fucked. Internships are being cancelled right now, and companies are laying off hundreds of senior devs.
i mean by how he said ""GPA cutoff for admission to the major"" sounds more like changing the cap for the major to me.
What's your opinion on 61b's grade bins being moved?

I assume they were originally moved because the department can't raise the GPA requirement post-admission without push back.

I personally believe the cap should just be raised (though, I think that's a bad idea). The deflation is harmful to students. Sure, it may be half of a letter grade, but it hurts for jobs, grad schools, etc. 

It's not the students fault. I don't think anyone's grad school or career chances should be affected because the CS is more over-enrolled this year compared to the last few.
lmao this spread of false information is why our generation is fucked not the job market

He was referring to how to incorporate Ps in the class with the cutoff. You have never been allowed to PNP major requirement before, so this is something we have to consider.

Also the reason he raised the bins in the first place was to limit admission into the major so the cap would not have to be raised, seems odd to lower the bins given that
I don't really know anything about how the bins have been moved. Though, I also try not to tell my colleagues how to do their jobs. :) 

I assume you mean raising both the requirement and average grade target? Yeah, I see that view. I think there's general push back against grade inflation, but I personally don't have strong feelings... My strong feelings are that grades are harmful writ large and so I'm kind ü§∑ about many other things grade related.
An anecdotal tweet is not really a source for your statement
i'm pretty sure he lowered the bins due to the pandemic lol
The fed is projecting 30% unemployment, and all the market indices are plummeting right now. You honestly don't think that this tweet, which is a personal account of a senior dev in a medium sized software company is indicative of what's to come? Take a look at the cscareers subredit. There are a lot of people that are losing their internships with companies also doing hiring freezes.

Prof. Hilfinger‚Äôs Contacts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17llr2o/prof_hilfingers_contacts/,2023-11-01 13:42:53,Hey everyone!

I want to reach out to Prof. Paul Hilfinger to ask for his LOR but realized that he‚Äôs retired - does anyone have his contacts by chance? Thanks sm!!,"We‚Äôre you a TA for him or something?

CS or EECS for unit ceiling at Cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16haesd/cs_or_eecs_for_unit_ceiling_at_cal/,2023-09-12 19:08:13,"Hello, 

I'm considering transferring to Cal from a CCC for EECS or CS and I'm curious about the experiences of others in managing the 5-semester timeframe set by the CoE. 

Has anyone found this time limit restrictive, especially when aiming to enroll in a series of highly rated courses such as: 

\- CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory (offered by Satish Rao or Anant Sahai)

\- CS170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (by Christos Papadimitriou)

\- CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (taught by a team including Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, and Dan Klein)

\- CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning (with Johnathon Shewchuk)

\- CS161: Computer Security (Nick Weaver)

\- CS168: Networking (Scott Shenker)

\- CS186: Databases (Joe Hellerstein)

\- CS164: Programming Languages and Compilers (Paul Hilfinger)

\- CS162: Operating Systems (Ion Stoica)

\- CS184: Computer Graphics (Ren Ng)

Would it be better to apply for CS in the College of Letters since I received most of my credits through AP or dual enrollment during HS?

I would love to take all of these courses if feasible. Would it be better to consider taking some of them (if possible) or their equivalents during graduate school instead?

Thank you!","I don‚Äôt think it matters since CS is direct admit now. It seems doable in 5 semesters.
Typically you‚Äôll want to take 2 techs a semester and transfers usually redo cs61a and Cs61C, many do 61b as well. Also, eecs16a and 16b are mandatory for EECS, so basically junior year is for lower divs. Then with three semesters left you can take 6 techs comfortably or 8/9 very uncomfortably (or using summers). There are two CCCs that can give you credit for 61C and 61B I think.
So does that mean that CS also must be completed in 5 semesters? Is it not in the College of Letters and Science?
The 5 semester ceiling is only for CoE transfer students in EECS. 

For L&S CS, you can go as many semesters as you want as long as you are under 130 units (for a single major).  In reality, it would be extremely difficult to go over say 6 semesters without going over 130 units.
No CS has a unit ceiling policy where you can keep extending if you have <= 130 units."

Exciting new Cal experience!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/farany/exciting_new_cal_experience/,2020-02-27 23:50:39,"Today marks the first time I ever cried in the Moffitt bathroom! I've heard from a lot of people that it's a uniquely essential part of the Cal experience, and that apparently everyone goes through it. I really didn't want to miss out on such an integral part of being a Bear, so when I joined Cal I knew that I just had to take this famous ""Hilfinger's 61B"" that had everyone so hyped up! I mean, literally everyone talks about it... This Hilfinger guy is also super popular--he's got nearly 2,000 students in just one class! But anyways, since I've already achieved my goal to cry in the Moffitt bathroom, I feel like I won't need to stay at Cal any longer, so I will be dropping out. I thought I'd have to stay longer to hit my goal, but it looks like now I get to save 6 whole semesters of tuition, woot wooooot. Huge thank you shout-out to Paul and his super fun midterm for helping me achieve my goal!","I‚Äôm sorry for what you‚Äôve gone through, if it helps, Hilfinger‚Äôs 61B 2nd midterm is notoriously hard (my semester the avg dipped below 50%), so, it is likely you didn‚Äôt do as bad as you might think....

On a lighthearted note, if you go to Moffitt 4th floor, and enter from the left side door while facing the bathroom, the long stall right next to the handicapped stall has an interesting record written on the wall, you should update it for future bears...
Its 8% of ur final grade, ur chillen
Also the one thing I like about Hilfinger is that he puts much more weight on the projects and hw rather than exams. If you‚Äôre a student like me, who‚Äôs always been ‚Äúmeh‚Äù on cs exams bc I was never clever enough to come up with the function solution, if you just do ‚Äúmeh‚Äù on the exams but focus on getting as many points as possible on the assignments, you‚Äôll do fine! 

Good luck!

Yikes..... I guess OP should also study hard for the 2nd midterm.... I‚Äôm sorry, but you got this!!

Reevaluate your situation! Don't drop out of college just because you didn't ace a class!! I know it *seems* like your entire life's fate depends on the CS 3.3, but even if you dont declare, you'll still have plenty of options. So many people go on to have happy, successful careers despite struggling in college. Adversity can be a good thing, because it makes us stronger in the long term.
An A-, even after bombing the second midterm. Hilfinger in 61a loved those ‚Äúrearrange a linked questions‚Äù and I could never figure them out üôÉ

I really loved Professor Beatty (he was my professor for MCB 50 and 55). He was really energetic and sassy. I also loved Professor Gibbs (she taught the second third of Bio 1A - she does it in the spring). She was teaching challenging material, but she was practically jumping around Pimentel Hall at 8 am.
For me it‚Äôs Professor Lowman he‚Äôs just so sassy in class and laughs at the chat‚Äôs chaos lmao
unpopular opinion but Shobhana Stoyanov in stats was hilarious lol, she also cared way more about her students than most professors I had during my time at Cal.
James Campbell!! Literally ran into him at a bar during dead week!!
Pete Marsden for sure
\[Disclaimer: 20 years ago, but I think he might still be around\]

Prof. Wenk in Geology.

Back in my day he organized week-long field trips out to the desert. The trip was a whole upper div course. Hiking and sightseeing all day. Every night camping with steaks and things on the campfire.

I can't recall if there was beer, but it was 20 years ago so probably.

Best class I ever took. Awesome dude.

I think we all got an A too.
Josh Hug. He has a really cool taste in music (Aphex Twin, Melt Banana).
Prof. Adhikari fs 8)
djordje popovic!!!!
Daniel Neumark 

He‚Äôs like‚Ä¶cranky AF and salty to the core.  He has the sense of humor you might expect from the captain of a crab fishing ship during a snow storm in the Arctic circle.  He‚Äôs constantly on the edge of being really pissed off but he‚Äôs just polite enough to make wry jokes at nobody‚Äôs expense.

I was going to say him as well. I‚Äôd love to get a beer with him. He was always fun in lecture, and seemed to really care about his students. I‚Äôm sure he would be amazing to hang out with outside of the school setting. Also, Jeremy Sanchez who is in the Stats department.

Ok
Paul Hilfinger
Just read the wiki article for objectivism and I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs controversial? Like the only thing I can see being remotely ‚Äúbad‚Äù is that it promotes capitalism?
Do you believe that the world would be a better (however you define better) place if more people followed your philosophy? Is this a reason why you follow this philosophy? If you were convinced that the world would not be a better place, would you feel less inclined to follow it?
considering you have the wrong year in your flair, it's not surprising your dumbass can only say 'goo goo ga ga'
yeah generally these are the only kind of responses against her (literally or in spirit)
No you can be charitable and help them if you can and in a free society nobody will stop you. I don't think her philosophy says anything against subnormal people. Also she says a person has a right to look for their self interest and may or may not chose to have wheelchair accessible store and nobody can force them. but if you want to be nice/charitable you can chose to have a wheelchair accessible store, nobody will stop you.

She called out govt spending on those and she hated govt spending of all kinds. But you cant force people to cater to them and on the other extreme cant force people to \*only\* cater to the poor, ""subnormal"" and the marginalized the way current woke left is doing.It is the \*only\* philosophy that values human talent, human creativity as the most important thing in this world that moves the world forward (and by implication doesn't especially value subnormal children or unlike left, isnt a philosophy that revolves around those).
Idc how her personal life was as long as her philosophy makes sense.

AFAIK it is the \*only\* framework that puts human mind and human creativity at its core and argues for achieving your highest potential be it science, math arts, music whatever  that moves the world forward, and is the only consistent framework from which you can derive fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, right to one's life etc. It is the only framework that talks about virtue of (rational) selfishness. Again There are so many rights with this framework that I cant see why this is not good or helpful

Similarly more things on finding meaning in this world by creating and finding meaningful relationships etc. I cant think of any other framework that is thoroughly consistent (maybe except communism but its axioms are wrong to begin with)

And she also compares her philosophy with other philosophies such as religions, existentialism, Nietszche, Buddhism, and the left and more and tells whats wrong with all of them. and I can look around the world and the whole world makes sense to me based on her philosophy.
agreed. I am trying much not to with everyone here
;-(
again name calling. why don't you give a real rational reason against her philosophy.
a true philosophy doesn't depend on if there is scarcity or not. It i like laws of physics. it works irrespective of space time and circumstance
ok
thats the thing! it has been imposed upon you through media that capitalism is bad especially in liberal circles (and the alternative is communism which nobody talks about: there is not such thing as socialism in terms of ideas a it is a mixture of two contradictory ideas.) Now capitalism only means freedom to trade without govt interference and is like freedom of speech. just like freedom of speech doesn't mean you endorse every persons speech but their right to speak, capitalism doesn't mean you endorse every business but their right to do business. I dont ee how it is bad. in a free country people have a rights and rather it is bad when you take away those rights aka communism and socialism.
absolutely the world would be an amazing place and the world is amazing today because of all the people who move it forward, who create new things and are thus objectivist in spirit. And no I don't follow it because the world would be a better place but because it is the only philosophy that talk about rational selfishness and it is in my self interest to follow it. it goes hand in hand that what is in an individuals self interest is also in the interest of the world. its just beautiful
[deleted]
Suppose her philosophy is indeed ""the true philosophy"" as many objectivists claim. Then the people who are attacking her without rational arguments are basically disorienting themselves and other people by saying things that have no rational basis.

I just find it funny how people always say communism is a good alternative to capitalism when, to my knowledge, they can never give a good example of a successful communist society. People tout communism as if they have personal experience. 
Ik I‚Äôm probably gonna be accused of being an alt for even slightly agreeing with you, but interesting nonetheless. Although that‚Äôs not to say that I agree with this philosophy - I don‚Äôt particularly like the notion that the moral purpose of life is to serve oneself (if I‚Äôm understanding correctly)
Even if you were wholeheartedly convinced that following some other philosophy would have a measurably better impact on the world, you still follow objectivism? Oh, and would you still follow it if you were convinced it was not in your self interest to follow it?
yup yup!!! we got you!
It is the only morally just way to do it that doesn't invoke anyone's rights.
>her philosophy is correct not because it derives conclusions that don't \*feel\* right to me, but because they make logical sense.

>  
>I cant think of any other religion/ philosophy that does that. christianity says you are a sinner, islam says follow Quran whatever it says, hinduism has all its mythological creatures with no consistency,
which part isnt logically sound?
so if you try to ""jerk off on your brilliance"" its fine but if someone else does it they are insecure? I literally took your attack and pointed it back at you
nah not here to preach just wanna see why people hate her so much, if they have any real arguments or is it all crack
but you didnt define the right reason.. idk how do you call it right philosophy
thats a false argument. This way you can justify anything by govt including govt killing people for greater good (say taking organs from some people to save more).

In her work, govt is there only to protect your rights such as right to life and property and thus only includes army, police and courts. Thats it. no other way to meddle in how people live their life until they are not impeding others rights)
Yes it is almost that but calling it to serve oneself would be misguided. The moral purpose is to achieve your own rational happiness (and nobody else's primarily) and working to achieve that, and from her philosophy it is achieved by pursuing your passion and changing the world for better (not for anyone else because you love living on this planet)
again it is not about the impact on the world (primarily!) but as I said in our world there are no contradictions ie.e whats good for you aligns with whats good for the world. Elon musk can only become rich by making good quality cars that help other people's lives. If he doesn't have a positive impact on the world he wont become rich.  


But to answer your second question I wont follow it if it is not in my self interest. The purpose of a philosophy is to tell a person how to live a good life. IF a philosophy doesn't do that then it is not a good philosophy and should be thrown in garbage. This is also the reason I am not a suicide bomber, communist or don't follow christianity as they advocate things that are not in my self interest.
I‚Äôm not going to argue for disabled peoples rights and right to exist anymore. Have a beautiful Sunday. :) and I totally recommend that class with rosenthal she‚Äôs not anti capitalist. I‚Äôm gonna check out some more Rand theory too!

How do we get roads? Sidewalks? Or ADA compliance?
Also communism is bad not on utilitarian grounds that it doesnt work (which btw is true) but because it takes away rights from people to their life and property which is an absilute wrong and is equivalent to slavery
Ig to me achieving your own happiness is the same as self-serving, but maybe that‚Äôs my Catholic guilt bubbling up despite being atheist lol. I like that you added the word rational, because imo it completely changes the philosophy from ‚Äúreckless pursuit of your own ideals‚Äù to ‚Äúpursuit of happiness that will not jeopardize others‚Äù
Sorry for all the questions, just trying to understand this philosophy more. So you'd say that it is impossible to become rich without having a positive impact on the world?
Cool I will check out!!    
Also the philosophy is \*for\* people's rights including disabled and they have the same rights as anyone else, nothing more, nothing less. But the philosophy is against giving some people special rights because of their extra need.
Ofcourse man. Same thing with objectivism. it is a fully developed philosophy with proofs and you can parse through the arguments to make sense out of them

ANd to some extent yes, but I think you can make sense of statements like how judges do in cases and find loogic there too, it doesnt have to be mathematical always.

yeah idk what they said but it makes sense to me and i am happy to find critiques.

and no. from your argument, there can never be a consistent framework.

And no, it says it can not be proven i.e. will have axioms which objectivism does too.

No religion is a unifying framework. All tell you do this do that or god will kill you. Thats not a consistent framework.

the reason you are contesting em on all of these basically shows we need reason to go anywhere

I agree. but the assumptions in architecture wont contradict the assumptions in particle physics. The physical reality is such that everything is consistent with no contradictions.I already said communism is consistent if you accept its axioms (one of the \*very\* few ideologies that are. But its axioms are bad and anti life. In objectivism, the basic axioms are

‚ÄúExistence exists.‚Äù‚ÄúConsciousness perceives existence.‚Äù‚ÄúAn existent is itself.‚Äù (Often referred to as ‚ÄúA is A,‚Äù or the Law of Identity.)

&#x200B;

If you accept these, then you will reach objectivism as it is a consistent framework.  


Also I feel you are trying to criticize here more than trying to see if things make sense and use the same room for both sides in all your arguments.
nah dude I have nothing to do with you!
I mean sure, if you don't have anything to say you can just keep quiet or go and learn for yourself if you are interested. idk if you call everyone negative names if someone mentions a name here, that will be quite stupid.
I mean you are still free to give it free to other people from your own pocket. but you cant ask others to give it by force without their consent. Thats looting. If you feel that strongly, open a trillion dollar company and give everyone free housing and whatever comprises their basic needs and earn more if they need more.  You only have a right to do whatever with your life and property but you cant tell others what to do with their life and property. Taking other people's property without their consent to advance what you think is right is is what Taliban does or what suicide bombers do.  In civilized society, one person or a majority cant dictate to anyone how to live their lives or what to do with their life and property
You should take rosenthals history of US capitalism while you‚Äôre at cal. Amazing class, I am anti capitalist and it gave me a much more nuanced view on it. Honestly best class I had
Good question. Her basic idea is that you don't force people for pay for something that they did not consent to (in the same way you don't force sex with people without their consent as both lead to curtailing rights of those people). According to her, roads are private and you pay for them if you use them (like many toll expressways are). She doesnt believe in ADA compliance and says a person has a right to be racist, sexist, and not accomodate any kinds of people on their private property (while she doesn't condone it, but respects their right) and says govt cant force individuals to act in any way that doesnt violate other people's rights. But in a rational society any person who can create value will be valued and even a person with a physical disability can have a very sharp mind (like Stephen hawking) and could be easily employed by an employer. So it is irrational for people to be racist, sexist  and discriminate any kind of people on characteristics that don't matter in creation of value (like race, gender, certain disabilities etc).

I am personally ok with having some preventive govt agencies (like FDA) but I honestly haven't thought too deeply about it to gauge all sides of the argument.
yes absolutely. thats a key word she adds to every thing. rational happiness and rational selfishness, which doesn't mean satisfying your whims to be happy (like doing drugs or cheap sex) or be selfish by looting others, but finding rational happiness by working to achieve rational goals that uplift your life (ie by pursuing your passion and changing the world for better by creating the best music, art, math and so on) and be rationally selfish about your life while respecting rights of others (to maintain the sanctity of rationality)
No I wouldn't say that. 

But it is impossible to become rich in a \*rational\* society without having a positive impact on the world. If your consumer is rational then will only pay for your goods if they add value to their life. And by rational i mean no govt interference or corruption.
I think the biggest issue I am seeing people have is that they don't agree with or like is if it goes against their feelings, like you \*want\* to help people with disabilities and make a virtue out it and make it a right, but her philosophy is about being consistent within itself and with reality (keeping emotions aside) and is a whole framework derived from that. So it doesn't matter how much one likes or wants things to be, the reality doesn't change based on one's feelings nor does her philosophy, but only about whats logical and whats right.

I've read Rand. I'm more interested in hearing why *you* think objectivism is the shizzle. I'd like know what you think objectivism means to you. That I can't read in a book.

&#x200B;

But more importantly, why would you challenge people to render an opposition to something you haven't made entirely clear in the first place.

&#x200B;

As to ""negative names""--again, you may not like the word crackpot but it describes Rand very well to me. Very good writer but she was a nutter through and through.
[deleted]
I understand this,  but the idea of ‚Äúcreating value‚Äù being collectively judged by a society of individualists  is really terrifying. We would absolutely have public executions of less desirables. And without wheelchair accessibility you have extremely limited who can be productive. 

If the person can‚Äôt get into the work place or private school now they‚Äôre ‚Äúunproductive.‚Äù The lack of system is a system that would marginalize people and intentionally make them ‚Äúunproductive.‚Äù  So the person in the wheelchair would have to be born rich to put a wheelchair ramp at their private school.
Yeah honestly i don‚Äôt understand why either of us are being downvoted. I don‚Äôt know much about this philosophy but I think it might be the founder that‚Äôs controversial more so than the actual belief system
but to add to it, the philosophy says one should earn things (money, reputation, etc) only by catering to rational audience as it is in your rational interest. a good person wouldnt want to earn money by cheating or fraud. money earned fair and square and for something you have created of value is something you can rationally be proud of and that is the right way to live.
If you can box the whole universe in 4 fundamental laws of physics idk why life can not have one true philosophy. And this is my personal take: I think one can enhance it a lot and add much more to it but it has some basic structure that will never change.  


There was a time freedom of speech never existed and people could have said it never will. Because ""The real world doesn't function on ideals or rules or axioms."" idk if you realize all our fundamental rights are ideal rules and we cant live as a society without them. what you are saying is equivalent of studying ideal laws of physics is useless as ""The physical world doesn't function on ideals or rules or axioms.""  In physics we literally have laws of physics that as far as we know hold true irrespective of space and time
>If you were really interested and were open to listening good parts, you wouldn't have started with calling her crackpot. I would never listen to philosophy from someone who I think is a crackpot.
Cool.
I don't agree with you. I think rational people will see that someones mental capabilities have nothing to do with their body disabilities (we literally have Stephen Hawkins as one of the most renowned and well respected scientist). And most times people are empathetic and benevolent  to people who want to rise up and do something in life and even according to her one could support such people as they represent the same values. And I think wheelchair accessibility is a very marginal topic honestly and even without mandates, most people will be accommodative. she is \*not\* saying you should hate people with disabilities and ban them.

But let me tell you how things derail if you make that a major topic. Suppose you make it super important to cater to people in wheelchair as there is nobody to take care of them and they need our support and we mandate all places to take care of them. The underlying principle is we as a society should cater to needs to people (aka the communist principle) or the utilitarian world where someone's need supersedes other person's right. This world violates people's rights and we have seen so many times how bad this world is aka communist Russia etc that are the societies run on this principle.
No I know why people hate her and her philosophy: its because she says you cant indulge in your emotions and do whatever with your life and you should live rationally to achieve the highest in you. And that puts a lot of pressure on people to do that which they don't like. They would rather get drunk and party all their lives than study, or work to make something important of their own life. and their own lack of effort and rational thought makes them hate her because it shows them the contradiction of their entire life which they would rather not see.

They hate the effort it takes to think rationally and live rationally and hate her for saying it out loud.  


But the interesting part about her philosophy is that it is a philosophy of rational selfishness and self interest, and she says it is in your rational self interest to be rational about life and live in this way because you are doing it for your own happiness and not for anybody else's. And these very people who don't follow her philosophy are being extremely unselfish and what they are doing is not in their own self interest.
Deleted my other comment cuz I didn't see this one, and it kinda answers my question. I feel like even in a rational society, there would be ways to get rich without having a net positive impact. Insider trading seems like one example, but I haven't thought through all the consequences.

But for a more pertinent question, why should I not maximize my self interest under the framework of a irrational society, and instead impose this restriction of only catering to rational audiences?
[deleted]
She's an entertaining crackpot.
Yeah I can see why people disagree, framing selfishness as a good trait feels wrong to me. Humans are inherently social creatures, and serving a greater community is supportive of such
You are doing because you are talented and you are good at it. Like why Einstein created his equations or Beethoven created his music. because they saw what they are doing is changing the wold for better (and you love living on this planet and this is our way of living here, to create things that change it for better)

It doesn't involve cheating people, stealing etc because it makes you a smaller person. This philosophy si all about being a person of high self esteem and maximizing happiness (and not money primarily) but if you do a good job, good money will follow in good rational societies.

To answer your second question, because its demeaning. You don't want to be Kim Kardarshian. Read fountainhead for example and see how Roark cares about sanctity of his work over money and he clearly says it is the most selfish thing. For him integrity of his work is more sacred than money.

agains please read as i cant explain everything here.
in physical reality there is no contradiction and if some laws are not compatible, we refine our understanding, we don't say physical reality isnt consistent.

&#x200B;

Just because society can ""function"" without it means nothing. idk even know what functioning means and validity of fundamental rights does not depend on who used it and when. Most societies have never used fundamental rights and even today few do. Doesn't make these rights any less sacred or less logical.

freedom of speech doesn't mean your words wont have consequences but you have a right to say it (and bear the consequences). i honesty dont know what you are even talking about here.

US was very close to pure capitalism in 1800s when there were almost no govt regulations and there was no income tax too (income tax was introduced in 1913).

If you feel they control people, people can stop buying from them and remove control, it is just another kind of democracy where each person who buys product from that company given them their ""yes"".

again in Us it was pretty close. And I don't think you have any scientific basis to say it doesn't work. And its not even clear what ""works"" mean here.  Pure capitalism means people have a right to trade freely and consumers have a right to buy freely. If someone doesn't like what they are into they can opt out.

But you cant tell other people how to live their life and make their decisions. In my definition ""works"" mean people have rights to their life and property and to decide how they want to live their life as long as they are not interfering with other people's life. It is only in uncivilized countries such as middle east or China or more, where people dont have rights and they cant live freely. In that respect one of my favorite slogans is from New Hamshire state: Live free or die! which I think is one of the best part about US that it is probably one of the most freedom loving country on the planet and also not coincidentally torch bearer for capitalism in the world (even if it doesn't really currently impement it unfortunately)

But I would encourage you to go to the other side ie the leftist ideology that is taking shape in US and especially on college campuses and see how bad they are. They tell you hoe to think and what to speak and id one of the most anti forward looking mindsets where they want you to appreciate traditional cultures instead of civilized countries that are built on logic., give up currency and do barter, and basically go back to stone age. The current left/woke is one of the most anti logical mindsets which also is to anticapitalism as you would expect. This should tell you what kind of choices you are dealing with: freedom vs slavery
Well its a logical framework on whats the most rational way for people to live. you can say humans are also sexual creatures but it doesn't mean you can go and rape eanyone, you have to live within the realm of rationality and whats the right thing to do. Irrespective of what kind of creature you are, you are bound by laws of rationality and it is in your best interest to follow those
Idk, why ought one not want to be Kim Kardashian? It seems like pursuing such a life (maybe not to such an extreme), would be a good way of maximizing personal happiness and self-esteem, given our current society.
[deleted]
IF you understand fundamental rights in US constitution and agree with them, you will easily see how capitalism is just another manifestation of it.
There are rational ways to express your feelings, both sexual or social, which is all this framework says is the right way to go, which for sexual it means sex as a way to express your highest \*selfish\* feelings based on right values, and in social, it means forming meaningful relationships based on right values that are in your selfish interest.
Maximizing personal happiness and self-esteem are not contingent on current society but on rational values that are valid irrespective of space and time.

Here cheap, low is not good. Only things that make you look up , almost like how when one prays, in that sense of reverence. You can look upto Einsteins equations or Galaois theory, things that increase our knowledge or make lives of people on this planet better. But you don't look upto to Kim Kardarshian. There is a way to characterize whats good but as I said I cant go into detail on this and you can read this up if you are interested.  


She talks about high in a human being in that sense and about achieving that high as the highest moral purpose of a human being
I will tell you whats wrong with ""Different contexts call for different assumptions"". Then you give space to subjectivity and can argue for and justify anything ""depending on the context"". You can say sharia law is as meaningful as US constitution its just the context is different. Even in your example, your axioms might be different in different fields but they wont contradict each other. Same in philosophy. You cant take two contradictory philosophies and apply them ""depending on the context"". Contradictions don't hold true in reality, nor in science and nor in real philosophy.  


for fundamental rights, it depends on what you mean by society and right word here should be civilized society. Even in animal kingdom you have societies but if you are talking of that level of society then its a different issue. In a civilized society every individual has  right to their right and property and others cant gang up and take your life/property away--thats jungle raj.  


And you can \*derive\* fundamental rights in objectivism from logic. Doesn't matter written by aristocrats or peasants.  


If your life depends on it you make that decision. Or leave that town and go somewhere else. Or don't interact. You are given a reality and you have the right to make decisions for yourself without force. thats what happens in a free society.  


And yes, if people with more money have more buying power thats true. and there is nothing wrong with it. 

In your hospital example, if you don't want that you can get together with a bunch of like minded people and start your own coop hospital where you decide the princes. Remember in capitalism coops are valid machines. You have the freedom to do whatever you want.  


And again to your point, in objectivism the only role of govt is to protect fundamental rights. And there is no way a rich company can control you. You can chose not to deal with it.   


On the contrary every country that has become rich on its own has done based on capitalism (without any exception). And every controlled economy has collapsed (see Venenzula or even how France is going down because of its state control). The evidence that capitalistic countries are very rich is overwhelming (hong kong, Singapore, Korea, japan, germany, US, ...... ). And the reason is very simple. Good trade is a positive sum game so when you allow unrestricted trade you increase value. if you control trade you are not letting things grow as much as they could.  


There are soooo many!!! Even today in most areas govt doesn't really control busineeses in US. But take lets say car industry across the globe. Its pretty unregulated and there is no problem. Also remember even if cartels happen in one country (which lead to higher prices) you always have competition from the outside world. But I will go further. I think you are looking at it from a ""utilitarian perspective"" i.e. if it is good for the society. objectivism considers that as a bad metric and argues that the real metric is based on matter of rights (ie Aristotelean logic) i.e. are you violating anyone's rights or not, and if not its all good even if there is cartelization or monopoly. If you do face such a situation (which you can show btw economically doesn't happen in large markets), even then it is part of your reality that you deal with and you have the option of making your own clothes, making your own products, or making your own company to compete or make a coop. but thats it. you cant tell other person how to make decision as long as they are not interering with your rights.  


If you are taking a utilitarian approach in philosophy, that leads to communism (if you are consistent with the idea). Now you see what choices you have : respect freedom and rights-- capitalism, or have utilitarian approach --communism. And the world has seen both these models.
[deleted]
I forgot to add most recent examples are India, China and Vietnam. In India for example in 1991 they removed some state controls and economy started sky rocketing and hasn't looked back since. It cant be more obvious than if you just look at these countries economies on how less regulation has lead to more growth.
exactly. in your kind of world, suicide bombers would be equally good as any other moral person. and thats the main problem. just because what people think doesn't make it right.

which parts? can you tell more?

In your town then you are making a rational decision to stay there so its fine. and you can not not know whats the world outside your town.

&#x200B;

Civilized means respecting fundamental rights of the individuals. Rand has an essay on it if you are interested. in tribal cannibal tribes no rights are respected and are thus called uncivilized. where as in civilized world there is a rational order implemented through a court of law.

Pinketers is violation of your right of privacy so illegal. And for the second case you have a right to life and property but not right to own a store or a job. if a competitor can take you out if business then you don't deserve to do that business. OR if people see your value, they will buy from local store even if it is more costly. Even big companies go out of business because of competition.

And in all those examples, the reason they got rcih is because of the free market part (as I show in India example). The data is over wheleming that the more capitalistic you go, the higher GDP per capita you get. Even today the countries with most economic freedom are one of the richest.  


France is wayyyy worse oof than Singapore. Their gdp per capita is going down (39k $ now) vs singapore (85k$). India has bigger economy than france doesnt mean india is richer than france.   


For china they liberalized their country in 78 and are getting more capitalistic where they are allowing foreign companies to manufacture and create there. Again the more capitlaism you adopt the richer you become.  


For utlitarianism I will ask you to read online as there is sooo much stuff there but as I said if you implement your idea consistently it leads to communism. so you have to be a communist then and know its implications.

You are philosophically a communist (but you don't have the guts to implement your ideas to the full extent)

and no I dont
Also I have lived in leftist circles and their ideas are EVIL. I still get angry every time someone brings those up. I know this is not an argument but it is inconceivable to me how they are mainstream on college campuses even in US which is one of the most capitalism loving countries. I did my undergrad in India in one of the top STEM schools and we never gave heed to such ideas but I think it is the humanities departments in these universities  that are corrupting the whole culture of the campuses (STEM are still much better and much saner)

How theoretical vs practical is the curriculum?
what classes have you taken so far
what was the interview question if u don‚Äôt mind
You can go either direction you want. They don‚Äôt hold your hand and teach you languages and frameworks as entire classes like other schools. Classes like 162 are like all practical whereas 170 is a theory class. Taking a handful of classes prepares you for any type of SWE job. The ML classes have a good balance of theory and practicality. Things probably lean more theory heavy as it‚Äôs a premier research university but I‚Äôve found practical uses in almost all classes
The core CS curriculum (61 series and 70) is a good balance of everything imo.  After those classes, you get to choose so it‚Äôs as theoretical/ practical as you want.

I wish I could have skipped the 16 series and done 56 instead (I applied to EECS when both majors had to take the 16 series ; this is no longer the case, only EECS does now).  16A and 16B are the only classes which feel overly theoretical imo.  Even then, they aren‚Äôt too bad and I‚Äôve learned a lot of practical skills as well.

Questions about CS courses from visiting students for 2019fall,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cbplyu/questions_about_cs_courses_from_visiting_students/,2019-07-10 18:42:01,"Hi,

I am a visiting student and is about to spend my first junior semester in UC Berkeley this fall. I am looking for some suggestions about how to do well in the following CS courses(People keep telling me that Berkeley CS courses are challenging). Because I would only stay in Berkeley for one semester, the grades really matter for me for my future application.

So I have read some of the posts about CS61B, CS188. And I am really into robotics so maybe take EECS106A into my consideration, among these three courses, how can I do and in what aspects specifically should I really put my effort in order to get high grades(>=A)?

Specifically, here is some information about these courses in 19fall:

1. 61B by Prof. Paul N Hilfinger
2. CS188 by Prof. Anca Dragan
3. EECS106A by Prof.Sosale Shankar Sastry

I found the information on Berkeley Acedamic Guide and hopefully I got the information correct.

If you have taken some of the courses above or know the professors quite well, I would really appreciated if you can offer some specific suggestions on how to success/get a decent scores on these courses.

Also, you are welcome to give other suggestions on my schedule or anything else(Whether it's too much load or anything else)!","Taking 188 or 106A will be really dependent on your college math background. If you tell us what maths you've been exposed to it would help us help you make a better decision.
Hilfinger's 61B is known for it's extremely difficult and large scale projects (dozens of hours per project even though it's a lower division class). Also his projects are all solo, so don't expect to only write the parts of the project you feel most comfortable with. Having taken it last year, even with decent programming background the class is a huge time sink so be ready for that if you take it.
All that being said, if you can succeed in the projects the grade distribution ends up being very favorable at the end of the semester.
I have taken mathematical analysis, calculus and linear algebra during my freshman year. And signals and systems and probabilities on my sophomore year. Though I got fair good grades on most of the courses, I wouldn't say that I am super good at math...Actually, I heard that 189 is really math consuming and requires deep understnading of the intuition behind math so I kind of give up on that one...

Not sure if this helps?
You should be fine then. The main prereq needed for 106A is signals/systems, and for 188 is probability. 189 does desire a much higher understanding of probability theory and linear algebra beforehand which is why it has that reputation, but some people take it without that much prior experience and do fine.
Thanks for your advice."

One student had the temerity to ask him for help with something - not understanding the assignment, but understanding what a compiler error message meant. Honest to god, Hilfinger sat down at the keyboard and helped that student fix his code.

You could also find him in his office at all hours - weekends, late at night, etc - and he‚Äôd be happy to help you then, too.
I once dropped a massive F-bomb in front of him between the Etch / Soda breezeway. I apologized because I internally thought ‚Äúoh yikes shouldn‚Äôt swear in front of an old person like that.‚Äù He brushed it off and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù

Only later would I learn that he was Paul Hilfinger.

A story for the history books, I know.
Fun fact: there are no fun facts about Hilfinger. *Only pain*
He taught Sahai 61c

He likes big butts and he cannot lie
I had a question in 164 about how to parse something in Bison that wasn't possible with the normal LR parser (I don't remember the exact details). He walked me through how GLR mode works (effectively forking the parser for all possible options like a tree and returning the one that satisfies the grammar). He then casually dropped the bomb that he actually programmed it himself...

Also it's fun to go through the extra credit problems: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hilfingr/collected-problems.pdf
Picture from the lab in Cory Hall (340 Cory?) where we did lab work for CS 164 with Paul Hilfinger in Fall 1988.  That class taught me (probably incorrectly) that pulling late nights in the lab or workplace was a Good Thing.

The fuck
‚Ä¶in which the artistic director and accompanist are both men *also* named Paul.
Wow this is honestly so cool!
>there were more women in the computer science program than there are today

Why?
*halt*
wait is this from Sp2020? The ""Blah Blah blah"" audio clip rang way too familiar!

I had Rowe. You learned more.
Chill he‚Äôs just educating his kids
Do you like big butts?

DON'T LIE!!!"
