ENGL 45B with James Turner,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/oou1n3/engl_45b_with_james_turner/,2021-07-21 09:57:37,Has anyone taken 45B with James Turner? His ratings on rate my professor weren't great but he's the only one listed to teach that class so I had to take him. Does anyone here have any experiences with him?,"Maybe you could take it in the Spring when it will more than likely be another Professor.
I was gonna do that but I need that class in order to declare in the Spring </3 So I don't really have a choice. Hopefully, he's not too bad.
I think you only need two to declare out of 45A, 45B, and 45C. I'm not sure of your situation, but maybe the other two classes work for you? Best of luck. I'm sure you will do well."
