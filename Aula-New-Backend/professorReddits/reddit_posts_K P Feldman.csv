"rate my schedule, advice/insights",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/192wjen/rate_my_schedule_adviceinsights/,2024-01-09 17:58:04,"hi! i am a freshman (2027) pre-med taking these classes and would like to know if this schedule is feasible, if you have any advice for the courses, or if you have reviews on the professors. please let me know!

* CHEM 3A - Peter Marsden
* Theater 25AC - Angela Marino
* BIO 1B -  John P Huelsenbeck, Michal Ilana Shuldman, Benjamin Wong Blonder, Benjamin K Blackman
* R1A
* Decal","This is a reasonable schedule in my opinion! Marsden has optional HW (you would still want to do it because the HW mirrors the exam) but if you don't feel like doing it you'd always have the flexibility!

BIO 1B is not set up like a weeder class compared to BIO 1A, but it is still a difficult class because of the memorization. The labs are fully done in-lab, so there's no lab report or anything like that due after class.

I haven't taken the rest but this seems very reasonable
Marsden is the best professorv
OMG! THR 25AC is going to be an absolute blast! I had a different professor for that class, but I had Angela for THR 119 and she is the absolute best! She’s really understanding about mental health, time conflicts, etc and just wants to encourage discussion :) Of course THR 25AC tends to be a bit bigger than the upper divs, but I’m sure it’ll be the same in terms of vibes :) Hope you have a great time with her!
hi! no advice but i wanted to say im also taking similar classes w bio 1b:) also pre med! we got this fr
Marsden is amazing! Have fun
The only note is that I believe the BIO 1B and CHEM 3A finals are usually back to back on the same day, but if you’re alright with that, then it looks good!
thank you so much!
what were your thoughts with THTR 119?
yes yes!!!
My class experience was a bit interesting for THR 119. Because of the events in October, our class discussions turned away from actual reading material. A lot of my friends in the class disliked it, but I previously felt like she made a safe space in the class and it was very nice to be able to talk about whatever. The only bad thing is she randomly drops assignments on you. Our final felt like it came out of nowhere. However, I had a lot of fun in the class :)"
Sproul Piano 😢,https://i.imgur.com/3RVCuzO.jpg,2023-05-31 12:46:16,,"Why? Why would someone have done this? Heartless
This is at least piano #4. I'm not surprised at all. It tends to happen over summer or winter.

No, mankind cannot have nice things. 

Give it a few weeks, someone will add a new piano.
Why can’t the world have nice things? 😵‍💫
Mann whoever did this can suck their mums I swear. Loved hearing ppl play on this piano after a hard finals ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
shame
Least vandalized Berkeley public property
It's wild how there are always a few people out there who just want to destroy stuff for no reason. They make having a truly free society impossible.
Damn, that's frustrating
I'm over fucking People's Park. Somebody needs to get those people the help they deserve as human beings because right now students fear for their lives going back and forth to class. I grew up around Berkeley and People's Park is just not what it once was. It is full of violent people with mental health problems who need help!!! I hate that people are still clinging onto this old idea of a hippie park where peaceful protests would happen/people would gather. That shit doesn't happen anymore! Now people just get assaulted! Wake up fr get these people into treatment centers and build housing there. I'm SO over it.
Man. I liked hearing that when walking through Sproul.

Whoever did this is a genuine asshole.
Sad :(
![gif](giphy|fGOjgWRzQkC2sHHnq7)
Dang this is what Fox News always complain about us for
Pave People’s Park
☹️☹️☹️
Canadians leaving their mark!
That hand has an extra finger.
AH YES FINALLY A PIANO I CAN PLAY
chaos.
From counterculture to crackhead.
Sorry but this took some time to vandalise, what was security/UCPD doing? You also got to think that there was CCTV covering this and it is not as if UCPD had to go far....
Have that same cup
This has happened basically every year for the last 5 years. It always sucks. Freecycle and Trashnothing may have some pianos available if someone can transport one.  


Side note: Why are y'all making this a People's Park issue?
Kudos to those of you who actually think someone from peoples Park did this.
This is reality lol
Let’s be real here.  I love playing that piano at night or between classes, and last time I went to play it it looked good to go but was functionally useless, probably due to people playing it like a damn drum set.  A piano out in the public will lose a key here or there but it was already basically useless with whole octaves no longer functioning by finals week, while looking like maybe one or two keys would probably not work.  That it looks like this now is just a visualization of its already existing subsurface uselessness.  It’s ultimately good that this broken piano is visibly useless so the people who graciously take it upon themselves to install pianos on Sproul are more likely to know that it needs replacing.
So sad!! That piano has been there and enjoyed by all for several years. 😢😔
This is sad
At UCSB, by Sands Beach, someone put a piano. I played it several times, was so lovely. Within two weeks it’s keyboard looked like this. 

I figured it wouldn’t last long, being in the weather and all. But somebody just decided to destroy it.
what brand is it anyone?
A couple of the local meth heads got bored.
I hope so! 😢
Well, you can, just not there..
They’re likely mentally unwell. They need social services.
Same kids who ripped up erasers for no reason in class
they hate to hear it
Build us another basketball court and community garden open 24/7 to the public in the same neighborhood then. 🤷🏽‍♂️
We literally had a whole series of concerts these last year but pop off sis you know best. You know folks from the neighborhood use the park tho right?
Build housing on it
Pave peoples park!!
what does that have to do with the piano
so brave 👏
It’ll be back. We’re on like the 5th piano now. He gets destroyed every final season, TBH.
just not in the most educated and socially conscious city in the world
Which Reagan and the GOP took away over 40 years ago and no one has ever restored.
Y’all are like vegans. That’s all we hear from the vocal anti-park minority.
Ur delusional 😂
For what? Shooting up?
does it really need to be said? most of us are capable of putting 2 and 2 together lol.
Peoples Park activists brought the second piano to campus 🤷🏽‍♂️
Great example of the Paradox of Tolerance in action. We are so tolerant and socially conscious that we welcome people who are hopelessly antisocial and intolerant...and now we’re paying the price.
And humble too
You forgot to say that they revere the arts as well but that’s cool. I guess in a sense this lowly piano is art too and says something as well when your statement is taken into context.
How does lived experience make me delusional. Don’t you think the ones sucking UC’s Oski, brown nosing the blue and gold and not having actual experience are the delusional ones 😮‍💨
Dude your dorm mates probably snort adderall and your frats are assaulting people nonstop. Students are just as fucked up if not worse cause you know better and can do better but you just complain on Reddit. Like… get off the high horse already.
the piano has old paint on it mentioning peoples park so the implication is that it’s peoples parks fault that the piano is missing some keys?
I like that. In my own personal experience I’ve found that absolute tolerance has led to enabling and disastrous choices for some friends of mine who dropped me because I would draw a line for what I believed was their own personal well-being. I’m not sure where that line is in society and honestly I’m glad Berkeley exists as it does to show us whatever it is we want to take away from it. To me, no place is perfect of course, but some do certainly have issues that aren’t as prevalent in other areas. It’s always a give and take though and one has to find the place they enjoy in my book.
Thanks for the ad hominem. I'm actually a woman and don't live in the dorms. If students are just as bad as the people in People's Park, maybe you should try your luck staying there? If it's just as safe as a dorm? Let me know how it goes!
lol there's no point in arguing with someone so blatantly blind to the truth. I think we all know that there's a pretty high chance that whoever vandalized the piano was a mentally-ill and/or drug addicted individual that places like peoples park attract from all over.
What is your major so I can judge you.
What is your major so I can judge you.
Compassion is nice but too much turns into enablement
I’m literally always there. And the fact you think “shooting up” is anything except pain relief is shameful. Please if you don’t like it you shouldn’t be at Berkeley. You are suppose to have a good education to get in. That means BASIC understanding of social issues including drug addiction. Students like you are bad and lack empathy. Still makes you a frat bro cause you’re no different.
Usually it’s people who are angry about finals. Not everyone at People’s Park are ill. Folks from People’s Park always play on that piano hence the graffiti 🙄
how do we know that a mentally ill person who lives in peoples park vandalized the piano? what is this based off of? vibes? how do you know random hooligans didn’t do it?
You are totally delusional if you think the perpetrator was a UC Berkeley student"
this year has given me a new perspective on chronic absenteeism,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jwakjg/this_year_has_given_me_a_new_perspective_on/,2020-11-17 22:12:10,"(Disclaimer: the following is probably super obvious to a lot of bears who weren't as sheltered as I was growing up, and probably to many who were just as sheltered). 

This year has been a quantum downgrade in terms of accessibility. I've parked in people's driveways to mooch wi-fi, and today I lost power an hour into my math midterm. After an entire (pre-college) academic career of near-perfect attendance, I have missed about 1 out of every 5 days of class this semester because of power/wifi outages. 

As I struggle to catch up, I'm recognizing in myself a lot of behaviors that I once (privately) wrote off as laziness or ineptitude in others. I'm taking F's on homework assignments, asking for extensions, and generally coming off as a fool in discussion sections where I've missed key parts of previous lectures.

Obviously this is college, and it'd be a bit of a firehose even under normal circumstances-- I get that. 

But missing 20% of my scheduled class/instruction time is clearly making things harder. It's driven home to me just how easy it is for someone to fall behind because of circumstances beyond their control, and even more importantly, how hard it can be to catch up. I'm facing mental and emotional barriers like I've never seen before. I can't imagine going through this during my early developmental years, I think it would have destroyed me.

Looking back on K-12, I realize that most of the burnouts and dropouts weren't any lazier or dumber than average. The gap between me and them was almost entirely circumstantial, but it grew enormously as time went on, and that feels like an indictment of something.

I'm still praying that CoE goes P/NP, but it's hitting me that there is no P/NP equivalent for elementary, middle, and high schoolers who were going through this (and much worse) pre-COVID.","I love this post. I had the exact same perspective on life as you did until this year hit. I would simply write off others as simply being too lazy or not working hard enough....more people need to understand the fact that not everyone has equal access to opportunity. The same applies to mental health as well. Also keep your head up OP, you're doing great...don't compare yourself to others...semester is almost over!
Great perspective. I've been tutoring an elementary school student (along with other volunteers helping other students) in a Bay Area high poverty school district facing the issues you mention. The opportunity gap is large and growing with distance learning. A shocking number of the students have trouble connecting due to internet issues, device issues (old computers from the school break), and family circumstances that make it hard for them to keep to an online school schedule. Attendance and homework submission rates are extremely low. My heart breaks. As an alum, I hope that all ""successful"" adults realize that fortunate life circumstances played a huge role, that we are all one community and to give back when able.
This was my whole middle->high school experience, and even a bit in college. At a certain point I did just give up and it took years for me to get back on track. I’m really glad you had a moment of self-reflection on it. Not glad that you’ve gone through it—I wouldn’t wish it on anyone—that you’ve grown from it.
wow I fucking love this post - im so sorry OP
I love that you shared how these factors beyond your control impacted your performance, as someone who's never had performance issues.  And I really love that you recognize how much invisible privilege you took for granted all your life, and likely never would have understood, had you not been subject to those forces.  You're at Cal, so it's a given that you're a smart cookie, but those things still slipped by unnoticed, because that's how privilege works.  When having advantages is built into your life, and always there, and you have no exposure to what it's like to have to do with out them, it's really easy to not understand how much of a difference they make.  

I hope everyone has been understanding, and that things resolve ok, and that you can get on with being the terrific Cal student/grad you are going to be.  But you've already learned such invaluable things, that will serve you so well for the rest of your life.
OP

Great moments of self-awareness in your writing. 

I empathize with your experience of extra challenges due to Covid-19 and this fucked up year 2020. 

Allow yourself to stay as close as possible to your intended course, and reposition your compass when the situation normalizes, as will like happen in school by Fall 2021. 

In the meantime, learn as much as you can. To the extent that the circumstances have dragged you down   some, see what you can do to make up the missing work. Do the ones that are not late first, unless your need the earlier knowledge to complete. Reach out to the GSI first and the professor if necessary. Explain you situation and your desire to get back on track and let them know you want to submit. 

Good luck and keep your head up.
You just described the experience most marginalized folks go through. I remember being in high school and going through a home foreclosure—we were evicted. I was written off as a lot of things including lazy...etc.
Do they not record lectures? I also have shitty wifi, but I just rewatch them later. Maybe ask your professors to record.
Most profs record lectures, and I fit them into my schedule to watch later. Online assignments/quizzes/midterms/office hours/discussion sections are a bit trickier to pull off async tho
Some classes don't record on purpose. Some of them have legit reasons like one of my classes is basically just a giant group project. But some classes aren't recorded because the professors think students should be punished for not attending class.
Have you tried to get a hot spot from STEP? 

I'm sorry. I'm not trying to give unsolicited advice. I just hate that you're dealing with this and would love to find a fix. I'm a soc major so our professors are all very understanding. I hate that other majors don't have such kind professors."
I wanna do cs61c but...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nlr87s/i_wanna_do_cs61c_but/,2021-05-26 13:53:30,"I'm not a Berkeley student. 

And you need a Berkeley account to view lectures and the autograder. 

I noticed that there are optional readings assigned from the K&R and P&H books. 

How closely do the lectures follow the books? If  I did the relevant readings, will I be able to do the labs/hw/projects? I could look for others implementations on GitHub instead of the autograder. 

Alternatively, if anyone knows any quality MOOC(s) which covers similar content to 61c, it would be great? 

Thanks!","Look at a past semester of CS61c (specifically, before the pandemic).

https://cs61c.org/fa19/#lectures for instance. Notice that the lectures are actually [all public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_hXH5-tbM4&list=PLkFD6_40KJIxaAvX0p_ZnB7915Ua-ggU0&index=3) for these. It's that the later ones are weird zoom lectures is why they're locked behind canvas.

Yeah, you won't get the autograder. No way around that; the university has to pay gradescope for server space to run that.

 Good practice, though, to write your own unit tests. And yes, you can also check the github solutions which shouldn't exist but nonetheless do.
For self-study purposes, I think it would be fine if you treated the slides sort of like a textbook alongside the Discussions

&#x200B;

Project 1 you may be able to run the code after some finessing with a Mac or Linux system (maybe Visual Studio on Windows, but I never tied...yet), for both Philphix and Game of Life

Project 2 CS61Classify is RISC-V emulated via Java, so you should be able to use it

Project 3 uses [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) to make the Computer Architecture circuitry using Boolean values and Forwarding techniques (circuit knowledge optional, but good practice in circuits helps a lot)

Project 4 requires an Intel CPU and OpenMP, and I tried doing a custom Makefile for my computer and another project, and it was painful. Unfortunately, while you can code it, you can't run it. You may find the concepts useful towards an NVIDIA CUDA kind of program, which via Visual Studio is possible.

&#x200B;

I would say the lectures are pretty detailed enough without too much textbook fluff; very to the point, but otherwise I myself don't recommend any of their listed textbooks, except the C textbook they have (it's pretty good)

&#x200B;

For the first 1/3, it is the C and memory management portion. [MIT OCW 6.087](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-087-practical-programming-in-c-january-iap-2010/) is very helpful here

For the RISC-V portion of the course (middle 1/3), [MIT OCW 6.004](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/index.htm) may be helpful

The last 1/3 on Parallelism, [MIT OCW 12.950](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-950-parallel-programming-for-multicore-machines-using-openmp-and-mpi-january-iap-2010/index.htm) is more related, but I never used it (plus we use Intel SIMD, and MIT OCW course doesn't teach that)
Look at summer 2020 version. By the way I want to take this course. We can start it now I have already taken cs61a and cs61b
EDIT: Just tried to watch lecture videos beyond the first lecture and it seems like you need permission to access the video (I assume only those with Berkeley emails have permission?) :(

Thanks, good to know i can view the lectures! If you have any idea, it would be really helpful to know if the readings closely follow the lecture material too
Unfortunately, as mentioned in one of the replies to a comment [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fhEE4J4QCps), most of the lecture videos aren't made public
Thank you, seems like a lot of configuration will be needed to set up my system, not to mention the lack of lecture videos and official solutions. I'll consider finding alternatives and the MIT links you've provided. Much appreciated
Yeah, I was thinking summer 2020 would be best given that the lectures are available.

I've decided to wait a bit, still have cs61b to finish off. But please do update if/when you've started and made some headway. It would be really helpful to know how you've got along!

what's changed then 😏
wild how things change . . . I remember being salty af that they implemented the “one late withdraw with no record on the transcript” the year after I graduated smh lol
essentially professors had a grading curve that they had to meet for their classes, and since most classes were notoriously easy the curve was extremely harsh and detrimental towards ones gpa - you could score a raw 96 in a class but receive a A- all because everyone did very well in the class - it made it so one small mistake could be the difference in a letter grade
3.2 mean
Now it's two. And everyone got those 2 ""new"" late withdrawals in like Fall 2020 whether they had used their 1 or not beforehand. Man, I would've taken like CS 162 twice if I knew that was gonna happen.
That’s crazy lmao . . . I mean I guess it makes sense because Covid or whatever but 3 free passes to mess up is still pretty generous at a place like Cal"

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
Open team in Dynasty Baseball League,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35vah9/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league/,2015-05-13 13:25:13,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. This isn't an all Berkeley league, but I figured this would be a great opportunity to meet other baseball fans at Cal.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward. 

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete). 

The team roster is below. The minors system is pretty barren and the roster has too many bench offensive pieces, but there's a great deal of elite talent here. A smart owner could turn this team into a contender in short order, either through rebuilding or with a shorter term strategy. Reply or PM me if you're interested!

ECON major 1st year cource choices,https://i.redd.it/co3hnhiw4l3d1.jpeg,2024-05-30 08:50:04,"HELLLOO, please help me choose my cources for the first year to declare an economics major. ","The first question is - what are you bringing over from HS in terms of college credit? Any Calc? Any English?
I do A levels so i believe I am not bringing in any credits
I do Maths and Econ my bad
Will you be required to take any classes in the calc series? Math 1A/B? If not, definitely avoid them. Same with econ 1/2 if you can help it. If you've passed out of both of those I believe all you'll need to take is intro stat and one upper division econ course between Macro and Micro. I'd sign up for intro stat your first semester, and one of the upper division classes (100A/B) second semester, dependent on who is teaching. I took stat 20 my first semester, and with a HS stat background it was fine.
So when you say Math, do you mean you’re going to get college credits for the equivalent of 1 year of Calc?  ie Calc 1 and Calc 2?  You probably want to check first, you might not want to repeat stuff you’ve already gotten college credit for already. (A lot of students do repeat stuff though). 

So your Math and Econ prereqs might already be done. For Stats, usually people default to taking STAT 20, but I recommend taking Data C88S as your requirement. But in order to take that class you also need to take Data 8, either as a prerequisite or as a co-requisite.  IMO learning Python via Data 8 is somewhat more in vogue than learning R via STAT 20.

The intermediate Econ classes, you’re not eligible to take until later on.
Also, a ton of Econ students these days tend to minor or double major in Data Science, of which Data 8 is a requirement. Something to think about.
is it possible to double major in ds if accepted into l&s?
It is possible, but no one really knows the outcomes and odds of switching to/double majoring in CS/DS/Stats until next year. You apply, go thru a comprehensive review and wait and see."

Wildfire Air Quality and PPE Infothread,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9xal9s/wildfire_air_quality_and_ppe_infothread/,2018-11-15 04:03:23,"EDIT: - MOVED TO [MEGATHREAD COMMENT](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9xfjew/megathread_air_quality_megathread_complain_about/e9rwm8l/)

Sup Berkeley - instead of studying for my midterm I thought I'd help put together a bit of an information post regarding the wildfires and respirator masks so you don't have to put in the time to ~~procrastinate~~ research. Reposting because I got caught in the spam filter the first time around.

Perhaps even useful for future wildfires - this won't be the last time California is on fire.

&#x200B;

*TL;DR summary* \- Awareness by checking fires and AQI, and buy/wear a valved **N95-rated respirator** (NOT a regular surgical mask) and **ensure a proper fit/seal** if you don't want **short or long term respiratory problems/failure**.

&#x200B;

**GENERAL INFO**

**What's on fire right now?**

[Official California wildfire maps here](http://www.fire.ca.gov/general/firemaps). A colored highlighted section will appear when a fire perimeter for a significant fire is created, like the current Woolsey fire in Southern California.

&#x200B;

**Tell me about the Air Quality Index (AQI)?**

[Official EPA AQI website here.](https://airnow.gov/) The AQI is a metric used to measure air quality and certain pollutants, such as PM2.5 and ozone.

You should wear a respirator for an AQI of about 150 or above.

&#x200B;

**What is PM2.5?**

PM2.5 refers to fine dust particles less than 2.5 microns/micrometers in diameter - these are the particles that come from heavy pollution (see: China) and wildfires (see: California). In short, they damage your respiratory systems like no tomorrow (depending on concentration and duration of exposure) for both short term (asthma, heart attacks) and long term (respiratory disease risk increase). [Source.](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.particle) [Source 2.](https://blissair.com/what-is-pm-2-5.htm)

&#x200B;

These particles are **microscopic** and cannot be seen, which means the best way you should check if you need to protect from it is to check an official AQI source, NOT simply check if it's smog/smokey outside. (FYI context - the average virus is 0.3 microns in size.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**RESPIRATOR MASKS**

**What protective equipment do I need? (mask vs. respirator)**

A respirator is a mask intended for filtration of particles and/or chemical (gas) - this ranges from disposable respirators to full blown ""gas masks"". There's essentially three types - disposable, half mask, and full mask.

[https://x9b1f1ulw2g31537u1gl95q1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Types-of-respirators.jpg](https://x9b1f1ulw2g31537u1gl95q1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Types-of-respirators.jpg)

&#x200B;

A surgical mask, like the kinds given out in hospitals, are intended to protect other people from the wearer (think: sneeze guard). They do not filter PM2.5 particles and are minimally useful/practically useless for particles.

&#x200B;

**What do respirator mask ratings (N95, P100) mean?**

This is a American NIOSH standard by the CDC that tests and certifies a certain filtration rating. There are two parts - **a letter (N, R, P) and a number (95-100).**

&#x200B;

The first letter refers to how oil resistant the mask is. The number refers to the percentage of particles filtered out by the mask (95 - filters 95% of airborne particles *0.3 microns or larger*, 100 filters out 100%).

The minimum recommendation for general wildfire protection is N95. If you're extremely sensitive, perhaps consider a 100 rating filter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Buying a respirator?**

(Edit: Seems people are having trouble finding respirators in stock even online. I recommend mixing up search terms between disposable/non-disposable masks and different NIOSH ratings higher than N95.)

&#x200B;

*Where:*

Typically respirators are sold for construction/workplace use - check pharmacies (Walgreens) and hardware stores (Ace Hardware, Home Depot). They also typically sell out within a day of an air emergency announcement, so either stockpile ahead of time or ship it online ASAP via Amazon One-Day (or 2-hour Prime Now if lucky).

*What:*

Stick to name brand - 3M is the best. Averages $1-2/each for a disposable N95 mask, usually in bulk packs.

Half masks (3M 7500 series) are generally one size fits all (but have small, medium, and large options (3N 7501, 7502, 7503 respectively)) and have better sealing against your face, with options for various cartridges.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

About exhalation valves - some have them and some do not. As long as they're rated properly (N95) it will work, but the valve is for quality of life :

1. You will be breathing harder trying to inhale air through the mask filter material- the one-way valve will help with exhalation.
2. Exhalation valves reduce temperature and humidity buildup under the mask (\~15 degrees reduction). Without it, you'll be uncomfortable and will want to take it off under prolonged use.

&#x200B;

**How do I wear a respirator?**

The most important thing is to ensure a **PROPER SEAL AGAINST YOUR FACE -** otherwise they perform **just as poorly as a surgical mask, or no mask at all**. Your respirator needs to have at least two bands, for the upper back and lower back of your head. Facial hair affects sealing -  shave or use petroleum jelly on it to seal against your mask.

&#x200B;

Perform a fit test:

The mask should cover all of your nose up to the bridge, and down to a bit of a lip around the bottom of your chin.

[Disposable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kIYxfJXfhc&feature=youtu.be&t=1m5s) \- there should be a metal piece for fitting snugly against your nasal bridge.  Breathe in, and feel for airflow around the edges.

[Half/Full Mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtHi03dFno) \- block the input filter(s) with your hands and then suck in — if you’re getting any air, that means it’s sneaking in somewhere. You should also notice the mask sort of cave in as you create a vacuum inside.

&#x200B;

**Bonus - HOME AIR FILTRATION**

Firstly, keep windows and doors shut.

Air purifiers with HEPA filters are [""rated for 99.97% of particles that have a size greater-than-or-equal-to 0.3""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA), which can filter PM2.5 particles.

If you don't have a dedicated HEPA air purifier but do have a box fan, [you can stick a HEPA filter on a box fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU) for reasonable results relative to the cost.

&#x200B;

If there's more info to add or correct, feel free to comment and I'll edit this. Hope this helps everyone - stay safe out there.

&#x200B;

Edit: Added sources and recommendations for buying respirators when out of stock.

Which type of filter should I choose for wildfire?
AC for temperature/humidity regulation?  Not sure what you mean by that, but if you meant for airflow exchange with the outside world, I believe that every building has central air intakes that circulate air into the building, and there are air filters over these intake openings. Depending on what you or your landlord bought, the filters over these intake openings should be good enough to filter particles of concern. Far better than an open window.

&#x200B;

I'm not an expert at home ventilation though. I do know that there is no such thing as an air-tight home, which is why running a HEPA air purifier to clean up any bad air getting in through the cracks is a decent idea.
Anything with the NIOSH particulate rating of N95 or better. See ""**What do respirator mask ratings (N95, P100) mean?""** section above.

&#x200B;

The bit about the organic vapor is for chemical filtration - not necessarily needed for our case. The N95 rating is for particulates, which is what you want for the wildfire smoke.

&#x200B;

Also double check it fits the respirator you have/are buying."
