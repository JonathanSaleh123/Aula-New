Advice on Spring 2021 Course Schedule + Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jg65ml/advice_on_spring_2021_course_schedule_professors/,2020-10-22 12:05:17,"I’m a freshman and am trying to transfer to COE for either MechE or CivE. I looked on rate my prof and there were some professors that had ratings and some that didn’t show up. Some of the ratings were for other classes the professor taught so I’m not sure if it all applies. If you have any advice on this schedule or the professors teaching these courses or the courses in general please let me know.

Spring 2021

-Chem 1A (Alexis Shusterman)

-Chem 1AL (Michelle Douskey)

-Math 53 (Zvezdelina Stankova)

-Engin 26 (Kourosh Youssefi)

-some r#b course
  
  - French R1B (Trevor Sanders)
 
  - Italian R5B (Mia Fuller) 
 
  - Asian American Studies R2B (David Pham)
 
  - Environmental Design R3B 

TLDR: pls give experience with any of these profs/classes","I'm taking math 53 and chem 1a/1al right now. As far as I can say, chem 1a/1al is a bunch of busy work, that might not all be fun or engaging or interesting or even intellectually stimulating at times, but it really requires you to be on your feet at all times. To be successful in that class, you gotta just either know the material beforehand or just watch a bunch of youtube videos on the topics, either from khan and organic chem tutor. Nothing from lectures has helped me anyway. As for math, it's been ok. As long as you read the book and do the hw, you should be ok.
I took E26 with Youseffi and it's a somewhat low workload class, especially if you already have experience with CAD. If you don't have experience, then the labs may take you a bit longer to complete. I didn't have CAD experience and I found the labs somewhat ok after asking for help from my GSI and friends. There aren't any midterms/tests but the final was tough. People who do have CAD experience find the class fairly easy so it depends on your background. I recommend going to lab sections if you need help.
Ok, thank you!
Ok, thank you!"
IEOR + Haas/DS incoming freshman fall class,https://i.redd.it/so7s7pvs983b1.jpg,2023-05-31 08:36:41,Is this courseload managable? if not which one should i cut? thankss,"IMO physics isn't a class you should prioritize, since it's not needed for most IEOR breadth classes and it may hit your GPA hard. To give you an idea i didnt do my physics till junior year lol.

I'd prioritize D8/61A instead (if you wanted another class), otherwise you may just wanna drop 7A and not add anything else since your first sem is gonna be a transition and your other classes aren't easy either IMO.
Don't do Physics yet
You’ll be busy the whole semester but it’s doable
I’d drop physics
No, take into account office hours and the time you need to study + internships and extracurriculars

Unless you’re a physics whiz, physics will actually take you a lot more time than is actually listed on your schedule to get you to score high enough around the averages"
