course reviews (from a mostly humanities-based undergrad),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w89tt5/course_reviews_from_a_mostly_humanitiesbased/,2022-07-25 21:13:08,"hello, i’m quite bored at the moment so i thought i might write about all the classes i’ve taken so far and maybe it’ll be helpful for future reference.

just for some context, going into my freshman year (currently a rising sophomore) i was hoping to double major in art practice and architecture. so here’s my experiences so far :)

ENVDES 1 (intro to environmental design):
wasn’t really sure what to expect with this class. took it bc of the lower division pre-reqs for ced (college of environmental design). discussions and assignments were pretty heavy on observation drawings although they claimed that drawing skill was not necessarily being judged. lots of talk about things like “what is space? what are places?” way more theoretical than i expected. a couple of group/partner assignments. expect a lot of readings too. was quite a lot for a 3 unit class to be honest.

ART 15 (ceramics foundations)
one of my favorite classes ever. if you’re an underclass man trying to take studio classes go email the professors individually or raty (the art advisor) and they can possibly get you on the waitlist. that is how i luckily got in during my first semester. prof was super nice (emma logan) so sweet. you can tell she cared a lot about encouraging her students to grasp new skills and put creative ideas into reality. she was always willing to answer any questions and was super understanding and compassionate in general. i’d never had any experience in ceramics either but as long as you put some effort you’ll get an A.

LY C70 ? or EPS 20( earthquakes in your backyard)
forgot the actual class code, but took this for l&s physical breadth. probably one of the easiest A’s i’ve ever taken too. highly recommend if you’re looking for an easy breadth. i took this course entirely asynchronously but i feel like it would be just as easy in person. quizzes were very direct and correspondent with lectures and i learned a lot so i appreciated that class.

FILIPINO 1A & 1B (intro tagalog)
took this for fun + i needed extra units. does not feel like 5 units at all. easy A as well and i can proudly translate/speak basic sentences now lol. love the prof with my whole heart (tita joi) she is super understanding and accommodating to students’ needs. also took these classes fully online but i feel like the energy and participation would be much better in person.

PHILOS 12A (intro to logic)
took this for philosophical breadth bc i thought it would be interesting but kind of kicked my ass. to be fair, i was lacking attendance a lot so it was hard for me to catch up but everything was just generally confusing to me. very math-based and proof heavy which i was not prepared for in a philosophy class. professor (holliday) was great but i was honestly just hoping for an easy class. took it p/np and thankfully passed but there was some crazy curve on the final.

ENVDES 5 (cities & sites)
i believe this was the first year this class was offered. had two professors (castillo & hood). lectures were pretty interesting but readings were also quite heavy. they claim to take the reading load back a few notches for future classes but i have no idea how that’ll play out. no studio drawings or observations like ED1 but there was no final. your whole grade is based on pop quizzes and 2 projects which is a little scary. but the project prompts were pretty fun imo (coming from an art major). not too sure if it was just as enjoyable for people who are not a big fan of drawing.

HISTART R1B (art history r1b)
your average writing class. i feel like for the art history department the topics are super niche so it’s kind of a wild card as to which gsi you get. but i think it was a nice break from the rest of my classes. grading methods were a little questionable and they claim participation is a huge part of class but i’m a quiet person and still got an A. 

ARCH 98BC (architecture berkeley connect)
took this out of interest for the architecture major. was actually quite fun and nice to talk to to other people thinking about switching majors. got a very cool tour of wurster through the studios and even to room 1000. very helpful q&a’s from alumni, staff, directors, etc. def recommend if you’re on the fence about architecture.

hope this helped someone and my pm’s are open for any other questions :)","lol you took logic thinking it was easy

As a philosophy major, thanks for the laugh.
ENV DES 1 is a really fascinating class conceptually but it definitely isn’t worth taking unless you need it for a CED major because it’s just a huge weekly commitment and the course staff can be extremely hit or miss. Some of my interactions with the GSIs were pleasant but the lecturer (Nathan John) was frankly insufferable and made the course way harder than any intro class should be.
I love that u made this list thank you ur so generous!:)
I KNOW i was walking into a trap. had a 46 in the class at some point lol. can’t imagine being forced to take it for letter grade
Agreed - depending on the lecturer and on your GSI, ENV DES 1 can be a completely different extra every semester. 

Quality of lectures for CED undergrad can vary drastically - I felt like they keep a lot of the good faculty for mostly grad programs. ENV DES 4 typically has good faculty teaching it though - and it's nice you got to take a class with Walter Hood! He's fun
I can't talk too much shit. My dumb ass took it in the *summer*."
