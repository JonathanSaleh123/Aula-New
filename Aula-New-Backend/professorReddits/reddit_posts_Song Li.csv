Grey's Anatomy, Christiana Yang (Sandra Oh) gets her PhD from Berkeley :')

If we’re going outside of movies, I was really surprised to see a brief reference to (a future) Berkeley in Cyberpunk 2077!
TV show: In House MD, Dr Kutner (Kal Penn) went to Berkeley for his undergrad. Irl Kal Penn went to UCLA but is good friends with John Cho who did go to Cal


Another TV show: in Monk, Adrian Monk is a Cal grad
Pixar's Soul
10 Things I Hate about You. The Stiles character is obsessed with getting into Berkeley.
If your list includes any reference to Berkeley at all then you can add United 93. Mark Bingham was a passenger on that flight and was a Cal alum. They portray him in the film wearing a Cal hat.

Good Will Hunting - they mention Ted Kaczynski teaching at Berkeley
Gregory Peck went to Berkeley!

He was one of the biggest actors of his time and was in To Kill a Mockingbird as Atticus.
The tailor's store in Soul is based on Advanced European Tailors in Berkeley

Sopranos too

George takei?! Ohhhhhh myyyyy didn’t know that
Also, forgot that Korean actress Choi Hee-Seo (최희서 ) was also a Berkeley student (Performing Arts).
Monsters University, what a reference to Berkeley lol
The Graduate?
If you wanted to include famous HK actors, you could include veteran actor Kenneth Tsang Kong(曾江)(School of Architecture), most noted for his role in A Better Tomorrow and his many numerous appearances in Jackie Chan movies.  Also Terence Yin Chi-Wai (尹子維) (Philosophy), also a HK veteran actor, most noted for having a famous actress mother.
Chunk from The Goonies (Jeff Cohen) went

Basic Instinct has a mention too
Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park is a visiting biology lecturer at Berkeley!
Boys and Girls, a late 90s rom com that is pretty pedestrian, but is notable that it actually is almost entirely shot on location on campus and in SF, and not at UCLA with b-roll and establishing shots. I think this is the most I've ever seen of campus in a studio movie. Use of geography is very wacky though, the main characters hang out in SF and the Marin headlands all the time.

Also, kind of cheating, but the legendary documentarian Frederick Wiseman has a 4 hour documentary called ""At Berkeley"", detailing student life and the administration over one academic year.
If you guys are trying to brag about Berkeley entirely and all the ""smartness"" in the movie ""Arrival"" with Amy Adams when the aliens arrive and the U.S secret services don’t know what else to do they go for Americas most smart linguist (Amy Adams) to decode the alien's speech sounds and what they want to communicate, Amy Adams declines, and secret services leave for their 2nd option... and she says when you go to Berkeley ask professor (can’t remember the name) what does (can’t remember) means in (can’t remember). Still, they go back to her for the answer which was cow shit, proving she was better than the linguist Berkeley professor for the job.

The movie is not trying to put in 2nd place Berkeley. Still, they go with her first because I believe she was working with the government before but lost her child or something and they wanted to know if she was ready, but she wasn’t, but then after some days she was and a helicopter lands on her patio to take her to the alien's site.

The director is Denis Villeneuve who did Blade Runner! the movie made over 200million in the box office, and it has high scores on rotten tomatoes, meta critic, imbd etc... it’s a must-watch IMO
Agent Lindsay in T-Men (Dir. Anthony Mann, 1947) graduated from Berkeley.
[*Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home*

Spock apparently spent too much time with the Mormons during the Free Speech Movement ;)
Not sure if someone already said this one but Basic Instinct !!

Not a Berkeley reference in a movie but here's a [list of movies filmed on location at UC Berkeley :)](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=University%20of%20California,%20Berkeley,%20California,%20USA&ref_=ttloc_loc_13)

[Finals (a 2019 short film) - Filmed at UC Berkeley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11492858/?ref_=rvi_tt)

In The Age of Adeline (2015) Ellis mentions his sister goes to Berkeley.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvAFPHLFMa0&ab\_channel=YouTubeMovies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvAFPHLFMa0&ab_channel=YouTubeMovies)

Inequality for all. I recommend watching this movie/documentary. Great stuff. Romers are in it too! :)
r
[""At Berkeley""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3091552/) is a documentary from 2013 about the University.  I realize it's pretty on the nose as a ""reference"", but would include it because if you haven't seen it, it's neat, and it's got a decent IMDB score (for a 4 hour long documentary) and [won a few awards](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3091552/awards?ref_=tt_awd)
Never seen this, but it was filmed during my tenure on campus:

[Boys and Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_and_Girls_(2000_film))
If we are doing TV shows, there was an episode of Quantum Leap set on campus.

Showing my age but a great show!
""Fear the Walking Dead"" - The girl was supposed to go to Berkeley before the zombie apocalypse hit lol
The Umbrella Academy season 2. The girl Ben liked (who was in Klaus’ cult) wanted to go to Berkeley
I feel like it's more interesting to know which movies are set at Berkeley. For example, both ""Antman and the Wasp"" and ""The Graduate"" have Berkeley as a setting. In ""The Graduate"", [you can see old Sproul Plaza, old Moe's Books, and old AC Transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY5_Gu_mLfM).
if we're going any reference to Berkeley, no matter how trivial- 

minor Bond-villain Henry Gupta (Tomorrow Never Dies*) is a ""techno terrorist"" who was a student at Berkeley in the 60s
Tim Kang, a character actor mostly in films, but played a big part as Kimball in the TV show The Mentalist, was a Political Science grad.
Where exactly in Antman and the Wasp, Hulk, Iron Man, and Legally blonde? do you’ve clips links? So I don’t have to watch the whole thing hahah I saw antman but can’t remember but makes sense since the history is developed in SF
Omg Atticus went to Berkeley
The Umbrella Academy. When Ben was in Klause's body and was obsessed with that girl that left Berkeley to join his cult
Mare of Eastwood has mention of Berkeley's media studies.
Can’t believe I forgot that one, it’s one of Spielberg’s best!
Movies including Silicon Valley, mention Berkeley at least once

\-0x1F84481C7625E543
Haha this might be the funniest Berkeley reference in a movie!
“You guys need to get me the fuck outta here”
And the princess diaries 2
Very cool!
It fits her so well!
The West Wing does too! CJ says she went to Berkeley
To add, Parenthood is set in the city of Berkeley, and I believe a few of the characters went to Cal. In The O.C., a few characters also go to/studied at Cal.
Awesome! I need to make another list just with all the TV show references!
Damn they really need to fix the game so I can play it
I might need to make another list with all the TV show references!
Another TV show: in Halt and Catch Fire its mentioned that Gordon and Donna went to Berkeley.
It’s there! Already one of my favorite Pixar films!
I thought she wanted to go to Sarah Lawrence?
Awesome! It’s such a fun rom com!
He’s in there! It’s so crazy he went here!
Oh shit! He went to my high school too, I didn't even realize he went to Cal.
So cool! It’s amazing how many Berkeley/Bay Area references are hidden in Pixar films
He ended up transferring to UCLA :( so people don’t talk about it too much, but yeah he was here for a while!
It’s there! It’s so fun to watch it and see buildings that look just like campus! They have almost exact replicas of Sather Gate and the Campanile in MU.
It’s in there, but yes, it’s the quintessential Berkeley movie!
Arrival is on the list! It’s an absolute masterpiece, probably my favorite Villeneuve film! I’m so excited for Dune!
YESSSSSSSSSSSS I was about to say this one, this is the classic one!!! literally, the whole history unfolds surrounding UC Berkeley the movie made Sharon Stone a movie star and the film made 352million usd on a 40mill usd budget which for the early 90s that would be the avenger's box office of today, i would say this movie put on the radar the school for millions of people to know across the world

I would also say this is the biggest movie reference for the school ever, but no one from junior year to senior at the moment would want to watch an old movie from the early 90s
Hey they don’t all have to be masterpieces!
Yes he mentions Klauss that she left a full bright scolarship to go to Berkeley just to join Klau's stupid cult 😂😂also, Klaus starts the whole cult movement in Berkeley and then starts traveling in the bus with all the other groupies followers of his
I tried to include those too, so both those movies are on the list! The graduate in particular is like the essential Berkeley movie, I love it! Antman and the wasp is awesome too, it’s crazy to see Berkeley play a key role in a modern blockbuster! I wonder if there’s any other notable movies set in Berkeley that I missed.
Kevin Costner's character in Field of Dreams was a Berkeley grad.
> Wing does too! CJ says she went to Berk

best show ever
Also in the newsroom. Sloan sabbith. Another sorkin show
I’m bad at reading
Filmed at USC
USC, UCLA, and Berkeley"
"Cal physics prof Marvin Cohen attended Cal from 1953 to 1957.
