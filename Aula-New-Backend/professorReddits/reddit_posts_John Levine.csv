What creative writing classes should I take this fall?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dj8dsy/what_creative_writing_classes_should_i_take_this/,2024-06-18 19:28:29,"I will be a junior this fall and have decided to do a creative writing minor. I am mostly a novice and so far I've only taken Eng 141 with Prof Abrams, as well as the required R1A and R4B. I really enjoyed the story writing component of Eng 141.

Currently, I'm deciding between Colwrit 130 (Kimberly Freeman, John Levine, and Kaya Oakes) and Eng 180Z with Prof Snyder. 180Z seems super fun and I have heard great things about Snyder but idk if it would end up being too advanced for my level, and on the other hand 130 might be better for learning the basics, but I'm worried it could be too simplistic and boring. What would you recommend? (Recommendations for any other creative writing or literature class being offered this Fall also welcome!)","The 143 Series are really good! 

The class sizes tend to be small so they're hard to get into but it does mean you get to know your fellow writers really well and they get a lot more time to review and workshop your pieces.
Were you able to get in? What kind of piece did you submit for it?"
"Curious: who are your favorite and least favorite professors, and why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gfsok4/curious_who_are_your_favorite_and_least_favorite/,2020-05-08 05:54:19,"Also include any that you do not share popular opinion (you like but others dislike, vice versa).","i‚Äôm a freshman but i‚Äôm calling it right now, Catterson is The Best professor i will ever have during my time at berkeley. it‚Äôs likely that you won‚Äôt take his class unless you‚Äôre a psych major but he actually cares about seeing his students succeed which seems pretty rare these days
Professor Ranade who taught EECS16A is the best professor I've had so far. She was really great at lecturing and trying to break down concepts, but the biggest difference about her is that she genuinely cared for everyone in her class. Mind you, this class had 800-1000+ students, yet she took the time to try to get to know students and building authentic relationships with them. She would have these ""Ranade roundtables"" where you could literally talk about whatever with her and 10 other students in the class. Towards the end of the class she also had meetups again to talk about how to make the class better. And she even took time out of her day to host an extra lesson on proofs when everyone was struggling. 

Being a girl in EECS and only have male professors for all my other classes thus far, it was extremely impactful on me to have a professor like her.
I‚Äôm a freshman and I can say that the Romer‚Äôs for Econ 2 are amazing professors. Their lectures are very entertaining and they answer all our questions beautifully. The Romer‚Äôs also often engage with the class and love participation. But aside from that, they are also such a wholesome elderly couple, and seeing how great they work together and call on each other for help is so cute! 

But yeah, right now, I can say that the Romer‚Äôs are my favorite professors!
Lord Hilfinger will forever be my liege.
Personally I really liked prof Robak. She has super clear lecture notes for chem 3a and 3b which made organic chem much easier to understand.
Siddiqi is the greatest teacher I've ever had- personal, dedicated, wonderful lecturer and even better in office hours. 

Luk is the most disorganized, ill teaching, frustrating, rage inducing professor I've ever had. If you can skip him and take a class later do it. 

This is for the physics department btw.
My least favorite professor was Elm in the History department. 

Her class was advertised as Slavery & The Bible on Monday and Wednesday mornings from 10:30 to noon. The syllabus looked thorough.

The first class she was absent. 

The second class she informed us that the course would focus on one book only, Augustine‚Äôs Confessions. Also, the class would only meet once a week, Wednesdays from
11 to noon, & 100% of our grade was based off of one ten page paper. 

Holston in Anthro was cool because he was open to new ideas which is ironically rare & Nader because of her astuteness.


Edit: a word
Favorite: Jonathan Zwicker for Japanese literature, Jonathan Shewchuk for CS and Ken Ribet for math. Don‚Äôt have any least favorite because personally I have never had any unpleasant experience with any professor. Yes, some of them are not the best instructor but all the professor I have had are at least responsible and caring, so no reason to hate them.
Only a freshman, but my favorite has definitely been Paulin. It‚Äôs amazing how in one of the biggest classes on campus (Math 1B), he still takes the time to learn the names of students who go to office hours. Made a subject that I had little interest in very approachable
Professor Dewulf who teaches Dutch 171AC. Aside from being an easy class, he is very fun and engaging as well as one of the most caring professors I have ever had.
Terry Johnson in the BioE department & Michelle Koerner in the English department.

Both professors legitimately care about their students and do the best they can to make a student feel like their success is in their own hands. 

If you have a chance to take BioE10 with Terry or an R1B class with Michelle, take it! These are the professors that reminded me that learning can be wonderful.
Hug in CS, Mathew in Music
Best: Babak for any class. He will teach Data 8 in Spring next year so if people wanna take with him, thats the best time. 

Worst: Raja Sengupta for E7. Any engineers who took it this sem or Sp19 knows this pain.
Hug because he‚Äôs a great lecturer (never walked out of lecture completely lost) and he cares about students as individuals. One time I showed him a really basic feature I added to my project (which looking back now is trivial and would take 1 second to do), but he hyped me up and gave me so much confidence.
Davies in MCB was extremely frustrating. Difficult
to follow her lectures and not very technologically savvy. She would draw on slides in class clicking and dragging with a mouse :/
Best is Ray Hawkins in Econ because he‚Äôs always prepared and has interesting and relevant stories to share. Worst probably Stephen Bianchi for all the opposite reasons
Favorite lecturer was Nick Weaver from the CS department and Linus Huang from the sociology one.
Gary Firestone in MCB. His style of teaching was one of my favorites, and he loves his class!
Dylan Sailor in Classics. Also second Nick Weaver in CS. They're both hilarious, passionate, and incredibly engaging.
Elcin Unal in MCB is really really great!! Richard Harland, on the other hand, is not a great lecturer üòñ
Favorite professors so far have been Nikhil Srivastava (math 54) and laleh behbehanian (sociology 140). both care about their students and are incredibly engaging. :)
psych101 right? i thought so too until i met even more amazing professors later in my college career like adhikari for stats140
His occasional office hours on Club Penguin were a great way to connect with his students! I even got the chance to race him down ski hill a couple of times.
Period
+1 was on course staff last semester and I was surprised at how much she cared about the class and making sure everything was clear and easy to understand. Also she's just kinda badass.
+1 My absolute favorite professors!
I agree with this. I had him for C178 and he was one of the nicest human beings I've ever met.
Second this, his class was really interesting and he's such a nice person

I took Sailor‚Äôs Aeneid class my senior year! It kicked my ass and I learned so much. I still remember how to scan/chant the opening lines (‚ÄúAaaarrrrrma viruuuumque canoooooo...‚Äù).
feeling like I should have had Srivastava for math 54 this semester instead of Lin now.
glad to know that there are other great professors out there! feels like all i see are true horror stories, especially for stem classes
planning on minoring in music
I will hopefully (assuming the University is willing to keep me on) be doing Fa 21...
BUT...

A current big problem is there is nobody scheduled for Spring 21.  It killed me to teach/coteach 61C and 161 in the same semester, but at the same time the 161 class, by being all-in on scalability, needs to be taught every semester.  So there may be a chance I'm co-teaching in the Spring as well...
Can confirm, Catterson is amazing.
S-s-s-senpai noticed me.... (‚âß œâ ‚â¶)"
