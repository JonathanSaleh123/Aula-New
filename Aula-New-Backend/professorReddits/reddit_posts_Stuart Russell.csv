"Questions about ""Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig""",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7hahgn/questions_about_artificial_intelligence_a_modern/,2017-12-03 08:17:16,"I'm a high schooler looking to do an independent study in artificial intelligence. Most websites recommend ""Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig"" as a good textbook. Are any of you using this book? What is the format like? Are there questions in the book I could use as assessments?","I bought the book and never read it...the slides for CS188 were much more useful to me 
I think you may get more practical mileage out of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). I did not find Russell and Norvig to be that useful for me.

I'd also recommend [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) and following one of the courses there.
I'm very surprised at the comments in this thread and as someone with actual experience in the fields of AI and machine learning I feel obligated to provide a counterweight against the strange opinions I'm seeing here. I feel qualified to provide input on this topic because I am currently employed as a machine learning researcher,  and I make heavy use of the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning (specifically deep learning) every day for my work. 

Having said that, the Russell and Norvig text is excellent, particularly as an introduction to the field, and I highly recommend it. Both Norvig and Russell are amazing researchers and mathematicians, and are among the most qualified people on earth to explain the core principles of AI. My introductory AI course in my undergrad used this book and I found it to be fantastic, with the core concepts laid out in an easily-understandable manner. There is also a large amount of supplementary materials, including code examples, provided on the associated website for the book for free. 

It is true that additional, exterior supplementary materials such as coursera or udacity are a great idea too, but this book provides an excellent starting point in my opinion. Obviously it isn't perfect, nothing is, but it is FAR better than the other comments in this thread are portraying it to be. 
It‚Äôs shit and old.

Take a modern course on machine learning from coursea.
http://ml-class.org is probably your best introduction in terms of relevance. /r/machinelearning has stuff too.
MIT OCW's stuff seems to be quite outdated too, I'm afraid.
Since a lot of machine learning models don't really make use of the logic/reasoning stuff the book introduces it might not be the best choice of text in terms of relevance.

Given how big a role stats ML and deep learning play now it would probably be better to acquaint yourself in that direction.
Yes, I'd probably prefer Andrew Ng's ML class over OCW, at least for this narrow subject. But OCW is still a great resource for learning about the math behind all of this.
I can agree with that. Strang/Auroux/Tsitsitklis lectures are a rigorous treatment of their Linear Algebra/Calc /Probability respectively. They will def prepare someone well for reading research papers etc."
cs 189 ed post update,https://i.redd.it/pykl58lfwdpc1.jpeg,2024-03-19 17:32:09,sent an email to Claire tomlin and got this response‚Ä¶ wtf ??? if she‚Äôs admitting that the ed post was threatening shouldn‚Äôt he be getting more than a conversation??,"he‚Äôs tenured though, i think it makes him pretty immune to this sort of stuff
if a professor needs the impact of his words to be explained to him‚Ä¶ it kinda puts into perspective how staffing is like here
someone send all and any screenshots to carol. she/her staff responds pretty quickly to student emails. also the daily cal.
women: ‚Äúwe felt very uncomfortable because of this professor‚Äôs statement about women‚Äù

y‚Äôall: ‚Äúno u don‚Äôt‚Äù
What bro say?
Shewchuk needs to be dismissed. No parent should be paying for their daughter to be taught by an incel.
The ""where women are plentiful"" part made me gag
THAT'S IT????
Shewchuk is so cringe. On his website hw says he identifies as a Smith & Wesson .45 caliber revolver, like wtf. He also states students can visit his office hours until midnight on weekdays. Now lets take a moment to think about this, what ~ woman would want to go to any mans office hours that late? Let alone by themselves? I feel like this is a direct invite only to student men to get extra help until midnight!! STEM professors gotta do better
When I was a student one of the Chem1a professors made a sexist comment in lecture (along the lines of ‚Äúcan you believe Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist as a Bond Girl‚Äù), and then had to apologize to each lecture section for his remark and affirm his position that women can be scientist/ engineers/ etc. He apologized and we moved on (although I remember it more than a decade later). This guy definitely needs to publicly atone.
Hi OP, 

You are a student and haven't had the opportunity to build a professional career yet. But after you graduate you will probably work hard to get a good job, get promoted, maybe move to a new company, take on more professional responsibility, and in general put in a lot of effort to be good at what you do and successful in providing for yourself. Someday (realistically, many days over the course of your 20-40 year career) you will say something offensive, thoughtless, and stupid. Maybe you meant well, but it came out wrong. Perhaps you were having a shitty day and overreacted. Or as you get older, social norms change and you might find yourself 50 years old and out of touch with what offends the young people.

When that day comes, I hope that people will treat you with the same empathy, understanding, and forgiveness that you show toward others who have offended you.
[deleted]
This is the same school that allows people to openly support hamas and their ""great"" track record of womens rights. What makes you think a tenured cs professor that said some negative comments is going to get push back?  


Unfortunately free speech does go both ways and given context of what's happened over the past couple months, to severely punish him here would have some large cascading effects.   


Not saying he shouldn't get pushback, but if he does you can't really let the rest of the shit happening on campus slide.
Jesus relax. You want that guy to get fired over that? Seriously?
God you lot are fragile as shit üòÇ
How come everyone is fine with jokes like ""Man Jose"" in the real world.

Also, it's quite well accepted by both males and females in the Bay Area that the dating market is a lot more difficult than other places because there are more young men than young women. Even my relative (women who is married) specifically came to the Bay Area from NYC just because of that and was open about it. And many people here I have interacted with (both male and female) take it as granted that men should probably move to NYC if they want better chance in the dating market. 

There's already evidence through dating apps that demographics (% ratio) does have large impacts on how the dating market is.

That said, I've no context of why the professor commented that in an academia channel. But it does seem extreme why a professor should lose his job over a comment. Where's free speech? It's quite ridiculous also how someone's life could be ruined by a relatively innocuous comment which was supposed to help a student feel better (though the comment does seem out of place).
[deleted]
This is the most insulting letter she could've written. 

""We had tea and crumpets with Prof Upchuck and he said he'll tell you he's sorry you got offended. He forgot female students existed because, well, should they? I mean, the only people whose feelings that matter are the men.  But I'll let him tell you that himself, in the most condescending way. 

What's that? Title IX? California anti-harassment laws? How droll! 

Well, toodle-loo, girls! Good luck out there now that we've given the go-ahead to thousands of male students that you're to be derided and harassed with impunity! Hopefully the conservatives with guns won't come after you, too. Or Upchuck won't be encouraged to start raping you because of your bad behavior! Of course, if he does feel free to fill out one of our complaint forms. We have other students look at those from time to time.""
He didn‚Äôt even say anything explicitly sexist. Y‚Äôall emotional and over reactive.
[deleted]
We're clearly very lucky to have someone as accomplished as Professor Tomlin at Cal, I'm glad she's on faculty here, but this response to Shewchuck was totally uncalled for. The department should be standing up to the minority of students working to undermine job protections for university staff, not giving in to them.

It's fair to say Shewchuck's post on Ed was a little inappropriate or unprofessional. Professors probably shouldn't be in the business of publicly giving students dating advice. But the idea that his post on Ed was ""threatening to students"" is ridiculous.
Sad my bro was hated for saying something true. It can be put in a nicer way though.
[deleted]
daily cal is On It
You don't speak for all women.
He has tenure‚Ä¶besides, Sahai would have been long gone before Shewchuk
Shewchuk's comment was inappropriate, but honestly, as a woman, I don't think you should lose your job because of one dumb comment. He should definitely issue a formal apology and face some kind of consequences though.
This is the guy whose FB cover photo was a picture of his Filipino girlfriend in a lewd pose, and then you realize that she was likely underage when they started dating. I‚Äôve been hearing about this stuff from my friends for years now; he‚Äôs a sexist incel and possibly a pedo. At best he‚Äôs creepy and incredibly inappropriate.
Think u gotta check ur definition of incel
disagree. he has the right to free speech as the rest of us.

Also not endorsing what that passport bro says, I've seen those people.  To put it harshly, they essentially want a child in a woman's body.
Rid yourself of cancel culture my friend. It is truly a cancer to the human race.
[deleted]
The revolver thing is cringe and gross, but the second thing is a big stretch
Oh he‚Äôs accommodating to student schedules? Must be a rapist
I think this is different from just plain out weirdness. I‚Äôve noticed a pattern with respect to people who make those type of odd comments and/or have minimal comprehension of differentiating between comments that are not socially acceptable and those that are. Not gonna say which one because I don‚Äôt wanna get canceled, but I suspect he has a mental disability if this is a common pattern that people notice about him.
hi! misogyny has been around for a long time, you can‚Äôt really fall out of touch of that.
Shewchuk needs to be dismissed. No parent should be paying for their daughter to be taught by an incel.
Hi prof Shewchuck, dont worry people forget easily these days. These ‚Äòwoke‚Äô people find everything and anything offensive and take it as a direct threat to themselves, soon someone else will say something that will offend them and they will forget about this shit. Its a day to day thing for them.
?
Seriously. Good times make weak men.¬†

Virtue is working hard to create good stuff, not going around getting offended by harmless comments.¬†
‚ÄúThreatening‚Äù in that his female students are less likely to feel comfortable approaching him for office hours or other inquiries knowing that he has those views.

At least that was my interpretation.
Relax buddy. Discussions on conduct in the workplace are standard, and for good reason.
He's tenured, unfortunately
He would have to commit a felony or put the university administration directly at risk to get fired with tenure. Having and expressing a ‚Äúcontroversial opinion‚Äù (I do not condone what he said btw) is exactly what a tenure protects, for better or worse
Where is it? I can‚Äôt seem to find Carol‚Äôs post
You don‚Äôt think the majority of women felt uncomfortable because of his statement?
Never said i did
I'm out of the loop, what'd Sahai say?
Wait what did sahai say
As a woman, I know it's not possible this is first time. For someone to say he prefers places where ""women are plentiful"" combined with his Facebook page, there is no way I would let my daughter attend a class with this guy and the school needs to take action.
Agreed, but what‚Äôs concerning is the problematic beliefs and biases that are exposed by his comment. What is preventing his beliefs about bay area women from affecting his interactions with the bay area women who are his students?
""As a black man...""
He's an incel who traveled the world to find a desperate woman. American woman shun him. For good reason.
He doesn't have an unlimited right to free speech while speaking in his official capacity as a course instructor. This was an official pronouncement from a position of power over people in the targeted group, which is what makes it fundamentally different than someone simply espousing a reprehensible opinion.
People who say shit like ""free speech"" have somehow managed to get through life with zero understanding of what employment means. Or what sexual harassment laws mean. Or what Title IX means. Or even what free speech means.
Sure; but Berkeley should not employ him or anyone who looks for places where ""women are plentiful""
You don't know the first thing about passport bros but it's clear you infantilize foreign women.
[deleted]
They purposely go for very young women who are not emotionally mature enough to advocate for their needs. They want power- their green card is just another thing they can hold over their wife when they abuse them. Seen this all the time working at DV organizations
Tell me you don‚Äôt understand the principle of free speech without telling me you don‚Äôt understand the principle of free speech
I prefer to rid the earth of white guys who look for places where ""women are plentiful""
Cancel culture? You mean holding people accountable for shitty behavior?
>people have done much worse things to each other that would actually deserve the level of punishment like dismissal, but not in this case 

For example, John Yoo, author of the [torture memos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Memos) which provided legal cover for the Bush administration to engage in torture, is currently a member of the faculty of Berkeley law. That man has objectively caused far more pain and suffering than 1,000 comments like this ever could and yet the outrage over his continued employment by UC is essentially non-existent.
The second one was the reason why I thought he was pretty cool lol. That shows a dedication to students
What is considered appropriate today is different than 50, 40, 30, 20, or even 10 years ago. 20 years from now, things you are doing today will be considered out of bounds. You'll see.
Pretty clear you have no idea what incel means

And even if he actually was one, what's wrong with him teaching someone's daughter?
It‚Äôs CS‚Ä¶
The only ones getting professorships for this stuff are the incels
Spoken like a true 12 year old!
If I were him, I wouldn't touch any of these posts...

Also, same hope applies to you.
[deleted]
or the transphobic hate speech on his website lmao
only women who interacted with him can speak to this. if any female students have had negative interactions with him - please talk about it.

unless we have a definitive answer we should probably stop speculating
Weirdo
I understand you are mad at Shewchuk, but why drag his wife into this? You don't know anything about her thought process.
thats not what incel means. I swear people just use incel to mean men that are sexist. just use sexist. incel means involuntary celibate he's most definitely not.
Berkeley is a public school, so you cant just fire someone for their opinion its more complicated than that.
I'm sorry, I'm a red blooded American man: What's wrong with this statement?
My experience has been that universities are way harder to get rid of people than say a private company -- this was kinda touched on in the senate's meetings with university deans the other week. Free speech on campuses (not just public, any school that accepts public funding, so basically all) does mean you can get away with saying a lottt more than if you're at a private company.

Speaking from experience with an incel in my PhD program unfortunately.
Or that people know that people have to do things they're not thrilled about to survive.
found the passport bro
[removed]
I,do. freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of consequence.  right?

If this was not a public school, they could do what they wanted, but this isn't.
why is this bothering you so much? i think he meant places where there are a lot of women (less skewed gender ratio, better dating prospects)
What specifically is wrong with that
What's the shitty behavior! People act like he directly hurt somebody.
The outrage is persistent.
Hi! You fall out of touch with social norms when you aren‚Äôt actively engaging with them. This usually comes with hanging out with polarized groups, not meeting new people, or just not being socially aware. Being a professor at UC Berkeley should, at the very least, teach you not to put women in such an objectified view, ESPECIALLY as an eecs professor. Also, human decency has always been around, but it seems like he‚Äôs fallen out of it too.
Says the white guy who wonders why he can't get a date.  You should sue your parents for poor parenting; you'd win.
men can be so fucking clueless lol
[deleted]
No. Any human being with a brain in their head can speak to this. If someone says ""I don't like eggplant"" you know exactly how they're going to interact with eggplant. 

Drop the act. No one's speculating here. We're reading actual words written by the actual asshat under discussion. Don't ask us to pretend his words have less meaning than they do. Be your age.
Y'all really have nothing better than social shaming to lean on, huh
Yes we do- let‚Äôs not be obtuse. Her thought process is ‚Äúwhite guy with money who can get me citizenship‚Äù. Just because she made that choice for her future doesn‚Äôt mean the relationship isn‚Äôt imbalanced and exploitative.
Becuase she's 30 years younger than him and he brought her over from the Phillipines.
Incel = man I dislike for any reason.
I know that. He is no longer celebate because he took advantage of a desperate woman and brought her here from the Philippines.
Yes you can. Decades of laws are on the books that say yes you can. In fact, those laws pretty much point to: you have to. They'll be ignored as per usual, but let's not pretend this is an ""opinion"" or that someone can't be fired for it.
Gee, thanks for pretending you are smart and ""letting me know"" Berkeley is public.

After 5 minutes of researching this guy, no good parent will let their daughter attend UC Berkeley
Berkeley is full of passport bros. Most of you are children of passport bros. Would you shame your father's and grandfathers? Also, it's quite hypocritical how progressives try to shame people for being close minded, xenophobic and parochial yet shame men who travel abroad for love and dating.
[deleted]
Tell me you don't understand the concept of a state university...
I don't care what you ""think"" - this guy is dangerous and that is easily verifiable with 5 minutes of research.  No parent would send their daughter to Berkeley after looking at this guys social media
He is supposed to stay forever single instead of finding a gf/wife somewhere else. At least that‚Äôs the logic of people mad at him.
Oh, so you don't like it when people criticize someone's behavior?
He made an inappropriate comment for an educational setting.

Which is problematic and shouldn't be ignored, but we shouldn't act like it is the end of the world
Where?
As you get older, you'll hang out with people your own age and you will find yourself out of touch with the younger generations more and more as time goes by. 

The alternative is that you end up being that guy/gal who is the old weirdo trying to act like they are still in college and just being sort of sad.

Actually, if you think about Shewchuk's reviled comment, one of the reasons it happened is him thinking of students as his buddies. I've heard dozens of people say shit about the opposite sex in the context of friends talking and it's fine. Students and profs can't really be ""buddies"".
So you're an obsessive racist misandrist, but other people are the problem?
[deleted]
his website had fake pronounce and the statement that he identified as a handgun. his facebook is just all pictures of his green card wife
He defended the Canadian trump-adjacent freedom convoy, mocked pronouns, as far as I remember
[deleted]
Stop making assumptions
lol
So? Last I checked she is a human being capable of thoughts, reasoning, and emotions? You don't know anything about her? Don't make assumptions that drastic just because you (reasonably) don't like Shewchuk.
true, I was trying to be charitable.
I don't know anything about his wife or relationship... but not all Filipinos are desperate to leave the Philippines/marry a white man. This is yet another harmful stereotype.
""Would you shame your father's and grandfathers?""

Are you implying that fathers and grandfathers should be immune from critique? That children and grandchildren shouldn't be critical of their parents and grandparents? What exactly is your point here? Very odd.

There is also a marked difference between, on the one hand, happening to find love abroad, and on the other hand, going abroad ‚Äî often to specific target countries ‚Äî specifically in order to find a wife. Either we're using the term ""passport bros"" to mean different things and you're unaware of the latter association, or you genuinely don't see the difference between the two. If you can't see the difference, then there is no reality in which I could foresee a reasonable conversation with you. But nice attempt to point out imagined hypocrisy?
makes sense given your german name lol.
lol
Care to expand on this? I don't doubt what you are saying, just would help if you gave more info.
You just proved my point
Can you wrap your mind around the idea that men have different experiences on the basis of gender? And that they may be unable to empathize or understand women due to those different experiences? Isn‚Äôt that true, generally?

He did not say ""I don't want to date eggplants"". He said ""eggplants in the area we are currently in behave unacceptably and other people should pursue superior eggplants elsewhere"". 

The eggplants in the room have every reason to believe he views their behavior negatively because that is what he said.
You are a student at UC Berkeley and you know your professors' wife well enough to comment on her personality?  That would be another reason he needs to be dismissed.
[deleted]
Oh and that.
Where did he say that they behave poorly here? He said in an autistic way that dating as a man is significantly easier in places with a higher proportion of women. Is he socially awkward and likely autistic, most probably yes. Was his statement fundamentally incorrect, I don‚Äôt think so.
I don't know her. I just want you to know that in your efforts to hate someone else, you're stereotyping all kinds of international couples, and especially the women from these regions.
You're the one making the assumptions LOL
You don't know her, yet claim she is she is ""capable of thoughts, reasoning, and emotions"" - she is being abused son. Grow up.
No actually we are talking about a ‚Äúspecific‚Äù type of international couple. It‚Äôs a continued form of colonization to seek women from places the US impoverished and destroyed with war. 

The Philippines has one of the highest rates of child sex trafficking. Men who go there are not innocent.
Hell of an accusation man. Please, develop nuance.
Says the 19 year old.  You have a lot to learn
Exactly. Sad that a 19 year old has to tell you to not assume people are abusers off of nothing.
Nothing? There's  plenty available with minutes of research - but you can keep pretending if it makes you feel better about yourself.
Evidence: his wife is young and from a different country

It's not ideal, I agree, but abuse is a hell of a stretch. I hate how people like you feel the need to dehumanize others in efforts to be mad at someone else.
The men who travel to impoverished countries to fuck these women for less money than they‚Äôd spend in the US is actually what‚Äôs dehumanizing them. Making an observation of it is not.

Read the SEA sexpat and passport bro forums and tell me women aren‚Äôt talked about like mere objects. ‚ÄúNot sure if there‚Äôs anything worth flying back home with me‚Äù etc etc"

Is virginity common nowadays
idk, in my experience the ""horny nerds"" trope seemed to ring true (more than a decade ago! wow!). I was not by any means an attractive man, in fact I was pretty average and unremarkable but it seemed many Cal women were very nice and open to giving me a chance.

Have things changed since covid? I've also seen the statistic about genz not having as much sex. Or is this just toxic Andrew Tate BS?

I moved from Toronto to South Bay in 2015 and while I still got dates, it was way harder to start a relationship here.

I dated for 4 months in Toronto before finding a girlfriend (we split 4 months later because of my move).

It then took me 3 YEARS(!!) to do the same thing here and required a lucky encounter with someone who literally had filed for divorce days earlier, and therefore hadn't been getting passed around on the apps. Also she was nearly a decade older than me (but still very attractive). Sadly after about 2 years she went cold/evil on me when she realized just how spoiled for choice she was (basically got cocky like most of the rest).

So yes, what the dude wrote is 100% accurate. Women can be SHOCKINGLY callous when they know you're easily replaceable.
What is the context I have to know

For what its worth I work in the Bay and even as the sole woman on my team, my coworkers are much more respectful and compassionate than this professor so there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Not everyone is this shitty

Fr the only thing that seems ‚Äúexpired‚Äù here is the rancid scent permeating from his armpits
Bay Area dating culture is incredibly difficult, but not for the reasons cited in these posts. Tech culture is prevalent, and many young people are extremely career driven. While this by itself is good for them, it leaves little time for getting to know others and/or spending with any one individual. If you're similarly occupied it may not be such an issue.
I'm gonna get downvoted but I got more matches my first week in Boston than i did 6-7 months in San Jose. It is absolutely significantly more difficult for young guys in the bay, regardless of what reddit insists.
Dating is hard everywhere, people in the bay just want to believe that it‚Äôs harder here, but plenty of people have success. I wouldn‚Äôt take it into account over things like quality of education or location. The west coast is lovely.
That's not the takeaway.
Only for these top dweebs who act like this and then wonder why they can‚Äôt meet women.
I live in Seattle and I don't like it here. It's kind of hard to make friends.
Yes

My dude.  It was a freakin‚Äô free for all in Berkeley and SF in the ‚Äò90s!  
I mean, were you going to lesbian bars and didn‚Äôt realize it?!
its really not that hard to not be creepy
How terrible for you that women aren't making themselves up just to get your attention and don't respond to you creeping on them in public places.  Oh woe is you!
He‚Äôs just super lonely and he‚Äôs paying people to just to meet them.¬†
I mean still pretty misogynistic or at least socially ignorant to think there's a set experation date for forming relationships. And also to lament losing out on one of the  ""expiring"" relationships, but also being the one who never texted back lol.
I don't think it's any more difficult. Berkeley maybe more than other universities due to the academics being tough and a priority. And if you work in tech and don't have other hobbies then the dating pool as a guy is tougher. 


But I think the dating scene has gotten tough everywhere ever since dating apps became so big. Everyone wants to find someone by swiping but then it's hard to get people to commit to in person meetups for the first time.
[deleted]
I've seen women say similar things to Shewchuk here about men all the time. ""Don't date X kind of person"", however they usually explain what exactly they mean rather than keep it vague. Like I heard a lot of people say that they wouldn't date men from Korea (not Koreans raised abroad, just Koreans from Korea proper) because of their experiences with them being overly controlling which seems to stem from the way men are raised there, or in other cases just because of cultural differences. It is unfair to Korean men who don't do those things and I don't think of it as a hard rule, but they make clear that it's these attitudes that make a relationship hard, not necessarily something inherent. 

It's still not right because people are not their culture, and they can change, but I think if Shewchuk said something like ""Don't bother with women in the Bay Area, they're focused on their careers and don't have much leftover to deal with your needs, your relationship will be more about how it reflects on them personally rather than about being there for you"", it wouldn't be... as controversial? I think people have encountered people like that before, so even if it might not be true for the group overall, people could understand it being common and could relate to him being so cynical. Like I remember reading a guy talk about how his girlfriend dumped him because he had a mental breakdown and couldn't continue his research job, instead of you know, being there for him and helping him (it was anonymized, but I don't think it was Berkeley). I think because he kept it vague, people projected a lot onto his comments especially in an environment where incel-like views are very common. 

To be clear, his comments are very weird, inappropriate and pointless, why he is giving comments about getting women instead of CS concerns, and it's possible they do have misogynistic views behind them, but that on their own they're very vague.

Huh?? Bay Area dating is terrible compared to Chicago, LA, or NYC. Heck, I would even put Austin above it.
Sad news bears
its not misogynistic , but an insane thing to say.
Hold up‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a young (I assume on gender identity here) woman and there are men your age turned off because you have a career now and/or don‚Äôt want to give it up to be Susie Homemaker?!!  Is it still 1955 in Texas?  

Wait - I know the answer.  Yes. Yes, it is.  

I mean, you‚Äôll find troglodytes here in CA as well, but not too many in the Bay in my experience (Cal grad, lifelong Bay Area resident).
then you're set lol
no it's 100% misogynistic, especially given the context
[deleted]
California for sure has more liberal views on relationships. Also it's expensive so unless one of you are a surgeon or a trust fund baby I think most people expect their partner to also work lol."
cs 188 or cs 170,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yyq1kd/cs_188_or_cs_170/,2022-11-18 09:47:20,"Hi, I have 3 classes I am trying to pick between for my CID ds major requirement. I am picking between CS 170, CS 188, and Econ 140. I'm really not interested in taking the econ class but I have it as a backup. I've only done 1/2 of cs70 (only the discrete math part, not the probability), math 55 at my cc, and I will be concurrently taking an upper div probability class either 172 or 134. Just wanted to check do I seem prepared enough to take either cs170 or cs188? I'm having trouble picking between the two. Thanks","I thought 188 was a waste of a class. IMO, it's too high-level to be satisfying, but then the tests are like 3x harder than most of the hw. Coding projects were just taking the given algorithms and translating them into code. Pretty lame IMO.
Please dont take 188. Its such a horrible class. Stuff is from like 1970s lol and oldass stuart russel refuses to change any of the material
I took 170 and 188 this semester. Let me tell you something: 2 of the worst classes offered at this university. Absolutely terrible classes. Let‚Äôs see where do I begin. First of all, all of my friends and I absolutely hated 170. The hws are super long and hard. The newly added coding hws made everything worse as now you have essentially 2x the workload. And the coding hws are just terrible debugging exercises since implementing everything at a high level is fine and easy but there‚Äôs so many edge cases to consider. Also there were always so many bugs in the code that students themselves pointed out. The class as a whole is stupid imo. You don‚Äôt really learn anything useful and the tests seem like IQ tests where you have to find the trick or you get it wrong. You don‚Äôt really learn anything useful. Not a class worth taking imo. 

The material in 188 itself wasn‚Äôt bad tbh. You learn a lot of cool AI algs such as value iteration, Q-learning, MDP, HMM, etc. HOWEVER, the tests are EXTREMELY difficult. They‚Äôre almost entirely multiple choice and test your understanding of the material at a very very high level compared to what you learn in class. I mean the lectures are so basic compared to the tests lmao. It just seems like 188 is a class that the department couldn‚Äôt care less about but the instructors were very kind and accommodating. 

Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking either class lmao. But If I had to pick one I‚Äôd say 188. 170 is just absolutely terrible. At least the workload in 188 is much lighter but be ready to study hard for the exams if you want a high grade. For 170, you have to grind hws, the crappy end of year project where your grade is determined by how everyone else did (such a toxic grading scheme), and the exams which always have 1 extremely bs and complicated question.
Should I take 170 over it? or even the econ 140 class? Those are my only 3 options since I didn't enroll during the fall and this is my first semester back I got a bad registration date so I'm left with these 3 to pick lol. My main goal is to pass the class but also want to take something interesting.
I don‚Äôt have many options other than those 3 classes lol, is it the worst of those 3 or do you recommend something else?
Lol yeah I forsure won't do cs170. I already dropped it off my schedule. Between cs188 and econ 140 what would you think is better to take? I don't have much probability other than data 8 and data 100 and math 55 at a CC which I don't remember went into too much depth. Should cs 188 be ok for me while doing upper div prob concurrently? Thanks
I will say that 188 will be a lot easier than 170, so factor that in. 170 is known to be difficult. I'd pick whichever interests you most, b/c you'll probably do better in that.

Econ 140 seems pretty repetitive from the POV of a DS major.
I don‚Äôt know anything about 140 so I can‚Äôt really give a suggestion between the 2. You‚Äôll be fine for probability in 188. The only probability I did was 70 and I‚Äôm absolutely terrible at it. Probability by far is my weakest area in math and I managed fine. It‚Äôs pretty high level math
Got it, thanks. Is the probability in 188 not too bad for me if I take a probability class concurrently?
Sounds good, all I really need is like a B or B+, doesn‚Äôt seem to hard to get a B or higher with the difficult exams when I looked at Berkeley time but is that what you felt about the class or nah?
It's hard for me to say, b/c I had the probability background from CS 70. I think you'd be fine, especially w/ the concurrent prob class. Just go to OH early, and attend HW party.
Yeah you should be fine for at least a B curve isn‚Äôt too bad
Sounds good, thanks for explaining everything for me."

Is this Algorithms book designed for beginners?
Sure
Found the book on Amazon. Is there a solutions manual either from the textbook authors or from the open source community?
Does https://www.overleaf.com/read/krjkstdxfccv#75768a work for you?
Thanks. Is it a solution to every problem in the book? Did you generate this set of solutions?"
"Course Reviews Spring 2022, CS 161, CS 162, CS 188, CS 189",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/upa9fj/course_reviews_spring_2022_cs_161_cs_162_cs_188/,2022-05-13 22:23:07,"Doing reviews for the Undergrad Systems + AI speed run

CS 161 (Nicholas Weaver):

Rating: 9/10

Workload: \~4-5 hr/week, \~15hr/week when project 2 was being implemented

Pros:

* I found the content very interesting. It opened my eyes to a lot of security vulnerabilities and even improved how I approach my own personal security (security keys anyone?).
* Weaver was very passionate about the material (especially crypto) and  was a fantastic lecturer overall. If you read this post, best of luck being the CEO, Janitor, and Chief Mad Scientist of Skerry Technologies!
* Projects 1 & 2 are some of the coolest projects I've had to do for a class here. In Project 1, I felt like I was a hacker hacking into old decommissioned Gobian Union satellites. I thought the lore added some character from the otherwise same old same old CS project requirements (although obviously not required).
* For Project 2, I loved the systems design with security component of it. I found developing Project 2 very rewarding, as I not only learned Go, but I had practice applying a ton of the cryptographic primitives learned in class.

Cons:

* While there was an attempt to perhaps make how they are assigning grades more transparent, I felt that the binned grading scheme caused a good bit of stress for me. I think the bins are currently set unreasonably high, and there is a rumor that the bins will be shifted. I personally prefer a curve where you can estimate your position than unreasonably high bins with possibility (but not necessarily guaranteed) of a downward shift.

Overall, I strongly recommend any EECS/CS major to take CS161. It is super fun and the work around Project 2 can be managed.

CS 162 (John Kubiatowicz and Anthony Joseph)

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: \~20 hr/week

Pros:

* Content is generally really interesting and very helpful in understanding systems.
* Working within an existing codebase like Pintos was initially rough, but it ended up becoming rewarding, as you end up seeing how so many of the core OS functions are implemented.
* Design documents and design reviews force you to actually think about all sorts of aspects integrating features into a large codebase. I think my systems design skills definitely improved by the end of the course.
* Both Professor Kubi and Joseph are solid lecturers! I highly recommend them.

Cons:

* I think at some point there was a Homework, Project, Design Document, and Midterm in the span of 2.5 weeks. I wished the workload was more distributed or that the deadlines were spaced out better.
* Workload around project due dates was very high (almost like a full time job), but this could have been mitigated through better time management.
* Good group is an absolute must (or enjoy having your back broken)! I was fortunate to have a great group and I survived.

Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in becoming a SWE or who has an interest in systems.

CS 189 (Jonathan Shewchuk)

Rating: 8/10

Workload: \~10-12 hrs per week

Pros:

* I've been slow to pick up ML before due to the heavy math and I wasn't able to learn effectively from online resources. This class definitely pushed me over this hump, and now I find ML very exciting.
* I think Shewchuk's iteration has the right amount of theory to the point where I can understand the intuition for the algorithms as opposed to just memorizing certain formulas.
* Majority of the homeworks were very helpful in understanding concepts. In general, homeworks included both traditional math and theory based questions but also code implementation of certain algorithms. I'm glad there was a balance so I could see how the theory related to code in practice.
* I loved Shewchuk's lectures!

Cons:

* As someone who took neither EECS126/127 and survived off of the backs of EECS16B and CS70, I found HW2 very challenging and long. While I did learn many concepts, like multivariate Gaussians, I found some of the proofs unnecessary and too much work for someone who is inexperienced at math compared to my peers.
* HW difficulty and workload is generally inconsistent. Some homeworks are somewhat short, but other homeworks like 2 and 6 become very long.
* Grading bins are not transparent, but I've heard bins are generous.

Overall, I think it does a great job of introducing ML topics at a good level of depth. It is definitely a worthwhile course to take, and if you are interested in ML, if you can survive HW2, you should be fine in a Shewchuk semester.

CS 188 (Stuart Russell and Dawn Song)

Rating: 3/10

Workload: \~5-7 hr/week

Pros:

* Projects for the most part are really easy plug and chug. Definitely takes the stress off if you have a ton of other work to do.
* A small amount of content actually helped me understand some of a new research project I'm working on this summer.

Cons:

* Content at the end of the semester was very rushed, and in my opinion it is some of the most interesting.
* I have absolutely 0 clue why we decided to spend 2 whole weeks on a logic unit where we could have added at least taken one of the lectures and put it towards RL.
* No idea why grading policy claims participation is optional 5% extra credit, when the reality is that the bins are 5% shifted up from Fall 2021. The participation is only optional if you are a genius and absolutely crush the exams. To have a shot at even making a similar level bin as Fall 2021 you have to go to discussion or participate on Piazza. I don't have an issue with participation, but please don't claim it as extra credit when it is required for mere mortals like myself.
* The way the material is presented does not develop a sort of intuition you can get like from CS189, for example. I felt a lot of it became know X, Y, Z formulas (or I guess write it down on your cheat sheets).

Overall: If you are taking/have taken CS189, I don't think it is justifiable to take CS188 as a whole separate course when you could probably learn the relevant RL portions in 2 weeks tops (IMO if you are interested in RL, CS189->CS285 would probably be better). If you find Bayes Nets/HMMs fascinating, then take this course, but do it at the peril of wasting your time. It could perhaps be a good introductory course for those who don't want the hardcore nature of CS189 but still want some AI background.

EDIT: I don't want to rail on CS188. I think the course staff was helpful for project completion, discussion, etc. I just felt like the content actually taught in the class did not meet the high bar set by the other three classes mentioned here.","Damn ur crazy
it's funny that there's a whole unit on scheduling in 162 and course staff was absolute ass when it came to scheduling assignments this sem
U took four techsü§†
Cs 188 is a dogshit class. Keep railing :)
Fwiw we covered HMMs and PGMs in 189 too. So 188 is actually completely useless lmfao
Also will be saving this post!! :)
I love seeing people who want to get by the CS degree the easy, less stressful way by taking light techs like 160, 161, 186, 194s. Then they naively choose to take CS 188 and just get absolutely railed with the impossible difficult exams.
So you think 188 is harder than those?
188 is ""easy"" up until the exams. The content is so wishy-washy and everyone gets 100-ish on the projects and HW. 188 isn't a ""hard"" class, but 188 is a ""hard class to get a good grade in because wtf did we even learn"".
I took all of the classes OP mentioned and 188 ruined my 4.0 GPA (i got a B+)

It‚Äôs also his/her/their worst rated class. So yes, 188 was harder than all if those IMO. Your effort in this class doesn‚Äôt correlate well to the exams and the concepts don‚Äôt even come up as someone who‚Äôs interviewed for many ML engineer positions.
Seems like an odd way to run a course... so was it more useful to look at past exams?"
Professor Anant Sahai as a Berkeley undergraduate,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/24x0d9/professor_anant_sahai_as_a_berkeley_undergraduate/,2014-05-06 18:49:21,"[Professor Anant Sahai](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/) is teaching [CS70 Spring 2014](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/sp14/).

Sahai as a high school senior: http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon

A student asked on the classroom forum Piazza:

> **Sahai -- what are your daily rituals?**

> From the very beginning of the semester you've stressed the importance of time management and many times have both implicitly and explicitly stated that after eating and sleeping we should be working.

> For a source of inspiration, would you mind sharing what an average day of being Prof. Sahai is like? I'm sure me and many others would find it interesting.


> EDIT: Or maybe even a college version in the past when you were a student vs nowadays, if you're so inclined.

Professor Anant Sahai replied:

> College Anant Sahai:

> I didn't keep detailed records of my time, so this is from unreliable memory.

> Took a nap pretty much every day. Aaah Foothill La Loma dorms --- so close for naptime. (I moved into Foothill the first fall it opened.)  And the lounge space around Sibley Auditorium --- perfect for napping. Later I lived essentially across the street from Tolman --- also close enough for napping.

> At the beginning, called home every single day. I missed my brother tremendously. Also wrote paper letters to folks back home --- long-distance phone calls were expensive! And there was no widespread email.

> Lived freshman year in Clark Kerr in a suite. The building was rather antisocial back then, and my suite was close to the entrance. So me and my suitemates would order a pizza every night (I hit my lifetime quota of Fat Slice in about a semester and a half) and prop the door open. It was a salon of sorts --- late night pizza, random philosophical conversations, and playing some cards. (The Monty Hall Puzzle came into it when it was sweeping the country. Main card games: speed and 24.) People paid their share of the pizza, but my suitemates and I put in the effort to make this happen. Lots of discussions in the evening about the material we were learning in courses, life, religion, philosophy, and political speculation. That kept happening throughout undergrad. We also played a rather grotesque variant of 20 questions in which you had to guess how someone died and why. 

> Took Math H50A (the then equivalent of Math H54) and H50B (the then equivalent of Math H53) as a freshman. Immensely challenging homeworks that really made you learn the material. It was also amusing to watch a class start with 50-some students and end the year with just 5 of us. Great fun. I learned everything in Math 110 as well as the usual 53/54 content, as well as a chunk of Math 128. This is the course that, more than any other single course, impressed upon me what Berkeley was really about. Why this is the greatest University on this planet. Oh by the way, H50AB was taught at the time by a faculty member who was joint Math and EECS. (He is now retired.) 

> Took Physics H7ABC. Also great fun. Loved the hard homeworks and fun exams. Enjoyed hearing stories from older Physics faculty reminiscing about the Manhattan Project. Had entered Berkeley unsure about EECS vs Math vs Physics. Seriously considered Physics before realizing that EECS really had the theoretical depth that I wanted.

> Spent many hours on the Math and Physics problem sets. And enjoyed every bit of it. Had study group sessions with others in the course. In general, throughout undergrad, I learned a lot by helping others. It really is the best way to understand something.

> Enjoyed 60ABC (the names then for 61ACB) a lot. Made it a ritual along with his friends to climb to the roof of Pimental before any midterm or exam and dance around. (DO NOT DO THIS.) Found these courses mostly quite easy --- although 60C with Prof. Hilfinger took some time and was great fun. (As was 60A with Stuart Russell and 60B with John Ousterhout, both fun but not very time consuming.) 

> Attended a great mini-course by CSUA and XCF on advanced Emacs Lisp. With his best friend (who he met in H50A and H7A, took most classes with and who came with him to MIT for grad school), wrote an emacs lisp program to help automate playing DikuMUD (a text-based multiplayer role-playing game).  Fun. We did this in the evenings of freshman year first semester while taking 60A.

> Used to watch Anime every monday evening at the Cal Anime club. (With that same best friend above --- who used to take Japanese courses.) 

> Spent countless hours in the Eta Kappa Nu office just chatting with people and tutoring folks. And learning by osmosis. You'd be surprised what all you can pick up just by watching people tutor others in upper-division courses! I believe my friend and I might have been the founding compserv officers and we were one of the originators of the ""challenges"" tradition that candidates have to do. 

> I ate food in the dorms at meal times my freshman and sophomore years. After that, I moved into an apartment when my brother also came to Berkeley. Then I used to enjoy cooking. 

> I tried to sleep a good amount every night, and following my parents general rules, no studying the night before an exam or in the near vicinity of an exam. I could help others though --- so final time was always great fun. Lots of spare time to enjoy myself! Dead week started later while I was a student.

> Never took an American Cultures course --- that requirement started after I had joined. My brother took it though, so I learned a lot of the material in the linguistics one indirectly. 

> Took lots of Math courses: I think 104, 113, 185, and 125. 

> This was before 70 and 126. So I took Math 55 and Stat 134. It was before 127 so I took an IEOR optimization course. 

> The classes that kept me up late: EECS 192 (I believe I was in the inaugural class for that), 150 (It was a big class then. In my year, the project was essentially a trick. If you tried to solve it directly, you were doomed. My group [with my best friend again] and a group of grad students were the only ones who finished the project. Both of us realized that it was easier to solve a harder problem --- design and make our own computer, write our own compiler for it, and then write a computer program to solve the given project.), and a special Engineering course that taught us everything you needed to know to start a company. (This was before the dot com boom.) We proposed a company to deal differently with email that we had called SpectralMail. One of my cofounders (also one of my best friends and fellow HKN officer) went on to found HotOrNot while a Berkeley PhD student. Another has also had a bunch of startups. 

> I took 221A and 222 as an undergrad. That was fun. Grad courses were a lot more work. And intense. No real study group though because I was the only undergrad in the course. 

> Spent my summers at research internships. Back then, Berkeley had a formal internship program for top EECS undergrads. Lots of places like Xerox PARC and HP Labs and so on would only take undergrad interns from MIT and Berkeley. Grad students only from any other place --- which made sense I guess given how our curriculum is so out of everyone else's league. 

> Anyway, for the most part, I always made sure to eat, sleep (including daily naps), and have fun. It was a lot easier to be focused on study-relevant fun in the days before Facebook, laptop computers, mobile phones, and the world-wide-web.  As far as I can tell, the only really good thing that has come from the internet age for education is Wikipedia. Not sure if the others actually help anyone learn anything better given the amount of time they suck up. Computers are nice, I guess. But even back then we had things like Mathematica and programming environments. So, we could explore things on our own even before the Internet. 

> EDIT TO ADD: Forgot to mention that I was on the Berkeley ACM Programming contest team. My year, we didn't do so well. When my brother was on the team, we won the International competition. Best in the world.

A student asked:

> Have you ever bombed an exam, or had moments where you felt you couldn't keep up with all your classes?

Sahai replied:

> Unfortunately, I never really had those kinds of feelings personally, at least not in a way that is real --- in that I felt bad because I really did do badly. But I did have close friends who felt that way so I have some empathic experience with them. I know that it can be hard to walk out of high school a star and then find yourself in the middle of the pack here in Berkeley. I've seen enough tears from my fellow students when I was a student, and tears from my students as a faculty member.

Another student asked:

> I'm asking these questions because I was thinking a lot about it and I'd like to see your input about it, prof. Sahai:

> 1. question: Have you ever felt that you are missing out on life's opportunities (say, backpack through Cambodia for 6 months or move to another country) by basically sacrificing everything to Mathematics or science? Not to say that they aren't worth sacrificing for, but to me this seems to be a curse for talented people (which makes me happy that I'm a mere mortal)...

> 2. question: How do you perceive brain drain? While you yourself were raised in California, I believe you (and advisors in general) are very influential in the development of (graduate) students, many of whom are international.. And I have noticed on your website that basically all your students stayed in the US. Is brain drain just a necessary evil on our path to evolving towards a global community or is it a real issue that should be counteracted?

Sahai replied:

> These are easy to answer:

> 1) No. Serving learning is a wonderful calling, and it is no sacrifice to spend time and effort on what you truly love. Are there tradeoffs? Yes, but they're due to the nature of time and space, not learning. Is the world perfect? No! But when people say that academia and learning will break your heart, they aren't referring to the nature of Math, Science, and Engineering. They are referring to the flaws in an economic/political system that blocks talented people from doing work they love that also truly needs to be done while helping humanity, just because they have to eat and take care of their families and the powers that be refuse to let them do so.

> 2) As an American, I like things that help the people of the United States. Having smart people coming here and staying to contribute, well that just makes good sense. Does it hurt other countries and other populations? Not really. If the other country wants to support them, they are free to do so. Most people would gladly return to their home region to contribute there. Look at Europe. Lots of people go back there. But I have seen far too many cases of places that basically refuse to do this. They know what needs to be done (give people freedom and create decent paying jobs with autonomy) and refuse to do it. Because in most cases, the local powers that be want to keep the rich and powerful rich and powerful. So, a person doing research in the USA is actually doing more for the people of their home country than that person would be doing back home.

> Lots of people contribute charitably back to their countries of origin --- and many I hope also contribute to help support the kinds of reformist and revolutionary organizations/social-movements that are needed to actually make real change happen.  (I'm not saying that the powers that be have any better motivations in the USA --- hierarchical power is inherently corrupting. It is just that social movements in the USA have, in the past, helped tame those forces at least a bit.) It is the will of the people and the blood, sweat, and tears of activists that matter. They made a better life for people and the ones active today are planting the trees that future generations will enjoy.","I think Sahai really hit it home regarding his opinions of how ""weaker"" students are treated at cal. During my time at cal, I saw many weaker students who were probably well better off at another university. I went from a high school star to being just a tad above average in engineering at cal, and even that kinda hurt. I can't imagine the kind of pain students go through who end up well below average even after giving their best efforts in their exams. Not only does that destroy their confidence but it also hampers post graduation dreams, which ride on the marks you received at cal. 
[deleted]
I have tons of respect for Sahai, and he clearly does for all of his students, but I will never enjoy theory even nearly much as he does. His CS70 class was by far my least favorite CS class I've taken so far (except for 161 with Tygar, but that was for a whole other set of reasons).
Sahai as a high school senior: http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon

Sahai's comment about the *Los Angeles Times* article:

> I'm surprised you folks were able to pull up a news article from back then.

> When you're a senior in high school, you attribute things to whatever is cognitively most available. I had spent 2nd and 3rd grade in India where I walked into classes being horribly behind in Hindi and multiplication/arithmetic. The numbers had always been friends, but I needed drill to catch up. So my mom helped me. Pilani at the time was a little neighborhood around the research center surrounded by sand dunes. (Seriously, we had sandstorms and everything!) My memories from then are mostly of riding my bike around the neighborhood, playfully planning the (purely theoretical and theatrical) destruction of my school, and the gorgeous night sky filled with stars (in summers we used to sleep outside under the stars). And following the ants around to see what they were up to.

> Looking back, the real special advantage I think was just my family and upbringing --- especially having a brother so close in age to me. We had so much fun together doing math, programming, legos and (yes) playing video games and writing our own ""kid's constitution"" and playing all sorts of make-believe games involving everything from TV cartoon characters to the lives of subatomic particles.

> Also, I now think that my elementary school education in Thousand Oaks was actually very good --- I was just an arrogant little kid at 17 who dismissed it in high school looking back because it had seemed very easy by comparison. But it built confidence and encouraged a love of learning and curiosity --- e.g. my 4th grade teacher put up with my childhood fascination with nuclear weaponry (I shudder to think of what would happen today to a kid who was fascinated by nuclear weapons) and fusion reactors. My 5th grade teacher let me do my own thing vis-a-vis math and reading. I also learned great lessons in macroeconomics, taxation, and public spending from an elementary school experiment of trying to create a class-room-sized economy. In junior high, I remember one of the highlights was trying to simulate trials for figures from history and writing our own constitution. And learning how to do research papers (I did mine on the works of Isaac Asimov) in English classes --- the first place you get exposed to scholarly thinking. At those ages, I think it is good to focus on actual learning instead of worrying about some absurd attempt at measuring performance. I never thought about any standardized test. Ever. It is sad that many of you can't say the same.

> Anyway, the cusp of high school and the years of college are a magical time. You feel your powers coming in, and it is exhilarating. Especially at a place like Berkeley where every hard homework makes you stronger. The joy of actually feeling the magic flowing through you. It is simply indescribable. You all should enjoy it. All the tiredness will fall away and leave your memory. You'll just remember the fun.
Anant's a real prodigy and he really really loves Cal. Even when he was a grad student at MIT he told everybody who would listen that his dream was to be a prof at Cal. Provably, he did choose Cal among all other places he could have joined as professor. 
The most important question and answer:

Q: What was your favourite anime? I bet it was Ranma 1/2.

A:
>This was before Miyazaki's work was mainstream in the USA. So, for me, I would have to include his great films at the top of the anime list back from those days. In particular from back then: Laputa, Nausicaa, and Totoro. Other works that I still remember (which I guess makes them my favorites from back then) were, in no particular order: Vampire Princess Miyu, Record of Lodoss War, Ranma 1/2, Kimagure Orange Road, Oh My Goddess!, and yes, Urusei Yatsura (which I remember not liking quite as much as Ranma 1/2). I, of course, watched many many more including lots involving big robots. But those blur together in my mind after 20+years.  
 
>Watching anime at the Berkeley club was particularly fun back then because a lot of the subs were actually fan subs --- many done by the active club members. So we were watching things that simply were completely unavailable to anyone else.

-weaker student
I'm transferring to Berkeley Engineering in the Fall and this terrifies me.  And I was just starting to convince myself that it's normal to feel intimidated by the rigor of Cal.  I can't say that I've ever ""fired on all cylinders"" though, so maybe that's a good sign. :/
I'm graduating this semester then starting a PhD program in option II EECS in the fall and recently I've been going around thanking all of the professors that helped me get to where I am. I want to express my gratitude to Professor Sahai because I would be nowhere without the three courses I took with him but I'm scared that he'll ask me what I'm doing with my life... I know he will say the same thing to me D':  
You don't think that getting into MIT for grad school might be an indication that you had what it takes to compete at that level? 
Will be taking his class in fall, any tips on how to do well? I heard the practice problems are tedious, is there anything else I should be expecting?
A student asked:

> ""Sahai has been accepted at the University of California, Berkeley, and has also applied to the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University.""

> http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon

> Why did you and your brother choose Berkeley instead of some other school? What about Berkeley stood out to you?

Sahai replied:

> Berkeley is the best, of course! Why else? Berkeley essentially has more top ranked departments than anywhere else in the world. That was true then as it is true now. Berkeley is the number one choice of winners of the National Science Foundation fellowship for graduate study. Despite being smaller than MIT as far as science and engineering go. This is true now, but I didn't think about this when I was in high school. I just knew that when it came to academic reputation, nobody really tops Berkeley. I had also heard the reputation of Berkeley as a place that didn't pull any punches or coddle students. It expects the best and doesn't care if people suffer. That no-compromise stance appealed to me as compared to places like Stanford. 

> I also was drawn to Berkeley's comprehensive excellence. It isn't just the best in Engineering and Science, it is a powerhouse in the humanities, social sciences, and the arts. In my mind then, that was one of the main negatives of MIT. CalTech was just too small for my taste. In hindsight, I think that I expected too much interaction across the humanities and engineering. So while I took a full year of Sanskrit at Berkeley and attended a few courses outside the Northeast Quadrant of campus, my connections to the rest of campus were mostly through attending the occasional seminar or evening talk. (MIT has those too and when I was there, I actually took Sanskrit literature courses at Harvard for a bit before deciding that I was too busy and riding the #1 bus a few times a week was too much commuting for me.) Stanford is also well rounded but I didn't perceive it as such when I was in high school. 

> I had visited both Berkeley and Stanford in the summer --- and the intellectual vibe and intensity at Berkeley really hit me. The city around campus was also different for me --- having grown up in SoCal suburbia. 

> Honestly, I don't think there was ever a day that I ever regretted going to Berkeley as an undergrad. I got the best possible education in every possible dimension. And looking back, it made sense. I was Berkeley's type. 

> As a faculty member, I have come to increasingly feel that while Berkeley is spectacular for super strong students like I was (and most of my friends who were all in HKN, etc.), **lots of weaker students would be better off elsewhere at places that are generally more supportive.** Our EECS model (and 70 in particular) of high expectations tempered with high levels of support is a bit of the exception on this campus. And even our support presumes that students have ample capacity in reserve after doing very well at high school. (Again, like me. In high school, studying schoolwork more than an hour or so per day after school was rare. I studied other stuff for fun, hacked computer programs, did origami, etc.) **The student who was firing on all cylinders and only then able to hit high marks in high school --- the pain that awaits them here makes me shudder at times. It isn't the party line, but I have to say it out of compassion for students: I think that this university doesn't always support all the high-striving students that it admits. And that isn't fair. If we take someone on striving, we should have supportive paths for people who are striving. But we largely don't. So students make heroic efforts. And maybe that grows their character and makes them better people. But there is a pretty wide stream of tears that flows through Strawberry Creek into the Bay.**

A student asked:

> ""The student who was firing on all cylinders and only then able to hit high marks in high school --- the pain that awaits them here makes me shudder at times. It isn't the party line, but I have to say it out of compassion for students: I think that this university doesn't always support all the high-striving students that it admits.""

> +1. I studied my hardest in high school to get into Berkeley, which has been far harder than my high school. I try my hardest and frequently score below the average (sometimes a standard deviation below the average) on tests.

> I sometimes wonder whether it would have been better to study somewhere else. Less rigor and less pain, more support and hopefully better test scores.

> What would you recommend Berkeley do to support students in this situation?

Sahai replied:

> It is because of students like you that I wrote what I wrote. 

> I think that for students in your shoes, the most basic thing that Berkeley can/should do is provide an on-ramp. A recognition that not everyone gets through material at the same pace and that some people just need more time to get up to speed. Firstly, the unit minimums are just insane. Why not let someone take 6-7 years through the system? If they aren't just taking lots of courses, then who are they hurting? It's not like they are taking seats away from someone else. This way, students can choose whether they want to take the slow and steady path where they could work hard to build themselves up. Yes, it's a few more years of your precious youth and $100K or more in lost income. But for some, the sacrifice is worth it. For others, not so much. Let people make that choice. Second, the campus should support the development of self-paced companions to core courses --- this way, there would be a more structured set of resources available for students who want to spend more time on a course. Third, students should be able to self-declare an incomplete in a course if they want to take it spread out over two semesters --- or a semester and a summer. Since this does take up extra seats, instructor permission should be required. But looking at the distributions in 70, we would be talking about at most 30% max of the students taking this option. This could be compensated for by giving such students lower priority in their choice of section times, etc. 

> More controversially, I think that Berkeley should offer two options that are not offered now. (1) Slow-start admission --- where students are told that we would love to have them here, but only after they complete a couple of years of courses somewhere that can help bring them up to speed in an environment that is a better transition. This could be a CC or it could be another UC or a CSU or even a place like Harvey Mudd. As long as they meet the required grades at this less competitive place, we should tell them that they are in. We know how to deal with transfers, but some people should be pre-emptive transfers. This combined with the on-ramp ideas above should probably take care of many cases. The transition will be smoother for many if it is less abrupt. For many, it could simply be a matter of style. There are plenty of other ways to teach people the basics.

> (2) Berkeley should have a system that is the equivalent of the ""minor leagues"" in baseball. For many students, they don't know that they would've been better off elsewhere until they actually show up here and experience it. But by then, all their other offers have evaporated. They're stuck. And if they leave, there is no clear way back. I think that at the very least, the other UCs should participate. A lot of students who struggle here could be stars at Riverside, Merced, Davis or Santa Cruz. Confidence matters and if there was an easy path to another UC, a lot of people would/should take it. Then, after they have built up their basic skills and rebuilt their confidence, let them have an honest shot at transferring back if they want it and feel they would benefit. Let them visit for a semester. Try it out again. Then (if they do well), let them decide if they would rather complete their degree here or back where they were sent.

> Basically, the system needs to be built to help people succeed rather than just giving them a shot. 

> What I would actively oppose is simply reducing the intensity of the Berkeley education in an effort to be more inclusive or supportive. The world needs many different kinds of places just like it needs many different kinds of people. Harvey Mudd exists. They have a kinder gentler approach to CS. That is good for many. Kudos to Harvey Mudd for supporting that. But I think that Berkeley's style of uncompromisingly intense education is also something that is important to have in the world. What does ""access"" even mean if you take away the very thing that people want to access?

A student asked:

> ""I think that at the very least, the other UCs should participate. A lot of students who struggle here could be stars at Riverside, Merced, Davis or Santa Cruz.""

> Wouldn't this be offensive to those other UCs though? It's like saying if you can't make it at MIT, you should go to Berkeley. Those other UCs would become the ""backup schools"" and serve like CCs that you try to transfer out of rather than institutions where you get your full undergraduate learning.

Sahai replied:

> If someone can't make it at MIT, they'd get wiped out here. MIT is better at supporting weaker students. For many students who are struggling here, they would be better served at MIT. For others, even MIT's support model can't help them. Many of those would be better served at Stanford which has yet a different model. Harvey Mudd is another place that is very good about supporting students who would struggle here.

> What I am saying is that there are different styles of teaching that work well for different students. Intensity is only one dimension. We believe it is very important for making the ""special ops ninjas"" that we like to train. But not everyone wants to be a ""special ops ninja."" When they were choosing Berkeley, they had no idea what that even meant. Many people had very little idea what they were getting into. (Not everyone has PhD parents and family friends who know what different schools are really like.) There are even people out there who (shudder) actually believe that the US News and World Report rankings for undergrad places overall mean something. (They don't realize that most of the faculty members in the most of those places would rather be at Berkeley than where they are.) What matters is how well students do in terms of getting something out of the courses and how well they contribute to the campus community. 

> If someone is mismatched at Berkeley and finds a better learning environment at Riverside, that shouldn't be bad for either Berkeley, the student, or Riverside. Nobody should accept slackers. I am talking about the hard-working students who just find themselves mismatched. Helping students is more important.

A student wrote:

> I keep hearing that Berkeley doesn't support students, but professors and TAs have weekly office hours and student groups like HKN have tutoring sessions. There doesn't seem to be a lack of support here. You and a lot of other people say MIT, Stanford, Harvey Mudd, and other UCs provide more support than Berkeley.

> What kind of services/support do they provide that Berkeley doesn't provide?

Sahai replied:

> We in EECS support students pretty well. It is not clear other departments here do as much as we do. But as I said before, all of our support is predicated on students being able to put in the time. We currently have no real mechanisms to support students who are simply hitting their maximum waking hours limit. At most of our competitors (MIT is a possible exception for certain courses where they are pretty much like us), there is simply less stuff in the courses at less depth. So there is more headroom in which support can be activated. That is the main advantage that other UCs can provide. A pace that is more manageable for many people.

> I love Berkeley. But it isn't for everyone.

A student wrote:

> Oh, so you're saying that Berkeley covers material at much more depth and at a faster pace while other universities don't? Is there any hard evidence or studies for this, or is it just anecdotal? It's difficult to believe that MIT, CIT, or CMU (for example) aren't as challenging (or more challenging) than Berkeley.

> Is it also because Berkeley is on the semester system so covers more material and most of the UCs aren't? Would changing to a quarterly system make the pace more manageable for more people?

> ""there is simply less stuff in the courses at less depth. So there is more headroom in which support can be activated.""

> What kind of support do they activate that we at Berkeley can't activate because of more depth? Andrew of 61A and Mona of 61B do Guerilla sections. Is that the kind of support they activate‚Äîmore help from the TAs at a more individualized level?

Sahai replied:

> I know only from courses that I have taught personally as well as from courses that I saw when I was an undergrad vs when I was a graduate student, and conversations with my colleagues at other schools. MIT, CMU, and CalTech are pretty close to us in general. But for example, compare the old 126 (before 70 became a required prereq) to MIT's 6.041. There was a pretty big difference in depth. (And there had to be --- 6.041 serves more majors than just EECS.) New 126 has 70 required so the comparison isn't even fair anymore.

> But in general, the following is a representative comment from faculty elsewhere (not MIT/CalTech/CMU): ""I wish we could teach that here, but we don't have Berkeley students. Our kids won't put up with that sort of intensity."" as well as ""I don't have the TAs that could pull that off.""  

> Like I said in the first lecture, I like Berkeley students. :-)
lol @ no dragon ball z. What a joke of a list.
It's been cancelled?!? Do you know why? I heard Professor Sahai is teaching CS 70 again in the fall, but I assumed EE 121 would be pushed to Spring. 
He said on the first day of CS70 this semester that he only applied to Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT for both undergrad and grad school, and got into all three both times.
[deleted]
Read the published lecture notes before lecture and work out the proofs yourself after reading through them. Then read through the notes again. Then start the homework, and finish at least before the weekend so you can re-do everything you did wrong. Repeat every week for a semester. 

Or just skip Sahai's semester and take it with an easier professor.
Same as elephonky said. I also highly recommend finding a group of people to work on the homeworks together with. Sahai also runs weekly homework parties (basically large group office hours) where you can get help from TAs if needed.

The most important part is start early. Each problem set can easily take 10+ hours.
A student asked:

> What would you say the top things are that an EECS student should ingrain and do these next few years going through college + grad school?

> We missed out on developing the iron man work ethic you got as a young child, but what can we do now to be the best we can be?  What kind of habits should we develop (and how!) and what kind of character traits should we build?  What should we live by?

> If it matters, I feel that my interests match very closely to your interests as a college student in terms of loving the applied math + theory in EECS.

> How does a strong student, who you say can really benefit fully at a place like Berkeley, take themselves to the next level?

Sahai replied:

> Help others. This will help you understand the basics. The basics are the most important.  

> Take challenging classes. This will make you spend time. And spending time is the key to affection.

> And finally, eliminate the emotional barriers that separate yourself from the material. You need to let yourself live and breathe it. To feel it flowing through you. To understand the nature of its existence. It might seem corny, but you have to let yourself truly love the subject.

Another student wrote:

> Hi Professor,

> I really loved the response. Quick question though - you mentioned that your parent had ""general rules, no studying the night before an exam"". Did this always work out for you and your brother?

> Also, were there any other study routines that your parents enforced that you found particularly different than other students?

Sahai replied:

> The idea was simple: studying is an integrated part of our existence, not some sort of weird exceptional activity. So, if someone has a birthday party, you go to the birthday party. Studying or homework or an exam is not an excuse not to go. Family obligations come first. Because, first and foremost, you are an integral part of your family. 

> My parents grew up in joint families and felt that we should have some approximation of that family feeling of having many kinsmen. So, they concentrated on making sure that we had a group of family friends who were as close as kin. Family values must be lived to be shared and propagated.

> I think that the biggest difference that I see between my upbringing and many students today is just the vast amounts of unstructured free time that my brother and I enjoyed. (Maybe we took swimming lessons when we were younger.) All of summers growing up were largely free time. As were essentially all afternoons and weekends. We did whatever we wanted. Explored whatever we wanted to explore. Dug holes. Read about bugs. Made lego armies. Decided to make origami cranes. Played cards. Wrote our own little computer programming language interpreter. Whatever. My parents believed that childhood is for being a child. And the essence of childhood is playing and curiosity. We had close family friends and would get together every week at least, and with some family friends, every other day. Then us kids would play. Free-form make-believe play, as well as the usual suspects of tag, hide-and-go-seek, etc. Little to no adult supervision. Sometimes, we would just read. Or tell each other stories. Or puzzles. One of my family friends (she was also one of my co-valedictorians from my high school and also came to Berkeley) did Rubics cubes and taught herself card-tricks --- the great thing was when she went from having a finite number of card tricks to having an infinite number. (She would never repeat the same trick twice unless we forced her too.)

> It's been very intriguing reading your responses in this thread--I really appreciate you taking your time to answer these questions for us! :)

> I've noticed all semester that you have a disdain for social media and cell phones. This definitely makes sense in the context of a college professor and a college class--Students waste time playing Candy Crush or chatting on Facebook when they should be studying and therefore do worse on exams. But after your response here it seems like your dislike for procrastination-prone technology goes past studying and work ethic. The line, ""I feel sad for students today whose lives are so structured or who are under the tyranny of their mobile phone"" is really interesting for me. Can you explain what you mean? One could argue that last decade's card games are this decade's Words with Friends. And, in what ways (besides cell phones, social media, etc.) do you think students' lives today are more structured?

Sahai replied:

> There is a huge difference between a card game, where we can all decide to change the rules mid-hand, and ""Words with Friends."" In one, you are in charge and empowered. In the other, you have to follow somebody else's rules because the silicon serves only one master --- and that isn't you.

Thanks you for the tips. I'm planning to prepare over summer too, any advice on how I should approach it?
thank you!
how you do at mit
Enjoy your summer. Make an app. Get a job. Go camping. Get drunk.

Seriously, unless you have absolutely nothing better to do, wait until the semester starts to deal with CS70. You could read lecture notes from this semester and do the homeworks, but I would be really impressed if you got past the second or third homework. They were an ungodly amount of work. 
thank you :)"
