## **Student's Piazza post**

> **Advice for dropping out of college as an EECS major**
> 
> Not sure if there are any previous posts regarding this so I decided to make my own. My circumstances right now:
> 
> - I am a first-year transfer majoring in EECS
> 
> - This is my second semester and I have taken or am taking CS61A, B, and C, 70, and EE16A
> 
> - I am a full-time student also working two part-time jobs and the ocassional freelance work
> 
> - I am from a very low-income family and I am the main source of income
> 
> My source of stress and the reason why I am considering this at all is because of the last point listed above. I currently receive full financial aid for my classes (besides the summer semester, for some reason) and the extra money I get from grants/loans along with the money from working is crucial to my family's survival. Forgive me if it sounds like I'm dramatizing that, but I can't really think of a better way to put it.
> 
> This May, I will not have enough money to support my family lest we resort to living in a shelter or cramped apartment. Even then, we would not have enough money for a lot of the necessities we pay for every month. The only options I can think of are to drop out/take a semester off or attend school part-time, all in order to have time for a full-time job as a software engineer. I believe I have the necessary experience and side projects already for landing such a job, but naturally I'm afraid to just drop out. The problem with taking a semester off or attending part-time is that, since I'm a transfer in the engineering department, I believe I only have a limited number of semesters here before I can no longer enroll. I suppose I could petition to stay longer as another option, though.
> 
> In summary, I'm considering dropping out to support my family before we go homeless. If I have the experience and confidence in my skills to land a software engineering job right now, should I go for it? Some clarification for how long an EECS transfer can attend would also be appreciated.

> I am very sorry to hear about your situation.
> 
> Have you considering finding an internship over the summer? You seem like a very resilient person, and after all the tribulations life has thrown at you, I am sure finding an internship will be no problem. Given how well internships pay, you can both take care of your family and not drop out of school.
> 
> Please hang in there. You can do it. Just one more year to go, then you can find a comfortable full time software engineering job with your Berkeley degree without any problems. College, and especially the world's best colleges like Berkeley, lift their graduates out of poverty into the middle class. You won't need to worry about finances any more then. You're so close. Don't give up.

The OP wrote:

> OP here. Thank you for the kind words. An internship has certainly been one of my options. Unfortunately, it may only be a temporary fix if I continue to attend school full-time in the next academic year.

## **Student's comment**

A student wrote:

> EECS transfer here. I think you have five semesters in total, and I heard you can postpone graduating if you do a co-op or full-time internship. Please talk to your ESS advisor as they know the stuff best! Besides, there are a lot of resources to support transfers. Talk to Tiffany Reardon at ESS! All the best. 

The OP wrote:

> OP here. Thank you for this information! I wasn't aware of any postponement policies, so I'll confirm this with an advisor very soon.

> After freshman year, I ""dropped out"" of Berkeley CoE. Then I worked as a software engineer and was making ~$50/hour. Then I decided to go back to school after 2 years. Afterwards, I still had an offer to work part time but I decided to focus on school. Like you, I also had 0 EFC.
> 
> Your income may affect your financial aid EFC. However, if your parent/parents that you put on your FAFSA has a income under the zero EFC threshold, you will get the automatic 0 EFC. Which means that no matter how much money you earn, if you qualify for 0 EFC, you will still get the 0 EFC.
> 
> Hypothetically, if you work part time for 20 hours a week and $30/hour, you'd be making $2500 pre tax which would be good enough to cover your family expenses if you keep things budgeted. Also do keep in mind that the more money you make, the more taxes you pay so working 40 hours a week may not necessarily give you twice as much as if you had worked 20 hours a week. Working part time will probably affect your GPA but I think thats a compromise you would have to make. Also, having an internship over the summer can get you like $15k over the course of the summer which might be enough to barely scrape by.
> 
> One reason for my coming back to school is that I would be able to make more money after I graduate. I'd suggest that you try to find a way to make ends meet and graduate soon so that you can get a full job.
> 
> [Warning: Next part is something most people initially won't agree with. But I'm just sharing my personal experience on how I made careful decisions to make ends meet]. Contrary to what people may say, it may also be a good idea to go into debt. This is a view that I have that not many people agree with, but in my situation, I made a calculated risk to go into (0% interest) debt in order to have more emergency cash padding. If you want to take a gamble that you will be able to find a good six figure job after you graduate, consider going into debt. $1 today is as valuable as $0.20 in a few years.
> 
> (As a side story, my mom passed away within the past year meaning i am no longer eligible for the 0 EFC next year and my income counts against me. However, I can submit a appeal for student contribution. Also, you can get a appeal for budget adjustment to get more financial aid.)
> 
> Feel free to ask any questions about my own experience

The OP wrote:

> Thank you for sharing this. Could you clarify what you mean by going into debt? I'm already taking out federal loans and, aside from borrowing from people I personally know, I don't see how private loans would have 0% interest. My initial plan was to rely on my federal grants/loans and I was fairly confident I could land a decent job right after graduating to pay them off asap, but my circumstances have changed such that I now would need to take out more loans to go down that same route (something I consider riskier than just trying to find a job now and finishing school later).

A student wrote:

> (I'm the author of the initial response thread). By going into debt, I mean using it to make ends meet while you work towards graduating. My situation was probably different from yours in that I had built up a credit score and was eligible to apply for credit cards that gave 0% interest for 15-21 months. This allowed me to get access to about $20k in 0% interest (of course, I didn't use it all but it was something useful to have to pay for important expenses that financial aid didn't cover). Having a full time job also helped my chances of getting a credit card.
> 
> One plan that could work for you is taking one year off of school to work as a software developer. Then while you're there, save enough to help you get through for the next two years. And perhaps, if your credit score is okay, then you could even get 0% interest credit cards. With 15-21 months of no interest (Citi Simplicity; Chase Slate; Discover 18 months), you will be able to focus on school while also being able to survive. Then you will have only paid a few months of interest before you get a job hopefully making a decent salary.

> Oh, I think i'm writing in circles, but I hope this clarified things without making things more  confusing. Feel free to ask more questions.

A student commented:

> I'm the author of the initial response thread). Oh, one more clarification I have to make. My decision to open these credit cards were carefully planned and I had written up a detailed plan on how I was going to manage the money. If done haphazardly, credit cards could be cause more problems than it solves.

## **Student's comment**

A student commented:

> I just wanted to say that I wish you the best of luck with your situation. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to follow the EECS curriculum while supporting your family. All I know is that you must be extremely capable, smart, and hardworking if you've made it this far, and I'm sure that will help you a lot in your professional future. Keep going, you've made it so far!

## **Students' discussion**

A student commented:

> Are you white or Asian? If so, you're already privileged so this situation shouldn't be a problem. Just use your privilege!

A student commented:

> are you serious? No point to be a troll under this post

A student commented:

> Not a troll. Whites and Asians are privileged. They don't need help. Only minorities, LGBQT, etc. are victims. 

A student commented:

> Glad this page is not totally anonymous so at least staff members could know who this ridiculous person is ;)

A student commented:

> Let's please not make jokes here. This person (and the commmenter above) is revealing some highly personal information, and we should be mature about it. I, too, am not a fan of political correctness but this is the wrong forum to attack political correctness.

A student commented:

> I think it's relevant though. I have a slight feeling that the OP is Asian. He/she should know how the left views them: as overprivileged, monotonous automatons.

A student commented:

> What does this have to do with anything? OP is just asking for advice, and not once mentioned privilege or anything like that.

A student commented:

> Not sure how you assumed the OP was Asian. Also, it may be true the left views Asians and whites in the way you described. In fact, many posters in the ""Town halls too politically correct"" expressed that view. So that may be correct. However, by bringing this up, you're using the OP's plight to make a political point, which is not related to the discussion at all.

A student commented:

> At the risk of getting dragged into a fruitless debate, perhaps we should be mindful of the fact that everybody's personal situation and experiences are different. Trying to stereotype people, assign characteristics to arbitrary groups of people, and otherwise deny people their individual identities, thoughts, and feelings is unhelpful and harmful. This is regardless of whether it's done for comedic effect, to make a political point, or whether it stereotypes ""whites"", ""asians"", ""the left"", ""the right"", ""LGBQT people"".

A student commented:

> Asians aren't a monolithic group, either. Some groups are overall underprivileged, like southeast Asians.

An instructor replied:

> Why is this relevant or helpful? Please, try to be sensitive. This should be a supportive space; please try to be helpful and kind. The admins can see your names and we will not tolerate trolling.

I think OP is right, he should take a semester off and try to come back later. State of well-being comes first before studies, if you don't have your welfare taken care of before your studies, it will disturb your ability to study well. Definitely find out and petition the administration for extra semesters, meanwhile try to save as much as you can and try to find work. I don't know much about software job industry, but it's going to be tough. There wont be any guarantee finding a job but nevertheless do not give up and try to keep the work you already have. I do not recommend resorting to a shelter because from my experience the list to get in is very long and the environment is bit dangerous. Do not be discouraged from moving your family into a smaller apartment, people can definitely find ways to handle it. I am guessing OP's family don't work because they're immigrants or because of health issues. Nevertheless OP can try to save by getting handouts from food banks and churches, applying for programs like food stamps, getting discounts on utilities, and using public transit. 

TL;DR Don't be afraid to drop out and go for that software engineering job.
I don't want to identify myself otherwise I would post on the Piazza, but if the poster is from the greater Richmond area (and fucked up as this is, is Asian and is first or 1.5 gen) I might be able to give him some hook-ups for loans of up to ~$5k/semester at no interest until graduation.

(I'm also a transfer from a low-income family who needs to supplement household income. I quit my 30hr job and now I'm only working 15hr which is WAY more manageable)
Sigh at the one anon bringing in race into this smh
Take out loans rather than drop out imo. Graduating in several years with an EECS degree will more than pay for itself. 
We would have had free college with Bernie but we got a Drumpf instead. I'm so sorry about your situation. Please do set up a GoFundMe, and I will donate to it - it is the progressive thing to do while we are stuck in the dark ages with Drumpf.
if living in an apartment with your family is worst case scenario, it sounds like your family is living beyond its means. Have fewer kids next time?
Why does it matter if he is asian or not?
Financial aid for independent students covers tuition as well as housing. So college is basically free. Supporting a family on the other hand...
Any family is one diagnosis or cat accident away from this, potentially. Don't be such an asshole. 
You have no idea what you are talking about. You don't even understand the scenario described in the OP. 
tfw when you're too retarded to get into a decent uni and blame everything on affirmative action
Because that is how most Asians at Cal are- exclusive as fuck.
\>only losers are racist or sexist!

\>the people who hold all the power in society are discriminatory!

Make up your libshit mind lol. I went to ucsb. There were still too many dumbfucks there "
