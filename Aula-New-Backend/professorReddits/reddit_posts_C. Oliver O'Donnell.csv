An extensive overview of Foothill Student Housing,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12e2x8n/an_extensive_overview_of_foothill_student_housing/,2023-04-06 17:06:05,"Hi! Although a little late, I noticed that there wasn't anyone sharing their experiences for the incoming freshmen/transfers who need to choose their housing, so I wanted to share my own experience in foothill(The La Loma part). For context, I'm currently a freshman intending to major in applied math and CS. I'm international, and aside from my major, I enjoy chess, smash, and lifting. Without further ado, I'll be describing my experience here in the following sections:

1. The bedroom and general living space
2. The dining hall
3. The people
4. Utilities
5. The location
6. Miscellaneous

&#x200B;

# A Quick TLDR

If you're too lazy to read the whole thing, firstly, fair enough, and secondly, hears a quick short summary of what I'll discuss:

Foothill's a great dorm for those who enjoy their inside them. It's got a very nature-esque theme, is really close many relevant STEM buildings, as well as a soccer field and a gym. The people here, both students and staff, are generally nice. The students here are mostly nerds, so unless you like talking about Ricci Curvature Tensors, the ton of money you'll make after graduating in CS, or chess, you'll probably find most of the students here unappealing. Nonetheless, many are still social and fun(this is Berkeley after all), so they'd still be interested in lifting, frat parties, etc. The dining hall food is relatively good compared to the other options, and is somewhat flexible for those with vegan or vegetarian diets. It does have its bad days though. The dorm gym has enough for you to get a decent workout. There's a game room with ping pong tables, a piano, and a pool table, as well as housing the only kitchen in foothill. If you enjoy gaming, the esports center is right next to the dining hall, which has reasonably good equipment. There have been several clubs that have hosted events there, ranging from club socials to smash tourneys. 

&#x200B;

Foothill is a very ""you love it or you hate it"" kind of dorm. Unless you are majoring in STEM, would consider yourself nerdy, or love staying in, I wouldn't suggest foothill. Not by a hard no, but you'd probably be better suited for the units. If you tick any of those boxes off, foothill would be a reasonably strong pick for you. In regards to pricing though, I do believe foothill has some of the most expensive housing compared to the other dorms.

# The Bedroom and General Living Space

&#x200B;

As far as I'm aware, foothill was built in the 1990s, and you can really tell from the rooms. The bedrooms are all carpeted, and almost all the furniture, including shelfs, tables, bedstands, etc, are made of wood. It will more or less feel like a dorm your parents would have lived in back then. The bed is somewhat small, and although I don't know my mattress measurements,  I sometimes find my feet hanging(I'm 1.72m or 5' 8). As for comfort of the mattress, it's not hard or soft. Each bedroom comes with a wadrobe, a study table with drawers, a microwave, fridge, and shelves. In my room, my side didn't have a window, but as far as I know I'm an exception. The only window in my room though had broken curtains, so we couldn't use the window even if we wanted to. 

&#x200B;

The common area, which is a shared area to hang out among peers living near you(called a suite), will usually have some sort of couch or two, a working and a lounging table, and a shelf. What caught me by surprise was the surprisingly good view my dorm had from the common area. For reference, this is what a usual afternoon will look like from my dorm:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q6cadsxo9csa1.png?width=1936&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a12ac2f1dbc8f98b1da715600039f674ccdf2f

I do admit, I believe it's pretty specific to my building, as most of the other buildings face some sort of road instead. 

&#x200B;

The temperature in foothill is unfortunately inconsistent, most due to their broken heating/cooling systems. Firstly, for some reason all bedrooms come equipped with some sort of heater/fan, but you don't really know which one you're going to get. That means that sometimes you'll be stuck freezing during the winter or melting in the summer. What's worse is that you can't really control these systems for the most part, and some of them outright just don't work. If it's on, it'll stay on. Otherwise, it's probably broken. 

&#x200B;

The restrooms are pretty standard, with tiled floors, closed stalls, shower curtains, the usual. Soap dispensers are automatic, and there are no hand dryers, just paper towels. Also, I don't know if it was specific to my suite, but the flushing power was extremely weak for us. We'd frequently clog the restroom. The heating system for the water also had incidences of breaking, so I occasionally did have to shower using ice cold water.

&#x200B;

In case you couldn't tell from the photo, foothill is very much surrounded by nature. It almost feels like a theme of the dorm, as there's green all over the place. A few of the buildings are supported by wooden pillars, and you can frequently see liana wrapped around lots of the green. There are squirrels and bees, and funny enough, there have been two occasions in foothill where my dorm mate left his window open, an a creature flew in. One time it was a bat, the other time it was a hummingbird. 

The are around foothill is in my opinion the safest among all the dorms. It's much more North than the rest, and there's way crazy people sitting on the sidewalks. In fact, I've never seen a hobo near foothill. 

One of my main problems with the actual living experience of foothill is the janitor. I admit, this is extremely specific, and there's only about a 20% chance that this janitor will be assigned to you. Nonetheless, more info is always better. My suite's janitor was this Chinese dude, who barely spoke English. Essentially the only phrase he knew was ""Hi, how are you?"", to which if you respond, he usually ignores you. Out of cluelessness or lack of care I don't know. But I didn't really care about that. What upset me was that almost every time he cleaned(usually every Tuesday and Thursday), he would blast this Chinese radio station at what felt like full volume. He usually came late morning(10-11am), so realistically unless you slept late or something, it's just a noisy nuisance. But since I love working in the dorm, it does annoy me quite a bit.  


# The Dining Hall

You'll hear quite a few people say that Foothill has the second best food among the dining halls, only runner up to Clark Kerr. Although I haven't had the chance to try all the other dining halls, I will say that Foothill's food is mediocre. That sounds bad, it's relatively good compared to my other dining hall experiences. It serves food buffet style, which I'm certain is the general consensus among all the dining halls. This year, foothill dining had several distinct food choices: 

  
a) A daily changing station- This section of the dining hall changes food every day. Although they might mix it up, I've generally noticed that there's a pattern of Fried Rice on Mondays and Indian food on Thursdays. Aside from that, they've had tacos, beef rendang, tri tip, as well as some other random things. The quality of this station varies. The fried rice is usually dry and bland, the tri tip is either near-restaurant quality or made out of rubber, and on the occasion that they serve chicken wings or babyback ribs, it's arguably better than some restaurants. There's always a vegan alternative to the meat option they have here, though it's pretty uncreative. Essentially whatever meat option they have, say beef rendang, they just swap it out for tofu or some sort of bean, resulting in tofu rendang. You can imagine the quality is abysmal. 

b) Burger/hotdog station- As the name implies, Foothill usually has some sort of burger patty or hotdog, as well as they're vegan counterpart(beyond burger, etc). The patties are usually what you'd expect, being kind of dry and plain tasting, but it's a great protein option with some cheese or sauce if the main food sucks. They occasionally serve fries, chips, pulled pork, or corndogs too.

c) Salad station- It's probably closer to a bar, as the salads aren't pre made. With the exception of two salad options, they just give you all the raw ingredients, including a rotating set of greens, bell peppers, diced eggs, cheese, chicken breast, tofu, corn, edamame, corn, croutons, etc. Note that not all the mentioned options might be available, as they rotate most of them. There are the usual dressing options, such as vinaigrette, ceasar, ranch, blue cheese, and olive oil. 

d) Sandwich Station- Next the salad station is the sandwich station. Here the usually have four types of bread, usually some form of white, whole wheat, and grain, with a toaster if you your bread, well, toasty. For actual fillings, they have butter, jam/jelly, peanut butter, lettuce, tomato, onion, olives, hummus, tuna, tuna salad, egg salad, cheese slices, and cold cuts. I usually make myself a tuna melt if I don't like what the main line is serving.

e) Pasta and Soup Station- As the name implies, you can usually get some form of pasta or soup. For the pasta, it's most commonly spaghetti with sauce on the side(pesto, marinara, cream). They'll sometimes mix up the sauces by making chicken alfredo or putting italian sausage into the marinara, but that's really it. They might also serve mac & cheese or lasagna instead. Personally, I really don't like the usual sauce options they serve, but when they make a different sauce it's usually alright. The soup is generally a rotation of chowder, tortilla soup, broccoli cheddar, chicken noodle, chili, as well as some other things. I'm pretty sure most are just from cans, so they're about what you'd expect. 

e) ""Fit"" Bar- This one is quite weird. For the rest of the stations, you pick the meal yourself. At this station, you have to ask somewhat to scoop it for you. The station usually has some sort of grain(rice, couscous, quinoa), beans, ground meat, and some boiled veggies. You can tell they tried to make a generically healthy looking assortment. However, as you can imagine, it usually tastes horrible, being really bland, or really salty. Also, for some reason, the ground meat is really oily. I would not recommend eating at this station. 

&#x200B;

As for the actual environment, the dining hall continues the theme of nature, with more wooden pillar and walls. There's also a TV room to eat it in, and I've found myself in there watching things like the NFL or spongebob squarepants. Most of the staff in the dining hall are really friendly. They like talking with the students, talking with each other, and some aren't afraid to show their attitude towards selfish students, and I respect that. You can tell that most of them are happy to be here. Sometimes, their interactions among each other feel like the job is a side thing, and that they're here to hang out. Of course, they actually do their job, but what I'm saying is that the interactions are pretty wholesome. 

There's a shelf filled with condiments such as sriracha, ketchup, tapatio sauce, salt & pepper. There's also a microwave.

One of my main problems with the dining hall is the cleanliness. I'll frequently have to check my plate, utensils, and glass to make sure there aren't stained. I'd say on average one in every three spoons are clean. Ew. 

&#x200B;

# The People

One of the biggest things about college in general is meeting new people, and as such you might be interested in the people that usually live here. You might have heard that foothill is usual for nerds, as it's close to most of the STEM buildings. You'd be right. Many of the people living here are majoring in some sort of STEM. In fact, at least a fourth of all the people I met here were EECS majors. I believe I've only met two non-STEM majors, one being in legal studies, and another in business. If you wanna count psychology as a soft science or whatever, then sure, three people. 

However, because these are Berkeley nerds we're talking about, most are still social and normal people that like doing the occasional dumb things. Most people like chess, gaming, or going to the gym. I've had nights where I talked about who the greatest physicist is for hours, and then have cursed NSFW discussions the next night. One time, me and two other dorm mates engineered a contraption out of clothing hangers and shoe laces that could break into each other's bedrooms. And yes, we do still scream during dead week. Foothill students are generally quirky, and are a refreshing shift from the usual party/420 vibes that you might get from most other students. If you do want to meet normal people though, of course they exist here, just in less numbers.

# Utilities

Foothill has two laundry rooms, one for the La Loma side, and one for hillside(don't worry too much about what these mean, they're just divisions among the buildings here). I've seen videos about where people complain that their clothes still smell after a good wash, but either they've fixed the machines or the video makers just suck at chores, because my laundry comes out just fine. There are a severe lack of machines however, with about 7 washing machines to cater to the laundry needs of about 500 kids on La Loma alone. It's pretty common for impatient people to take out your laundry and put it on top of the machine if you're not there to pick it up.

Foothill has a really small gym, which until recently was just cardio machines and one sad cable machine with one extension. It now has a debatable ""upgrade"", as they've removed some of the cardio machine options(stationary bikes), for stair masters, a chest press & leg press machine, and for some reason a dysfunctional lat pulldown. They removed the cable machine too.

The last utility worth mentioning is the game room. This was my main hang out place at the start of the semester, as the games gave a good way to vibe with those around me. The game room comes with a couple tables, a ping pong setup(most people steal the paddles though), a pool table, a piano, as well as access to foothill's only kitchen. The kitchen itself is small, and I doubt you'd be able to cook simultaneously with two people in there. There's a stove, a fridge, and not much else. 

Other small little things include water fountains, which are bare for the most part. You'll have to drink tap water more often that not. Foothill is also right next to the Esports center, which comes equipped with reasonable quality PC setups. I wouldn't really know though, as I'm not a PC gamer. You can use it almost whenever, and sometimes things such as game club meetings and tourneys happen here. As a smash player, it's really convenient that the SAB club hosts almost all their tourneys here.

# Location

Foothill is located extremely close to many STEM buildings. The main ones being Cory hall, where most EECS majors will hang, and Soda Hall, where most CS discussions take place. These two are about 2-3 minute walks from foothill. Other really close buildings(4-7 minutes away) include Evans(main math building for OHs), the Physics Building, and Pimentel Hall(common for Chem lectures and exam locations). Some other locations worth noting, not because of closeness, but because of relevance, including Dwinelle & Wheeler, common for all sort of L&S lectures and exams, which is about a 12 minute walk, and Moffit lIbrary, the main on-campus study place for students, which is about a 15 minute walk.

Some relevant, non-academic locations near foothill include Stadium Fitness center(8 minute walk), which is the smaller, not as furnished but way less populated gym in Cal, as well as a soccer field right next to foothill on the top of a parking lot. If you enjoy soccer, they frequently play pick up soccer there. There's also the Greek Theater next to foothill, where lots of concerts take place. 

Aside from that, Foothill is far from the bustling atmosphere of Berkeley. Most restaurants are on the complete opposite side of Berkeley, so you won't be able to get Chipotle any time soon. It's strangely close to the frat area though(8-12 minute walk), so parties aren't too difficult to get to.

&#x200B;

# Miscellaneous

Some important info that doesn't really fit into anything I've said so far includes:

Price- I believe foothill's dorm pricing is the most expensive, at least from what I compared with my non-foothill friends.","I have good memories from my time there. 1999-2000. Hillside 614. Right next to the laundry room!
Current foothill resident here: OP was pretty thorough in their review of foothill, I’ll just add my stuff from my own experience living in foothill. The soccer field is above the parking lot and is ok, as there are two goals and it’s usually almost occupied by people playing a pick up game. However, it’s a popular hang out spot and if you want to play you can just introduce yourself and say hi. The majority of the time they would be happy and willing to let you join the game. It’s also a turf field, and because people wear cleats on it, the field quality isn’t the best. Another thing that OP didn’t specify was the price. Currently I live in a foothill double, which costs around 2300 a month. It’s actually really pricy for a double, even in Berkeley, although it includes a meal plan. Lastly, I can’t believe OP didn’t mention the turkeys. I think it’s the rain, but this year, especially in the spring, there has almost always been turkeys present in and around foothill. It’s really cool. Even when it’s not raining, you can find turkeys really close by to foothill. The big C has plenty of turkeys and they are quite common there. Foothill is really close to nature, and in my opinion, it’s a big plus.
Thank you!!! I needed this
Hey I liked Bing! (the Chinese janitor)
omg i just signed my housing agreement and i'm very happy that i got foothill! i'm not STEM but this is great thank you so much
Was the nice and and issue resolved? I read it was a big problem. I was not aware of the mice and ant issue. There is no way that I will be able to live let alone study under those conditions. I need to know the truth to see if I still have a chance to switch housing or figure out something else. I cannot imagine returning from break to find mice droppings all over my room or to try to fall asleep and wake up to mice or ants on my bed. The thought of this is taking my anxiety to the roof. I just can’t.
gym rat here haha what’s the dorm gym like? and how far away is RSF from foothill walking?
I don't know if I should be jealous or not. On one hand carrying the laundry basket back must be child's play. On the other hand oh gosh the noise.
Thanks for mentioning the price. Idk how I forgot about that. Also, lowkey, about the turkeys, I think I straight up forgot about them since I spend most of my days watching lectures in my room lol. But yeah there are turkeys, and I've noticed lots of deer near midnights as well.
No problem! Feel free to ask for any clarifications!
I like him for the most part too, as I can tell he’s trying, but damn that radio pisses me off.
As far as my time there was concerned, I didn't notice a single mouse. Ants can be a problem, as my suite mates frequently had ants in their place. It was more so recklessness on their end though, as they just let open packs of food lying around and whatnot. You can tell they never bothered to proper seal or lock away their food. I never had an ant problem to be honest. Just make sure to that your roommate isn't out of line with their food hygiene and it should be fine.

&#x200B;

In regards to wildlife though, there have been three notable incidents in my time here. I've found several mantises on my wardrobe and trashcan. My suitemates have also let in a hummingbird and a bat before during the night, and I've seen wasps come in during the day.
The dorm gym is alright. It actually got upgraded a couple months ago. Idk if they'll change anything when you come in, but when I was there it last had a chest press, pulldown, cable leg press, cable machine(with pull up bar), and 2 cardio marchines of each of the following: Treadmills, stairmasters, elipticals.

Unfortunately RSF is pretty far from foothill. It's like 20 minutes away for the average walker. If you can catch a bus on time, it'll only take you 6 minutes, though do be warned that the right buses only come maybe once every 20 minutes. An alternative is the stadium fitness center, which is in the memorial stadium. It's only an 8 minute walk. Though it's much smaller and less equipped, though it still has free weights and is less packed anyway. It's also only open on weekdays though and their hours are much more restrictive than RSF. Honestly getting a good workout living in foothill is kind of problematic, but manageable.
Surprisingly wasnt noisy in the suite at all. I never used the laundry room though. I grew up down the street so went home to do laundry.
Bro at that point why'd you pay for the dorm then?
Lmao, I asked my parents if I could live at home and they said “fuck no”. Same with my homie in 8C42. He grew up in Berkeley.
Damn your parents must’ve really wanted the space."
FALL online ONLY instruction,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hvcrhe/fall_online_only_instruction/,2020-07-21 11:23:46,"Called it lol

Dear Colleagues,

As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, show that infections continue to increase.

The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.

Although we have repeatedly noted that all fall plans are subject to public health conditions, we understand that this news will be disappointing. Many of you have worked diligently to develop plans to provide in-person instructional activities for almost one thousand classes across the campus. Many faculty and students continue to look forward to resumption of some element of in-person instruction. We will continue to work hard on our plans, and to learn from the setbacks as well as the advances. 

Learning to switch between remote and in-person

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow.

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to providing guidance and support. 

If previously approved in-person instruction returns later in the semester, students will not be required to attend classes in-person—they can continue to attend classes remotely through the semester. 

To the degree that operational logistics and public health conditions permit, we will prioritize offering in-person instructional activities for Tier 1 and some Tier 2 courses, depending on instructor, classroom, space, and facility availability. Tier 1 is defined as instructional activities that, by their pedagogical nature (e.g., labs, studios, fieldwork), are significantly preferable to offer in-person or partially in-person. Tier 2 is defined as instructional activities that, if offered in-person, would substantially contribute to cohort-building for entering students, to academic engagement for students who are underrepresented on campus, and/or part of a capstone experience (e.g., freshman/sophomore seminars, first-year cohort-building courses for graduate students, capstone courses for seniors, etc.). 

The Office of the Registrar will continue to assign general assignment classrooms as needed for courses provisionally approved as Tier 1 and Tier 2 in the event that we can return to some hybrid or flexible instruction later in the semester. At this point, it is less likely that we will be able to offer Tier 3 in-person instructional activities, those in which the instructor strongly prefers to offer instruction in person—even later in the semester—so we are holding off on Tier 3 room assignments for the time being. 

Current fall planning

For now, as we plan for the start of the fall semester, faculty should implement their contingency plans for fully-remote instruction. Waiting for conditions to improve would not provide us with sufficient time to prepare for the start of instruction. If it is not possible to offer a particular course remotely and the course needs to be canceled for the fall semester, please work with your department scheduler to update the schedule of classes at your earliest opportunity. It is important that students have the most up-to-date information. For questions, please contact the Office of the Registrar scheduling@berkeley.edu.

Whether or not public health conditions allow us to return to some in-person instruction as planned, we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for our students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. Please also take a look at the following FAQs: 

For instructors (COCI)

For students (Registrar)

Participation/Attendance (CTL Resource) 

Looking forward 

We acknowledge the challenging times for our community with regard to childcare, dependent care, personal health, and other responsibilities through the fall. Our instruction planning and operations recovery management teams are working to develop plans to support instructors, GSIs, and staff who require classrooms or office space to prepare for and/or deliver instruction. We will send more detailed information about these plans in the near future.

We will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester.

As the public health situation continues to evolve, we will keep you updated as additional information regarding fall plans develop. We will provide regular updates leading up to and throughout the fall semester.

For your information, a message about fall plans that students will receive later today is appended below. 

We are immensely grateful for your incredible dedication to our campus community in the face of this pandemic and for your remaining flexible to our ever-changing environment. 

 

Sincerely,

Letter to be sent to students today

 

Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students -


As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, continue to increase.


The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.  

 

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow. 

 

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students, but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to continuing to communicate regularly with you regarding these matters.  

 

Regarding Thanksgiving, we will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester. 

 

Whether we are all remote, or mostly remote, you should know that we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. 

 

We realize that these changes may be frustrating and make it difficult for you to choose what you want to do for fall. This may also be confusing for incoming undergraduate students, including first generation college students (students from families in which neither parent has a four-year college degree). Please know that you belong here. You are an essential part of the UC Berkeley community and we will support you in having a rewarding college experience. We have numerous offices, groups and services at Berkeley and the Educational Opportunity Program is a great place to start. This incoming undergraduate class also marks our most ethnically diverse freshman admitted class in more than 30 years. We are committed to encouraging and supporting all underrepresented students through programs like The Office for Graduate Diversity and the Centers for Educational Justice & Community Engagement.

We’re hoping this email can provide more information to help you make your decision. In general, if you can reasonably live and learn where you are right now, staying there may be the preferred choice for you. However, you may decide to reside in the Berkeley area if you have on-campus housing, critical in-person classes (depending on public health conditions), in-person research or work, or other specific directive to come to campus; or accessibility, accommodation or other needs. Fortunately, the federal government has rescinded the rule that would have harmed our international students. They can now make the decisions that work best for them.

Help Us Support You

To help us better understand how to support you, we will asksurvey you about your plans for fall and your public health habits so that we can create a program to support COVID-19 prevention practices. Your feedback is important. Watch your email for more details. 

 

Instructional Support

For graduate student instructors, the Graduate Division has created FAQs about fall instruction. 

 

We will begin by providing remote access to academic services such as academic advising, tutoring and peer advising and will assess other options as public health conditions allow. We are exploring how technology can enhance our services, creating toolkits for staff, and following guidance to support equitable access including adhering to ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) best practices and ensuringstudents have the technology they need to succeed.  

 

The Campus Experience

 

The campus experience will begin remotely. There will not be opportunities to gather with groups of other students on campus at the start but we hope to switch to a more flexible approach should public health conditions allow. The State of California is currently drafting guidance for universities and colleges, we expect to share that soon. We will provide more information at sa.berkeley.edu/covid19/Fall2020. 

 

Students who do come to campus, including living in the residence halls and apartments, will be required to adhere to public health and safety requirements. 

 

Financial Aid and Scholarships

 

We are committed to offering financial aid to support students in covering the estimated total cost of attendance, including tuition, housing, books, food needs, and more, whether they are living on or near campus or outside of the Bay Area with their family. 

Students not living in on-campus housing are encouraged to update their “Cost of Attendance” information in CalCentral as soon as possible. Click on “Update Housing” and select “Living Off Campus.” Please review Financial Aid & Housing Updates for Fall 2020 for more detailed information. Should the standard allocation not match your actual living expenses, you may request a cost of living adjustment in mid-August.

On-Campus Housing

 

On-campus housing for students in the residential halls will be single occupancy only; you’ll get your own room. We will be able to accommodate all students who have received housing offers. Occupancy levels in apartments for undergraduate and graduate student and student family housing (University Village Albany) remain the same. All housing complexes will continue to have residential life, housing, custodial, maintenance, and other critical staff on site. Additional information is available at housing.berkeley.edu/fall2020covid. 

 

Off-Campus Housing

 

We remind students that off-campus housing (including private apartments and houses, fraternities, sororities, and the co-ops) is not owned or managed by the university. You are more likely to contract and/or spread the virus if you live in crowded, congregate living environments. We advise that if you are living off-campus in Berkeley you have your own bedroom and you not socialize in person with anyone outside your household (the people sharing your apartment). For group living environments with large numbers of residents, we encourage students to create smaller social bubbles like we will have in the residential halls. 

 

Preparing for Positive Cases

 

While we are working diligently to mitigate the spread, we will reserve space in the on-campus Foothill housing complex for students who have tested positive and are in isolation; are waiting for the results of their test; or have had close contact with a known positive and need quarantine under public health orders. We will make sure students have meal service and other resources they may need during the isolation/quarantine period. Students living in on-campus housing will be given priority but University Health Services will also oversee a small number of spaces at Foothill that will be available to house high risk students who live off campus, as appropriate. Students who are experiencing symptoms or think they have come in contact with a positive case should call the 24/7 Nurse Advice line at (510) 643-7197.

Final Thoughts

 

Our plans will, by necessity, evolve as we receive direction from public health officials. This is the case all over the country with cities, counties and states easing and then reintroducing restrictions. We are grateful for your patience and flexibility. These are challenging times but we continue to invest in a robust remote experience - both instruction and student engagement - to ensure students can have a full and meaningful university experience no matter where they are learning. The campus remains as resourceful, determined and resilient as our students. We will get through this together, and our shared journey through these difficult times will make us stronger. 

 

Stay well, Bears. 

 

Sincerely,

Please do not reply to this message","yo why do I have a course materials fee if I can't actually take labs for the course...
bamboozled
Does the school have any thoughts about people living off-campus and can't cut their leases? Seems super unfair for us to pay \~4000$ over the semester for rent if everything's fully remote and not making the announcement until midway through summer
What does this mean for athletics?
how the fuck are they going to justify charging people 25k a semester when none of the facilities are open on campus lol
\*will begin fully remote
Tldr? 

I can't read this.
It's possible that you will be mailed a lab kit, at least that is what 16A is doing this summer.
Berkeley released a city ordinance that allows any student to cancel their lease with 30 days' notice. This is a city policy so it would supersede anything written in the lease not allowing this. Landlords have already gotten in trouble for trying to stop tenants from doing this.
 I foresee the Big Game played in April

If you think that they can still hold anything in person after starting and ending the semester fully online, I want some of whatever you're smoking.
The title
Imagine going to a world-class university and not being able to read.
Classes in fall start online, might go back in person if things get better, if you have a housing offer you can keep it but you can cancel it, and a couple other things for students to know.
seriously doubt I'm going to be doing 143 stuff at home tbh
You are still on hook for the rent until a new person takes over the lease, so it’s not really that helpful.
The issue is that leases are signed way in advance - finding housing is such a shit show that most students (me included) sign leases in like March, because if we wait until June we’d literally be living a mile and a half out from campus.
At least we get to keep the Axe?
He's probably including rent, food, alcohol, textbooks, condoms, and event tickets. Either that or he's out of state / international
I know leases need to be signed way in advance in berkeley (I'm actually the house manager of a \~40 person house). But even if you signed in March, you can still give them 30 days notice today. It will be a little annoying with Spring leases \*if\* classes are in person, but even if you signed a long time ago, you can still give 30 day notice today.
oos rise up
I see, this changes everything. Let me look into it, thanks."
