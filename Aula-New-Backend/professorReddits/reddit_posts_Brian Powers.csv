took psych 160 w iris mauss and it was really chill; for tests they would release study guides for what exact topics were in scope. however you will need to read the textbook in addition to lecture. if you end up taking the class I have the e version of the textbook."

Sign the petition here: [https://www.change.org/p/an-open-letter-to-the-uc-berkeley-community-boycott-the-2022-berkeley-china-summit](https://www.change.org/p/an-open-letter-to-the-uc-berkeley-community-boycott-the-2022-berkeley-china-summit)

As UC Berkeley steps into a new semester of academic exploration and social justice activism, we are deeply disappointed to know that the University of California at Berkeley is going to provide a platform for Zhang Jianmin 张建敏, the Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco to speak at the 2022 Berkeley China Summit on October 1, 2022. We are highly concerned that Zhang's presence at this well-intended summit to bring about bilateral communication and cooperation between China and the US will contribute to the whitewashing of crimes against humanity committed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). We urge you to sign this petition to urge the UC Berkeley community to boycott the Summit and stand against CCP.

The CCP, leading the Chinese government, has been notorious for serious violations of human rights, crackdowns on freedom of expression, religion, and press, and making aggressive neocolonialist advances in other countries. To be specific, throughout the years, they have committed to:

**1. Egregious violations of human rights against Tibetans and Uyghurs**  
**2. Mass political persecution and imprisonment in Hong Kong**  
**3. Mass arrests and abuses against human rights lawyers and activists in China**  
**4. Neocolonialist aggression toward other countries disguised as the “Belt and Road Initiative”**

Details can be found at the end of the letter, under Appendix.

The above are a few of the many examples of how the Chinese government has been violating human rights, limiting free speech, and imposing neocolonialist foreign expansion. Zhang Jianmin, Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco, is the representative of the tyrannical regime in the United States. 

UC Berkeley, a place where all individuals strive to uphold a just community in which discrimination and hate are not tolerated, somehow has committed to providing a venue for atrocious human rights offenders a space to spread their conspiracy to people unaware of these jarring crimes of the CCP, to pollute the freedom and civil liberties on campus and in the US, and to promote the ideals of an unjust, discriminatory, and intolerant world. His participation has brutally humiliated students and communities marginalized and oppressed by the CCP, and will undermine Berkeley both as an institution that upholds the values of democracy, justice, and academic freedom and as a space that should defend people against injustice.

Hence, we urge you to sign this petition to join us in the fight to boycott activities that falsely present China as a free and harmonious country. The business opportunities in China lay their foundation on the blood and tears of people who are wrongfully persecuted, imprisoned, and tortured to death. UC Berkeley ought not to grant human rights violators the media spectacle they desperately wanted, and instead mislead students and scholars who are unaware. 

We call for the UC Berkeley community to join us in standing up against injustice. Our demands are as follows:

**1. We urge everyone to refuse to attend the 2022 Berkeley China Summit in protest against CCP’s human rights abuses.**  
**2. We urge UC Berkeley to refuse to provide a venue for CCP members to speak on campus.**  
**3. We urge the facilitators and participators of The Berkeley China Summit to correct your mistake and join us in keeping our students and our campus safe by signing on to this call for a campus-wide boycott.**

***Appendix: What Crimes have the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Committed?***

***1. Egregious Violation of Human Rights against Tibetans and Uyghurs***   
*On August 31, 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner released the “Assessment of human rights concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the People’s Republic of China” \[8\], pointing out that the CCP arbitrarily detained Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic groups in a discriminatory manner in the name of “anti-terrorism” and combating ""extremism"", which may have resulted in committing “crimes against humanity”. Since 2017, the CCP has been illegally arresting and detaining Uyghurs, cutting off their communication channels, imposing forced labor, and even torturing them with beatings, brainwashing, and rape. These acts aimed to erase their identity and autonomy and have seen no sign of stopping.* 

*The 2021 Freedom House report listed Tibet and Syria as the least-free countries in the world. Reported abuses of human rights include intensive surveillance, restricting freedoms of religion and languages, arbitrary arrest, maltreatment in custody, and tortures \[6\]. Since 2009, 159 Tibetans have committed self-immolation in protest of the CCP’s repressive ruling \[7\]. The CCP has refused to respond to the world’s calls on returning the Tibetans to their deserved freedom and has only been tightening its grip on the autonomous region.*

***2. Mass Political Persecution and Imprisonment in Hong Kong***  
*In June 2019, Hong Kong people rose in solidarity against the CCP and its puppet Hong Kong government’s plan to pass the draconian Extradition Bill (Amendment), which will open up a channel to send political activists in Hong Kong back to the Mainland for closed and unjust trails. The people of Hong Kong took to the streets, only to be brutally suppressed by the Hong Kong Police Force, including mass arrests, unreasonable use of force, and numerous suspicious cases of suicide by protesters \[1\]. The Hong Kong government further retaliated by arbitrarily passing the Hong Kong National Security Law in 2020, destroying Hong Kong’s democracy and autonomy, and leaving acts of police brutality against democratic protestors unanswered. Within the past three years, more than 10,000 have been arrested in connection to activism and protest participation \[2\]. At least half of those arrested are under the age of 25, with the youngest being only 12. Under the National Security Law, activists are being targeted on baseless pretexts, and jailed, while others have been driven into exile \[3\].*

***3. Mass Arrests and Abuses against Human Right Lawyers and Activists in China***   
*In 2015, the “709 Crackdown” saw the arrest of around 300 Chinese activists and human rights lawyers. Having probed prison deaths, labor rights cases, and the mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners, these lawyers have faced closed-door trials and some were allegedly tortured \[5\]. As of now, all of them are incarcerated with no political rights, disbarred, or placed under severe surveillance. Some of them have already died in prison without clear accountability.*   


***4. Neocolonialist Aggression towards Other Countries Disguised as the “Belt and Road Initiative”***  
*Since 2017, President and CCP’s General Secretary Xi Jinping has pushed forward a so-called “win-win” strategy, namely “The Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), in the hope of setting up neo-colonies in vast pieces of land in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. By taking the role of a creditor, the CCP coerces other countries into building the infrastructure they do not need, and through controlling the construction corporations, the ridiculously massive projects ultimately benefit state-owned Chinese enterprises in the end. High-profile BRI projects have severely damaged many underdeveloped countries’ fragile economic systems because of overpricing and corruption and pushed many to the verge of bankruptcy, such as Sri Lanka, Khazakstan, Ethiopia, and many more.*

*In recent days, the CCP has presented growing interest in militarily annexing Taiwan, a self-governing country with the highest level of freedom and democracy in Asia. In August 2022, the CCP fired numerous missiles into the economic zones of Taiwan and Japan, unbelievably violating international law. The CCP’s aggression toward Taiwan is only the tip of the iceberg of its massive imperialist ambitions to take control of the Asia-Pacific region, and even the world.*

Isn’t open, honest, transparent, bilateral communication the best way to address these concerns? Doesn’t stopping speech just stop any potential progress?
Sadly I don't really see this working, few of the people in Berkeley (being mainly Asian-American too) can empathize with the people being oppressed by the CCP. You cannot simply boycott a whole event where it represents a country while participants probably aren't all associated with the CCP. IMO getting people to learn about the CCP is the first step and u gotta communicate to gain mainlanders' support as well. Maybe educate on the worse atrocities the CCP committed in the past decades.

Fuck China the CCP and Xi Jinping
Let people speak smh, if you don't like it, don't go, but don't act like you know best for others
If you really want to do something, how about doing something to change Berkeley into a safer place and solve the homeless problem?
The CCP represents a threat to humanity. But a boycott is just burying your head in the sand. 

The CCP sure knows Sun Tzu: ""If you know your enemy and yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every
victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy
nor yourself, you will succumb in EVERY BATTLE.

Go see what those fuckers have to say.
China watchers dumb as bricks as always. Silence Falun Gong cultist. You think the school who’s literal professor is John Yoo has a leg to stand on re human rights that’s fucking bullshit

Thanks for letting me know I’m gonna go now
I think you have noble intentions, but if your desire is to bring attention to human rights abuses and aggressive foreign policy, at least be consistent i.e. you should read up on the less publicized activities of our own government. 

We literally destroyed a country and destabilized an entire region on the pretense that Iraq had WMD's.  Guantanamo continues to quietly imprison and torture folks without trial. We still have undocumented Mexican kids who were forcefully separated from their parents and imprisoned at border camps where they have been sexually assaulted without consequence. You don’t hear much about that in the news these days, yet you still see people talk about a Uyghur genocide that didn’t happen (not that I’m suggesting their internment camps are much better, but there’s a reason media hasn’t corrected itself with the same visibility in which it accused China of genocide). China is just following their own version of the western imperialist playbook to attain geopolitical dominance in the same way US has.
Tbh I think it may not be such a bad thing to provide clarity and just knowledge overall. There's that one stupid quote about knowing thine enemy or some shit it's basically that lmao
Signed.
You think there is genocide in Uygur ethnic group. What is your evidence?    
Do you know the one-child policy doesn't apply to them and only applies to ethnic Han? Do you know they can get into Universities with a much lower score? Do you know the Uygur population increased from 3.6 million to 12 million from 1953 to 2022? I do not want to depict a rose pic for CCP, I don't agree its stupid zero covid policy. However, CCP leads an extreme poverty-stricken society, society being bullied by Westerners and Japan for centuries, to prosperity through hard work. CCP won the support of its people as a matter of fact. You want to change the regime. However, it will be a disaster for the Chinese people and the world, and most Chinese are against it.

  
I believe most of you have never been to China. Most students are open-minded, and China, particularly ethnic Han, is historical an agrarian society. They love peace. They don't want to create chaos in other countries.
?
Whoa, were none of you here for Milo? 

I only want to point out that your #2 demand is likely a non-starter. UC Berkeley is a governmental entity, and is required as such to operate within the legal constraints of the Constitution. In this case, the University counts as a public forum and cannot discriminate among guests that are sponsored by student groups, nor among those eligible groups that request event space.

As Supreme Leader Christ mentioned last time, the best response to offensive speech is more speech. To that end, I applaud you for posting and highlighting a timely conversation!
That is true in most cases when both sides listen to each other, but it does not apply to cases when it comes to autocrats. The international community has repeatedly spoken out against the Uyghur genocide and the massive arrests of human rights activists in China and Hong Kong. And what has the response from the Chinese government been?  I believe activists want open, honest, transparent, bilateral communication too but an autocratic government wouldn't give a shit. The call for a boycott is a way to raise awareness among people who are otherwise not aware of what is going on.
This attempt, even if it doesn't succeed in getting the event cancelled, is exactly ""getting people to learn about the CCP"". Look at how much educational material is in the post.

Me talking about democracy in China and then you bringing up homelessness in Berkeley is a little bit like me asking you to change a lightbulb, and you complaining about the sink leaking. Ok fine I’ll add fixing leaky sink to my to-to list, but you still haven’t fixed the lightbulb.
You can’t.
I think actions speak louder than words, and I don’t need to give a platform to a CCP official to know where the party stands when it comes to human rights, basic freedoms, and democracy. 

I’m curious whether you would, hypothetically speaking, hear Putin out and see what he has to say about the Ukraine war? Never in a million years would Berkeley invite Putin to speak at a US-Russia summit hosted on campus. And that’s the argument you’re applying to the CCP.
THIS WAS THE QUOTE I WAS THINKING OF
thank you for raising awareness about John Yoo someone who has served in many branches of government. i agree he has a very problematic history emblematic of many of the major issues with the USA.

thank you also for exercising your **freedom of speech** in the USA for criticizing him. i am glad you and your family won't be getting a knock on the door from the US government. enjoy your rights while you are here.
I don't see what's wrong with raising these points in response to a CCP linked event speaking at a local summit. Nothing these people stated is inconsistent with the atrocities the US commits. This post was made by members of the Hong Kong Affairs Association so of course they focus on issues pertaining to issues specific on that part of the geopolitical space. I am fully aware and also critical of many of the issues and abuses by the US government, but if you were boycotting a US Immigration Policy summit, I wouldn't counter by saying ""but what about China"" so hopefully you can see why your comments are unhelpful here.
Whataboutism is not helpful here. I will happily point out US issues at a US summit. We’re talking about China here so stop changing the subject
This is so riddled with inaccuracies i don’t even know where to begin. Suffice to say: I found the tankie in this thread. 

Where’s the evidence for genocide you ask? [Here](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/08/1125932). The UN report details numerous human rights abuses. Let me remind you that genocide does not just include killing people of a specific racial or ethnic group. It also includes bodily or mental harm (re-education camps), imposing living conditions intended to cause harm (again, re-education camps), preventing birth (forced sterilization), and forcibly separating children. If you refuse to believe a UN published report then I have nothing more to say to you. 

You somehow brought in the topic of affirmative action in your argument about genocide. Not sure how to answer this complete non-sequitur other than to say it’s irrelevant. 

You somehow blame China’s poverty on Western powers and Japan while conveniently ignoring CCP’s disastrous Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward. Yes, the Western powers and Japan did cause widespread destruction and oppression, and yes, I am still waiting for accountability on their part, but let’s not discount how much CCP has shot themselves in the foot as well with their own stupid internal policies. 

To say that most Chinese are against regime change would be inaccurate. Don’t forget that Tiananmen Square happened a mere 30 years ago, and public sentiment against the regime continue to foment despite having no outlet. Just look at how much work it takes to maintain the Great Firewall. Chinese netizens routinely refer to June 4th as May 35th to circumvent censors. There is and always will be opposition to the current regime, and failure or unwillingness to acknowledge that would be a mistake.
If you won’t talk to anyone in the Chinese government, I guess you’re just trying to start a revolution in China? That’s a big ask, I think it’s better to focus on more realistic goals. Chinese officials aren’t immune from having their minds changed, it could be hard but it’s easier than overthrowing the Chinese government.
bruh, at least get your facts straight

Free speech is overrated as fuck
Whos john yoo if you dont mind me askin
>I wouldn't counter by saying ""but what about China"" so hopefully you can see why your comments are unhelpful here.

It wouldn't make sense to counter with that because we don't live on Chinese soil.  The point I'm making is that if bringing attention to human rights abuses and aggressive foreign policy is the *primary concern*, wouldn't it make more sense to apply these efforts domestically?  Even if this boycott is a 100% ""success"" and nobody shows up for the event - however unlikely that is - do you seriously think a tiny boycott across the sea would convince an authoritarian superpower to change their policy?  The officials who have the power to make those changes probably wouldn't even hear about it.  

On the other hand, bringing awareness to our own government's atrocities actually has potential for change as we have the privilege to mobilize citizens and vote for the desired change that can positively affect the people around us.  Last I checked, we have *plenty* of domestic issues to address that seem to have been forgotten or ignored - because riding the US propaganda train and pointing fingers at other countries feels good.

CCP officials who are invited to speak at the summit are not there to change their minds. They’re there to toe the party line and espouse party ideology. Ostracizing them, excluding them, and making it known to them that their words are unwelcome, would probably have a higher chance of changing their mind than letting them speak
Least out of touch redditor on r/berkeley
Same! I listened to Putin’s speech the other day declaring mobilization. You’re right, we need to know what a world-ending madman’s next moves are. 

But here’s the thing - they can give as many press conferences and televised speeches as they want, I don’t want them to speak at Berkeley and use Berkeley’s name to lend credibility to their words and ideology
Agreed absolutely
you're hilarious
Tldr: he was responsible for conjuring up legal gibberish out of thin air to justify war crimes, wiretapping, and torture during the War on Terror under the Bush administration. He’s now a professor at Berkeley
this awareness is initiated by the hong kong affairs association at berkeley , presumably with many (or majority) members from hong kong, and cosigned by many hong kong activists who, all of whom who are losing their rights to freedom of speech, promise of democracy, and losing the future of their hometowns to an authoritarian regime. they are lucky enough to find themselves at a university campus and in a country that allows them to speak up about their struggle. why do hong kong international students at berkeley have a moral obligation to prioritize US immigration policy?

if a group of russian students were protesting russian military aggression right now, i wouldn't tell them to first criticize US militarism (even though i highly oppose US militarism).

fyi, i actually am with you and am personally very critical of US imperialism, exploitative capitalism, conservative and neoliberal hypocrisy, etc. but your points on this thread, calling out hong kong students for mis-prioritizing issues, is strange.
Nice!
Seems like a not cool thing to do
I don't fault HK students for fighting for a democratic society in their home city.  But last I checked, this post is an attempt to mobilize *all* students and affiliates of berkeley.
So when people ask us for solidarity, we say no thanks because we have our own problems? They're literally asking people to sign a petition and not attend a conference, refusing to do so seems to be an even more active stance lol. I'm wondering which major human rights atrocities you're thinking of that have been solved entirely by the people being oppressed. This post is literally in the context of this specific event, and I'm sure there are numerous other posts on other issues in other contexts."
