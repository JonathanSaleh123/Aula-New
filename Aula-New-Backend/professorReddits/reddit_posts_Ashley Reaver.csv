NUSCTX 104 with Ashley Reaver,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18oyj0i/nusctx_104_with_ashley_reaver/,2023-12-22 21:23:15,"Hey guys,

I'm planning to take this class next semester. I'm thinking of taking this to boost my GPA (avg grade as per Berkeleytime is A-). Any thoughts on the difficulty, or the professor's teaching methods, or just about the class in general? Any input would be appreciated.

Please don't downvote",Are you taking this class?
Which class should I drop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13n3t02/which_class_should_i_drop/,2023-05-20 12:27:23,I have registered for NUSCTX 10 by Ashley Reaver and EPS N82 (Introductions to Ocean) by Michelle Jungbluth for Summer. Which one is an easy A?,"If you haven’t done so already, check berkeleytime for the grade distributions of these classes :T
Nutrition one should be easier
Take EPS 20 with Farghal
Already checked! But was looking for suggestions from students who have actually taken one of these.
I actually need to fulfill biological science requirement. Do you have recommendations for bio sci? Thanks!"
"Should I drop Spanish 115 (Spanish Poetry) (fluent Spanish speaker), History 133A (History of American Capitalism) or An Introduction to Human Nutrition (Nusctx 10) (waitlisted)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pez2au/should_i_drop_spanish_115_spanish_poetry_fluent/,2021-08-30 21:52:48,"Professor for History: Caitlin Rosenthal 
Professor for Spanish: Michael Iarocci 
Professors for Nutrition:  
■ Ashley Reaver -
■ Joseph Napoli 
■ Marc Hellerstein
■ William Evans

I am a freshman and need to drop one of those classes. I have all online classes (the only one that isn’t online is Spanish) and I am undeclared in the College of L&S. I am also taking a business and math class so would like help from anyone who knows the workload, professors, etc for these classes. 

Help is much appreciated and needed!!","Nutrition
I loved 133A so I'd recommend keeping it! Rosenthal is great"
Nutrsci 10 Summer,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fztuty/nutrsci_10_summer/,2020-04-12 02:38:46,Does anyone have experience with Ashley Reaver as a professor? I'm considering taking nutrisci 10 over the summer and I can't find any info on findmyprofessor. Would anyone also like to share their experience with this class as well? Summer session or not. Any advice or tips about this class will greatly be appreciated. Thank you!,"I took it for my Bio breadth as a non-STEM major and actually found it pretty interesting and easy. Didn’t take it over summer but I’d expect it will be similar. Overall I recommend if you’re just trying to get a breadth out of the way.
My friend took it last summer. It was an easy A
Ashley is my prof for NST104 right now. She is super chill and gentle(?)
hi!! just wondering how ur experience(workload, grading,etc) was taking nst104 with her :)"
