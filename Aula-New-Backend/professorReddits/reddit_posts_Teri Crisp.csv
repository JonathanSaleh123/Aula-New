Opinions about R1A professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13cg8jm/opinions_about_r1a_professor/,2023-05-08 22:12:40,Hey! Iâ€™m taking the R1A course in my first semester and I was wondering what do u guys think about Teri Elin Crisp? I did a lotta research about professors and I found some great ones like HSU but Teriâ€™s is probably the only one that fits my schedule. Thanks!,"Sheâ€™s good and very understanding but keep in mind that the workload is significantly more! As long as you devote time to it equal to other courses, I think youâ€™ll be fine but again donâ€™t procrastinate!
