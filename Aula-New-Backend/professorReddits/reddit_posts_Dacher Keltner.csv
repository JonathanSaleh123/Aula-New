"Pixar consulted with UC Berkeley psychology professor Dacher Keltner for the movie 'Inside Out' about getting into the mind of an 11-year-old through animation. The child, Riley Anderson, who now lives in San Francisco, has five emotions living inside her mind.",http://abc7news.com/entertainment/pixar-consulted-with-cal-professor-for-inside-out/800182/,2015-06-23 21:03:57,,"Wait samses is Riley real? 
Thank you for asking! Yes, Riley is based on a real person, Inside Out director Pete Docter's Elie Docter.

As a young child, Elie was very outgoing but became very quiet when she turned 11. Elie Docter is now 16.

Here is a summary from [the Disney Wikia](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Riley_Anderson):

> Riley is inspired by Pete Docter's daughter, Elie (the voice of Young Ellie in Up). As a child, she was outgoing and goofy. When she turned eleven, she became more introverted and quiet. 

And some trivia from [the Pixar Wikia](http://pixar.wikia.com/Riley_Andersen)

Now here's a more detailed description from [Variety](http://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/inside-out-pete-docter-animation-pixar-1201516389/):

> After taking putting a spin on the scary monster genre with “Monsters, Inc.,” and stretching the boundaries of who should be animated characters with “Up’s” curmudgeonly Carl Fredericksen, [Inside Out director Pete] Docter said he wanted to push the boundaries yet again, and that’s when **he was inspired by his young daughter, Elie, who was 9 when she did the voice of her namesake character Young Elie in “Up.”**

> “She was very much like that character. Spirited and goofy, but then she turned 11,” said Docter. “She became a lot more reclusive and quiet. We didn’t literally get eye-rolls, because she knew that would get her in trouble, but she gave off that kind of feeling. And that got me wondering, ‘What’s going on in her head?’ That’s when I thought of emotions as characters. This could be exactly what animation does best. And that’s what led us on this five-year journey.”

> Since she was the inspiration, how did Elie Docter like “Inside Out?” Mitchell asked.

> **“She’s 16 now and she saw the film a couple of months ago. She came out of the theater and went, ‘Humph, good movie, Dad.’ I took that as a compliment,” Docter said. “Since then, she’s seen it a couple more times and has admitted to crying and being moved by it, so that’s pretty cool.”**"
Human Happiness (LS C160V),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vi01rq/human_happiness_ls_c160v/,2022-06-22 01:14:43,"I’m taking human happiness (Psych C162 AKA LS C160V) this Summer but i kind of went off the description of the class instead of consulting other people to see what they thought. 

Has anyone taken the class and what were your takeaways?

I’m hoping that if I learn more about it it’ll help me understand resilience mechanisms and be happier.","i cant say im happier but it was a delightful course to take,,, full of AWE
It was the best class I've ever taken at Berkeley, the professor is such a legend, the class is so fun, obviously very applicable too. Just an all around joy.
Hi! I'm wondering how was your experience with this class because I'm considering taking it for the fall semester. How was the workload and exams?
You're not gonna be happier because you take a class that supposedly teaches you how to be happy.  Happiness only exists because pain and suffering does as well.  The true goal is to be content - and that can only be achieved through deep analysis of your insecurities, needs and wants, relationships, and how these variables form an equation for the mindset that necessitates contentment.  I'm sure the class will be cool, but temper your expectations on it changing your life.
what professor taught it?
Dacher Keltner. He was on sabbatical last year, i hope he's back now though"
