anthro 3ac with stefania pandolfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eweunq/anthro_3ac_with_stefania_pandolfo/,2020-01-30 15:46:04,how is this class so far? i just added it to my schedule and will be attending next week but want to know what to expect. her reviews are pretty bad on ratemyprofessor so was just wondering,"she has an accent, and in my opinion, is not very concise so its kinda tiring to listen to her. to be fair its probably because english isn't her first language. at least she's starting to put content on powerpoint which helps a LOT, so its less of a problem now.
I took this last semester, albeit with different professors.  Wouldn't worry too much about it, fairly easy class.
oh ok and is attendance in lecture required? i hope it is a class where i can just skip lectures and do some reading here and there and be able to pass easily. not looking to take it for a grade lol"
