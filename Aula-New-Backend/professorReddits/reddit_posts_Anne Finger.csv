"Cal instituted new rules for non-student access to Moffitt Library to limit overcrowding. Anne Finger, an Oakland resident who uses a wheelchair, on using Moffitt to reach Gardner Main Stacks. ""I said I have no choice, you can call security if you want. Using the library is really important to me.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/11/16/moffitt-library-entrance-policy-prompts-access-concerns/,2016-11-16 23:31:42,,"Has anyone tried going in with a Cal 1 card as an alumni? You just show the card to the people sitting at the desk, right?
Yeah if they let you leave through Moffitt I don't get why they wouldn't let you in through there.
What am I missing here?  There are like 10 different ways to access Doe/Stacks in a wheelchair besides the creepy dungeon hallway leading from Moffitt.  
I use a old Cal ID card I found at the willard park tennis courts. Theres always a student sittin at the desk and they only look at the card. No one ever asked why the picture on the card is a asian girl, not even at pappy's where i get student discounts. they should just let anybody into those libraries. My best bud harry and me stay in there overnight sometimes. One time a janitor was doing his rounds and he caught harry. I could hear them yelling at each other for about an hour until the police cam and took him away. The janitor spent the next two hours cursing and screaming in the library. He was mad as hell. glad he didn't find me, he was too busy cleaning the turd i left down the hall.
Yes.

Paragraph 3:


>Anne Finger, an Oakland resident and blue library card holder who uses a wheelchair, said she has relied on the lower Moffitt Library entrance for years to reach Gardner Main Stacks and that both entrances through Doe Library are on too steep of a slope for her to access.
So you are the homeless guys always sitting in the bathroom or sleeping between bookshelves?
No. I only go to the library about once every couple of weeks. Most the time I go to barrows to use the clean bathrooms and get good wifi. Hopefully they're gonna put a wifi spot at the people's park as long as they ban the pokemon go. I thought nobody plays that game anymore but every now and then some kid will get to close to my pal Harry. And Harry ain't allowed near kids anymore, so it freaks him out.
