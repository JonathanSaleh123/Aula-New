Jaylen Brown Finals MVP,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11vaide/jaylen_brown_finals_mvp/,2023-03-18 20:51:25,"Waddup, Golden Bears.

The young blood here may not know who this man is, but I did my freshman year with him at Cal. In 2015, Jaylen Brown came into the University of California at Berkeley touted as the second best basketball recruit in the world, projected by some to be the next great shooting guard in the NBA. At Cal, he did not disappoint. While he was very raw, on game days, Jaylen Brown was electrifying to watch night in and night out, and he elevated the team through his sheer athleticism. This man, a literal one-and-done recruit and draft pick (guys like this do not pick Cal), embodies the spirit of the Golden Bear. To finish the year, Brown wrote a 35 page paper the night before a critical basketball game for the history of our school, our final appearance in the NCAA March Madness tournament, [Hawaii vs Cal](https://youtu.be/afpW8QdNaRw?t=45) (thanks professor!).

Tonight was a historic night. Tonight was the first game in Jaylen's seven year career that he was featured as the first option of the Boston Celtics. Despite the loss, despite the fact that the team was shorthanded without three of their most important players (Marcus Smart, Al Horford, Robert Williams), tonight, without a doubt, is the best the Celtics have looked on offense since they've been contenders for an NBA title.

I'm calling it right now. If the Boston Celtics have learned anything from this game, they will feature Jaylen more often as they have tonight. If this happens, Jaylen and the team's ceiling is without limit. This year, Brown has transcended the limitations put on him by his offense to produce as one of the top players in the NBA. As an extremely consistent scorer (like all of you guys <3), if he is feature in the playoffs like he was tonight, the Boston Celtics are not only winning a championship, but Jaylen Brown is also winning a Finals MVP.

Go Bears.","Just don't ask him about vaccines. Or Kanye.
Giannis coming outta the East this year fs
FTC
The 2023 MVP from philly has something to say about who's winning the east.
Yeah lost a lot of respect for him over that. He’s a smart guy very evidently, I expected more
Completely agree. He mingled with people with Kyrie which destroyed the “Cal athlete/intellectual” image for me.
Only cause the Celtics and Tatum still freeze out Jaylen! Blows my mind!
Ah, yes, the Federal Trade Commission. :)
The east is irrelevant as long as the chubby kid from Serbia is in the west.

yea tbh last year’s finals jb was playing better than jt who lowkey crumbled under pressure
same kid who hasn't made conference finals last 2 years despite being the league MVP?
Lmao is that you Jaylen’s little bitch?
Jaylen's playoff efficiency inside 15 feet is elite. They make him create those shots. Imagine if they set him up for it, would be beautiful basketball.
Championship mindset I don’t remember the Ls
Hey buddy 😀😀😀
Didn't think Jokic had enough help, I was wrong. Most boring finals in a minute tho.
Lmao most watched playoffs of the last 5 years but stay mad and stay wrong.
Heavily outmatched, how was it any fun. Views don't always mean entertaining.
Because the Nugs kicked everyone’s ass. Hey, at least your MVP and the 6ers looked really good this playoffs. Glad you got to enjoy that."
Cal won a men's basketball game! LET'S GO BEARS!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17pm868/cal_won_a_mens_basketball_game_lets_go_bears/,2023-11-06 20:22:20,"&#x200B;

They were missing 2 starters and one is their best player, a transfer from Texas Tech.  His name is Jaylen Tyson. Look up why he transferred his former coach racially abused him and his players
Looks like Cal upset Duke with the way they were celebrating postgame

Don’t worry bronny mad rn he gon clap us this season 💀💀
The other team were hitting shots that they had no business making. The good news is that (albeit against lesser competition) this team looks much better than last years. Players are in the right spot and offensively the ball is moving with purpose.
That tends to happen in Basketball. Basketball is a bit more balanced and unpredictable than, say, football.
Nobody ever heard of Davidson University before Steph Curry went there.
St Thomas isn’t a bad basketball school - they have an outside shot of going to the tourney this year
Supposedly we’re going to hear about our appeal of the waiver rejection on Thursday. Tyson was listed as a top 10 preseason small forward - if he gets cleared this team could be a bubble team
We’re already at 1/3 of last seasons win total
Isiah Collier looks really legit
They been to the NCAA tournament in the years 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1986, 1998, and 2002 before Steph Curry arrived. But I get what you mean.
He is a hooper. Hoping he can get in on Monday
Practically every team in the NCAA other than newcomers and absolute perpetual losers has been to the NCAA tournament,all you have to do is win your conference tournament.  But I don’t think Davidson is in the top 100 most well known programs.  Even West Coast conference teams kinda look down on them and the West Coast ain’t no ACC.
He got his waiver - he’s playing on Friday!"
