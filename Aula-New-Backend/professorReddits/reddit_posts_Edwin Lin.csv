SOCIOL 167 with Edwin K Lin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1buxipp/sociol_167_with_edwin_k_lin/,2024-04-03 09:48:20,Has anyone taken this course? Seems pretty interesting. Would love some input on grading/workload/exams from any previous or current students.,"sociology major or not, everyone should take a course with lin. awesome professor, really easy to understand his lectures and extremely approachable as well
Great course, really loved it! You get to do lots of creative assignments too and he‚Äôs a good lecturer
he changed the course of my academic interests! this was my favorite class at cal by far, highly recommend!!
I'm not a sociology major and the prerequisites say that I should have taken either 1, 3, or 3ac or get instructor consent. I haven't taken any of those or reached out to the prof before but I would like to take it for media studies. Can I still enroll?
Awesome - the course seems really interesting! How was the grading and workload?
super easy workload, felt more like a 3 unit class than a 4 unit class (though may be biased since i enjoyed all the readings). the grading is very lenient, there are two quizzes that are really straightforward and the essays aren't bad at all! people in the class are really helpful also!
this is super helpful; thank you!"

Questions about Sociol C167 with Edwin Lin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6pb6qw/questions_about_sociol_c167_with_edwin_lin/,2017-07-24 13:34:51,"I'm registered for Sociol C167 and I was wondering how rigorous is the course. I'm taking a total of 15 units including this class, but based on the syllabi I found online (fall 2015 and spring 2016) it seems doable. What do you think? What advice do you have about succeeding in the class? Do you know of any resources that I can access now so I can get a head start with the readings and possibly papers? Does anyone have the Fall 2016 syllabus? 

Thanks","I took this class. I think I did four readings. I went to class about half the time. Passed with an A. It depends I guess if you're a sociology major, but most students find this class to be somewhat interesting, but mostly easy. The only thing he is strict about is deadlines. Do your papers, turn them in on time, and make a decent effort. You'll do fine. 
I honestly have no idea, I most likely did MLA everything, but I would ask Lin. 
I didn't take it with Lin, but the class was pretty easy and relatively low effort. Really interesting topics though
I took Soc C167 with Lin and it was a VERY easy class. There's one two page paper, a short answer take-home midterm, a ten-page project, and an eight-page take-home final. These four writing assignments are your entire grade in the class. I went to half the lectures and only read the readings that were relevant to the questions asked on the exams and writing assignments and I got an A. I even BS-ed the ethnography project and still got a 100% on it. This is all in light of the fact that I am a poor writer. If you choose to take this class, there is no need to be worried about grades whatsoever. Also, form a google doc for the exams (which he lets you do) and use the quizlet for finding concise explanations of the theory. As long as you put in a little effort for each assignment, you can easily get an A.
Awesome. Thanks for the response. Do you still have the reading material, notes, or any other useful information for this class? 
I might. I don't have notes for sure but I may have some of the power points and some readings. I'll take a look, can you pm me your edu email? 
did you do the virtual communities paper with MLA format heading and ASA citations?

Social 5 Final,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zaun2l/social_5_final/,2022-12-02 11:11:30,"Does anyone know what Sociology 5's final looks like? It has a time conflict with another class so I'm not sure what Edwin Lin's policy with changing times/final procedure looks like.


UPDATE 2023 SPRING: IT WILL BE A TAKEHOME FINAL",
Getting Ahead During Break,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/egqbt7/getting_ahead_during_break/,2019-12-28 04:40:49,"I didn‚Äôt do too great this semester so I wanted to get a head start during the break, could anyone give me any insight on the work load for the following classes? Or maybe point me to a resource that can?

French 1 w/ Daniel Hoffman
Sociol 1 w/ Robert Braun (?) 
Sociol 127 w/ Edwin Lin
Sociol 169C w/ Edwin Lin
Spanish 135 w/ Nasser Meerkhan

I‚Äôm obviously not planning on taking them all but I wanted to gauge the work load to decide. Thank you!","Preface: I've never taken any of those classes, so take this comment with a grain of salt. 

In my opinion, the best thing that you can do to get ahead is to take the break to relax and destress. Play some video games, read a book, try a psychadelic or two....whatever suits you. 

Trying to ""get ahead"" over the break will just leave you burnt out when the semester starts.
I took 135 with Meerkhan.
Stay on top of the readings with him...don‚Äôt slack...review your Spanish grammar over break (especially formal essay writing vocab and grammar) since that affects your grade more than you think...generally it‚Äôs a chill class though compared to some other classes I‚Äôve taken
Hey! Recently graduated from Berkeley (Fall 2019). For context, I took SOCIOL 169C (Cross Cultural Communications) for Fall 2019 (A) for three units so I can attest to the character of Professor Lin and the workload of the specific class for a three-unit student. There are a little more assignments for that class if you are taking it for 4 units.

In regards to the workload of 169C, there really isn't much that you're graded on. In fact, I don't think I've batted an eye at the readings until the final paper came around (I only used three sources for that paper and just skimmed them). At the beginning weeks of class, you will do your proposal for a cultural sub group project. The class, in my opinion, is centered around the project for you have two assignments based on that project: a headstart for your final paper aptly named ""Deep Description of Cultural Sub Group"" (4-5 pages, double spaced)and the final paper for the project. (8-10 pages, double spaced).

There is also a cultural self-analysis paper (4-5 pages, double spaced) in the early stages of the class. As long as you start on the papers a week to a week and a half before they're due, you'll be solid. 

Everything else such as participation, a group presentation, and a presentation within a small group during the latter weeks of class is pretty easy to get. Just be sure to engage with your peers and professor and you'll be fine on that front.

Professor Lin is pretty chill. Very talkative but tries his best to get the class engaged with others and with him.

**TL:DR 169C is a pretty easy class provided that you get a headstart on the papers and be engaged with your peers and professors. Lin is a nice guy, you'll find him cool.** 

PS: I suggest you don't get ahead during break because burning out before the beginning of the semester is pretty bad. Don't know about the other classes and the other one that you may potentially take with Lin (SOCIOL 127) but I wish you the best of luck.  


Feel free to PM with questions! Go Bears!
I‚Äôll be sure to review my grammar for sure, thanks for the advice!
Thank you for such a detailed comment !! I really appreciate it :) you‚Äôre though I shouldn‚Äôt get ahead"
Sociology courses recommended?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/175lheu/sociology_courses_recommended/,2023-10-11 11:41:29,Any sociology upper courses required no final exam or only take home exam or essay?,"The virtual environment one taught by Edwin Lin
i would expect most upper div soc classes to have take home exams as the final, and the one time i had a multiple choice exam it was pretty straightforward. take what you think you‚Äôll find interesting!"
Is this schedule manageable? I will be a sophomore intending CogSci and Media Studies and will be my first time taking upper divs,https://i.redd.it/4xhy4un4khwa1.jpg,2023-04-27 08:21:38,,"Definitely manageable! You might just feel tired though on Tuesdays having an 8am and the last class being at 5pm (that's just me though). 

I will say, SOCIOL 167 is by far my fav class I've taken at Cal with Professor Edwin Lin! An incredible professor and I'm sure you'll enjoy his class, if you decide to attend the lectures LOL
Edwin Lin is a good and easy prof üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Second all the comments about Edwin Lin! He‚Äôs amazing"
