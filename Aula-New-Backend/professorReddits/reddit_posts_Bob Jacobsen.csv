at least I got a reply lol,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jfqphi/at_least_i_got_a_reply_lol/,2020-10-21 18:59:53," Sent a short email about to academic senate (sent it directly to Janet and CC to the list of deans) earlier today and got a reply from Bob Jacobsen Dean ofÂ  division of undergraduate studies:

what was the threat in the last line lol
I bet the solution is letter grades and emails about resources
I don't know how to feel about this. You certainly used some strong language that could be viewed as a threat, and I didn't really like it either. But I don't like his response either. He's acknowledging that we should be using 'tactics' to achieve the policy that would help most of the students. How about we stop treating this like a game, and simply resort to human decency and empathy during these troubling times. I shouldn't have to be using tactics to get the administration to help a major percentage of its students from \*\*major\*\* stress that is out of their control, and is not normal.

Bob Jacobsen also browses this sub quite a lot, and is more than aware of all our concerns. I think he doesn't realize, or doesn't fully understand why we want this, based on his comments around here. I'm not L&S, but I think him, and most of the administration, should consider meeting the students halfway, and consider a limited P/NP policy for major requirements.
you're a clown for including a threat. stop coming up with all these bullshit reasons for P/NP and acting surprised when you're called out for it.
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Yooo this is all I said: More students each day are reaching out to all you for this change, so we will not stop until the Academic Senate acknowledges our plea.Â 


But I opened with saying ""hey I'm a transfer, double majoring and just asking for an optional P/NP for Fall 2020"". Maybe my language came out pretty protest-y but when I wrote this email today at 10 am, I was kinda railed up from reading a bunch of posts of people wanting PNP
Yeah, I think 1-2 major requirements with P/NP would really help
I understand some of the reason people want P/NP. Iâ€™m not sure I understand all of them, hence the question in my email reply to the OP. 

But the reasons _for_ P/NP are not the only consideration.  Letter grades are used for a lot of purposes on and off campus. We learned last Spring that mixed P/NP and letter grades had problems too.  I know most of r/Berkeley doesnâ€™t agree those problems are really problems; even asking about it has gotten me lots of downvotes. But itâ€™s still a concern for the people working on this. 

It would also not be great if some parts of campus provided P/NP while others didnâ€™t.  Weâ€™re already having trouble with L&S having a later drop/option deadline than other colleges. 

Finding a solution is a matter of developing a consensus across about 40 decision makers on multiple committees. Thatâ€™s a communications / education / negotiation task. Itâ€™s moving along, slower than some would like, but itâ€™s moving. The info the ASUC is gathering has been important, the emails people are sending help, Iâ€™ve even copied in some comments from r/Berkeley and other social media. 

At the present point, (rhetorical) pounding of the table probably doesnâ€™t help. Academics are trained to think about the correctness of a proposition, and to pay little or no attention to its popularity. Sending the same information in the same form repeatedly until you get what you want is just going to get your particular points deemphasized. New points, new situations (like the one I asked about above, to which Iâ€™d really like answer), more info on how many are affected do help in very important ways.
what bullshit reasons for P/NP?
But legit how is that a threat? All I said that more students are becoming aware of this situation and that it won't stop. In no way did I ever threatened with violence or other forms of attack.
""not stop [reaching out]"" is a ""threat""???
Professor, if nothing else, will you be able to give us a general timeline of when we might receive an email at least acknowledging our concerns and whether or not the Academic Senate will or will not move to P/NP of some form? 

Thank you
Hi Dean, I would like to thank you for making a careful decision about this. Too many people on this subreddit are too shortsighted and downvote any opposition to p/np (just take a look at my karma, I made this account a few days ago just to voice my opinion). No matter what decision is made, I'm glad great consideration is being made about this issue.

It's cringe as fuck when they you consider that they already know about it.
Did you email me and not get a response? If so, I apologize. I thought Iâ€™d replied to everybody who contacted me directly, but ifs been quite a pile and I may have messed up one. Write again please. (But I havenâ€™t been on email since 9pm yesterday) 

I donâ€™t know when decisions will come, unfortunately. You might see some small things roll out first instead of a single Grand Decision.
Hereâ€™s UCLAâ€™s policy:

https://cac.ucla.edu/academic-policies/grading-repeats/

It some ways itâ€™s more rigorous than ours. 

I get that people are stressed. Everybody understands that.  We knew that was coming and people have been working on trying to help (including P/NP) since last year. 

Iâ€™m not telling you that you canâ€™t pound the table about that. Iâ€™m telling you that pounding the table is ineffective. (One of the people whoâ€™s a decision maker on this buried a partner of many years due to COVID; calling people like that â€˜privilegedâ€™ isnâ€™t likely to help either) 

Whatâ€™s holding this decision back are the points on the other side. Thatâ€™s also the cause of the delay: this decision looks easy for you, but there really are counter-arguments that make it quite hard. Iâ€™ve written about those previously. 

People writing all those emails make them more effective if they discuss why UCLA didnâ€™t do this and addressing those reasons than they will be if they just point to USC, Stanford and UCI. 

Donâ€™t like this? Want to downvote it to oblivion? Seems a bit self-defeating to me. Not all things in life can be downvoted away. Berkeley is an educational institution thatâ€™s supposed to help you learn how to be effective in life, so Iâ€™ll probably keep writing these comments anyway. Maybe somebodyâ€™s listening.
No worries! I hadnâ€™t emailed, I was just curious. Thank you for your response! 

Also, let me add that despite the disrespect/downvotes you might face, Iâ€™d like to add that despite how a lot of the student body seems to disagree with you, we definitely respect your decision and I think we all recognize that you are just simply doing your job and what you believe to be best."
