Berkeley professor Ian Agol wins the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in mathematics,https://breakthroughprize.org/News/29,2015-11-09 00:39:53,,"[deleted]
""Ian Agol, University of California at Berkeley and Institute for Advanced Study: for spectacular contributions to low dimensional topology and geometric group theory, including work on the solutions of the tameness, virtual Haken and virtual fibering conjectures.""  

I wish I had some idea of what any of that is.
I mean congrats, but Agol is still the worst prof I've ever had at Berkeley (math 53).  He literally read the textbook in class.
I took 113 with him.  I liked him.
Oh shit, I took particle physics and a seminar with him! Go Kam-Biu!
He was definitely not a great lecturer 

I think part of it was that 53 wasn't too related to what he's an expert on, and another big part was that he'd rather be doing his research than wasting his time on undergrads who aren't even math majors 
He just shouldn't have been teaching a lower division math class. He's way too advanced for that.
You're saying a math prof at Berkeley was a crummy teacher? I'm shocked. Daily Cal should investigate.
Describes most of the professors who teach lower div math IMO. "
"Six professors were elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), one of the nation's most prestigious scientific societies: Steven Evans (math/statistics), Susan Marqusee (MCB), Ian Agol (math), Robert Glaeser (MCB), Krishna Niyogi (plant and microbial biology), and Peidong Yang (chemistry).",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/05/05/uc-berkeley-faculty-members-elected-national-academy-sciences/,2016-05-07 23:11:22,,Ayy my nigga Agol back at it :\^)
