Stephen Colbert interviews east bay area Congresswoman Barbara Lee,"http://www.hulu.com/watch/709753#i1,p0,d1",2014-11-06 12:19:14,,"The fact that we have the only Congressman/woman in either house that voted against the authorization for the use of force is pretty cool.

I'd be willing to bet there are quite a few people in congress who would change their vote if they had the opportunity to go back.
This was a strange interview, even by Colbert standards. 
I normally like Colbert, but those were some cringe-worthy comments/questions.
Spittin game though...  I couldn't do one of these if I was in congress he's too crazy haha.
His show's about to end, he's got to get all the character fuckery out of his system before then.
The urban question.. I can't believe he went there. Kind of great that he did though, put his character into sharper relief pre-departure and Barbara's responses were awesome.
I think we notice them when they hit literally closer to home. 
It's great publicity. I bet most people couldn't name their congressperson, but lots of people watch Colbert.
If you can't believe Colbert went somewhere, you haven't watched enough Colbert.

he is implying urban is a euphemism for black people

lol, wat? ""Urban"" is a euphemism for black. The question wasn't shocking at all, only mildly funny."
