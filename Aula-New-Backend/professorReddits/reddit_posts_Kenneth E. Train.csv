 why would u post that
Oh shit
What is the difference between giving ChatGPT a prompt and having it spit out code, which presumably the student then has to modify slightly to fit his particular use case, and searching for a StackOverflow answer which accomplishes the same task, finding one, and then modifying it slightly to fit?
bruh read your notifications
no shit it‚Äôs not allowed‚Ä¶but anyways‚Ä¶
L student. Just do it and don‚Äôt advertize on Ed
Imagine not using ChatGPT to write the post for you
After finishing 189 that poster will realize there is no way they can detect that‚Ä¶ why bother if it‚Äôs not detectable. 
AI is changing everyone‚Äôs life. The most important lesson I learned in CS is Google-Oriented-Programming. why wasting time on cheesy issue??

If  uc berkeley could  make AI ta like GPT, it will be great.
Plagiarism Will get you kicked out of school if you‚Äôre caught.  
Let me give you a ‚Äúwhy this matters‚Äù from industry.  You‚Äôre working for a startup and they‚Äôre pushing you to put in 12 hour days crunching out code as fast as you can, and you find an open source snippet that does what you need so you copy/paste it, then your company gets sold, and the people doing the due diligence find open source code integrated inside your code base. Now the code is no longer yours; the GPL says you‚Äôre obligated to open source it.  If you kept the code in an external library and cited it, you‚Äôd have been ok. But there have been cases of people getting into a LOT of trouble over stuff like this, or taking code from company to another, which can get the police involved. Keep your nose clean. It‚Äôs better to graduate with B‚Äôs or C‚Äôs then get expelled.
For that matter‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs better to graduate with C‚Äôs based on your work than A‚Äôs based on somebody else‚Äôs.  You‚Äôre going to spend your career writing code, and you want to be good at it.

Bro turned himself in üò≠
You're also not supposed to use Stack overflow in class assignments.
no real difference, both have worse learning outcomes for you than figuring it out yourself imo
Yo would it make me fail and go to student council or something. Do they have way to check
Mind boggling why someone would cast a shadow of doubt upon themselves over something like this given that we were explicitly allowed to use external libraries to do exactly what they asked about
Copy/pasting open-source code almost never creates any issues. When the author open-sources it, they‚Äôre basically giving anyone using that a free run to do whatever they want with it. Almost all software engineers use some open source code/library. From the biggest companies to the smallest startup‚Äôs, it‚Äôs extremely common and rarely causes any issues.
why bother asking on edstem, tho, when the answer is just out there waiting for you, as they say, a little *attention is all you need*
He did:

>	Yes, there is. Please do not use algorithmically generated code in your assignment. It's considered cheating, just the same as if another person wrote your code.

And to quote the response of famous TA Anton:

>	bruh
Yeah do people really not know that anonymous on ed means anonymous to other students, not your instructor?
In my experience most classes are 100% fine with you using Stack Overflow in assignments as long as you *cite your source*. Just copying code from the internet without citation is straightforwardly plagiarism. That said, check your class policy on this, don't accidentally cheat because someone on Reddit said it was usually allowed.
Huh. Today I learned. I never took any CS classes at Cal but I took a few courses in R that always allowed us to use StackOverflow because that is ‚Äúhow people code IRL.‚Äù Is there an advantage to learning CS this way? Or is it just to make the class more difficult because ‚ú®grade deflation‚ú®
I feel like the StackOverflow answer is better for the student because they have to understand what they should be searching for and what to modify. Also, how else are they expected to figure it out ""themselves""? Documentation for methods online are not always straightforward and StackOverflow is an excellent resource.
Speaking from experience, their ways of checking aren‚Äôt too accurate. So long as you make some changes to whatever you copied and pasted it‚Äôs highly highly unlikely you‚Äôll get caught
Incorrect. Read the GPL. Being a software engineer does not make you a lawyer.
The pure irony of banning AI in a class about ML.
The point is to learn CS not to ‚Äúget the answer‚Äù like you would irl. Of course copying from stack overflow isn‚Äôt the same as thinking through the algorithms yourself
You can use StackOverflow, but for little segments unrelated to the task the assignment is trying to get you to learn. Like say a project asks you to fetch a file using C before getting started on the actual function and you don't know how to do that. You'd be allowed to use StackOverflow for that as long as you provide a source
Agreed that StackOverflow requires a lot of reasoning upfront to write a good question--and then you have to hope it was asked well enough that someone will be able to help.

On the other hand, my experience with ChatGPT and writing code (I'm not a student; I write code at work to do data analysis, but am not strictly a programmer) is that you can continually modify your prompt and instantly get iterated responses that get closer and closer to what you need. So you learn how to write prompts as you go with no consequences (ie, you aren't really losing time, you're just teaching yourself how to ask better questions). 

It still requires a reasonable understanding to use either, but if you're at Cal, you have above average reasoning skills and an analytic mindset already. 

So if you're not able to ask ChatGPT a decent question (or iterate on the responses), you probably need more assistance anyway and should be using resources like the GSIs or study groups as opposed to a coding calculator.

I think the real ""danger"" of ChatGPT FOR CODING SPECIFICALLY is whether it (and services like it) will be freely available to everyone, or whether they will be subscription-gated.
Wouldn't the student still have to give ChatGPT the appropriate prompt? Google can't read one's mind but neither can ChatGPT...
Yes, I guess personally I‚Äôve rarely have been able to just straight up copy/paste from StackOverflow and have it just ‚Äúwork.‚Äù I do think it requires a level of critical thinking to be able to look for the resources you need to solve a problem. Sure, there are people that don‚Äôt understand this and I‚Äôm sure have some copy/paste wins here and there. But I feel like I‚Äôve learned a lot through SO and seeing other‚Äôs examples, and I wonder if limiting access to the resource actually does make someone a better critical thinker when tackling these problems, or if it even has an significant effect on learning outcomes at all. IDK, not my field, clearly, but it‚Äôs interesting to think about.
Ok, that makes way more sense. Thank you!
Completely agree with you. Limiting access to any resource seems like an artificial workaround to the core problem which is assessing student learning/understanding. As new technology emerges, projects and assessments should adapt(or even straight up change) to reflect that. Rather than contemplating how to limit access to a certain technology, instructors should contemplate how they can integrate that into their teaching and assessment methodology. This is what I find so frustrating about the notion of ‚Äúplagiarism‚Äù and specifically instructors who will go out of their way, and invest time/resources in catching it. Like maybe if they redirected that energy to actually integrating the tech into their curriculum, everyone would be better off."
EMT Training Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ylj6rn/emt_training_questions/,2022-11-03 17:01:07,"
I am a current student on the premed route looking to do EMT training either during Spring 2023 or at cc during Summer 2023. After going through this forum and searching online a bit, I found the most common options for EMT training to be nearby community colleges (e.g., Skyline, Contra Costa, Merrit), or private options such as Bear EMT. I would love some input from anyone who has gone through the process of EMT certification on a few questions about training adjacent to my classes.

**For Community College**: 
- Which cc did you use/where would you recommend doing it? 
- Did you take it as a hybrid class? How did you commute for training?

**For Bear EMT/Private Services**: 
- Which private EMT class did you take? 
- Did you commute to Santa Cruz on a weekly basis for *Defib This*?

**General**:
 - How much did it cost?
 - How doable was it to balance alongside other classwork (Context: I will likely be taking 13 units during Spring 2023 and 4-5 units during Summer 2023)
 - How much of a time commitment was it?","I took the Defib This EMT class this summer and it cost about $2000. It was 10 weeks and I drove down to Santa Cruz once a week and then had online class twice a week. I thought that the class was very good and prepared me for the national test. I also took 2 classes alongside it (cs 61a and an r1b) which I don‚Äôt really recommend, but it depends on how comfortable you are with the classes you‚Äôre taking. For defib this, I probably spent around 6-8 hours outside of class doing work per week. Feel free to dm if you have any other questions"

The Emergency Brake Effect Of Social Media,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wvwsnv/the_emergency_brake_effect_of_social_media/,2022-08-23 11:53:01,"Hi everyone, I'm a senior here and have been writing articles about my experience working at SWE companies (Google, Amazon) as well as my experiences as a student. Here's my latest article, copied from my website, about some advice towards school starting this semester:

\----

Productivity, healthy habits, and living well are like a heavy freight train: Very, very slow to start moving but once in motion it can obliterate everything in its path‚Äìflying with immense momentum up mountains, careening through valleys, and smashing through blockages. In a similar way, pulling out your phone to check social media acts like a very strong emergency brake. Stopping your studies, your workout, or even a conversation by opening up your phone to scroll mindlessly will bring your freight train full of momentum to a complete stop.

## E-Break

Imagine the following: It‚Äôs the first month of school. You sit down to get started by answering some welcome-to-class emails, read through a syllabus or two, and begin to get [into the flow](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/flow-state). As this process continues, you get a notification. Someone has liked your post on social media. Worse, a friend of yours has just tagged you in a post‚Äìhow could you ignore that?

Screeching noises, sharp deceleration. This massive train of force is brought to a halt as you look at a video that you won‚Äôt remember in two days. You react with a laugh emoji, scroll for a few minutes, and look back at your laptop.

There are a few tabs open; a syllabus here, a welcome email there. Midterm dates and assignment notifications. The thoughts ‚ÄúWhere am I? What was I doing?‚Äù flash through your mind.

And a lot of effort is expended. If you are particularly industrious and hardworking, you get the freight train started again. Slowly and slowly, the train picks up speed and you enter the flow state yet again. Taking notes, putting events into your calendar, downloading documents. A top achiever!

#### *Ding*

But yet, another notification. Screeeeeeech!! The train slams to a halt as you open up snapchat, this time a message from someone you fancy. It‚Äôs a picture of a bowl of cereal. Great! You reply with one back of the work you were doing, and go through snap stories for a few minutes.

You break free, get the train started but are getting fatigued. It‚Äôs a lot harder to start and stop work than it is to continue steadily. As a result, the notes you were taking look a lot harder to get back into than earlier. Strong as you are, the train isn‚Äôt accelerating as quickly as earlier. Struggling to pick up speed, you make your way through an assignment when another notification comes from a different social media platform. The train shrieks and comes to a complete stop, this time over a few text messages and a YouTube video ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. Dang, 22 minutes of YouTube. At this point, getting started again is too difficult so it‚Äôs time for a breezy 35 minutes of TikTok to finish out the hour, along with all of the terrible feelings we all feel after burning all that time.

## Social Media Is An Emergency Break

If you are being particularly productive, try it. I had this experience earlier as I came back from a run and found Safari on my phone. I typically do not have it installed, and only enable it in situations where it is absolutely necessary. Shoot! The night before I went out for dinner and the menu was only available on QR code. That‚Äôs an instance that requires a mobile phone with Safari (although, I could ask for a print menu next time), so I re-activated Safari. Seems like I forgot to delete it. Hm. Maybe there‚Äôs something good on here, I don‚Äôt use it much‚Ä¶

I opened it up to the Reddit homepage, curious.

Almost 35 minutes passed by, completely killing my drive and motivation. I deleted Safari, took note of what happened and what went wrong, and got the freight train restarted. It took a lot of effort and it really did impact my productivity for an hour or so. Reasonably, because if you use social media for 25 minutes, it eats up 42% of an hour, reducing an hour‚Äôs worth of work to 58% of what could‚Äôve been. 35 minutes eats up 58% of an hour, leaving all other work at 42% effectiveness. If you always feel like you‚Äôre running out of time during the semester, this may be a cause.

## Taking Good Breaks

[Taking breaks is important](https://college.harvard.edu/life-harvard/student-stories/importance-taking-break). Burnout, fatigue, and the like exist and are common.

Taking a break, however, does not mean using TikTok for thirty minutes. [Screens cause fatigue](https://www.londonvisionclinic.com/screen-fatigue-how-to-care-for-tired-eyes/), commonly discovered by hundreds of millions during covid as [Zoom Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_fatigue#Physical).

### Designing a good rest-stop for your freight train

Imagine you are planning the ideal break for yourself. You‚Äôve been hard at work, however that manifests for you. Where, exactly, would you like to park your freight train? What does a good break look like?

Think of the best rest stops in-real life. They have nice, scenic views. Delicious food, water. Maybe even a friend or two to talk to. Seriously, take some time and imagine what taking a fantastic break that recharges would look like.

If it‚Äôs been a particularly draining journey, rest stops have places to sleep. Beds that are made, or even a nice grassy field to lay a blanket in. You know, to rest. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a nap, but laying in bed (without a screen in sight!!) or sitting on a bench watching the clouds go by are both relaxing and restorative. Without a phone in bed, you will lay there until rested/bored and will feel a drive to go out and do stuff again. With a phone, that drive is suppressed, leading to hours in bed but exhaustion and dissatisfaction.

For a good break, maybe even perform some exercise. A couple of toe touches, shoulder rolls. Just some easy and invigorating stretches. Or a full-blown workout!

>This semester, on campus at UC Berkeley, this looks like eating lunch on the glade and listening to some music (or just enjoying the birds and people walking by). Packing a lunch is a part of preparing for the day, and not planning is planning to fail.

### Nightmare Rest-Stop

The worst rest stops for the conductor of a freight train would be a place with no rest! Maybe even a place that makes you miserable.

It would have NO food, or maybe just bags of chips. You know, [junk food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_food#Health_effects)‚Äìfood that tires you out, makes you miserable, and provides no nutritional value. Certainly no vegetables or fruit to be seen! The view would be terrible. Maybe no view at all. Staying inside. Imagine a conductor that stays in the train along an unremarkable stretch of rail. ‚ÄúTaking A Break‚Äù by switching to a different tab/different screen.

    Recommended Read: How To Maximize Your Misery In 7 Short Steps

No rest, no relaxation. Putting a phone in front of you to scroll through social media is not a break. Your shoulders are hunched, you are looking down at a small screen, inside of a small room. How could that be relaxing at all?

## Conclusion

Alright, all this talk of freight trains, conductors, and rest stops is over. Hopefully the analogy helped you visualize what is going on, but if not I‚Äôm going to break it down further here.

When we work, there is a peak state called [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Flow is an innately positive experience; it is known to ‚Äúproduce intense feelings of enjoyment‚Äù.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#cite_note-Csikszentmih%C3%A1lyi_1998-16)¬†An experience that is so enjoyable should lead to positive¬†[affect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology))¬†and¬†[happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness)¬†in the long run. Also, [Csikszentmih√°lyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) stated that happiness is derived from personal development and growth¬†‚Äì and flow situations permit the experience of personal development.[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#cite_note-Cs%C3%ADkszentmih%C3%A1lyi_1996-78)([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#Outcomes))

It may come as a shock that these feelings can come from challenging work. From making friendship bracelets to writing code for a computer science project in a library, flow state can happen everywhere. It‚Äôs a positive feedback loop. As we work, our work becomes better and feels easier while being challenging and we accomplish more and more. We become locked-in and very engaged. This feeling can happen when reading books, going for workouts, hiking, cooking, learning, and more.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm referring to as the freight train. Like a heavy train picks up speed, [so do our brains](https://ksharpe.org/the-miracle-of-compounding/). We begin to filter out noise and enter states of heightened productivity. This state, like all things, is unsustainable. We must take breaks, which is why I refer to the rest-stops. Taking healthy breaks: good snacks/meals, time to reflect, outdoor air and light, etc. Will re-energize us and make us feel better.

### Social Media ‚ÄúBrakes‚Äù

I talk about social media in this article as an ‚Äúemergency brake‚Äù, but that‚Äôs a bit misleading. Emergency brakes are very important. What if a car comes across a train‚Äôs path? Lives could be at risk.

In this context, social media is not fulfilling those positive purposes as we can exit flow at any time by stepping away from our work. Social media is acting as a detriment; yanking us out of positive states of mind into a standstill. Personally, my social media usage was terrible. It was all about the worst things happening in the world: climate change, injustice, violence, etc. What a sore! I would be working hard at something and then be interrupted by some horrific war crimes 5,000 miles away, really damaging my wellbeing. The world is mind-bogglingly huge, with lots of positives *and negatives* happening each second. Frankly, interrupting my work with something very far away was not beneficial for anyone. Being informed is important, so I schedule time to read the news on my own time instead of constant interruptions.

    Recommended Read: The Scale Of A Day

Deleting my social media and creating all of these safeguards (web filters, parental controls, etc) is what it takes for me to keep it under my own control. [Life without social media](https://ksharpe.org/life-without-social-media/) has been an immensely positive experience. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I am growing, living, and facing challenges. Before making these changes, life felt like it was just happening to me.

## Final Thoughts

May you have a great day ahead of you. I hope the information in this article helps you be a little more empowered to make decisions that benefit you and those around you.

Nick Weaver's Post COVID Teaching Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ma3ps0/nick_weavers_post_covid_teaching_policy/,2021-03-21 12:13:01,"The University has announced that Fall is mostly in-person with only large classes (>200 students) offering a remote option.  I personally think this is even a little conservative (see why below at [1]) but it is understandable.  So these are my plans for both the end of the Spring semester and teaching for the Fall semester.

To start with, I hope to hold in person office hours on Wednesdays starting after Spring Break, because at that point I‚Äôll be ‚Äúquasi-vaccinated‚Äù, as I‚Äôm scheduled to get my second dose on that Wednesday.  I am still waiting on having cardkey access to Soda to confirm but things are hopeful.  Worst case it won‚Äôt happen until the week after or so, I haven‚Äôt yet gotten confirmation on my cardkey working.

This will be according to Berkeley‚Äôs current protocol (outdoor, masks, and participation in the COVID screening) but I‚Äôm hoping that Berkeley will soon extend the in-person guidelines in line with CDC guidance for fully vaccinated individuals.  If so, that means I could see students inside my office since two weeks after that I will be in the ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù category.

As for the fall we already know that a lot of students don‚Äôt actually attend lectures, instead preferring webcasts.  So I will give live lectures and webcast/record for those who want remote access, which is the general protocol I‚Äôve always used.  Most discussions/labs will be in-person as well, but there will be an online option.

The most interesting problem with this mixed model for large classes is exams.  In-person proctoring is clearly easier, more effective, and lower stress for the students.  Not that much lower, mind you, because both CS161 developed a relatively low stress proctoring method and we are still talking about midterms from someone with a reputation for ‚Äúhard exams but easy curve‚Äù.

But we will need to support some remote proctoring.  I expect to use a tool that produces the same exam for both (e.g. the 61A examtool or how the 161 exams are generated and derandomized) and will strongly encourage in-person exams.  It may even be the case that there may be in-person exams where the students bring their own laptops if we have access to exam rooms with suitably numerous power ports so it is an ‚Äúin-person on-line exam‚Äù.

We are also continuing to work on remote proctoring.  For example, one idea that we‚Äôve had for ‚Äúclosed net‚Äù exams is that we could use the exam‚Äôs site as the proctoring camera/microphone.  This should enable light-touch 161-style remote proctoring without needing a separate setup.

With the right additional policies (e.g. TAs only have a live view of the students and the only recordings occur if something suspicious occurs) this should allow us to do remote proctoring with easier setup and reasonable privacy concerns but without increasing the stress level for the students.  The instructions would be simple: open the exam, say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù when it wants to access the camera and microphone, and just stay on the exam web page while you work.

So overall things are looking up.  Going forward I intend to keep the things that worked (e.g. chat as a mechanism for asking questions, remote proctoring to enable scalable low-distraction environment proctoring for DSP students, etc) and ditch things that didn‚Äôt (e.g. ONLY on-line office hours in programming classes).  And I hope to see lots of you in person in the fall.

.

[1] Why do I think this is conservative?  Because the vaccines are miraculously good.  Fully vaccinated individuals (2 weeks after second dose for Pfizer or Moderna, 2 weeks after single dose for Johnson and Johnson) have incredible protection: 75-95% effectiveness and preventing infection altogether, and effectively 100% effective at turning COVID-19 from a serious disease to yet another common cold coronavirus.  

The US, despite having done our damndest to be pro-virus in the spreading phase, is doing amazingly well on vaccination: ~25% of the entire population is already at one dose, and we are vaccinating at the rate of nearly 2.5 million a day.  12% of California is already fully vaccinated and the rate of vaccination is continuing to climb.  Treating July 4th as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is almost a certainty at this point.

And variants don‚Äôt worry me too much in the face of vaccination.  If we think of the virus as an attacker there is a bind it is in.  The spike protein is a ‚Äúkey‚Äù that has to match to specific proteins on our cell for the virus to get in.  But it is also the target that vaccines train our body to recognize.  So mutations that reduce the immune response are likely to also reduce infectiousness.

More importantly even a partially effective vaccination will probably still prevent bad outcomes.  The growth of a virus in your body is an exponential process.  And although exponentials can cause things to grow very scary very fast, they are actually remarkably slow to start and incredibly sensitive to initial conditions.  Even a fairly weak initial immune response will result in a substantial improvement in outcomes.  It appears that previous coronaviruses have followed this trajectory.  Combine this with a booster in the fall a‚Äôla the flu vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 becomes yet another common cold coronavirus.

I think the one thing I would like to ask Nick is how room scheduling is going to work for exams and discussions...many professors and instructors have said it takes months in advance to schedule rooms for midterms and discussion section...so how are things going to work out in the fall if 1) a large number of people plan on staying at home, 2) exam times and dates need to be provided in advance, and 3) professors will allow laptops on the exam rooms (space may be an issue)
I think although some of us got vaccines, most haven‚Äôt, and spring break with everyone everywhere it might pose a problem. But omg will you be hosting in person office hours after spring break? Can I go even if I don‚Äôt take your class? :D
Thank you for sharing your plans, I‚Äôm excited for 61C in the fall!
What are your thoughts on the new 66% effective 1-dose J&J vaccine? Will people who took that vaccine likely to need a second dose, or switch to the 95% effective Pfizer/Moderna? If you got J&J instead of Moderna/Pfizer, would you feel comfortable attending large gatherings again?

I hear the vaccine is very popular because it's the only 1-dose vaccine available in the US. How would this affect the vaccination timeline since the 80% heard immunity threshold was assuming everyone get the 95% effective Pfizer/Moderna?
Thank you for your post Nick. I hope all of our classes offer online support (for exams and OH) for the fall because I think many of us, including myself, just don‚Äôt feel safe coming back to Berkeley. Not just because of the virus, but crime rate has been climbing itself and there is very little to do in city now that many places have been closed. Plus, finding housing now is going to cost many of us too much time and stress.
i miss ya professor :)
If the numbers are low enough, do you think Berkeley will walk back the <200 lecture restriction and allow all lectures to be in-person?
I plan to take your 61c class this fall. I saw that the lecture component will be online. Does that mean that we will use Zoom to join live lectures?
That would be why: with in-person the proctoring becomes much easier.
Idk tbh I really do not want to take another exam on Gradescope or exam tool. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I just don‚Äôt enjoy the majority of my grade on a few multiple choice/select and short answer questions. 

Also I still much rather fill in bubbles on a sheet of paper than click buttons online.
Weeks, actually, not months.  And I expect most students won't be remote since the default assumption is for <200 person classes to be in-person only.
Sure.
Oh You Poor, Sweet, Innocent Child.
It is 66% effective at preventing infection, BUT this was in a world where there were many more variants, so the actual protection may be the same as Pfizer/Moderna.

And critically it is still almost 100% effective at turning SARS-CoV-2 into Yet Another Common Cold Coronavirus, which is what really counts.
Fortunately there is time on housing.  But I suspect most students will come back in person, since the default for <200 person classes is going to be in person.

I suspect for my office hours I'll still have a Zoom window open, and we will probably have some zoom-supporting O/H, but in person was just so much more efficient at solving student problems in 61C and 161 that the primary default is going to be in person.
Well, for CS it doesn't matter: recording is sufficient to allow the remote folks to be remote and the in-person be in-person.

ü•∫ he bout to be shafted.
You're implying that there will be less variants in the future? Why is this the case? J&J is only 50-60% effective against the newer African strain, isn't this a major worry still remaining? 

My doctor said the point is to get everyone vaccinated ASAP regardless of 66% vs 95% effectiveness because we want to prevent the virus from mutating so fast it makes current vaccines obsolete. But so long as low income countries are lagging behind in vaccine access, the virus could still mutate abroad and make J&J and even Pfizer and Moderna obsolete. Wouldn't this still be a major worry even if the US reached herd immunity?
Are 61C and 161 <200 person classes? I am confused to how ‚Äúthe primary default is going to be in person‚Äù for those classes‚Ä¶
I actually prefer remote exams over in person exams at least for CS exams since there‚Äôs less distractions (people coughing, entering/exiting rooms) but I also recognize that some people can‚Äôt take remote exams in a quiet setting
Not all CS classes are > 200 ppl
For the first thing, I think he was referencing how the Johnson and Johnson was tested at a later time, in which there were more variants, so it might not be that much different than Pfizer/moderna(j and j played against a harder team, we gotta cut it some slack if Pfizer/moderna wrecked an easier team). 
As for the second question, that‚Äôs a good point, idk, maybe someone else knows more.
No lol.
The discussions and labs will default to in person.  Lecture will be webcast, and there will be accomodations for remote.  We have been told that discussions, since they are <200 each, default to in-person even if the lecture is supporting remote.
In-person discussions sound like we can finally go back to normal, thanks for keeping us in the know!"
Best places to run?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hzr4bp/best_places_to_run/,2020-07-28 18:05:35,"I started enjoying going on runs in quarantine, and am trying to get together a list of places to run once I'm back in Berkeley. I'm still working up to running longer distances (I can only do a couple miles at a time as of now, but am training to run \~10k), so a variety of route lengths would be appreciated. 

Are the fire trails doable for someone pretty new to running/inexperienced in trail running? Do most people just run around Southside/Elmwood? Are there any hidden gem locations (i.e. somewhere that is not the Clark Kerr track) that I should check out? 

Thanks!","Definitely check out the fire trails behind Clark Kerr!!
Highly recommend the Berkeley Marina or going up to Tilden Park
Make sure you can handle hills before trying out the fire trails, they might be tough at first.

Once you get up to 10K distances, big +1 to the marina. Tilden's got a vicious downhill on the way back so the knees may not be happy, but I'd still recommend. There's also a nice bike path about a mile west of campus that goes along the BART up to Richmond - it's pretty flat and has a dirt path on the side.
One that I do when I‚Äôm training for longer distances is the Bay Bridge. If you start at the IKEA in Emeryville to Yerba Buena Island and back is 8 miles.
Stadium to Grizzly Peak is my personal favorite, lots of vertical and one of the best views in the East Bay IMO - roughly 3 mi up to Grizzly, and then you can run back down. This might be too difficult if you're just starting out but you can always hike upwards and then run down. For long runs, I liked to run up Euclid all the way to Tilden Park (actually isn't too far - 2-3 mi oneway?), then running a few miles in Tilden. In my experience, trying to go up the one trail behind Clark Kerr was too hilly and far too dangerous going downwards due to the steepness - but it's a very popular hiking destination. 

I also did a lot of runs in North Berkeley and Berkeley hills - if you don't mind running on the street, you can really explore a lot of Berkeley this way. Also you can run from campus to the Marina, do a loop there, and go back (roughly 7 mi). Pretty much every route has a ton of hills, so at least you'll get good at running hills.
I like to run up into North Berkeley/the area with all the mansions, and come back down on Euclid Ave. You can start from anywhere but that specific part of the run has some gentle hill to get started with uphill running and there's a really great view of the bay once you get near the rose garden.
Euclid by the rose garden is a gorgeous run!!
Ohlone (if you prefer a flatter route), Fire trails, Marina, and Indian rock are pretty decent runs.
Start from Sproul, go to University Ave and just run down until you reach the Berkeley Marina/Cesar Chavez Park. It's about a 5-6 mile run downhill and the 51b ends at the Marina. When you're done, take the 51b back up Berkeley.
Also the ones behind the stadium!
Thanks for this! Do you have any tips for building up stamina for handling hills? I live in a fairly flat area and so I don‚Äôt have a ton of opportunities to practice with them yet, but I‚Äôd love to eventually be able to take full advantage of the fire trails
Honestly, mental toughness is half the game with hills, so if you can just up your mileage, it'll help a lot. Get used to feeling uncomfortable for long periods of time and it'll eventually feel natural. And when you're back in Berkeley, you really can't avoid hills so the physical part will come!"

"sick of getting robbed my packages, trying to build Anti-Theft Delivery Package System",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mjbc0l/sick_of_getting_robbed_my_packages_trying_to/,2021-04-03 09:01:59,"But I got stuck :(

&#x200B;

I'm trying to build it with Raspberry Pi, Pi camera and PIR sensor

&#x200B;

so the logic I've constructed is that 

&#x200B;

1. While the delivery worker completes their delivery(to the orderer's house),

2. PIR sensor detects the motion,

3. when detected, turn camera on.

4. try to recognize a package(i.e. box) in frames

5. save the information about the delivery(like ""Arrived"") as a state (say, Delivery state) whether a package is recognized

from here, I'm assuming the package is arrived

6. while the orderer comes back home and bring the package in,

7. PIR sensor detects motion, turn camera on, try to recognize pre-registered faces(it should be the orderer's and the work of recognizing faces is performed if the current state is that the package is arrived)

7. if recognized, save the information as a state(say, Face recognization state: ""Recognized"" or ""Not Recognized"")

8. now, ideally the package shouldn't be in frames(the orderer must have brought it home)

9. so the state of whether the delivery package is arrived should be changed to something like ""Not Arrived""

10. if the state was ""Arrived"" and then just changed to ""Not Arrived"", check if the state of recognizing faces

11. if Face recognization state is ""Recognized"" then it should mean the orderer took that package and it's ok

12. if Face recognization state is ""Not Recognized"" then it should mean some weirdo took that and send notification through the mobile app

&#x200B;

I'm also building the app, its features include

1. register, login, logout

2. sending user's faces to server

3. notification

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

let's not consider a lot of edge cases like What if someone kick off the delivery box away and run away, etc

&#x200B;

what I am stuck at is how to isolate the functionality. because Raspberry Pi itself can't afford the deep learning model training(if I use that for recognizing faces, package boxes)

&#x200B;

aside of that, like I am so stuck at how to construct the whole system. how to get the functionality separate and so on.

&#x200B;

if user register/send their face images to server(I'm thinking of Firebase to store them) how am I gonna use those images to train it, and then how to use the recognizing model when recognizing faces on Raspberry pi Camera.

&#x200B;

I'm searching around for 7 days with little sleep, I can't organize things.

can you give me any ideas, or advises? thank you.",This has been done already:  https://youtu.be/a_TSR_v07m0
Pro-Gun Argument,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8h5sme/progun_argument/,2018-05-04 23:32:21,"I'm usually pro-gun control I think people should be limited to only action guns (bolt action, lever action, pump action, etc.), however, I was watching a Lowder with the Crower video on gun-control and he made a point that as the second amendment says we are given the right to own weapons to protect from the government if it becomes tyrannical. The normal argument against this that I know of is that the US people could never take on the government and win the fight so there's no point in having guns for that purpose. This argument seemed logical to me until Steven Crowder pointed out that it is illogical for the solution to citizens not being able to protect against a tyrannical government to remove all weapons that provide any chance at doing so, i.e. taking away all guns and leaving the US people defenseless. I've been trying to think of a counter to this idea but have fallen short anyone has a counter because with none I feel that it is only right to concede that people should have the right to all weaponry.    
    
Edit:    
After listening to a few Supreme court decisions (District of Columbia v. Heller and The United States v. Miller) I have concluded as follows. As Antonin Scalia states, ""the second amendment right is not unlimited. It is not the right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, for any purpose whatsoever."" This coupled with the decision in the United States v. Miller that upheld that not all weapons are eligible for protection under the second amendment (in the case the weapon specifically mentioned in this ruling was a sawed-off 12 gauge double barrel shotgun). With these rulings as my grounds, I back the position that while it is not currently to ban the right to bear all arms it is within the scope of the government to limit the right to limit the right to only weapons that are ""in common use of the time... [thats] use could contribute to the common defense"" (The United States v. Miller). Furthermore, as Antoni Scalia says, ""Undoubtedly, some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing armies in pride of our nation where a well-trained police forces provide personal security and where a gun violence is a serious problem, that is perhaps debatable."" There is reason to consider amending the second amendment in the name of protecting against gun violence. Therefore, I propose that the second amendment is adjusted to only protect guns that function through the use of a manual action and be extended to also specifically protect the right to of one to protect themselves from intruders in their own home with such weapons. This will preserve the right of the second amendment to protect against a tyrannical government and help to prevent future gun violence. I would also propose that a system be in place to allow for more substantial guns, e.g. automatic assault rifles, be allowed to be owned and kept under heavy protection by federally licensed gun ranges so that those who wish to use guns as a mean of sport may still do so without the need to own such weapons.","The argument for gun control isn't to protect against a tyrannical government, so the fact that ""taking away all guns"" doesn't help protect the people against a tyrannical government is irrelevant. The argument for gun control is to reduce gun related violence and deaths.
Heller basically reaffirms that the right to bear arms in an individual right.  Miller basically says there being no evidence that a sawed-off shotgun had ""some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia."" 

 So taking those two together means that we individuals should only be guaranteed to have firearms that state militia would be have and since the state militia has basically morphed into the National guard that means we citizens should be able to have any firearm a national guard member is equipped with or similar make & models of hand guns & semi-autos. The AR-15 and typical semi automatic rifles are in common use as well so under the law set by Heller AR-15 bans are unconstitutional. We know this because of Bryant's dissent which he says:

>"" According to the majority‚Äôs reasoning, if Congress and the States lift restrictions on the possession and use of machine guns, and people buy machine guns to protect their homes, the Court will have to reverse course and find that the Second Amendment does, in fact, protect the individual self-defense-related right to possess a machine-gun. On the majority‚Äôs reasoning, if tomorrow someone invents a particularly useful, highly dangerous self-defense weapon, Congress and the States had better ban it immediately, for once it becomes popular Congress will no longer possess the constitutional authority to do so. ""

Also I'd like to point out when people say citizens have no chance against the military look at Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq it a certain extent, etc.  Strong militaries are only effective if they can bear their full might against an entire population with no regard for collateral damage.  If a tyrannical government wanted to enslave people or whatever they would need people still alive fighting millions of armed civilians would not be as easy of a task as people like to think.   

I would also argue that a semi-auto is a manual in that you need to pull the trigger each time for a bullet to fire.  My whole philosophy is that nothing should be banned due to the actions of another person breaking existing law (like murder). If an semi-autos are banned, a bolt action or pump shotgun against unarmed group of people you're still going to have a mass casualty situation, perhaps even worse since they'd be taking moment to aim better. So basically banning semi-auto rifles does nothing to reduce mass shootings (in a gun free zone) and makes civilians less equipped to defend against a tyrannical government.  
Our very own Law dean, Erwin Chemerinsky, wrote a piece in the wake of the Parkland shooting arguing for gun control. It's somewhat relevant

http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article201009764.html?platform=hootsuite
The question is really one of grey areas and in betweens. The second amendment states:
>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

There is actually quite a bit to parse there and what it means is up to significant interpretation. The idea that it refers primarily to a personal right to bear arms is actually a pretty modern interpretation (not saying that it is wrong, just modern).

In direct response to your idea, I think the answer is pretty clear. Allowing all weaponry has terrible effects on society and its members, so we don't do that. An extreme example of weaponry with negative societal impact is the anti-air missile. If allowed it would be easy destroy an airliner on takeoff. The cost of allowing that is clearly not worth the utility it provides in overthrowing a tyrannical government (this is despite it would be extremely useful for that purpose as well). 

So the question is, how much are we willing to pay for having weapons, how much do we want them, and how much are we worried about tyrannical government. 

That's all fine and dandy. Just remember that the NRA and child murderers agree with you.
>The argument for gun control isn't to protect against a tyrannical government,

Crowder is trying to say that the reason for the 2nd Amendment is for self-defense and prevention of a tyrannical government.

>so the fact that ""taking away all guns"" doesn't help protect the people against a tyrannical government is irrelevant. 

It is very relevant. Just accepting for a moment that taking away guns does prevent crime, the ends do not justify the means. For example, eugenics is generally regarded as a terrible idea. Morality is all about balancing.

An argument on principle would be that the right to bear arms is an extension of the right to life, and the government should not be restricting an individual's means to defend themselves (or otherwise preserve their own life). But clearly this also has limitations, ie. even most conservatives agree fully automatic weapons should be banned.

From a pragmatic point of view, there is not much data that suggests gun control legislation is actually effective at deterring violent crime. Of course, firearm related crime does go down, but the number of homicides does not necessarily go down (e.g. the UK). In the US, even though gun law has not changed much since the 90s the homicide rate is at an all time low in the past few years.

And furthermore, it is worth considering the cases where guns have been effective at self defense. From the CDC report Obama ordered in 2013:

>Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year, in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008.

Yes, I understand that, however, the second amendment says that we can't take away guns so that we have the ability to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government. Therefore, to limit the right to guns one would have to show that it is constitutional to do so which I think is quit hard to do so because of the above-stated argument.
Ya I think I agreed with you in my edit. I listened to the fully decision as given by Scalia and Steven's and Miller was a pretty clean cut case. Currently you are right people have the right to bear all arms that are in common use. My argument was that the second amendment should be changed to limit the weapons that can be kept so that only manual action weapons can be kept in order to help prevent mass shootings. While this is not perfect because people can still kill others with these weapons it will help because you can't get nearly as many shots off in the same amount of time with a manual action weapon and you can't bump and manual action weapon. So I think the argument comes down to whether or not this action is justified. I think it is due to the number of shootings that occur every year however that's my opinion and it is debatable. Finally I would like to note that semi automatic weapons are not considered manual action, however, even if it is that's simple semantics which isn't an arguement my intent clearly was to ban that type of weapon.
After reading that article, I'm not convinced he is actually informed on the issue and seems to just be regurgitating a lot of what the media has said.

>Each year, more than 30,000 people in the United States die from guns and more than 70,000 are injured. 

22,000 of those are...suicides. Of course suicide is a terrible issue that should be addressed. But it is not particularly meaningful when trying to create legislation for the purpose of curtailing violent crime, and it is intellectually dishonest when you don't acknowledge that in this kind of discussion.

>To begin with, Congress should ban the sale and possession of semi-automatic weapons...Almost all of the recent mass shootings ‚Äì in Parkland, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in Las Vegas, in Orlando, in San Bernardino ‚Äì involved the same weapon the AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle...The AR-15 is adapted from the military M-16 rife and serves no purpose other than to murder people quickly. 

Several points:

1) Handguns are semi-automatic. Most people in favor of gun control don't really seem to be in favor of banning handguns. I don't know his position here, but we can discuss that later.

2) The AR-15 is not an assault rifle. By definition, an assault rifle needs to be capable of selective fire. ""semi-automatic assault rifle"" is an oxymoron.

It was designed for civilian use. The design may be based off the M16, but that does not make it an assault rifle. A closer look at the components the gun uses can confirm this (chambers a deer hunting cartridge).

3) In aggregate, of the 8,000 firearms responsible for homicides annually in the US, <300 of them were due to rifles. That's less than 4%. AR-15s are not the real issue here.

Also, just a quick addendum: the Sutherland Springs shooting he mentioned was stopped by an NRA instructor. *With an AR-15.* 

>the gun-show and private-sale loophole to background checks must be closed

What is the gun show loophole? Licensed dealers must run background checks on all people. It's federal law. This is a video of Crowder trying to buy from a gun show and trying to get around a background check: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEihkjKNhN8

Of course, you cannot regulate literally every single transaction that happens in the US (e.g. someone selling out the back of their van) But new laws will do nothing to change that.

>A final myth is that gun control laws won‚Äôt make any difference because criminals will still get guns. Study after study shows that crime has decreased in foreign countries that have adopted strict gun control laws. 

This is not true. 

The number of firearm related homicides (which is not the same as 'crime') did indeed drop. But the overall homicide rate did not necessarily drop (UK's shot up), and if it did, it was not necessarily because of the enacted gun legislation (because, for example, the homicide rate has been dropping since the 90s in the US). 

The truth is (and as Obama's CDC report acknowledged) there is not enough evidence to conclusively say that gun control is effective.
Thanks for the sauce, not sure it answered my question but I'm going to listen to the DC vs Heller case and I have a feeling that will thanks!
Also the 
>US people could never take on the government and win the fight so there's no point in having guns

argument, while popular, is really dumb. The full might of the US military couldn't even control Iraq, Afghanistan, or  Vietnam, where they have many fewer guns per capita. If the us was invaded in a civil war or otherwise the civilian guns would be significant.
OP has been reasonable and is just inviting discourse. Why the tribalism?
That's not exactly what the 2nd amendment says, even under the most pro-gun-rights interpretations. 
Well I disagree that manual action only would reduce mass shooting by any measure and even if it did like I said I don't support our rights being reduced or infringed because of actions that are already illegal.  That said I respect your willingness to want to change things the correct way rather then judicial activism or laws that obviously infringe on the second amendment as it is now.
Hey, Drew\_a22, just a quick heads-up:  
**arguement** is actually spelled **argument**. You can remember it by **no e after the u**.

You seem very well informed than you for expressing you opinion. My opinion on banning pistols is that semi automatic ones should be banned this may seem like it encompasses all of then at first essentially banning all pistols, however, most revolvers are lever action and manufacturers could simply make it so that pistols need to be cocked every time they are fired like you would cock it to put the first round in. On the AR-15 you are right they are not assault rifles, however, they are still dangerous weapons and that I feel to be excessive. Their only real use is for sport at a range, self protection at home, or killing. While I suppose they could be used for hunting this is not really a hunting rifle dispite it holding a round that could be used to hunt with. If you intend on hunting dear you are much better off with something like a .30-06 dont you agree? I know this because I actually use to hunt deer. As for using it for sport i addressed that in my edit, and for personal defense I would argue that it's not really that effective for that purpose. Sure it's a high caliber weapon that will blow through anyone who steps in your house but this is a weapon meant for medium range use and most encounters that it would be used for for self protection are close encounters where a shot gun would be better. This being said it has not practical use other than to kill with. Now I'm not saying everyone with and AR is a killer I'm just saying that for the 300 kills that this gun causes per year it is really not worth it to keep around because it simply isnt a practice weapon for anything but shooting in a range with.
What you said about gun shows is not true. In many states (Nevada for example) you can buy a gun in a private sale with no background check. The dealers at the show have to check but the people selling their own private weapons do not. In California any sale has to go through a FFL dealer, thus closing the loophole. There should be a federal law that every sale must go through a licensed dealer like in California. 
.....do you not have finals?:'')
Thanks for your reply! You made some good points and I feel that in my edit that I just made I touched on a what you were saying. 
you're replying to a troll. As always, downvote and move on
Thank you Mr. Robot
The problem I have with what you just said is that you haven't provided evidence demonstrating that banning all semi-automatic weapons works and is worth sacrificing human rights for.

Sure, it'd be nice if you could just ban those firearms and then the overall homicide rate will drop. But it's not necessarily the case that it does - and when it does, it's not clear if it's because of legislation. The problem I have with most gun control studies is that they only focus on firearm related deaths and don't include a control variable.
The problem I have is there is no way to regulate that. 

Certainly, gun dealers, whose business relies on selling guns, will need to be licensed, so the law is going to target individual transactions.

If an individual were to say, sell a gun privately and to a mass shooter out of the back of the van, then he/she could just do so without enforcing a background check, and no one would ever know. No law would stop that - it would only serve to punish the seller retrospectively.
I do but I was studying all morning now I'm doing this XD
Ya, that's definitely a rational concern. While there are no studies I have heard of that look at the effect of this change because to my knowledge something like this has never happened worldwide, however, there is a pretty decent amount of evidence to support gun control is effective such as looking at Finland or if we look at the US by state the ones with stricter gun laws have fewer gun homicides (New York is known for having strict gun law and is 48th for most gun violence with 4.4 gun deaths per 100,000 people, California, arguably the most strict is 43rd with 7.9 gun deaths per 100,000 people. This compared to the top 5 states with the most gun deaths: Alaska, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma (all who have fairly loose gun laws) who have 23, 21.4, 21.2, 19.8, 19.6 deaths by gun per 100,000 people respectively. admittedly these statistics include suicide which when removed change the standings slightly (notably Alaska drops quite significantly), however, out of laziness I didn't calculate all the statistics out to only include homicides but from the ones I did convert over and the simply by looking at the total homicides in each state the trend seems to be consistent.
Sure he could do so Illegally but it would prevent responsible gun owners from selling to a mass terrorist accidentally because the guy looked normal. No law stops people from doing it illegally that's the job of the atf.
> gun control is effective such as looking at Finland 

You mention Finland, I can mention Switzerland. Or the UK, where gun control had a negative effect. Or the US, where the homicide rate has dropped more (as a percentage) than Australia. 

>US by state 

Do it by city, county. (And for areas, such as Chicago, which have had gun laws strengthened, compare the trend over time)

Also your numbers don't match up: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state

>the trend seems to be consistent

Even if we pretend it is, you have to prove it is because of gun legislation that murder rates have dropped over time. 

Oh, and factor in the number of self defense use cases - which range (according to the CDC) from 500,000 to 3 million.
Fair enough
**Gun violence in the United States by state**

This article is a list of the U.S. states and the District of Columbia, with population, murders and nonnegligent manslaughter, murders, gun murders, and gun ownership percentage, then calculated rates per 100,000. The population data is from the U.S. Census Bureau. Murder rates were calculated based on the FBI Uniform Crime Reports and the estimated 2015 population of each state.

The 2015 U.S. population total was 320.9 million.

I'm not super versed in other countries gun control effect so in reference to Switzerland and the UK I don't really have any insight there, however, I think looking at America its self is the best way to compare because as we can all agree America has a very different culture than the rest of the world when it comes to human rights and guns. The numbers your reference come from wikipedia which doesn't invalidate them, however, It makes me a little skeptical to know where the data came from and how legitimate it is. The source I am referencing comes from Usatoday which while slightly liberal leaning but better than most sources, and all the data was reviewed by the wall street journal which is really as close to middle as it gets as far as US news sources go. Also as far as looking at counties goes that seem like just as effective a method as looking at states, I don't have the information on that so I would like to see those statistics, however, your example of Chicago I think is a bit misconstrue. Despite Chicago cracking down on gun laws it has a very long history and culture of gun violence so it having high rates of gun violence despite strict gun laws does not to me seem like compelling evidence.        
Sauce for state gun violence: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/02/21/states-most-and-least-gun-violence-see-where-your-state-stacks-up/359395002/    
As far as the self defense goes I know the source you are talking about it was a study done by the CDC which is a very reliable source, however, the study was never published, this was all just leaked information. I am very skeptical to believe these numbers as the total provided by the FBI is only around 1.2 million a year so having more than the total number of violent crimes being stopped with a gun seems absurd and even saying that half of them are stopped seems unreasonable. What I think may have happened (this is pure speculation) is that that the CDC took a sample of the population to find how many crimes were stopped with guns (and they included crimes stopped by cops with guns which I don't think should be concluded because I don't think anyone that is pro-gun control is asking to take guns away from police) and then they assumed their sample average was about equal to the population (common statistical practice) then created a confidence interval which is what is shown with the 500,000 to 3 million. This is all sound statistical work, however, even if everything is done right you will still get out liar case like this that seem to be outside the expected bounds. Furthermore, by the look of the large range of 2.5 million it seems that the data is quite varied and doesn't provide an accurate reading which may indicate too small of a sample size. Again, that last bit was speculation, however, I think that it is fairly logical to believe that the data is off and that the true number is smaller. I would like to see some real data on this, however, currently to my knowledge there is now legitimate data on the number of crimes stopped by citizens with a gun. I feel that before any legislation is made this study should be conducted. Also, thank you for being respectful and engaging in real, meaningful conversation with me.
I‚Äôm going to have to read that after finals week lol 
Ya, definitely give it a read once you're not drowning in work XD. It's a pretty short article it's mostly just the statistics. Also, I'm sure there are other articles out there that may have a found different conclusion. That's just how statistics is none are going to be 100% accurate it's just about finding the most unbias ones that use the best statistical methods and comparing trends across them rather than specifics. Thanks for the conversation good luck on finals!"

PhD program. Med school. Industry. Law school. A master‚Äôs degree program. A professional master‚Äôs degree program. Teach for America. Starfleet Academy. Companion to The Doctor. Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. *Et cetera.* 
  
Figure out which of these you‚Äôre interested in and competitive for, and prepare a plan of attack for each. The senior year should be devoted to implementation, not planning.
  

**Be suspicious of your lifelong goals.**

I‚Äôve heard many students tell me that they‚Äôve wanted to a doctor or a professor since they were children. Now that you know what a doctor or a professor actually does, is that still true?
  
If I was beholden to a career chosen by my nine year old self, I would currently be the worst Jedi ever.
  

**If you don‚Äôt know why you need graduate training, you don‚Äôt need graduate training (yet).**

If you go to graduate school because you ‚Äúlike school‚Äù, want to put off making a decision, please your parents, or because it seems like the next thing to do - you will likely be miserable, and you‚Äôll be paying for that misery with your time and money.
  

**If you‚Äôre interested in a PhD program...**

Schedule, study for, and take the GRE. Plan to have three strong letters of recommendation, at least two of which are from people you‚Äôve done research or interned with. Get started on your essays, which should go through endless drafts and many reviewers, each of whom you owe either beer, fancy chocolate, or comments on their own essays. Plan to apply for an NSF fellowship. (If you don‚Äôt apply for an NSF fellowship, you‚Äôre not sufficiently serious about graduate school.) Look into the NDSEG, DoE, and (if your resume burns with the power of a thousand suns) the Hertz fellowship as well.

Identify eight or more programs, each with at least two labs you‚Äôd be happy to work in, in locations you won‚Äôt mind making your home for five years.
  

**If you‚Äôre interested in med school...**

Schedule, study for, and take the MCAT. Plan to have three strong letters of recommendation, at least two of which are from people you‚Äôve done research or interned with. Get started on your essays, which should go through endless drafts and many reviewers, each of whom you owe either beer, fancy chocolate, or comments on their own essays.
  

**If you‚Äôre interested in industry...**

Internships are, from the employer‚Äôs point of view, an extended interview. Get yourself an internship. Network. If an event on campus boasts industry guests in your field, go to it. Do practice interviews. Have your resume reviewed by people that know what they‚Äôre doing.
  

**Become a mentor.**

You remember what is was like in your first year? Chances are you got a lot of help from students in their 3rd and 4th years. Congratulations! You are now that person. Own it.
  

**Manage your online persona.**

Your public photo album named ‚Äúkegstands and other tomfoolery‚Äù is unlikely to impress future employers.


**Plan to publish.**

No matter your trajectory, having your name on a published or in-press paper when you graduate is useful. Talk to the people you‚Äôre researching with, and ask them what the plan for publication is. Be honest about your goals, and tell ‚Äòem you‚Äôre willing to do what it takes to make that publication a reality.
  
Research is always a risk, and the publication might not happen. That‚Äôs fine. At worst, you‚Äôve proven your dedication to the lab and demonstrated your professionalism.
  

**Make a graduation ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù.**

Don‚Äôt spend the first few years of your postgraduate life kicking yourself for not participating in campus traditions or taking advantage of the area you‚Äôre currently living in. Outside of academics, what do you want to do before you graduate? Write those things down. Then start making them happen.
","Who is this advice from?
What to do if senior and no plan^^plz ^^help
What if I'm a senior planning on applying to grad programs (masters only)? Is it worthwhile to join another research lab and get what I can out of it, if only for a semester?
Going to expand on one topic: Even if you plan on going into industry make friends with a professor of two via office hours or research. You never know when/if you'll change your mind and want to go to great school even if you absolutely don't right now. 
Patches on Telegraph. 
Advice the first: don't panic.

Advice the second: ""get a job"" is the default. Most people graduate college unsure of what they want to do next. This is terrifying, but the upside is - you will learn more about what you want to do in practically any position even slightly related to your field. So go out and cast a wide net. Go to job fairs, build a resume (get others to review it), and practice interview.

Maybe grad school or med school or an MBA or law...later. Lots of people take a few years in industry before they are sure they want another degree, and they are excellent candidates. They're a little more seasoned, and they generally know exactly why they want the next degree, which makes them motivated, too.

Or not. Maybe you work a bit at Company X, which makes you realize that you want to work for Company Y, and your experience at Company X gets you there.

In brief: just go do something. Do not lose sleep about ruthlessly optimizing your next choice. There is no perfect choice, because your goals are a moving target. Go do something and learn from it.

(I was a ChemE who worked in environmental engineering who went to grad school to study catalysis to go back to industry - and ended up doing tissue engineering to become a professor, but left to become a lecturer instead.)
Some experience is better than none - for any graduate program, 2 letters from internships/research positions is a good place to be.

It's a little more complicated than that, but not seeing your resume and assuming you could find a lab that you'd be genuinely interested in and willing to put a lot of hours into - I'd say go for it."
"Connecting With Berkeley Alum on LinkedIn or via Email - ""{Hi} and {Why}""",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vsdsir/connecting_with_berkeley_alum_on_linkedin_or_via/,2022-07-05 18:25:38,"In the era of ambitious tech bros and ""product bros"" aka future MBA grads who want to be PMs, LinkedIn is a great way to get connected to others in the tech industry. I utilized LinkedIn to get referrals or ask Berkeley Alumni about their experience with certain companies as graduation approached and I was applying to jobs.

With that being said, connecting in good faith is important to keep the ecosystem alive and well. What do I mean by this? I mean that if you connect and say ""hey I'd love to get to know other professionals in the tech industry"" but you just want a referral, or you say ""I'd love to chat and learn more about what your work looks like at [company]"" but you actually are trying to connect about your club on campus or some kind of partnership, then you are contributing to the ""bait and switch"" environment, which hurts everyone. 

cc: Cal student consulting organizations

## My Context

I have been on several panels for students in the program I graduated from at Cal (Statistics), have posted or commented on tech subreddits or other forums, and simply by having an updated LinkedIn profile, get somewhere between 3-5 messages / week during busy seasons and \~1/week during the rest of the year. Most people ask for referrals or for me to hire them explicitly when I have advertised that our team is growing; I once shared a referrel link directly to LinkedIn and our internal analytics registered thousands of likes and hundreds of applications, and I also got dozens of DMs during those times. Others ask how to ""break into tech"" from other industries, or ask miscellaneous questions about my current or past company.  I think LI's algorithm will suggest me in the sidebar since I have a high response rate, but from my colleagues this experience is not uncommon.

## Incentives on both sides

Before I go into the format with examples, a word on incentives:

### Incentives for Current students

1. Opportunities: internships, full time job offers, referrals
2.  Knowledge: a phone call or email exchange where you ask someone in industry about their experience, tech stack, org chart, best practices, domain knowledge, etc. This almost always feeds somehow into \#1, but a highly motivated senior for instance might have internships and a solid profile, so they may just be reaching out to understand a more niche role, like MLE vs. ML SWE, or DS vs Applied Scientist, TPM vs. PM, and so on, or ask about projects on a high level. 
3. Mentorship: maybe you have seen someone's content or interacted with them and you admire them or otherwise want to get to know them or learn about their career journey. Maybe they were a GSI who graduated or you were in a club with them.

### Incentives for Alumni

1. Hiring pipeline and referral bonuses: if there are entry level roles to be filled, then oftentimes Berkeley students are particularly capable, and it means that there will be a shared context, or the current employee may even have a clear grasp on exactly what sorts of projects and academic training the current student has. Referral bonuses range from $500-$5000 depending on the context, which is nontrivial for what usually amounts to submitting a form or a slack message on behalf of an applicant.
2. Giving back: being a mentor can be a rewarding experience, and it also uplevels you as a manager and teacher, gives you more context on what is happening at different levels of the hiring pipeline or experience funnel for your industry / role ladder, and also reminds you of how far you've come in your own journey to have someone giving you some level of trust, admiration, or otherwise looking to you for guidance. 
3. An additional connection who may be useful later when the currently employed individual is in a position of needing a reference or job. Maybe the current student is going to have a much more successful career and soon you'll be peers or in need of mentorship yourself! You never know. 

An important note here is that these interactions are almost exclusively one-sided at the outset, or at the very least strongly asymmetric. Even in the case of referral bonuses, a job offer is clearly of greater value than a couple thousand dollars one time after taxes. 

## The ""Hi and Why"" Format

My suggestion is the ""hi and why"" format. Give a greeting, and then give a VERY brief (one sentence if you can) description of what you want from the interaction, including scope. By scope I mean, do you want an hour long call and for me to review your resume and project portfolio? Do you want me to look at your code? Do you want to meet in person? Do you want me to connect you to someone else in my network? Do you really just have one question and think you need a phone call to ask it? I want to know how much you're asking of me so I can budget when I can offer it, if I do want to offer it.

### Good Example:

""Hi Jake,

I'm a data scientist looking to apply to [company]. I was hoping I could speak to you beforehand so I can better prepare for the roles I'm seeing. Let me know if you have time to chat!

Best,
[first_name]""


You can see this person reached out, gave a brief intro (hi), said what they were hoping for (why), and a polite salutation to conclude the message. I appreciated the brevity and because they included both the hi and why, I knew exactly what to expect and how to budget my own time and energy to interact with them. I ended up having a back and forth email chain of more than 25 emails over several weeks containing detailed feedback for this candidate's resume and other components of their interview prep, have had two chats now and I genuinely was glad to be part of their career journey as they transitioned to ""big tech"" roles since they come from a slightly different environment. We have plans to grab coffee in the next few weeks to finally meet in person. They responded promptly and eagerly, but not ""desperately"" and were appreciative and teachable. This makes the exchange rewarding for me, thereby reducing friction when it comes to having additional touch points or advising.

### Bad Example

""Hi Jake, I'm Mark\* and I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. I saw that you studied at UC Berkeley too and I would love to connect! Go Bears!""     

\*(name changed here for privacy)

You can see here the student includes the hi, but no ""why"". I don't quite understand why people want to connect on LinkedIn with people they haven't met because a low quality ""connection"" without an introduction or brief set of messages is not very useful unless you post frequently and I'm able to sort of ""get to know you"" via seeing your posts on my feed (which I rarely look at). But I understand some students are eager to connect with professionals and don't want to rebuff their enthusiasm, so I sent back a message (again, with name changed here for privacy):

""Nice to meet you Mark; looks like you have a strong profile and still a couple years left to gain momentum. Have you considered if you will do a masters or MBA?""

I responded this way because this student clearly is ambitious, and their LinkedIn is FULLY decked out with over 12 different experiences, several internships per summer, and some confusing employment entries which I now understand are some kind of ""consulting clubs"" at Cal of which I'm unfamiliar. They have the full measure of both typical and somewhat cringy ""I am deeply honored to have accepted my offer of internship at Bumbleflairex\*"" for literally every step in their student career and internship journey. Understainding their goals could help me get at the ""why"" component of connecting, and I thought they could be interested in the masters program I completed.    


\*Bumbleflairex is what all small startup names sound like to me, but is not a real company (yet).

The student's response was to send some kind of multi-paragraph advertisement about how he is the vice president of a very exclusive and illustrious consulting organization and how my current company could really benefit from the expertise and ""acceleration of product development"" that his organization has to offer. The website was not specific about exactly what partnership looks like and I couldn't see clear examples so :shrug:. 

I was sort of taken aback because he also didn't answer my question or continue in the organic conversation, which indicated to me that I'm clearly part of a wide net LinkedIn outreach effort, and while I would be potentially interested in connecting with an eager student, I'm not excited to engage in some kind of ad, especially when it wasn't part of the ""why"" in the original message. It's a bait and switch--I saw you're a Cal alumni, let's connect! Great. I'll connect. Also, now that we've connected, here's an exclusive opportunity I want to sell you on. 

## The Big Tech Company Ecosystem

Before I go on, let me be clear--I think that Cal undergrads are exceptional. I was a GSI for several courses when I was at Cal and had students who were far more accomplished than I was as an undergrad and extremely sharp. However, the team I currently work with are all econ or stats PhDs from top 10 schools who have between 4-10 years of experience in our specific domain--oftentimes they come from the specific research field that my company or team focuses on. This means they have, on average, 12-15 years of experience working with the data and models our team cares about. This is nearing the age of undergrad students. And unless you're Terence Tao you're going to need more time to absorb and process the information and methods in our domain. When we hire interns or undergrads, it's nearly 100% because we trust that they will be helpful or productive after a substantial investment *from our end* while providing little to no benefit during the ramp up period. Internships in general are chiefly to reduce costs on the recruitment budget because it's easier to identify and invest in students over a summer and have return offers for the following year than it is to sift through hundreds of thousands of resumes during full time recruitment season, and those same interns tend to refer well for the roles we care about, so we pay them bonuses instead of hiring more recruiters. Furthermore, our company has a TON of training and bureacracy in order to allow people to have access to ANY data or even log in to our system. It's a huge headache when something goes wrong and we have senior people in their 30s who fuck something up even when they havd so much experience. It presents a large incentive NOT to trust or engage with outsiders about internal proprietary information and increases the necessary value add before a break even point. This is not to say that it's impossible to add value, it's simply to illustrate the perspective of someone working in industry and how this ecosystem is represented to us when we know nothing about your student organization.

What I'm getting at is that there is *some degree* of presumption when you are a student and you contact a full time engineer, data scientist, product manager, or other employee at a large firm and claim that you have something strong to offer. Additionally, it takes a substantial amount of ""messaging around"" for the most eager of employees to find out who is in charge of these partnerships, then I have to have a call to explain what it is, then a follow up to introduce the point person, and I also have to take on the risk of it being unfruitful which reflects poorly on me and might hurt my ability to get resources later when I need them. Have these organizations provided some value to companies in the past? Their existence suggests so, but it's not evident to me what the value would be, since my company has a hoard of engineers, data scientists, and PMs at all levels working on these things all the time.

This student has now sent me several messages to remind me of his original offer, and even sent me a ""Happy Fourth of July"" message and an **additional connection request** after I declined his first one, which actually reminded me to finish this post I had in my drafts, so it was not entirely useless.

## Recommendations

1. Be clear from the outset what you're interested in by summarizing it in your ""why"" component of your original message.
2. Avoid jargon and be specific whenever possible, because not everyone knows your context or what you're offering. E.g. if you say ""consultants"" or ""accelerate product development"" add that your consultants are current undergrads in a STEM major, and that by ""accelerate product development"" you mean perhaps that you will do some kind of project on an underresourced area for 4-6 weeks, or say ""you give us access to proprietary data and we will build a model and partner with one engineer, one data scientist, and one PM before we hand it back off to your team for maintenance"". 
3. Don't pester or follow up half a dozen times if the connection isn't happening. Leave your original message, MAYBE one reminder, and then thank them for their time and leave a link or an email to reach you if they are interested in the future. I have left a message on read or declined in the past, but then gone back to look for the message when the right time arose, but only if the person was (i) not aggressive or pretentious (ii) they were polite and brief.","""hi, i want connect. gib referral or job? thx in advance""
pretty much agree with everything here. also worth noting that I think a lot of people are willing to take time out of their day to give advice or a quick referral. I wish I reached out randomly to alumni more just for advice when I was in school.

something that turns me off is if the person reaching out comes off as too tryhard. what you wrote about being presumptuous is really true. i know that shits tough out there for some students and im more inclined to help people who seem casual, humble, and are just trying to learn/better themselves rather than simply use me for a connection, shill me something they've been working on or are a part of, etc. dead giveaway is when the message I get looks like it could have been copy pasted and sent to 100 other people.
I get loads of invite requests, some tips:

1) A simple ‚ÄúGo Bears‚Äù goes a long way

2) If you ask for a referral within 2 messages (or at all really without meeting face to face) that‚Äôs gonna be a no from me dawg. I‚Äôm not some referral vending machine, this isn‚Äôt a transaction.

3) It‚Äôs a good idea to have a few questions that you want to ask, it‚Äôs a good idea to show genuine interest.


+1 for the suggestion to come off more casually/humbly. Talk about who you are but you don‚Äôt have to oversell it.
Excellent summary. I know it takes a good amount of courage to send cold messages, so I'm forgiving for the most part even if the manner isn't perfect, but I certainly wouldn't say 'no' to a polite concise message. 

Some alumni may not always reply back or have the warmest tone, but there are other alumni out there who want nothing but the next generation of golden bears to also succeed, so keep connecting. Go Bears!
!RemindMe 2hrs
As an incoming econ transfer student, thank you for this post. It was very helpful
Brb adding this to the good examples
I think the reverse for 2. If you‚Äôre messaging me for a referral, I would prefer if that came out early. There‚Äôs nothing worse than someone who feels obligated to make empty conversation just to pad out the time before they ask for the thing that they want and it‚Äôs incredibly obvious that that is the case.

Get the transaction out of the way and if you want to talk we can talk, or if not we can skip the water cooler talk.

I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree actually. I think I just prefer to avoid people that are gunning for a referral. I don‚Äôt know you, my referral is gonna be pretty useless. I‚Äôm more than happy to offer a referral on my own accord once I‚Äôve met you at least once (over the phone/zoom/in person, etc)

Or if they‚Äôre gunning for a referral, I think the best approach probably is: ‚ÄúHi I saw your profile and wanted to connect. I‚Äôm currently interested in an open role/internship at XYZ and I know a referral can go a long way. Can we set up a quick call for me to introduce myself?‚Äù
I'm glad to see two completely opposing opinions on this because it's important also to keep in mind that everyone you reach out to has an unknown preference so it's impossible to make that connection every time. I have lots of well crafted messages with what I think are insightful questions that get left on read. One of my most impactful research experiences was obtained through 40 cold emails with only one response. That's showbiz, baby!"
Who here goes to Cal and hates it? Why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6xcsz7/who_here_goes_to_cal_and_hates_it_why/,2017-08-31 23:29:50,"So this was something I had on my mind for awhile. I've seen a couple of these comments  on the subreddit and in real life, so I think it's something I've wondered i.e. how many people who go here hate it? WARNING: Large block of text, if you don't wanna read it just skip to the end, this is just why I feel the way I do.

Now for the record I hate Cal, but in a confused way. I like many of the teachers and faculty, certainly the EECS department is the best run educational institution I've ever taken courses in. Many were entirely run by undergraduates and they were amazing simply because the department seems like they not only take surveys, but actually listen to them. Unlike say the Math department who dumps some visiting professors or graduate student at some random school to teach their courses, often with little support or teaching experience (I'm an Applied Math major), leading to a bad experience that's not entirely their fault. Honestly CS courses have been the highlight of my experience at Cal. 

Now on to why I hate the campus. First off the administration is dogshit and arrogant. When I went to orientation a speaker was talking about ""imposter syndrome"" of people feeling like they're a fraud and don't belong here and how that's not true and that the school does want them. Honestly I'm a bit skeptical of that, it seems if you don't have a 3.5 gpa and don't have some area you obsess over you can't do any extra curricular. You can't do research since you get beat out by other people, you can't join clubs since joining interesting clubs is like applying to a job, many expect alot of experience, and even resumes and cover letter for an unpaid club membership. WTF. Application decisions at Cal are notoriously nonsense and a joke, so it's doubtful whether many students should even be here. Admin itself is so incompetent, constantly flagging your account with nonsense (to be fair this was a bigger problem last fall) and not being able to handle the volume of students. To put this in perspective I'll just talk about the various UC reps who were hosting counseling sessions at my CC before I transferred. UCSD was very helpful, going through every detail of transferring from housing to how the school works to the types of things you can do. It was so helpful because she answered questions I would've had later down the road. Berkeleys rep by comparison was a fucking joke being completely bare bones. Other schools just care more about their students; Cal doesn't give a shit, they seem to just view them as spoiled suburban kids to be used as money bags and for photo ops to continue their business. I have another friend who goes to CSULA, one of the students there was risking his parents getting deported and the school stepped in with their own lawyers to help him out. Can any of you imagine Cal doing that? They deported their own janitors a while back. But hey, it's ok because we hold the Guinness world record for the largest human letter. 

I guess the next thing is the environment. Obviously it's highly competitive, but since there's more or less no meaningful support if you fall behind it does seem like the school just stops offering anything. If you have a tough time connecting with anyone or begin to suffer from something like depression, thats a tough thing to do. I think everyone who got into Cal with good grades can do well, but it's alot easier if you have some sort of community. The people around you have a much larger impact on your personal performance than you may believe. The support services are a joke. I don't normally ask for help, and when I did I was reminded why I don't. ""Save your semester"" is a bunch of nonsense, counseling was just a waste of time. In the end I decided to say fuck that and to reintroduce some of my old habits like waking up early in the morning and exercising first thing. You have no idea how helpful that was. After that my grades just shot up. All Cal offered was hours of useless support.

But I think really the main reason is just the area for me. Berkeley quite honestly is a boring shithole. The food suffers from protectionism. Many chains  are kept out or limited, like say McDonalds, while many of the local businesses are run by first time owners and are understaffed with poorly trained cooks. The only thing mildly interesting are the protests, but they're just a bunch of pointless grand standing; a way for ""woke"" liberals to feel good about themselves. Newsflash: the protests aren't dangerous, nor is what they're protesting. It just seems bizarre in a city with so many problems like homelessness, a sex trafficking slumlord who owns most of the rental properties and workers at Cal dining, they only care about some guys from Breitbart. 

Now all of that is forgiveable IMO. But for me, I've always hated Cal. When I first came to Cal while I was in HS I HATED IT. I didn't have any chance at the time, but it was the place my mom wanted me to go to. It was just many of the things I hated about America wrapped into one. By that I mean arrogance, ignorance and a false image. Now I was still a teen, so when I transferred years later I gave Berkeley a chance. I pretended that was just teenage angst and since it was being pushed on me I pushed back. I bought some Cal gear, I've never been a big school spirit person anyway, and during the first week I tried to make friends and join clubs. Yet somehow that resentment stuck. It is much deeper for me than I thought. And I couldn't get past it. I made a serious mistake coming here and I should've chosen different options at the time. I had almost joined the military (like last last minute no), I had a well paid job as a medical equipment technician that would've also helped pay tuition and I had been accepted into UCSD. For me though, I know what my mom would wanted and since she had my back the entire time I went here. If I supported myself I would've gone to UCSD, which comes with the added benefit of leaving the Bay Area. 

More importantly though I met many people who felt the same way. Even many of my friends who I transferred with feel the same way. I'm curious to see how many students feel that way. ","I dropped out so clearly I wasn't the biggest fan. 

Calling you out on your 'Berkeley is a boring shithole' though. Get the fuck out of your bubble - gourmet ghetto, places all over San Pablo, so much food in Jack London and by the lake a 20 min BART ride away. 

There's tons of hikes around, mini golf, gorgeous views, so many music venues. The Bay is such a fantastic place with so much to do, but it is really easy to get trapped in the three blocks around campus. 
>Application decisions at Cal are notoriously nonsense and a joke, so it's doubtful whether many students should even be here.

>more or less no meaningful support if you fall behind it does seem like the school just stops offering anything

lol bruh that combination of narcissism and pretension with a request for help is hilarious. 

If admin competence is selecting students who can preform then if you need help you don't belong. Or should the school nurture those it selects? For some reason, presumably for yourself, you make a special exception for why someone might fail  - People don't belong here, administration is incompetent, but If I were to fail ,BECAUSE OF DEPRESSION , there should be support.

There is a lot I don't like about Berkeley, but one thing Berkeley has really given me , is a sense of respect for how intelligent other people are. If you made it to berekely, you were big fish in a small pond, and now here, you realize your not alone. There are Freshman history majors taking calculus, and everyone has a unique set of Talents. 

Drop the pretension. Berkeley isn't your locality, you have found your peers. The most annoying thing Berkeley students do is condescend. Everyone wants to be your tutor.
If you're a grad student, you may find a professor or two who cares, but if you're an undergrad, you're just another money-generating number. Also, rent and rape culture.
Completely agree on hating Berkeley:


1. Want a good club? Lol good fucking luck. 

2. Parties arent as good as other schools

3. DECALS are hard to get into. FUCKING DECALS.

4. No more late night 

5. Hot weather and no AC

6. No support system whatsoever for careers. They just give you a fucking career website to apply to companies...

7. Impersonal class advising process

8. Long lines at Sproul

9. Expensive rent, food, and other shit

10. Horrible ""study 24/7"" culture

11. the only tangible steps to fixing stuff is like adding more nap pods

12. Career fairs are so crowded it gives no reason to go

13. Dining halls are so crowded 

14. Hills make walking around hard

15. Cal football is a joke. Even aaron fucking rodgers distances himself

16. We had two top ten recruits and lost in the first round of the tournament 

17. Obama picked us to win that game, then crossed us out

18. We had an all male dorm up until two years ago

19. Grade DEflation

20. Our school colors are ugly. 

21. Constant constant construction 

22. We had a number one pick...that was a bust

23. Finding Housing is so unnecessarily complicated 

24. No In-n-out

25. Top Dog is cash only. You know how many times ivewalked by, wanted it, and realized i didn't have cash?

26. It is very unsafe. I never feel safe at night i always make sure to be with others at night and use the shuttle etc

27. It is very very dirty. Lots of trash and smells really bad some places

28. If you're driving, everyone jaywalks. If youre a pedestrian, all the drivers are overly aggressive. Its a shit show

29. AC transits that are late ruin everything 

30. Our fucking school gym is so crowded its ""one in, one out"". What kinda shit is that?

31. Want a seat in a library during dead week? Better wake up early!

32. Our rivalry is a joke. Stanford is better in the things that matter in a rivalry: football and school ranking.

33. We havent beat USC or Stanford in a football game in a long time.

34. Theroetically We have the same tools USC, UCLA and Stanford have yet we went 1-11 like three years ago

35. We are LITERALLY on a major fault line

36. Not only is our football team ass but our stadium is financially fucked 

37. Little nightlife

38. Airbnb restrictions 

39. The McDonalds is very overpriced

40. If you want to get in to Haas, you still have to apply. You cant just get in from high school. 

41. Everyone, no matter what, is just a number. 

42.  There is no DIRECT PERSON to complain to. Its a Huge bureaucracy where nothing can get done. Thats what i hate most.

Lol but jokes aside, Berkeley has some positives:

‚Ä¢ive met great friends here. Theyre gonna be lifelong friends and i'll know them until I grow old 
‚Ä¢because of the lack of support, everything ive accomplished ive done on my own. That is incredibly fulfilling. 


My bottom line is: Berkeley is a rough place. Its one of those ""get thrown in the fire asap"" experiences where if you get out, youre a rockstar. And to be honest, its not that hard. Just put yourself out there to others and keep trying to form friendships and youll be great. My time was kinda rough but it got better. its shaped me. Its an opportunity to find yourself and develop your identity. I have developed tremendously and Im glad i came here. Im proud to be a golden bear.
Cal may not show much interest in its students but when there are so many qualified applicants why should they? the admin isn't going to hold ur hand. if u think Cal's bad wait until u graduate. post-college no one cares what you do at all. it's a dog-eat-dog world and I think Berkeley prepares you for that.  


not everyone is going to like the Bay but im not sure how u can call Berkeley boring - have u been to Pullman or Coorvallis? La Jolla is near/on the beach but ure in a really wealthy area that isn't a fan of college kids


You're certainly not alone. I definitely feel you on both the lack of personal interest or involvement from administration as well as the hyper competitiveness of clubs and research. Jesus, even getting into a DeCal involves some serious dick sucking.

It's not all bad, though. The Cal name essentially did the hard work of getting me an internship this summer.
You're definitely not alone in this sentiment, it's pretty much you vs everyone else on campus. Remember, Berkeley's most notable academic achievements was never due to their undergraduate department - it's always been postgrad research. Honestly this is why I stress having some kind of support group of friends to fall to or even a fraternity. 

Keep in mind, it doesn't get any better after you graduate, do take advantage in the fact youre surrounded by many people of the same age and interests in one spot. 
Poor selection of vagina
Sounds like you're struggling with the rigor and are having a hard time separating your life from your academic career. Why not try to non-academic extra curriculars? Try to meet some new people who are having a positive experience. It sounds like you are complacent and surrounding yourself with negativity and then still want to complain online about it.
same
Oh yeah I've got a huge list of grievances. 

* Too expensive tuition.  
* Too little housing  
* Too much focus on academics. College is more than classes!   
* Too many EECS majors  
* Too many hippy hipster types.  
* Too many homeless  
* Too boring parties. The high schoolers throw better parties!    
* Too little status. You can't say you went to Berkeley as a badge of honor like Harvard or Columbia.  
* Too little school spirit. Look at this post!  
* Too much crime  
* Too little attractive girls  
* Too many cliques. I can't even count the number of 4 letter clubs   
* Too little Greek life  
* Too little actual population representation. California is 3/4 white but Berkeley is 3/4 minority.  
* Too large of a campus. > 1/2 the buildings are unused at any minute.  
* Too many know-it-all professors. Sometimes, students have better ideas!    

I need to add:  
* Downvotes instead of discourse

Yeah I do see that. I'm not perfect either and I think I should be clear; I am grateful for being able to go here, or at least try to be. This stems less from looking down at students who are here, because I honestly can't tell, and more from when I was hearing decisions. You see some of my most brilliant friends were rejected, while others who lied got in, even when they were caught. One guy failed to report classes he took in China, where he had a 1.0. When this was discovered UCLA and UCSD voided his application due to lying whereas Cal accepted him. Other cases people who constantly cheat get in as well as lie on their personal statement. I remember one where they lied about being raped in Afghanistan. If those people slip through the cracks even when they're caught, whereas more qualified students ,who didn't lie, didn't get in, that really makes me question how they accept apps, especially in comparison to other schools who seem to be more competent. I don't mean to say that half the people here are stupid or can't excel here, I think if your  app was good enough to not be thrown out immediately and you didn't  lie, and if you know yourself you can walk away with at least a 3.5. I'm don't seem to be alone because I'm pretty sure everyone agrees it could be better. It was more in response to imposter syndrome, and that getting in isn't as impressive as it seems. 

As for the last part, what? What is this mythical place you speak of? I have a hard time finding study partners, much less anyone to 'mentor' me, even in classes where I excel.People seem to want to just keep to their groups.

Overall, it is a bit ironic when you say ""wow you're a narcissist you should be more like me"", but honestly I think you're right. It did come off as condescending and when you hate something you are being  inherently condescending.
Fuck, how do I rectify with this whole 24/7 study/grind culture? Classes giving me barely a day to get over a shitty problem set or midterm before handing me a new one has really burned me out in all honesty. 
Agree with points 15-17 but Goff has 7 career games it isn't fair to call him a bust
Let me just make this clear; this is all personal. I wouldn't go up to someone considering going here and say ""don't"". I don't think this is the worst school in the world, but it is for me personally. I'd say to someone considering going, to check it out first, get a feeling of what the school is like and see if it fits them. I didn't really do that, or at least I didn't think it mattered. I feel like alot of people get accepted and go anyway just for the name (like me) and because few people get the opportunity you feel like an asshole for saying no. 

As for not giving a shit about students. Um ok? So the long wait times, poor counseling and poor school support is supposed to prepare you for the world? Here's the thing; your success is not entirely your own. Without someone supporting you, you'd probably be homeless. That is the face of having no support whatsoever. Everyone who has great grades got there because of other people supporting them as well as their own personal habits. I know because I've spent alot of my adult life on my own. You cannot get very far or make good decisions just on your own without any guidance. Believe me, when you have school, are days away from getting kicked out of your place and have to do it all alone, then you will know what being on your own is. And if that's the case, what's the point of the school? Why not just have no teachers at all and just give everyone textbooks to do their work? Why even have students? Just read it on your own time for free! 

Now, for the record, I grew up in the Bay Area. So for me it has a bunch of baggage. What I find fun and interesting isn't that well received here, so I've always felt out of place. I wanted to go somewhere new and fresh and far away, UCSD was that. Now I've been to UCSD and the area a bunch of times since my family moved there. I love it. The beach is perfect for me mentally, they actually take care of their homeless people, admin seems really top notch, housing is still expensive but it is far higher quality. Berkeley makes you pay 1500$ for a room in a run down moldy apartment owned by a convicted sex trafficker (look up Raj Properties and Laki Redi Balireddy). You could get your own new apartment in SD and have pets as well for the same price. For me it's not even a competition.
I guess. I mean these were all things I knew back in community college. The problem is that clubs themselves are exclusive; it's difficult to get that support group. You either are already a super expert or you can't do anything. At CC it was a bit easier to make friends. Now why should they be your age? I find most people at Cal to be uninteresting. Oh you grew up in a wealthy suburbia with a big Asian population too! Whoa how amazing! I found so many more people at community college to be far more interesting. Quite frankly most people here are very similar to each other. 

And to be fair, originally UCs were exclusively grad and post grad schools. So it makes sense.

I mean I have more grievances than that, but quite frankly this school just wasn't for me. I feel like alot of people just go for the name. I was more interested in how widespread it is.
California is 38% Non-Hispanic White.....
>hearing decisions.

It really is hard to know what will get in or not. They have to reject so many applications that it may be to some extent a lottery among the top epsilon percent based on how your application evaluator is feeling at the moment. What is true, is that the people here , or at least the ones I have met (in upper div physics classes) are not imposters - they are some of the brightest people I have ever met, and I have nothing but respect for them. Doubtlessly, there are people just as intelligent who didn't get in.

We live in an insane world if being raped in Afghanistan results in your admission to UCB, as great a misfortune as that may be, what does it have to do with academics? **Admittedly**, admissions are blackbox, and I have no idea if this is criterion desideratum. With the huge number of students, I am sure some lies, even relevant ones , have been missed.

>getting in isn't as impressive as it seems. 

Imposter syndrome is complex. UCB is the entry level gateway to the world elite, there are more barriers to cross, but if you cross this threshold, you have substantially made progress. This can feel remarkable and surreal, are you really here? Are you really a world elite? People in your classes may win noble prizes, become president, etc. It can also be making a mountain out of a mole hill - you haven't graduated yet, and 1 degree isn't per se enough to be world elite.  

I think lower division classes maybe larger.. I have never taken one. My upper div physics classes have ~25-50 people. People talk a bit, and form groups. 
from my personal experience, its best to split it up and do a little a day. like when I took my upper div math classes, I struggled with the material. but a 6 question PSET is so much easier if you just do 1 or 2 a day.
Heh, I can't tell you how many times people would be complaining about something university-wide but then end it with ""oh well, at least it's Berkeley."" There is definitely some portion of people going into a school blind just from the brand name - including me - that end up realizing it might not be a fit for them anyway. I guess we should have listened to our high school counselors more when they said to visit and research our options well.

Berkeley never worked out for me socially either. It was a huge let down and I took the anger out on the administration as a result, but the good news is that it prepared me for what the real world was like where nobody is forced to cater to your interests or success.

Honestly, looking back, I wish the number one thing I did focus on was nutrition. I probably wouldn't have been so grumpy/had issues with navigating the school if I wasn't eating shit every day. You know that poutine place? I was hitting that area up at least 4 times a week, and that's not including all the other junk I was getting for free at student events. A nutritional course on making sure you eat well should've been mandatory for freshman.
International students are always cliquey. Try hanging out with American students. They'll be more interesting and less samey.
There's no way that's true. That would mean Hispanics are the majority population by 5% more than whites.
Poutine four times a week? Holy hell. On an offside though, eating unhealthy food like that really aggravates that depression. I entered a vicious cycle with that shit
It was my first year of living independently, I didn't want to get into cooking and I obsessed over all this good food I could have. Frankly, the stuff available at Crossroads wasn't the best either. It didn't help that food was a great thing in a time of stress.

> 
> A broad majority of L&S CS majors don't end up taking EE 16A nor EE 16B before they are able to declare, since it would be useless to most of them if they weren't able to get into the major. Therefore, since CS 70 is part of our declaration requirement, we anyways end up taking it before EE 16A and EE 16B, which makes it useless. In regards to prepping us for other courses, a majority of CS upper division courses either don't require any knowledge of circuits or require a knowledge of circuits that runs tangential to the course material. This can be seen from the fact that 16a and 16b are very sparsely, if at all, listed as prerequisites to any CS upper division course.
> 
> 2) A basic amount of knowledge of circuits is essential to a proper CS education.
I disagree with this entirely. There definitely do exist fields within CS for which a knowledge of circuits would be useful but there also exists numerous fields in CS (esp. with industrial application) that require absolutely no knowledge of circuits. And if this is the case, it seems that imposing a requirement that ALL students must know a basic amount of knowledge on circuits would be unfair to those who have no need to use it in the future. This is the same point that I would make as to why CS 170 and CS 162 are not required for all CS majors, even though they are extremely useful in a large proportion of fields within CS.

> Hi, I will write a more detailed answer later but first will say that I encourage you to come and talk to me to understand this better. 16AB were designed to be fundamental to the needs of all of our students in preparation for a 40-year career going forward, and L&S CS students in particular. We in the faculty have a bit more experience than you do about both how fields are evolving intellectually as well as just how much things can change with time. As a student, you don't really understand the bigger picture, especially the scope of change and the need for a robust development of different ways of thinking. Which is to be expected --- otherwise, you wouldn't need the university and could just go and read books and do projects on your own to learn. The answer so far (I have to go to a meeting) is basically of the ""trust us"" variety, and there is a strong case that such trust is actually fundamental to the student/teacher relationship. Everything we say will always have a dimension of ""trust us"" to it, because you do not understand or appreciate what you cannot yet fathom. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, it's the unknown unknowns that get you.  One of our goals is to make you more ready for them.

> If I were to follow your logic, I would argue that R&C/Breadth/HSS/AC requirements should be entirely removed from all science and engineering majors as those would have no impact nor benefit on the career of a computer scientist/engineer.

## **OP's response to student's answer and Sahai's initial answer**

The OP wrote:

> OP here. I disagree with the first student response. Breadths make sense because all L&S majors are fundamentally part of a liberal arts school, which stresses a fundamental understanding of a variety of subjects that don't relate to our traditional technical curriculum. So that requirement makes sense because that's the fundamental teaching philosophy behind the entire school; this is why breadths reqs. vary between schools. On the other hand, EE 16a is a major requirement, which means it should (in principle) relate to our specific technical curriculum.
> 
> Prof. Sahai: I appreciate your quick response! I'd love to hear your more detailed answer and maybe follow up in person if necessary, but I just want to point out that my post doesn't come from a point of conceit but rather from a point of relative frustration. That is, I agree entirely that professors would have a much more thorough understanding of the fields and understand what is and isn't useful to teach us, but often times it may be frustrating from a student's perspective if we're told to learn something that seems tangential to everything else we learn when we don't have an understanding of the bigger picture in mind. I especially see this a lot with 16A since there are many CS majors (myself included) who find it frustrating that we have to learn about circuits. Maybe some of your detailed perspectives on this issue may resolve our concerns! Looking forward to hearing your response.

The 61ABC series is heavily weighted towards (1) with a little bit of (3) mixed in during 61A.  16AB bring more of (2) and (3) into the mix, and it is vital that this happen as early as possible in students' development so that their mental muscles are more balanced in their development. This is why we absolutely urge 16AB to be taken by freshmen. 
> 
> Within (2), there are many aspects to analog information processing. In 16A you see a little bit as well as how it connects via constraints to optimization-oriented thinking. However, in 16B the dynamic aspects also come into play. While today's deep neural networks tend to use circuits for information processing (circuits emulated by programs running SIMD cores for now, but more specialized cores in the future) in a way that doesn't involve time, there is every indication that biological neural networks do indeed invoke time dynamics in nontrivial ways. So it would be absolutely irresponsible of us to not give students some inclination of time-dynamic behavior of circuits as a part of their foundational training for a 40 year career. This is why the department wants everyone taking 16A and 16B.
> 
> Fundamentally, EECS has two pillars: information and computation. All students need grounding in both even if they may choose to specialize in one more than the other. But they need to start with mental balance to the extent possible so that they don't misunderstand informational issues as being computational nor vice-versa. You're going to have to learn and adapt. It's our job to give you the foundation so that you can do so.

## **Elad Alon's reply to OP**

 I think that Anant largely hit the points that I would have made, but I'd like to also offer to speak with anyone in person about why I believe the material in EE16A and EE16B are indeed fundamental to your education as a CS student.

> To follow up on one specific aspect that Anant hinted at however, if you look at where the major innovations/advancements have happened in the last decade (starting arbitrarily from e.g. the iPhons), almost all of them have involved optimization and co-design among multiple levels of the system stack (from applications and algorithms all the way down to the circuits and devices).  Even if you end up as a purely ""software"" engineer, our goal at Berkeley is to try train you to be one of the ninjas who has at least a basic understanding of how issues at layers both above and below where you work can not only influence what you are doing, but provide opportunities for optimization of the system as a whole.
> 
> Another point I'd like to make is that many of the skills you exercise in circuit design are actually essentially identical to skills you would exercise in software or system design as a whole (as well in linear algebra).  I can dive in to the details if you'd like, but debugging, modularity, modeling, and using structured methods to do design and even analysis are all common across the board.  As a final note, there are actually many mathematical concepts underlying circuits, and gaining intuition about those same concepts but with physical quantities you may not be as familiar with is a great way to make sure you really understand the math.

More importantly, there are a number of additional (in my opinion substabtial) issues with your proposal, one of the most important of which (again, in my opinion) is that this approach will explicitly de-emphasize that designing efficient systems involves optimizing (and hence understanding) across multiple (all) layers of hierarchy simultaneously, and that often times, things you do at one level can make your life dramatically simpler (or harder) at the others.  The silo'ed approach you are proposing is exactly what I have seen over and over in my career (both in academic and industrial contexts) lead people down highly sub-optimal approaches to solving the problems that faced them.  For almost all intents and purposes, this would go back to the 20/40 model we had before (although granted it would be a very different version of 20), which was very clearly not working (both overall and specifically in highlighting the above).

Making this intellectual link clear throughout all of the modules (in 16A and 16B) is something we are constantly striving to improve, but splitting the content up (as you proposed) in to separate courses certainly won't help with this.

While we are allowing L&S students moving forward (for now) to fullfil their requirements with Math 54 and 16B (mostly for reasons that I hope will be transient, as I'll explain below), that is not the path we recommend by any means, and is not something that would work in general without the existence of 16A.

This is by no means a done deal and we can't yet make any guarantees, but my hope is that this will address some of the practical issues that are driving some students to delay taking 16 (which again, I definitely don't recommend).

A student replied:

In fact, I think this will extend the integration to one more level, in the sense of understanding how the different electrical components work under the hood (in terms of how they move electrons and affect electromagnetic fields).

> Please come and talk with me about any concerns that you have about 16A. It is meant to be taken by freshmen in their first semester in parallel with 61A. That is firmly the intended audience and recommended scheduling by students, and the course is designed for that. Clearing the backlog of students during the transition who have not taken it as freshmen creates some degrees of mismatch here and there, but it is our goal that even those students should get a lot out of taking 16A. (I'll be honest, when I taught it, both me and my TAs got a lot out of it. And we all supposedly know all this stuff perfectly by comparison --- so it should reward contemplation for pretty much everyone.)

The goal is that the course should be fundamentally inclusive and that every single concept taught in the course should be clear, integrated, and obviously relevant. Just like students, we Profs will fall short of the high goals that we set for ourselves, but that doesn't mean that we stop trying. :-)

No, certainly not - this wasn't the way I learned things originally, and this isn't how things are taught in most other schools (at least not yet).  That's a pretty weak criteria though - as a student, I distinctly remember wondering to myself why in the world I was learning the things that I was (especially in my intro circuits class, but even well after that), and I perservered despite that.

Including linear algebra allows us to show with relatively little prior background just how powerful the tools and techniques that underly modern EE (and CS) really are in enabling real-world applications that students (particularly freshman) will not only recognize, but have a visceral feeling about/interest in.  I really can't take the credit for that particular realization BTW - it was really much more the product of Gireeja Ranade's and Anant's thinking than my own (at the time) - but having now worked this through (along with the two of them and many others), linear algebra really is the one conceptual area I can think of that finds substantial importance and use across pretty much the entire spectrum of EE endeavors (including the more physicsy side, as you mentioned).  As already mentioned, it is also something that can be taught to students coming out of high school (of course with appropriate math maturity) while simultaneously exposing them to the application (and hence making them feel ""empowered"").  
> 
> I certainly agree with you that an integrated approach to teaching physics 7B like material would be extremely worthwhile as well.  Physics 7B itself however requires more math background than what can be expected from incoming freshman, and so this is one of the reasons why we made the choice to partition things the way we did.  (Another reason for this is that for better or for worse, in general, students entering from high school tend to have less background in or opportunities to learn physics than they do math.) 
> 
> I'm now dipping into a much more highly speculative topic, but to follow up a bit further on your point about an integrated approach to Physics 7B, there have actually been some discussions amongst the faculty about creating a ""16C"" (naming along with everything else TBD) that could serve as an alternative option for Physics 7B.  This (currently hypothetical) course would more directly expose students to the applications/motivations for the 7B material, as well as more generally the ""physicy"" side of EECS.  This class could then also leverage the linear algebra (as well as of course circuits and basic sensor ideas) from 16A/B.  In case it wasn't obvious from how I started this paragraph, it isn't at all yet clear when or even if this will happen - the discussions are still highly preliminary.  Based on my experience from 16A/B, standing up a course like this will take (tens of) thousands of hours of work, and so it's not a task that anyone will be taking on lightly.  I do believe it's an exciting possibility however, and am doing what I can to help support this eventually happening (but again, absolutely no guarantees at all at this time).

Anant Sahai responded:

What material in 16B is not relevant to 120? At the moment, I think that the SVD and PCA-related material isn't likely to make an appearance in 120. Everything else can be built upon to different degrees depending on exactly how 120 realigns.

You need to take something that will take you from where you are, and improve your mathematical maturity. EE16A might help you in that direction (assuming you have already done the equivalents of Math 1A and 1B). As freshman-oriented courses, they are more gentle with their slope of mathematical difficulty.

They just have to train for longer and at a pace that will let their body adapt to the rising difficulty.)  Without talking to you, what you described sounds like someone who was stymied by the difficulty slope in 70 relative to your mathematical equivalent of athletic conditioning. Take EE16A and 16B first. Then the slope in 70 should be more accessible. There's no getting around working hard, but you have clearly shown that you are willing to do that.

You are welcome to continue to come to office hours and at least listen. The interactions among students, and between students and TA's may well be more fun and instructive now that the pressure is off. Choose ideas to really get and ensure you get them. Better to solidly have some than sketchily have many. It should be fun, even.

> Hey OP, really sorry this had to happen to you. As someone taking 70 right now I understand the dreadful ""shaky"" feeling about the material- I felt the same in the few weeks leading up to the midterm. I also sunk a lot of time into reading the notes and extra resources. However, when it came to the first two or three homeworks I was a mess- couldn't even get started on some problems, and the ones I could do I ended up getting completely wrong.
> 
> In your post you don't mention office hours, homework parties, or study groups so I'm not sure if you tried those at all. If not, my advice would be to lean on those heavily next time you take it. What I found helped the most was a large amount of time face-to-face with someone who knew the material well- may that be a TA in OH who was going through the notes with me or a friend in my study group who was working with me to construct a solution to a HW problem. This really benefited me because the other person was able to gauge my understanding real-time, help me understand the stuff I was missing, and correct any misconceptions that I had. It worked really well- I ended up getting +1 std dev on the midterm. IMO learning CS 70 is a dialogue- you learn by bouncing my thoughts and ideas off other people and listening to the responses.
> 
> I agree with Prof. Sahai on the problem of self-studying- reading the notes and doing the HW in a vacuum allowed me to form these misconceptions that went unchecked until I talked it over with someone else. Perhaps you can find resources this semester to help you prepare even though you're not in the class. I know there are clubs that offer tutoring for CS 70 (HKN comes to mind).

> I had a different issue than the student response. I did the homeworks and spent a lot of time on them, and was getting everything, or so I thought (scored high on the homeworks). But I spent so much time on the homeworks that I wasn't prepared for the midterm, as weird as that sounds. Though I really enjoyed the homeworks, I wish I had more time in the day to explore and work on hw style problems. But I have to now be realistic with how much time I actually have and I have to allocate it towards doing well on the test. After keeping up with hw I ended up not having much time to really review and practice the faster style of the midterm, i.e., less in-depth but more questions, and time limited. I tend to be more methodical and slow-thinking but enjoy solving hard problems. Fast-style test taking isn't my forte but I hope if I prepare more for that I can do better (I've done better on other exams that require that kind of style before, but never had weekly homeworks for those classes that required so much time -- I'm doing the homework option). 
> 
> I ended up doing close to the mean on the first midterm, which for me was a huge disappointment. I feel like you have to ""deeper"" on the homeworks, and for more specific scenarios than the midterm requires, so I wasn't ready for the midterm. The Bieber hw problem did boost me from doing even worse though, because it was similar to one of the midterm questions. I plan to spend more time doing old exams in prep. for the 2nd midterm, but would welcome any tips or advice from others who have taken the course, or especially from Professor Rao.

> The strategy on the midterms is to give more smaller problems. This is for a few reasons, first is that more questions increases the amount of data from which to ""measure"" a students knowledge and ability to work with the materials, another being that a ""large"" question like what you see on homework is problematic in that the piecing together of various concepts at that level is too much to expect on an exam and very noisy in that even for the same student on some days the insight comes quickly on another it just doesn't.      We do try to design them to capture the pieces of the
puzzles that you put together in the homeworks.  For example, testing the proof of Fermat's theorem may unwind into smaller questions about inverses, bijections, and reorganizing terms within a modular arithmetic framework.
> 
> The idea is that you worked with all of these pieces in your homework, so the time spent on your homework should be helpful for exam.   Still, the pacing for homework is truly very different than what we can test on the exam; read problems, digest, play with the ideas, be creative, etc.   Measuring student performance fairly is a difficult problem that Professors constantly struggle with.

> As for advice, perhaps the above context is useful.  In some sense, knowing the design principles around the exams may well help you better understand how to approach the exam.
> 
> Studying old exams is good.  Other instructor exams are great for content, but maybe to attune to my style use my exams perhaps later in your studying cycle.  Discussions have more smaller idea problems that are akin to exams. Study those. Finally, do at least understand the solutions to homeworks.  We do have difficult homeworks in that it is difficult to come up with the solutions, but often the solutions are short (annoyingly so, I would imagine) so do at least try to scan over and understand the solutions to the homeworks; I wouldn't try to come up with them again necessarily though as that would likely take a lot of time.","I think the issue a lot of the professors are missing is that this might just be this person's first exposure to real math.  At least in the US, high school math classes tend to be the cookbook approach to math: you learn how to use a bunch of tools to solve textbook problems (which are carefully formulated to be easily solvable by direct application of those tools, and tend to have minimal relevance to the real world).  There is minimal exposure to how and why these tools actually work, where they came from, etc.  In particular, proofs or rigorous mathematical derivations are almost never seen or performed; when they are done, even the teacher usually has trouble with it.  I've seen the same thing happen in a linear algebra class full of engineers.  This was literally the first time many of these people have been exposed to actual math, and it was disastrous for many of them, even though linear algebra is generally fairly easy and intuitive.

Satish is the man.
I think your point is what Sahai was trying to get at when he suggested the student take ee16a and 16b first. The math isn't particularly difficult so it's a gentle introduction to the realm beyond calc a/b. "

Heartbreaking. :(
This is absolutely heartbreaking and my wishes go out to her grieving family.

And I hope the fucking psycho is brought to justice not only for the sake of her but for the sake of all those who are waiting for the train to get back to their families.
May she Rest In Peace. Her death has angered me and made me feel defeated. People say a lot, but actions‚Ä¶ actions create change, good and bad. His unforgivable actions... And now as a community we must act.. for the better‚Ä¶ I believe Simon is not mentally ill. He is 61 and was once working not homeless. He planned to attack another woman and when he could not he decided to target Michelle. To me that is a clear murder. He should be charged for 1st degree murder. And what actual mentally ill person sticks out their tongue in cameras and dramatically states things like ‚Äúshe stole my jacket!!‚Äù Like no dude, you knew what you were doing, you are a murderer. He probably will be taken into a mental health housing and finally have an easier life, being fed still, having a bed and room, decency‚Ä¶ he won‚Äôt feel guilty.
Yesterday on my way home from Harlem I was on Atlantic Avenue station some black guy was harassing a Spanish guy. Basically pushing him around and trying to fight him. 2 minutes later I was his victim. He pushed me so hard that I was literally flying from one side to another. Thankfully no trains were coming. Only 2 other black men screamed at him and said what the f‚Ç¨%# are you doing? I screamed so loud out of fear but Gd was on my side that day. This needs to stop. ü•∫
nyc is very very dangerous
Where is blm?
Going to prison and having regular meals and a roof over his head is an upgrade for his life, not a punishment.
retributive 'justice' isn't justice at all. rather than focusing on how to best punish the guy, why don't we respond with conversations about how to aid and improve the mental health of people in poverty

systemic outcomes need systemic solutions
The guy is a lunatic that has a well documented mental history. He‚Äôs been in and out of but houses for 20 years he needs to be in a straight jacket
I‚Äôm getting downvoted but I grew up there and got robbed at gunpoint. A 19 year old girl working as a cashier at Burger King 3 blocks from my house got shot and killed by a guy for only $100. Go someplace that isn‚Äôt Times Square, you dumb tourists that are downvoting me
If there is clear cut evidence (subway cam?) of any murder, it should be automatic death sentence.
retributive justice is a vital component of any complete theory of justice, which should include deterrence, punishment, and rehabilitation. 

I agree that effective deterrence (e.g. social welfare programs) and effective rehabilitation (e.g. counseling and career training) need reinforcement, but to say that punishment is not a part of justice is silly. Obviously, our justice system is too focused on punishment (excepting the few crimes that go under-punished, like domestic violence and sexual abuse), but that doesn't mean it has no place.

We can do both
Can confirm NYC sucks but I can‚Äôt afford to move. Someone was killed in my building in 2019.
""We have been so trained to think of justice as retributive, justice as punitive, that it is very difficult to imagine a different kind of justice ‚Äî a justice that doesn‚Äôt consist of hurting the person who hurt you,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIn order to move in the direction of something like transformative justice or restorative justice, we have to consider all of the conditions that lead to the creation of harm‚Ä¶ rather than simply create a kind of cycle that leads from one form of violence to another‚Ä¶""

Angela Davis or berkeley physics student idk

we need to focus on the elimination of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Not the ""under-punishment"" of them. And spoilers, punishment isn't the road to get there. ib4 some dickhead characterizes the abolitionist perspective as ""just lettin the rapists and killers roam free""
is this dramatic irony
Pretty incredible that you don't make a philosophical argument, you just find an authority to re-state your theme. If I find a scholar to state my theme, would that convince you? Why not? Also you think majoring in physics means I haven't also read broadly? 

You also didn't address why you think punishment is necessary counter to the other aspects of justice (deterrence, rehabilitation, as aforementioned). Also, it seems that you think all punishment is necessarily violent. Do you think that the punishment of separation from society (even the non-US kind, where inmates are treated well, fed well, made reasonably comfortable) is ""violence""? Do you think exile is violence?

It seems obvious to me that punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation in some measure go together. Punishment can be a deterrent. Rehabilitation can be a deterrent. Punishment can be rehabilitating -- isolating someone from society and joys can lead to rehabilitating introspection.

Do you think there are no crimes that go uncommitted because of the possibility of punishment? I am aware of research regarding harsher mandatory minimums and non-correlation with crime rate increases and decreases, those are studies that deal with the magnitude of already harsh punishments and not with their complete presence or absence.

Do you think it's a zero-sum-game, where we cannot have tripartite justice that includes not only effective deterrence and rehabilitation but also punitive components? Why do you think that? From what moral or ethical philosophy do you derive that, and what are your givens?
you're confused; i don't owe you a philosophical argument or relief from your position in the first place. i'm not a resource for you to test the internal consistency of your existing beliefs, i'm a random asshole who likes calling out b.s. when i see it, but doesn't spend extra spoons arguing with strangers online than is necessary.

also you're having a semantic discussion about retribution, not a moral one. the bloodthirst and hate for the killer in the OP, all over these comments is what i'm taking aim at, and suggesting we trade it for productive conversations around prevention of the entire social interaction: which was a tragedy for *everyone* involved.

tldr we're not going to convince each other on this platform and should know better than to think this is worth any more energy. if u leave here thinking my lack of spoons somehow proves abolition wrong, it's unfortunate but genuinely not a weight i choose to carry.
""You're wrong""

""Why?""

""I don't owe you an explanation, you're just wrong""

Why ""call out BS"" if your goal isn't to convince people? So you can feel morally superior?
who knows. maybe a thought'll occur to you or some lurker when they're walking down the aisle at the book store and they see Davis or emergent strategy or something. maybe i like flinging seeds around and sometimes stuff eventually sprouts and sometimes it doesn't.

do you typically have productive discourse in this format? that hasn't been my experience, so i protect my spoons while still commenting when/what i feel like and don't overthink it beyond that.

just as a thought experiment, *if* I were right about abolition and critiques of retribution as a mechanism of justice panned out, would there be any issue with what i did here? consider the exchange a clear sign that, at a minimum, i believe what i'm saying. and that's good enough for me.
To answer your question about whether what you did is wrong, it depends how broadly I interpret the potential parallelisms.

""Act only according to that which you wish would become a universal law for all others in your situation""

So it hinges on how I think of ""this situation"". If no one ever explained their moral argument and instead only condemned each other, that would not be what I wish be a universal law. If I instead take on faith (as I do) that you're simply ""conserving your spoons"" for a more primed opportunity, then I think your action is just."
