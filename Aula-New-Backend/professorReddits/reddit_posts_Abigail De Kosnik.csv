THEATER 118AC- Abigail T De Kosnik,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1apekdj/theater_118ac_abigail_t_de_kosnik/,2024-02-12 15:32:58,"I plan to take theater in the summer, and it is an online class, so we also take the final exam online, right? Would be this one a lot of work? The midterm and final are multiple-choice or essay?","Best class Iâ€™ve taken at UCB!! Not a lot of work and itâ€™s fully asynchronous. Youâ€™ll get however much time and effort u put into it, highly recommend!
This class is really enjoyable to be honest. There is a lot of reading so be prepared for that. Professor Abigail is honestly so sweet and is very understanding. The work itself is really easy. One assignment per week. And the final is a creative project with an essay aspect to it. I personally made a song and wrote a short essay on how this song relates to certain topics covered in the class.
How much work was there? On average how many hours did you spend on assignments a week?
If you're open to it, would you also be able to share the syllabus for this course with me? I'm curious to know what the readings are!
Hi I'm thinking of taking this class. How much was the weekly workload? The course page says this  
""4 hours of instructor presentation of course materialsÂ per week, 16.5 hours of outside work hoursÂ per week, and 2 hours of the exchange of opinions or questions on course materialÂ per week.""

Is this accurate? Also was there a Midterm or a final? I'll also probably be working full time during the summer, do you think it's possible to take this class during that time?
Midterm and final are also done online, right?

If possible, can u share with me the syllabus?
Sorry I was grinding midterm studying ðŸ˜­ Just one weekly assignment! If u wanna engage with the lectures and readings itâ€™ll take longer (but I recommend it bc theyâ€™re great). Otherwise, you could probably skim readings and finish assignments within 1-2 hours. Depends on how quick u usually finish hw
Thereâ€™s 1 midterm for summer and 1 final and itâ€™s a lot of work in terms of learning. The hw itself is not a lot. But learning how to do the hw is a lot.
Thereâ€™s no midterm or final exam. The final was a creative project with an essay

Thanks
oh how are the midterm and final graded? Like 45% of people on berkeleytime get A+s in this class is that accurate
Definitely possible to do with a full time job! One final project, no midterm that I remember. How long it takes you to engage with the material is really up to you and can go anywhere from 1-5 hours probably. Highly recommend!
Thanks! Good to hear. It's definitely not 16 hours a week right haha, more like an hour or two of total work in a week?"
Taking 2 summer online classes (Theater 118AC and ESPM 50AC) while working a full-time internship doable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v9b2rz/taking_2_summer_online_classes_theater_118ac_and/,2022-06-10 09:04:14,"Hey guys! I decided to take two summer online breadth classes â€“ Theater 118 AC (session C with Abigail De Kosnik) and ESPM 50 AC (session D with Kenneth Worthy) â€“ while working a full-time internship (around 40 hours per week). Have any of you guys taken these classes, and is the workload manageable? Any advice is appreciated â€“ thanks!","espm 50AC w/ Ken is super doable, I took it two summers ago at the start of remote learning and his class was super cool. Discussions and atrendence at them were important but really the only required part when I took the class. There some weeks with a lot of readings, but you can probably get ahead super easily since he posts all the ones you gotta do at the start of the course. I'd recommend making a study guide w/ imp info from the readings. When I took it we had a few assignments, one paper about ur family, 2 of these like reading analyses thingys, & a final paper. We also had a midterm and final exam that were SUPER straightforward and super easy if you skim the readings. I'd recommend doing the readinfs bc they are super interesting. Also there were some films we had to watch, super easy. Also there were short quizzes for each lecture video and they were a piece of cake. You get a few dropped quizzes too. DM me if you want any more specifics!
Same
Havenâ€™t taken either of them â€” but if theyâ€™re breadth courses you could P/NP them pretty easily to get through. Looking at grade averages though these seem to have really high A rates so make sure to just finish the work assigned and you should be fine.
oh wow thank you so much!
thank you so much!"
