Math 1B: Pierre Simon or Francis Christ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cczmld/math_1b_pierre_simon_or_francis_christ/,2019-07-13 22:54:02,Which teacher is easier? Better teacher?,"Hey, I have only taken the class with Professor Christ but I would strongly recommend him if your major is going to have math down the line. Unlike in school where Math was seen more computationally (your experience may differ from mine) he spends time explaining why we're doing what we're doing. 

As far as grades go, it was pretty reasonable. I know students who did pretty badly in the first mid term but were still able to get an A/A- in the subject by working harder so you have some room for error."
Math 1A Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6n6mq3/math_1a_teachers/,2017-07-13 20:28:15,"Does anybody know if there is a large difference between the Math 1A teachers in regards to difficulty of class? I currently have Vivek Shende, and some of my friends have Pierre Simon. Any help would be appreciated as I still have a little time to switch around my schedule. ",
