"Free stuff on Berkeleyâ€™s streets: Blight and/or opportunity? For artist Jim Rosenau, while he too encourages responsible discarding, the appearance of free stuff on the streets is a thrilling treasure hunt. The annual exodus of Cal students brings a dumping of furniture and other sundry possessions.",http://www.berkeleyside.com/2016/05/23/free-stuff-on-berkeleys-streets-blight-andor-opportunity/,2016-05-23 21:28:35,,"This is my favorite time of the year. I love how dirty the streets here get, it's like a landfill and a gold mine at the Same time. Best pet is they don't clean it up for a while so there always stuff you can find and I don't have to walk more than twenty yards to find a decent place to sleep. I even found a onesie once, didn't fit right but who cares. I usually pick one mattress out but my best bud Harry likes to take as many as his cart can carry. He piles them sky high and wheels them over to people's park. He always ends up pissing on them so they last him about a week and then the clean up crew take them awaY. He gets angry when they take his trash away but forgets about it after a couple of beers."
