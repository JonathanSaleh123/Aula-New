Has anyone taken a course with Amm Quamruzzaman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vwl6uj/has_anyone_taken_a_course_with_amm_quamruzzaman/,2022-07-11 08:31:44,There aren’t any reviews on Rate My Professor so I opted to Reddit to help me out. I’m interested in taking ISF 100A- Intro to Social Theory & Cultural Analysis with this professor. Any feedback on this Professor would be extremely helpful!,"Does anyone know how hard the class is? Like for Isf 100A? I want to take him but I have a heavy load and I fear his class might be on the heavy side. Like what is the typical course load
He’s adorable. Took his stata class last semester, got an A. I think the other class will be even more interesting.
Omg LOVE him! He’s a wonderful professor, really cares about his students. He really wants you to succeed and you’ll definitely learn a lot if you go to his office hours (he’ll go out of his way to offer interesting reading materials, etc). Depending on the subject, his lectures could be a little dull, but I think just talking to him outside of class/in office hours/via email really helps
Terrific, you should enjoy him.
Wonderful. Thank you so much for commenting! Are there any specifics about his teaching style that are worth knowing?
Amazing! Thank you so much ☺️
Thank you so much!"
