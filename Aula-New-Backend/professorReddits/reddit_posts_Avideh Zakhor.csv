EE20 advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2fuhi3/ee20_advice/,2014-09-08 14:37:58,"I was planning on taking ee20 next semester along with ee40 but I found out Babak isn't gonna be teaching it. Would it be too late to try and take it this semester? Anyone know how good of a teacher avideh zakhor is? I really wanted to try Babak out.

- Also I am taking Math54, 7b, and 61c. Is it doable?","Zakhor teaches 225B, which is image processing a.k.a. EE 20 in two dimensions. I know a handful of undergrads who work in her lab and took her course last semester -- you should ask about her teaching on the EECS facebook group and they'll probably chime in.

It's probably not too late to switch into EE 20 if you're familiar with complex numbers & stuff (Babak spends the first few weeks reviewing this material, so you won't have missed anything), but I would not recommend this unless you've taken four tech courses in the past and succeeded. Math 54, Physics 7B, CS 61C, and EE 20 is a pretty rough schedule.

If you feel like you're going to hate yourself unless you take EE 20 with Babak, though, you could drop Physics 7B in favor of EE 20. Physics 7B is essentially useless to all EECS majors other than those who want to work in device physics & such, which I'm assuming you're not one of. Actually, it would be helpful to know what year you are and what your intended concentration is.
Unless you have a really solid math and physics background, I'd keep your current schedule as it is. I don't know anything about Zakhor, but Babak is a legit professor. "
Why won't the EE 120 release final exam grades?,https://i.redd.it/puqpxhyv2k681.png,2021-12-19 12:05:43,,"Bruh this class repeatedly has had issues this semester with the staff
I’ve always found this annoying as fuck but it’s common in other departments (like stats.) all the profs I’ve had who did this offered to show you your final the next semester if you visited their office hours.
Because they don’t want do deal with their regrade obligations. Last semester I got A- and no final grades. Email the TA for final grades then found a regrade, got an A.
who’s the prof this semester?
All of my classes so far have released final grades, so I’m stumped as to what the purpose of not posting them is.
unprofessional, entitled, and condescending…
EE dept has gone to shit
I don’t understand. For a lot of my classes, I don’t know what I received on my final. Even at cc, most profs there didn’t post the final grades. It’s common to receive what grade you got on your final??
Oh for fucks sake...

Escalate this to the Prof, and then the department. It is practically unacceptable to not give students access to the exam grades on gradescope, even if you don't allow regrade requests.

Classes (in another university) were pulling this crap when I was an undergrad X years ago; I thought with the digitization of exams and exam submissions this crap was gone.

You are entitled to audit and contest every part of your grade, even if it is for 24hrs. The grades are due on Dec. 22, so if the regrades were open TONIGHT and closed tomorrow at midnight the staff would still have TWO FULL DAYS to enter the grades into Calcentral.

Say all of this to your prof, and if he does not respond favorably, immediately escalate this to the department. When this happens, there is something fucky going on in the background (bad grading, bad exam questions).
yeah this confirms it, I'm never taking an EE class here again, 16b is it for me
this is common for many courses, stat 134 is particularly brutal on this, along with other examples such as Sethian's Math 53.

I was really pissed when I saw these too, but there was literally nothing I could do so I decided to just accept it
This is quite common in EE grad courses (among the 5 I’ve taken). Extra care is taken to make sure there aren’t any errors in grading. It is however the first time I’m seeing an undergrad course do this in the EECS department (some math classes I took didn’t allow regrade requests). People seem freaked out that this is something that’s never happened, but I’m also fairly sure that people freaking out have never taken a grad course in EECS
Scores got released boys! (and girls)
Dude I’m in this class as well, scratching my head, really don’t understand why the situation is so needlessly complicated ...
Question; how do re-grades work?

I submitted an essay that was upcoming only to find out that the deadline had been extended AFTER my submission thus effectively making me operate on a timeline shorter than my peers. Is that something that might factor in a re-grade? 

I don’t think I necessarily bombed the paper but I was curious what a regrade entails.
y’all really want the GSIs to be working through the break huh? haha
PH 142 is doing the same thing.
This policy of ""you can't challenge your final exam grade"" or ""you are not entitled to share the exam with future years"" is just rooted in the years since before we had Gradescope.

All exams for all classes I've taught ended up on Gradescope. There is no reason to not show the exams.
Avideh Zakhor
Condescending, not really. It feels like the TA was forced to post this by the professor. At the end of the day complaints about things like this are about the professor.
Literally in every class at Berkeley I have taken so far, I got to see my final exams/paper and my final exam grade. I even got to request regrades.
Yes, I have gotten points back from several regrade requests on exams.
Yes. Especially because a lot of exams are hand graded, it’s always possible someone made a mistake which could be penalizing you for no reason
I had two classes at cc like that. I just knew the overall grade for those classes.
It's really dependant on the Professor and has nothing to do with the EE department. This is just unlucky. Every professor in the EE department I had so far has been nothing but great. I had an offer to teach EE120 this semester from this professor too and I'm glad I declined it lol. 

Also I know the head TA personally and hes really trying. Sometimes theres only so much 1 person can do since the class is underfunded with 2 TAs and 3 readers.
Oh darn. That TA on this post scared me.
No. A regrade is only for an instructor mistake.
The condescending part comes from an earlier post about homework drops or something.
I guarantee you this is the best GSI in the class, and likely acted without prior authorization from the prof.
yeah it’s so weird why the professors do this. what exactly are they going to gain from withholding your scores on the final
You’re in the minority then, most stats/math classes I have taken have not released final exam scores
Yeah I know ee120 TAs but I’ve just had too many bad experiences to justify it, i doubt the underfunded TAs/readers will change next semester and I have internal connections that tell me it will likely be much worse.

Everyone always says EE classes being shitty is because of professors but i actually liked Sahai's lectures for one but still didn't like 16b overall and i feel like 127 would've been bad even without laurent just bcuz of how little the course staff cared
Got it. Thanks.
Not to mention the graders make mistakes some time. Everyone is human, but students should at least get the right to fix those mistakes
I think it's mostly lazy, not malicious. Gradescope makes it really easy to return exams and scores, but if your course staff isn't on that flow (which math/physics upper divs I took rarely were, and only around half of EE upper divs) it's a non-trivial amount of work to set up a new delivery pipeline.

But from what I've seen coming out of this course this term...
Can you list the actual classes you are talking about here?

All lower divs I've taught in the math dept except 1 have allowed regrades, and all showed you your final exam on GS.
Math 53 with Stankova

Math 54 with Lin

Stat 150 with Kolesnik (remote offering)

Stat 134 and Stat 135 with Lucas (saw score, but could not submit regrade)
Math 53 with Sethian, Stat 134 also has done this, I don't think it's uncommon
stankova released exams and gave a regrade window for math 110 this semester, so she might have changed her policy.
I got my final exam grade in 53 with stankova. Was this spring 2021?
You should bitch about it every semester until it becomes uncommon. There are no good reasons to not allow exams to be regraded if the departments already use Gradescope. And if they don't use Gradescope, they should, at least in STEM.
No it was Spring 2018 lol
To be honest I never liked regrades, from the staff perspective it really only seems to reduce the motivation to grade properly the first time around… of course its better than the option of shite grading and no regrades but students acting like they have a right to submit regrade requests is ridiculous
bruh I've tried. you know waht i get back? No response: I get nothing. I don't even know who to talk to, I'm too tired of the classes that pull that shit anyways. At that point its just not profitable or worth for me to keep trying to talk to higher ups, i just want to enjoy my break and see my family
I am obviously on the other side of the barricade here (not a student).

Whether students will get a regrade or not, generally all the graders I know (including myself) spend between 15 and 20 seconds per question on Gradescope. I'd like to think my accuracy is pretty high and I still make mistakes.

There is no incentive or safeguards for the course staff to grade ""properly"" the first time either, and recognizing that is the first step to recognizing why the students should have the right to challenge grades on the final exam.
I emailed the professor yesterday and so far got no response.
I’ve been a grader too, the incentive to grade properly is that the burden of figuring out what grade a student earned should never fall on the actual student. Obviously we aren’t perfect, and regrades as a safeguard are probably a good thing on net, but to act like it is shambolic that some professors choose not to allow them is ridiculous."
