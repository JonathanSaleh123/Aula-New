Consulting clubs at Cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14oy5ii/consulting_clubs_at_cal/,2023-07-02 13:21:40,"What are these consulting clubs? Like they mention they have clients like Tesla, Samsung, Aston Martin, Airbnb, door dash. What do these clubs do for these companies what their employees can't. I know some people from consulting clubs who do don't do  anything during the semester but when I see their resume, it's loaded with these big companies because of some consulting thing.

What is their selection process like and is it worth to get in?

Also one of my friends told me that they do not take in transfer students. Is there a reason behind that?","They provide them with under-compensated worker drones and potential future fresh blood to be exploited in junior positions post-graduation.

The most useful thing they could offer are the friendships and networks built. I've noticed that various clubs on campus compete for people's free time, so it can sometimes be challenging to make strong friendships outside of these kind of circles. 
Whether this is worth it or not also depends on your field of study and goals.

Another perk is that for applicants who are associated with your campus consulting club, you can get paired 1-1 with an alumni at the consulting firm for personalized coaching before your interviews. You’ll be part of a summer buddy system where we give you tailored advice at the different stages of the recruitment process and it goes a long way in your odds of getting an offer.
But what kind of consulting they give to companies? Like would companies really make decisions based on what they say?
In my experience, clients generally hire these kinds of clubs to do research/strategy in one of their areas of interest for a fresh perspective, or to work on a project that's peripheral to their main goals but still worth putting time and resources into."

I am wondering if anyone can suggest a decent gym in the area I can do some drop-in workouts at? I don’t mind paying a drop-in fee but ideally it would be something open early in the morning.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",

### Life Story:
(excerpts taken from this Washington Post article, linked [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/beverly-cleary-on-turning-100-kids-today-dont-have-the-freedom-i-had/2016/04/02/7a63e92c-e6d4-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.90d8da85d179).)

Beverly Cleary doesn’t really want to talk about turning 100. “Go ahead and fuss,” she says of the big day, April 12. “Everyone else is.”

Across the country, people are delving into Cleary nostalgia, with celebrations and new editions of her books with introductions by the likes of Amy Poehler and Judy Blume. Kids and adults are being asked to “Drop Everything and Read” to commemorate Cleary’s contribution to children’s literature.

But the beloved children’s author has something far more low-key in mind for herself: a celebratory slice of carrot cake, she says, “because I like it.”

Cleary is as feisty and direct as her famously spirited character Ramona Quimby — an observation that she hears often and doesn’t care for. “I thought like Ramona,” she says in a phone interview, “but I was a very well-behaved little girl.”

Today, Cleary lives a quiet, well-behaved life in a retirement home in Northern California. She gets up at 7:30 a.m. and spends the day reading the newspaper and books (on her night stand when we talked in mid-March: Alexandra Fuller’s “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight”) and doing crossword puzzles. She watches “Doc Martin” and CNN and enjoys visits with her family. She doesn’t have a computer, and though she enjoys writing letters, she notes dryly that “when you get to be 99, there aren’t many people to write letters to.”

Cleary’s last book was “Ramona’s World,” published in 1999. Her plucky heroine remains frozen at age 9; her sister, Beezus, is 14 and just entering high school. Who knows what Ramona might have been like when she hit puberty. Cleary, for one, is happy to leave her before that nightmare. “I think writers need to know when to retire,” she says.

Yet Cleary’s books live on. In January, HarperCollins published new editions of three of her most popular works: “Henry Huggins,” “Ramona Quimby, Age 8” and “The Mouse and the Motorcycle,” with introductions by Blume, Poehler and Kate DiCamillo, respectively. There are more than 40 Cleary titles in print, and you can even watch Selena Gomez and Joey King play her two most famous characters in the 2010 movie “Beezus and Ramona.”

Cleary has won a National Book Award, a Newbery Medal and a National Medal of Art from the National Endowment of the Arts, among other accolades. In 2000, the Library of Congress gave her a Living Legend Award.

Yet she wears her literary stardom lightly. “I’m just lucky,” she says. Throwing zingers — “People tell me I don’t look a day over 80”; “Don’t expect me to analyze my books!” — she’s both modest and outspoken.

Perhaps these qualities are a product of her upbringing. Born Beverly Bunn in rural Oregon, she spent much of her early life doing farm work. When her family moved to Portland, she says, “city life was a shock.”

During the Depression, Cleary attended Chaffey Junior College in Ontario, Calif., where tuition was free. To help pay for the rest of her education, at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Washington, she worked a variety of jobs — including as a seamstress and a chambermaid.

She struggled through her classes with poor eyesight; her mother denied her money for glasses because she feared it would spoil her daughter’s appearance. Eventually, her mother relented — to no ill effect on Beverly’s love life. In 1940, she eloped, marrying her longtime sweetheart Clarence Cleary, who died in 2004.

Cleary’s first book, “Henry Huggins,” was published in 1950. Based loosely on a story she had overheard while working at a military hospital library, the book (originally titled “Spareribs and Henry”) came slowly. And it was, at first, rejected by her publisher. As Cleary reworked it, she added Beezus and Ramona — the latter a name she heard being called out by a neighbor — to the mix.

Her own children — twins Marianne and Malcolm — born five years later, inspired the book “Mitch and Amy” and even helped shape that story.

“My son pointed out that you cannot ride a bike with a banana in your hip pocket,” she says. “So I did take that out. I didn’t want my character to have a squashed banana in his pocket.”

As she approaches 100, Cleary still talks about her characters as if they are friends. Even if she doesn’t want to be compared to Ramona, she confesses that the spitfire is her favorite. The charming and better-behaved Ellen Tebbits is a close second. She would have both girls over to dinner, she says, “but not at the same time.”

Ramona, she says, has to some degree been misunderstood. It’s not that she’s naughty, Cleary says, it’s that “things just didn’t work out the way she thought they should.” But for her creator, things pretty much have.

“I live in a very pleasant place with a very nice room that looks out on trees and rabbits and birds,” she says. She has her books, her newspaper, her family and her memories. Bring on the carrot cake.","There’s also the residence hall named after her with a picture of her in the lobby (also happens to be a fabulous place to live too!). Thanks for this series, pretty cool to hear these stories and keep it up
I loved reading her books when I was in elementary. Didn't know she was an alum, that's awesome!
*Ramona the Pest* was my first completed chapter book as I was learning English. 
I love Clearly. Her books were the shit."

Tim Martin: Berkeley and other universities have abandoned the principles of free expression and debate. They're churning out students incapable of applying reason or critical thinking to any issue. If it keeps up they'll find the doors of their schools locked. Stop higher indoctrination: Defund Cal,http://www.times-standard.com/opinion/20170325/stop-higher-indoctrination-defund-cal,2017-03-25 22:40:36,,">It wasn’t the first time Berkeley students attempted to quell free speech on campus. When UC Chancellor Nicholas Dirks was scheduled to have a public discussion about the value of higher education, the event was shut down by students chanting and shouting over him. The protesters stated that he wasn’t doing enough to help black students. Dirks later resigned.

Holy non sequitur batman!
It's very funny that these guys chime ""Defund Cal"". As if the fund money goes to us. Do they even know that the fund money goes to professors and their research who have no connection to whatever political thing going around campus.
If you want a vision of the future, imagine a trumpkin gaslighting /r/berkeley about the definition of ""free speech"" forever.

Hate speech, nice speech, it's all free speech.
With twisted logic like that, I bet he is a Drumpf supporter. Hate speech is not free speech."
