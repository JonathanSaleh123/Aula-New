Whats EE127 w Laurent El-Ghaoui like?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jhmnbs/whats_ee127_w_laurent_elghaoui_like/,2020-10-24 20:31:30,,"He pretty much exclusively uses slides with lots of math on them during lecture, which if you're familiar with the concepts (e.g. SVD/PCA, LP/QP/QCQP/SOCP, etc.) is fine since you can gloss over the details. But, if you're seeing it for the first time it can be confusing since there's not enough time to fully digest the math behind what he's saying."
Thoughts on EE 127 with Laurent el Ghaoui or EE 120 with Chunlei Liu?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k0npk1/thoughts_on_ee_127_with_laurent_el_ghaoui_or_ee/,2020-11-24 23:38:45,I can't find much about Ghaoui and Liu has really low ratings on ratemyprofessor. What are yall's thoughts?,"If if its anything like the textbook 127 uses (which  el Ghaoui wrote), I don't expect it to be good but it won't be terrible. It cant possibly be worse than Venkat that I'm going through right now so, you'll be fine.

Chunlei is top 5 worst professors I've had in Cal. I had him when I took 16A and he made 0 sense teaching linear algebra. At least I had some Math 54 knowledge so I didn't need to listen to lectures but a lot of my friends got fucked. Also, 120's content usually doesn't vary year to year but you can take the class, skip lecture, and just watch and learn it when Babak taught it (when I took it). Absolutely amazing professor, best professor I've ever had at Cal and 120 was the best class I've taken at Cal as well.

"Does anyone have a pdf version of the book ""Optimizing Models"" by Laurent El Ghaoui?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8lry4z/does_anyone_have_a_pdf_version_of_the_book/,2018-05-24 04:38:31,"Asking here since its the textbook for EE127.
Or is the live book version enough to prep for the class?","post on one of the facebook groups - 'Textbooks' or 'Free and for Sale' for example
The book is called ""Optimization Models"" it's by Calafiore and El Ghaoui.
Have you checked libgen
Ya, I’ve looked online on quite a lot of websites but haven’t been able to find it. That’s why I asked here. "
EECS 127 - El Ghaoui textbook useful?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/x2518d/eecs_127_el_ghaoui_textbook_useful/,2022-08-30 22:14:58,"Currently taking 127 w/Ranade. I feel that my linear algebra is a bit shaky, and was wondering if the textbook is a better investment of time than just straight up reviewing math 54's textbook + spamming office hours + going through the textbook if I absolutely need another perspective. 

Thanks!","Get the Stanford book by Boyd, its much much better.
same situation, i’m finding the live book of the other textbook to be a little bare bones so far
I wonder what fish think of us"
How do I deal with a professor at Berkeley who was bullying me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e5u76c/how_do_i_deal_with_a_professor_at_berkeley_who/,2019-12-03 21:03:54,"How do I deal with a professor at Berkeley who was bullying me?

How did he bully you?
Talk to your academic advisor, and consider talking to the Chancellor if that doesn't work. It's her school, at the end of the day she's responsible (morally, if not legally) for the actions of the professors here.

**Don't go anywhere without proof**, though. If it comes off as you just don't like the guy, they'll chalk it up to immaturity.
Can confirm this prof is an asshole

EECS 126 + EECS 127 + CS 189?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mzc3ww/eecs_126_eecs_127_cs_189/,2021-04-26 17:21:57,"I already know this schedule is difficult, but I wanted to know how difficult it'd be. The professors are 126 - parekh, 127 - el ghaoui, 189 - malik & listgarten.

Also is 189 a pset class (with hard theoretical problems) or a project heavy class?","i took 127 162 188 and math 128a this sem and its not that bad, but as the others are saying, i think that hinges on the fact that i love math. 189 and 127 are in the same field, so they should support each other in many ways, at least with the learning curve in terms of proof styling and methods. id say go for it if you have experience with upper div math/cs theoretical classes (like zyonsis said), but maybe drop either 127 or 189 if you dont. 127 doesn't take too much time since psets are due every 2 weeks, and you can do them in a day if you really grind, and theres nothing else. midterm + final + 6 psets + 2 optional and ungraded quizzes and you're golden.

sidenote, 127 is one of my favorite classes of all time, partly because the content is the perfect balance of theoretical cs and pure math, plus super interesting applications. it feels like we get a very 50000 ft view/abstract view, but also dive into the nitty gritty details. also i love el ghaoui, goat prof imo, so if you like math and genuinely enjoy cs/algos you'll v likely love it too
Sahai, Malik, and Listgarten's iteration is a LONG-ASS PSet heavy class

I don't recommend it unless you are good with all 3
Might as well throw in 162, 161 and 186 in there too while ur at it
If you’re among the top 10 scorers in CS 70 then it’s doable
if you're decently good at math, I'd say it's a pretty doable schedule. 126/127 are a lot of math but not that much work actually. the classes also all complement each other well.

I don't know how much harder the fall version of 189 is than shewchuck's. I took 188/127/189 (shewchuck) a few semesters ago and it was easier than I expected, I definitely could've swapped out 188 with 126.
Oh, I had this exact schedule last semester + 162. I failed all of them.
If you've had experience with and done well in upper div math or theoretical CS classes (like 170 series) then it's doable - lots of people (especially math undergrads) take 3 or more theory/pset classes per semester. Otherwise you're asking for a load of pain.
How’s math 128a? I’m interested in taking it but I’m not 100% set yet. I heard it’s kinda like calculus but you write code the approximate solutions
Sahai isn’t teaching

Were Spring 2020 EECS127 lectures recorded somewhere?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mvckww/were_spring_2020_eecs127_lectures_recorded/,2021-04-21 03:16:53,"Likely won't get time to take this class at Cal, but am going through the course materials. El Ghaoui's lectures are useless, so I was wondering if Ranade's lectures from Spring 2020 were recorded as I hear good things.","Only some of them were. They should be on the EECS 127 spring 2020 website. Btw are El Ghaouis lectures posted anywhere? I’m curious to see what they’re like
Following
If you know anyone in the class they're on bcourses media gallery (I dropped). They're good if you already know the material because he skims through it and points out the applications. The issue is if you need a refresher or are seeing it for the first time it's essentially useless."
Should I take EE 127 or CS 170?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l3q2ov/should_i_take_ee_127_or_cs_170/,2021-01-23 18:03:51,"EE 127 is with Professor El Ghaoui this semester and 170 is with Professor Chiesa and Demmel. I want to take only one of these two as my schedule would be too much otherwise. I got a B+ in EE16A and P in EE16B (would have been B- or lower), so my linear algebra isn't that strong for 127. But I also got a B+ in 70 which is needed for 170 so I'm weak there too, welp. I wanna compare the two based on a) workload per week, since my schedule is pretty busy, b) difficulty of content and exams, and c) curve/ability to get an A. Could you guys help me break it down?","I recommend Chiesa. He is a god tier lecturer, and you will learn a lot. I’m currently in the class right now.
170 is hands down my fave class in Berkeley! I haven’t taken 127 yet, and I’m definitely more of a software person than data science (I’ve taken classes for both). I think if you can only take one, try 127 because it is more relevant, but I think 170 is easier if you concerned about struggling. Nothing from 70 really carries over, just the intuition which you can develop in the class itself. Hope this helps!
Took both and found their difficulty to be more or less equal. Comes down to what's more useful to you. If you want to do any ML/DS research 127 is a must. 170 isn't necessary for interviews, it's probably less work, less stress, and more useful to just leetcode
these 2 are widely different in terms of material. What interests you? If you're not good at math and are not interested in it 127 would be a poor option. 170 is good for interviews so I would go off that since 127 is much harder than 16B
I took both in the same semester and got a C for EE127 and an A- for CS170. EE127 is a lot of complex math (linear algebra x.x) and was really challenging for me. CS170 felt a lot more intuitive and became really useful in my SWE career.

(whatever I'm saying from here on is based on Fall '19)workload wise, I would say on paper EE127 seems to have lesser work (since it doesn't have a project), but I spent so long on all the homework. The slides are less useful, hence I read a lot of the textbook which was way more time-consuming. CS170's project didn't take much time, and the readings they provided were not as long. CS170 has great materials and great TA support too.

127 is definitely more difficult. I'm really weak at math so I completely flopped at 127, I would say its a lot harder to get an A. It's actually a miracle I got a C because if you ask me to tell you what I learnt from 127, I can't even give you an answer. A few years after I took these courses I realized that data science isn't really for me, so I'm completely biased. Take my opinions with a pinch of salt!
In the long run I want to have a career in data science, or maybe do some light research in the field. Which is why I think 127 would be beneficial, but of course algorithms is important across the board.
Sorry I have taken neither of these classes and also debating whether to take either one of them next semester, but isn't CS 170 also very math heavy? I have not touched linear algebra in quite a while and just recently took CS 70 in Spring and 61B in Summer 2022 so I'm leaning more toward CS 170.
What other upper div classes were useful for your swe career?
You don’t need that class to be a data scientist. You need to be good at linear algebra. While ee 127 can be a good class to practice your linear algebra skills, you will rarely encounter the materials in industry.
If 16B was hard 127 will be killer since last semesters 16b math was very basic in the grand scheme of linear algebra. You can still do data science just not the mathematical side so I would try to go more in software since that’s where you lose the need of math
170 is not math heavy it’s more about algorithmic thinking
Well idk if one should prescribe another’s career path over a single class’ grade but yes 127 assumes you have mastery of 16B/110.
What do you think about the average workload for CS 170 if compared to CS 70? FYI, it took me 20 hours to finish CS 70 hw without office hours help. With OH, it took roughly 8-10 hrs.
I found 170 significantly easier than 70 and extremely over hyped and not all that useful for industry or non theory research. It’s not all that difficult but it’s one of those classes where if you get stuck it takes forever to get unstuck"
