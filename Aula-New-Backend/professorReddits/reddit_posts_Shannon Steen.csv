Theater 25ac experiences?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ihbmhv/theater_25ac_experiences/,2020-08-26 18:11:25,"I'm currently in Theater 25AC with Shannon Steen but may get into ESPM 50AC from the waitlist.

Rate my professor doesn't have too much info on her and this class, does anyone have any experience or knowledge about this class? Is the reading a lot? Are the exams difficult?

It seems like ESPM 50AC is easy, but gives a lot of busywork, so I'm not sure which class I should choose if I get into 50ac.",
