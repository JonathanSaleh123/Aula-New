What happened to me after I was ticketed for running a red on my bicycle at Center and Shattuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2sb3az/what_happened_to_me_after_i_was_ticketed_for/,2015-01-13 10:47:22,"I'm the guy that threatened the foundation of all that is good in Berkeley when I complained about the cost of my running-a-red-light on my bike ticket and argued that cars and bikes should be ticketed differently.  You can see in the [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2h8r3q/center_and_shattuck_jaywalking_and_redlight_on/) the consensus was that I am an asshole and deserved to be ticketed more.

I thought I would let you guys know what happened

**tl:dr: I went to traffic court, cop never showed.  The case was dropped and I don't have to pay the $490 ticket.**

Anyway, it's clear that the majority of the people on this sub absolutely hate bicyclists.  However, one day you may also be ticketed so this post may be helpful.

9/23/14: I was ticketed during a sting (6 cops waiting, 3 (possibly 4) others got jay walking tickets during the same crossing).  They tell me I must call the clerk 30 to 60 days after I get my ticket.

11/15/14: I receive a courtesy notice from the county that my **arraignment** needs to happen by 1/05/15.  I call the number on my ticket to confirm this.

For the arraignment you have to go to 'walk-in' court.  You bring the courtesy notice and they check you in, you wait for awhile and eventually your turn comes up and you enter a plea: 'Guilty,' 'Not-Guilty', or 'No Contest.'  If you plead ""No Contest"" or ""Guilty"" you have to pay the fine.  You have the option to set up payment plans, pay all at once, or do community service (you get $10/hour, meaning a $490 ticket would require 49 hours of work that needs to be completed in 5 months).  The judge indicated that is difficult to get extended periods of community service done at a time, so you'll likely have to chip away at it in 3-6 hour per day increments.

12/14/14:  I got to walk-in court and enter a ""Not Guilty"" plea.  My goal was to go to the real trial and ask the cop to reduce the fine to that of jay walking since that was more equivalent to what actually happened (In other words, my actions were clearly 'equivalently dangerous' as the 3 others who got the jay walking tickets as we all looked, saw no cars, and proceeded to cross).  The assign me a court day of 1/17/15.

12/28/14: I get mail saying my court date is rescheduled to 1/9/15.   

1/9/15: I show up to my traffic court and of the ~20-25 people there only 4 cops show up and about 16-21 get off with nothing due the fact the ""there is no complaining witness"" (i.e. the cop).

If you can afford the time, I recommend pleading ""not guilty"" at the arraignment and hoping that your cop doesn't show up at the actual trial.  My single experience seems to indicate that cops only show up about 25% of the time.

Hope this helps someone deal with their traffic ticket(s)!

Feel free to add anything about your experience(s) and/or ask any questions

EDIT: **If anyone would care to discuss this in person, I would love to.  This forum makes people become internet warriors and cowards. This is an issue that really is important to both the students and residents of Berkeley.  Every time I try to present facts about what happened to anyone who disagrees with me, I just get called and asshole who as no idea what they are talking about. It's absurd unwilling people are to consider facts and understand the situation better.**

Same technique works for any traffic ticket.

Congrats on saving yourself nearly $500. I guess you could get a jay-walking ticket by walking your bike through red lights instead of riding through them next time, but I guess you might as well keep breaking the law vehicularly since you have a 75% chance of getting out of the ticket.

Or... obey traffic laws? I dunno. Whatever your floats your boat (apparently innocent blood, amirite?).

I got a ticket once but paid it since I broke the traffic laws. I could have argued with myself about how I wasn't really endangering anyone in that specific moment, tried to fight the ticket like you did, but I felt guilty and figured it was a good lesson in public safety. I've never received another ticket. And I still always get to where I need to be on time. Amazing shit.
Holy shit the comments in that original post are hateful. Sorry to see there's such vitriol in this sub but glad to see you got out of the ticket. Would have been points on your license too which is exceptionally silly considering you weren't driving. Thanks for sharing your experience regardless of the rude behavior from the earlier post. You might have gotten a better response in [r/BAbike](http://www.reddit.com/r/babike).

For what it's worth, a similar thing happened to me in Oakland a while back and I had a similar experience. There were five cases tried during my hearing, only one cop showed up, and everyone got off. (Even the case where the ticketing officer showed up and testified against the ticketee, the 'complaining witness' in that case was a bus driver who didn't show up, so that case was thrown out too.) 
> Every time I try to present facts about what happened to anyone who disagrees with me, I just get called and asshole who as no idea what they are talking about.

In my experience, when people are called assholes in an argument, it's rarely due to the facts they presented or the substantive parts of the argument. Rather, it's due to how they presented that information.

That seems to be the case here. For instance, in the other thread, you posed your argument from kinetic energy. Others disagreed, countering with arguments made from different starting assumptions. There are a lot of ways you could have responded to those comments, for instance explaining why you specifically disagree with their starting assumptions. But instead, it seems that you were utterly convinced that your argument from kinetic energy was the most fair, and so you name-called everyone who argued against it. For example:

> Stop being dense. Seriously that argument is invalid and ignores basic physics. 

You would have made a better impression had you instead said, for instance, ""I believe that your argument's starting assumptions are invalid because they ignore basic physics, and my opinion is that penalties should reflect physical parameters.""

It also seems clear to me that very few people here actually hate cyclists. Less than ~5% of the comments on the other thread made any reference to disliking cyclists as a whole class of people. Most of the hate, rather, seems focused at the specific, bothersome actions that some cyclists perform, such as running a light without looking. (That's not to say that you ran the light without looking--that's just an example from the other thread.) So when you say:

> Anyway, it's clear that the majority of the people on this sub absolutely hate bicyclists.

It seems clear to me that you're (intentionally or not) picking a fight, because you talk as though you're persecuted on here for being a cyclist, and that's just not the case. I think many more people would have been sympathetic to your problem because $490 really is a lot of money, even for running a red. But I noticed at least two or three instances on the other thread where people decided instead that maybe the $490 was deserved purely based on how you were acting in the thread.
It looks like someone took the previous thread too personally (which was backed with sound logic and critical, respectful discussion). Thus, to spite them, this person has created a ""take that!"" post
Thanks for the advice.  And you are right about the sub-reddit hating cyclists, it seems to be filled with people who make fun of financial aid recipients and minority groups, and now cyclists. Anyways, fuck this subreddit and a majority of the users in it
Not gonna lie...  when driving, the only close calls I've ever had with bicycles were when the cyclist was doing something stupid.  I.e. riding the wrong way on the wrong side of the street, riding on the sidewalk where they cannot be easily seen by drivers before going thru an intersection, running red lights, etc...  

What if there was a car going thru that intersection at the time?  What if you didn't end up plastered all over its windshield and instead the car swerved to avoid you, and then had a head on collision with a car going in the opposite direction? 

I beg to differ that ruining a red light as a bicyclist is not as dangerous as in a car...  maybe the odds are less but there is still a lot of potential for public harm. 

What really bugs me is that bicyclists think the rules of the road do not apply to them and when then when violating a rule, they always seem to get upset at the driver that nearly hit them as a result of the rule being violated. 

They don't take responsibility for their safety and seem to think that because they are riding a bike that they deserve special treatment, as if somehow that they are saving the environment by riding a bike gives them immunity from traffic laws and safety responsibilities. 

That's one of my biggest pet peeves about SF and Berkeley. 
Glad to see everything worked out!
Lol, how many people do jaywalkers kills? (see http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Bicyclist-sentenced-for-fatal-S-F-crash-4736312.php )

> Anyway, it's clear that the majority of the people on this sub absolutely hate bicyclists

Anyways as a driver, a bicyclist but mostly a pedestarian: you are an asshole. We don't hate bicyclists, we hate you and your entitled attitude.
So, you lied in court to get out of a ticket for a crime that you admit to in your original post. You then go online and complain about how broken the system is when you just did everything in your power to subvert it. 

People please don't be like OP.

The law isn't there to just protect ""other people"". It's there to protect idiots from themselves (i.e. people on bicycles who run red lights/stop signs).   
That's pretty hilarious.  Thank you for that!
Thanks for the support.  I could have been much more respectful and tactful in my responses, but some times I do get riled up. 
Thanks for the insight.  

> I guess you could get a jay-walking ticket by walking your bike through red lights instead of riding through them next time, 

That is effectively what I did, which is why I was shooting for jay-walking ticket. 

> I felt guilty and figured it was a good lesson in public safety.

I felt $120 guilty, not $490 guilty.   Furthermore, even though I didn't have to pay the fine, I ride my bike even more conservatively than I did before this instant. 
It seems like even for car traffic and/or bart/muni fare violation tickets it's best to take your chances and show up to court.  

Thanks for your experience!
That was a really helpful and insightful comment.  I really appreciate it.  After sleeping on it and calming down I realized that I did get riled up both times I posted about this to r/berkeley. 

I think that you are completely right that they called ME an asshole and not every single bicyclist out there.  I did take it personally and unwisely projected my feelings onto others.

In the end of the day, a good reminder in bike safety is never a bad thing.  Despite not having to pay the $490, I did spend a whole day (2 half days) going to Oakland to deal with this matter, and as a result ride my bike even more conservatively than before.  

I'll do my best to use this experience to change the way I talk about bicycle safety in a public forum.   I realize that I have done the opposite of what I intended, which is to make the public feel better about bicyclists.   

Thanks again for the thoughtful and sobering comment. 
On one hand (possibly, the bigger one), this is very true.  I think it was ridiculous how I got treated in that thread and to some extent feel vindicated and wanted to post this - specifically so the same people could read it.   Much of this post **is** grounded in spite.  This is made clear by the language in both this post and the other post.  

On the other hand, this post is also meant to be informative to anyone who may have or will get a pending traffic ticket. 

(BTW, nice username)
Bring on the downvotes, I guess, but...

>I beg to differ that ruining a red light as a bicyclist is not as dangerous as in a car... maybe the odds are less but there is still a lot of potential for public harm.

Your only point to support this is to say ""maybe a car might crash because of it,"" which is pretty much a moot point, because that's also a potential outcome of a car running the light. The fact that that's your only evidence actually lends *more* weight to the argument that running a light on a bike is less dangerous than running a light in a car.

I'm not trying to say that it should be acceptable for bicyclists to run every red light they come across, and I do think that most traffic laws are really necessary, but to say that the dangers of running lights is equal between bicyclists and motorists is clearly false.
Those are all valid points.  I have similar pet peeves about SOME bicylists in Berkeley, because I have crossed paths with them as a motorist, a pedestrian, and another cyclist.

> What if there was a car going thru that intersection at the time? What if you didn't end up plastered all over its windshield and instead the car swerved to avoid you, and then had a head on collision with a car going in the opposite direction?

I can never convince you without showing non-existence video evidence that scenario you describe is impossible (the nearest car was stopped 2 lights away at University).  This is corroborated by the 3 other people who got jay-walking tickets.  It was clearly safe to cross that portion of Shattuck at that time. 

> What really bugs me is that bicyclists think the rules of the road do not apply to them and when then when violating a rule, they always seem to get upset at the driver that nearly hit them as a result of the rule being violated.

My position is not that the ""rules don't apply"" is that there is a clear need for different rules for Cars and Bikes (we already have different laws for motorcyles vs cars vs big rigs, why do not naturally extend this to bikes, which are arguable even more different?)


Thanks!
Please explain exactly what I did that makes me an asshole?  Did I hurt someone?  Did I hurt you?  


> So, you lied in court to get out of a ticket for a crime that you admit to in your original post.

That is one interpretation of the events.  However, at no point did I lie, I plead ""not guilty,"" which exercising my right to due process.  

> you then go online and complain about how broken the system is when you just did everything in your power to subvert it.

addressing broken things is a bad thing?  

Please don't be a sycophant like this guy. 
Not really advice... but hey
Jaywalking is $220 (or at least it was 3 years ago)
>That is effectively what I did, which is why I was shooting for jay-walking ticket. 

Oh shit, serious? You weren't even seated on the bike and they still treated you like a vehicle?

>Furthermore, even though I didn't have to pay the fine, I ride my bike even more conservatively than I did before this instant.

And that's what makes you a good person.
Agreed, except with MUNI. My girlfriend got issued a bogus ticket on muni, and they actually make you pay each time you want to fight it. So you pay to have a hearing, they deny you, and then you have to pay again to appeal... I'm assuming they'll just laugh while they deny each appeal...
Thank you.  If you equate the dangers of the two it shows a clear lake of sincere effort to effectively analyze the situation.  

> I'm not trying to say that it should be acceptable for bicyclists to run every red light they come across, and I do think that most traffic laws are really necessary, 

Yep. Exactly 

>  but to say that the dangers of running lights is equal between bicyclists and motorists is clearly false.

Which is why we should have different more applicable law for bicycles!

Thanks again. 
Whether or not ""it was clearly safe"" irrelevant.  When driving a car, does one stop at the red light and proceed thru the intersection before the light turns green when one clearly determines that no cars are coming?  One doesn't (generally).

Granted, one has better visibility on a bike and can better make that determination, but if one somehow misjudges and gets killed or triggers the scenario in my original response, who's at fault?  The cyclist, of course.  

I do think that if the penalties were less,  then even more cyclists would red lights. 

How do you think the law should handle such situations?  I think it's too hard to include such nuances as ""there were no cars coming and it was safe to run the red light"" in the law in such a way that they can be consistently applied.  If they're was such a provision,  it would be the defense of every cyclist who ran a red light and got a ticket for it.

There's a reason bicycles are bound to the same laws as cars.
You willfully ran a redlight, putting a priority on perserving your inertia over the safety of others. And rather than acknowledge that other people might care about their safety you imagined the problem is everyone elses anti-bicycle agenda. After all it is impossible that you might have done a wrong thing.

Asshole.
Many that's tough, but still would have been an okay penalty compared to the $490 I was originally on the hook for. 
Effectively in the sense that I moved at the same pace as the walkers and took up as much space. 
good point, my fiancee got a ticket, but was able to prove that she was a paying monthly passenger.  The appeal was denied and she was given the $120 ticket despite the fact that she was clearly ""paying her fair share"" at the time of the ticket. 
Should motorcyclists be able to run reds? They're way more likely to get through an unsafe intersection faster than a bike should the unexpected occur, right?

I think traffic laws are written to protect people by attempting to eliminate the unexpected. The more you can rely on other drivers (whether they be in cars, in semi-trucks, on motorcycles, or on bicycles) to follow predictable patterns, the less likely it will be an accident occurs. Part of this policy, it seems, is to apply the rules of the road evenly to all participants to help traffic flow the smoothest and safest it can.

When you introduce exceptions, things get hairy. One that comes to mind here in CA is motorcyclists being able to ride the lines on roads and highways. It may be legal, but it is hard to anticipate and thus can lead to accidents. Now imagine if motorcycles could run red lights like I mentioned earlier. Think accidents would increase or decrease? Now what if it was bicyclists who could run red lights? Would accidents increase or decrease?

These are the kinds of considerations public safety officials have to contemplate when they write and adjust traffic laws. If you can come up with a better policy other than ""I just know, as a responsible bicyclist, when it is or is not safe for me to run a red light,"" please share it. But as it stands, your ideas don't seem to mesh with the purpose of traffic safety laws and instead seem more like a personalized system of law - a thing which simply can't exist in a society like we have.
Did you even take a look at my data/evidence about Idaho Stop Laws?  Or did you chose to ignore it because you disagree with me?
> Whether or not ""it was clearly safe"" irrelevant. When driving a car, does one stop at the red light and proceed thru the intersection before the light turns green when one clearly determines that no cars are coming? One doesn't (generally).

It actually is relevant.  Do you know the intersection at Allston and Sacramento?  This is clear evidence that sometime you don't need it to be a traditional stoplight all of the time. 

> Granted, one has better visibility on a bike and can better make that determination, but if one somehow misjudges and gets killed or triggers the scenario in my original response, who's at fault? The cyclist, of course.

No argument there.  But I really have to say, Who exactly go killed that morning?  

> How do you think the law should handle such situations? 

Idaho stop laws, which have been demonstrated to reduce both injuries and fatalities associated with bicycles.  This is  data, not my opinion. 

> If they're was such a provision, it would be the defense of every cyclist who ran a red light and got a ticket for it.

Again see Idaho stop laws, which have been proven to make the roads safer.  Eventually they will be adopted here, it's only a matter of time before the facts and data beat out the draconian application of laws.

> There's a reason bicycles are bound to the same laws as cars.

Why aren't they in Boise, Idaho?  Why is it safer there, then?


Here is a presentation on the original research showing that Idaho laws are safer than bike=car laws,

http://www.ecf.com/wp-content/uploads/Meggs-J-Stops-as-yields.pdf
> You willfully ran a redlight, putting a priority on perserving your inertia over the safety of others.

Except I stopped at the red light, check thoroughly down the ONE WAY STREET, before proceeding.  I WOULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED, IF I HAD ANY DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT I WOULD BE CAUSING HARM OR MAKING THINGS LESS SAFE. 

> And rather than acknowledge that other people might care about their safety you imagined the problem is everyone elses anti-bicycle agenda.

No imagine the problem is that no one seems to give a shit about facts in the sub and only care about that ""one time a bicylist almost hit me."" 

> After all it is impossible that you might have done a wrong thing.

I was ready, willing, and able to pay the fine for jaywalking.   I firmly believe that the fine was too heavy for ANY PERSON (AGAIN, not just me) who did the same on a bicycle, so I pursued the matter through the courts.  

I did not argue with the cop.  I did not argue with the judge.  I did not compromise anyone's safety. 

 


True,

But $220 for crossing a road with no cars is some major bs, especially since they only give tickets when they're planning to sit there and wait.  I've seen multiple people jaywalk in front of police officers so many times without a ticket.  One girl even caused a cop car to slam on their brakes in order to not hit her and he just drove off.
I'm glad you just downvoted me instead of reading the evidence and analyzing the data.

Sometimes it's better to be open minded, even if you have a deeply held belief. 
> Should motorcyclists be able to run reds?  They're way more likely to get through an unsafe intersection faster than a bike should the unexpected occur, right?

That is not the point.  You can pick up a bicycle with a single hand, but you can't do the same with a motorcycle.  Furthermore, if your hand slips on a motorcycles and you hit the gas instead of the brake, you could be going 30 mph in matter of 30-50 feet on a several hundred pounded vehicle.  This CANNOT happen on a bicycle.   Furthermore a bicycle is smaller and easier to avoid than the motorcycle so overall it easier to avoid if there is an unseen car.  Secondly, bicyles helmets provide better field of view (and less restrictive hearing) for the rider than motorcycle helmets.  These scenarios are not comparable


> Now imagine if motorcycles could run red lights like I mentioned earlier. Think accidents would increase or decrease? 

I'm willing to bet there are some intersections where this is OK, which implies that intersection should have its light replace with a roundabout and/or an uneven signal (blinking red in one direction and blinking yellow in the other).  Two  intersections that come to mind in Berkeley are Piedmont and Channing and Allston and Sacramento). 

> Now what if it was bicyclists who could run red lights? Would accidents increase or decrease?

Accidents decrease as shown by the [this reasearch](http://www.ecf.com/wp-content/uploads/Meggs-J-Stops-as-yields.pdf), summed up by this article/quote [If all this sounds far-fetched to you, look at the data. Public health researcher Jason Meggs found that after Idaho started allowing bikers to do this in 1982, injuries resulting from bicycle accidents dropped. When he compared recent census data from Boise to Bakersfield and Sacramento, California — relatively similar-sized cities with comparable percentages of bikers, topographies, precipitation patterns, and street layouts — he found that Boise had 30.5 percent fewer accidents per bike commuter than Sacramento and 150 percent fewer than Bakersfield.](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/05/idaho-has-surprising-progressive-traffic-laws-bicycles)

>  If you can come up with a better policy other than ""I just know, as a responsible bicyclist, when it is or is not safe for me to run a red light,"" please share it. 

That's the thing. I don't have to come up with it. It already exists and has been vetted in Idaho (and is slowly being adopted by other bike-friendly medium sized towns - like Berkeley!)

> But as it stands, your ideas don't seem to mesh with the purpose of traffic safety laws and instead seem more like a personalized system of law - a thing which simply can't exist in a society like we have.

I really think you are just assuming that.   If you have the time, read through the entire presentation ([linked again here](http://www.ecf.com/wp-content/uploads/Meggs-J-Stops-as-yields.pdf))



Ah gotcha. In that case I don't understand why you think this is different than a car running a red light in the same circumstances? Personally I never run such lights in car or bike. I agree it's not particularly unsafe, it's just about respecting the rules of the road, to make things more predictable for everyone. I would agree that cops should be using their time more wisely and I guess they sorta agree given that they didn't show up to the courthouse.

The jaywalking thing doesn't make any sense at all. You weren't jaywalking.
I agree it's unnecessarily high.  As is $490 for going through a clear, but red intersection.   Unfortunately this fines are inflated to become a cash cow for the city and county (just like Parking Tickets).  

However, if you ever do get a ticket. I strongly recommend taking it all they way to traffic court because of the fact that very few officers actually just don't show up.


I know this is old now, but I never downvoted a single one of your comments. Nice persecution complex though.
Yeah it happened in the middle of the semester so I didn't feel like dealing with it, even though I probably should have.
Are you willing to look at the Idaho-style stop data? 

[Here it is.](http://www.ecf.com/wp-content/uploads/Meggs-J-Stops-as-yields.pdf)

Bottom line is that it's SAFER to let bikes yield at stop signs and stop, then proceeds through red lights WHEN IT'S SAFE and clear.

The fact that so many books still name the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved. 

In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for free for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply publicize what the music business wants to make money with.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. And rock critics will study more of rock history and realize who invented what and who simply exploited it commercially.

Beatles' ""aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll: it replaced syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.

Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for a good reason. They could not figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). THat phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Fours'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"". Not to mention later and far greater British musicians. Not to mention the American musicians who created what the Beatles later sold to the masses.

The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial band. 
uh...did you post in the right thread? I mean OP mentioned the Beatles once as a band he liked, not worshiped them as the greatest musical icon ever.
