Seniors: what‚Äôs something (non academic) that Berkeley has taught you??,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10513cg/seniors_whats_something_non_academic_that/,2023-01-06 10:11:30,Edit: and alums.,"Everything is competitive.

Getting into certain majors? Competitive.
Getting into the classes you want? Competitive.
Getting a good grade in a curved class? Competitive.
Getting into certain clubs? Competitive.
Getting research? Competitive.
Getting lunch at the dining hall? Competitive.
Getting good housing? Competitive.

Adapting. 

Things won't always go according to plan, whether that's professionally, or in relationships, or friendships, or whatever else.

The career path I had in mind when I applied to college was different than the one I had as a freshman, and that changed multiple times again before I graduated. 

Life has a way of happening whether you're ready or not. And while you can plan for possibilities, being able to reassess and adapt to changes and keep moving forward is what will get you through everything.
I learned mostly about joe actually.
Something I‚Äôve routinely not done, making everything infinitely more difficult, asking for help. Rely on others, classmates, professors, GSIs, going it alone is Dark Souls 1-3 no hit run-esque difficult.
That your perception of yourself has the potential to change rapidly during this time (specifically from your late teenage years to your early 20‚Äôs) and so can other people‚Äôs perspective of you. I used to get teased at my highschool about struggling in classes and when I went to community college I could feel unsure of my future and overwhelmed. Now it‚Äôs a little surreal when I travel out of the bay and people go ‚ÄúWow‚Äù when I tell them I go to Berkeley. I know school isn‚Äôt everything but it‚Äôs good to reflect

That everyone is actually insecure at this school and people will project onto you.
A lot of people you meet at uni won‚Äôt matter to your life after this era ends. That‚Äôs okay. Just choose the people you invest in wisely and don‚Äôt invest your energy that could be spent on your self-growth into people you can‚Äôt imagine being important in your future.
 I C'd my way through my econ degree and I make just   
as much as much as my wife who got a degree in chemical biology. She   
also works more than I do. I can't count the amount of times I've   
consoled her while she cried during late nights of studying. She   
literally cleans lab equipment and does Bradford assays. Shit I did in   
my bio class. Not to disparage people from their chosen profession, but   
if you're in it for the money, there are easier ways. The whole thing's a  
 scam.

The Moffitt library has good restrooms to cry inside.
People here will do anything to be on top, regardless of how much of a douchebag they have to be to do so
Competitive and self ego and obviously hard to get above 3.0 or 3.5
Strong body is a strong mind. Start going to the gym and take care of your body.
Yes to all the comments below(I don‚Äôt even attend UC Berkeley I‚Äôm just here to see the tea)

Struggling is necessary if you wish to become more powerful.
There are drugs that can be good to do and drugs that are almost always bad. Alcohol is almost always bad
Nothing ever goes exactly how you plan it. There‚Äôs never going to be a perfect time. Trudge through the discomfort. It‚Äôs better to show up unprepared than to live in avoidance.
Trust nobody. 

My roommate was my best friend from community college and we transferred to Berkeley together from cc. He roomed with me off campus and never paid rent for our first  year. He owes me 12k+ and I developed a mental disorder from stress partially related to him and working to pay rent and bills while being a full time student. Was supposed to graduate 2020 but its three years late and I dropped out. Going away to college teaches you a lot about relationships and being financially responsible. In other words, Fuck Joey.
self censorship
Learn how to be alone
ironically, coming from a super competitive bay area high school my takeaway was kind of the opposite. the world is a kinder, less cutthroat place than I was led to believe it was. the people at my high school were also smarter than I thought they were.
This. Other examples include PGE power outages, COVID, poor air quality, and the UAW strike all being unforeseen disruptions to learning.
As an alum, can confirm. Cal has a specific way of making you learn how to adjust to rapidly evolving situations when the odds aren't in your favor.
Pretty sure learnt that in the past. Bring a native armadillo in the Bay Area next day he will become a software engineer
Joe?
üòÇ
Good to know. Thanks for the tip!
Funny thing, before college I would cry silently so nobody would see me, now I have no shame. I will literally cry anywhere; I once cried in the front row in my math class during a lecture because I had no clue wtf was going on. Crying just helps so much with the stress, I have no shame whatsoever.
What do you do for work? I was also a transfer but I really worked for a good GPA and honors in econ. I think I somewhat disagree. Having a solid GPA really opened doors for me and it will help a lot when I apply to MBA programs in the future.

I feel like learning to work hard at Berkeley has helped me work hard for the life I want.
What was your overall gpa
Can you elaborate?
Im really curious to hear about what these cutthroat bay area high schools were like coming from a guy that came from a lower than average reputation high school (although ive heard it has gotten a lot better recently!). For me, it was more like damn, college was super hard and I feel dumb as balls lol.
Did your high school feel more competitive than Berkeley?
I think they're talking about Joe Mama
Fr lol
A little shame can be a good thing sometimes. It‚Äôs probably not the best to loudly cry whenever you are stressed.

I know we‚Äôre in an era of showing emotion and crying it out, which can be a good thing, but learning to handle stress in a productive way is also healthy.
many people here are very easily offended, intolerant of views that conflict with their own, and actively look for gotchas around every corner and under every rock. Not everyone is like this, of course, but so many are that it is often times easier to not share thoughts/facts that these people will surely misconstrue and/or misrepresent. In many cases, the drama is just not worth it.

In other words, this place is, ironically enough, unwelcoming of genuine dissent.  I say ""genuine"" because there are plenty of people who view themselves as ""dissenters"" but are really just run of the mill, status quo ""revolutionaries"". They are ""dissenters"" in the eyes of their midwestern parents, but they fit perfectly into the Berkeley/Cal milieu.

For what it's worth, this is not a quality unique to [Cal](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/opinion/campus-speech-cancel-culture.html), or even [university](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/08/free-speech-nearly-half-of-americans-self-censor-study-finds/), but it is undoubtedly more pronounces in a university setting than a non-university setting, and specifically at Cal when compared to certain other universities, in my opinion.
50+ people from my year got into berkeley. so when it came to advanced classes that not everyone took (like the 2x math pathway for alg2 h/precalc h/ap calc in 9/10/11), the average student was about as smart if not smarter than the average cal student. the difficulty of tests and of getting an A reflected that.

my calc bc class had ~20 people, and ~90% of that class went to ucla/berkeley or an ivy league. only half of us got As. grade-wise (not material-wise), that class was harder than anything I've taken at cal.

edit: not gonna specify the hs, makes it too easy to dox me
same üò≠ i went to school in the valley so our big thing was our FFA group, bay schools sound absolutely terrifying
at least in the circle of people I was in, yes.

Ik but life‚Äôs difficult broüòì, appreciate advice but sometimes you just gotta let it all out
That is crazy man. Was this a private high school? It must be a huge advantage to go into college that smart. I wonder if the advantage starts leveling out as you get into your third year because people are getting used to the rigor of college by then. I took calc BC, and we were super lucky we had a great teacher teaching that class. I think 25% of the class went to UT Austin, a bit over 25% went to texas a&m, and the rest went to state schools dotted around texas.
Irvington? I remember being in a bc class with Lin with around 20 ppl in it but I don‚Äôt remember if only half of us got As
Lemme guess Dougherty Valley?
no, public school. from what I've heard grading at private schools is super lenient, they tend to coddle you a lot. our school was much more sink-or-swim.

I think it's an advantage in the sense that you get earlier exposure to tons of rigor, but even then not everyone can handle it. tons of people ended up dropping out of the hard classes because they couldn't keep up.

whether it was due to the earlier exposure or not, I never really found classes at berkeley to be particularly difficult throughout my time here if I'm being honest.
Wow. I also went to school in the bay but this has to be Gunn or something.
it wasn't one of the stereotypical ""top top"" schools. to be fair our school's rigor was also very hit or miss by department/subject, some were total jokes."
