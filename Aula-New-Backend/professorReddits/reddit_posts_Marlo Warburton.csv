EDSTEM82 or 82T?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12wpckx/edstem82_or_82t/,2023-04-23 13:39:45,Title,"Whichever Marlo Warburton teaches. She’s awesome.
82 are classroom placements whereas 82T is tutoring students one-on-one
Yay thank you !
Hm I think only 82 fits my schedule either way so should be okay?
Is the class difficult?
nah, it was a really chill and fun class.
easy a
Just a quick question, in your experience with 82, we are assigned one hour a week which will barely fit or worse not be possible without extra hours. What happened if you didn’t make the 12 hours? Did they fail you or just take points off or something else? I have Professor Lang if that helps. I’m a bit concerned with that.
hey! i also had professor lang and she’s pretty chill. with that said, you do need to have 12 hours. not sure if you have your mentor teacher yet, but it should be relatively easy to coordinate with them when you’re available, whether you wanted to do 1 hour a week or more. there were some weeks where i didn’t do any, but i made it up at the end by just doing like 4 hours on one day. feel free to pm me if you have more q’s!"
