pls help: CS 88 w/Michael Ball VS CS61A w/John Denero&Pamela Fox,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ny068z/pls_help_cs_88_wmichael_ball_vs_cs61a_wjohn/,2021-06-11 23:16:33,"I still need help choosing between these two classes for next sem: i rlly don’t know which to pick. I’m most likely going for DS minor cuz double major w DS will prob be rough for me at this point. ppl tell me to go w/88 bc most who go data science pathway do that i guess, but then others tell me 61A will be more worthwhile. Is there a big difference in level of difficulty between the two? If 61A is significantly harder, might just try to enroll in 88. I’m already enrolled in 61A on waitlist but like #41 so i’m sure i’ll get in. But if it’s a lot harder i’ll just try to get into 88. But if it’s not much of a difference, I think i’d rather take 61A to learn some useful technical skills. The only thing “close” to programming i’ve had is taking data 8. I liked the class more than i thought but it wasn’t a walk in the park for me personally, for reference.","I recommend Cs 88. However you might find 61B a bit harder coming from cs 88 rather than 61A. Just a thought.
I recommend CS88. The only topic you will miss is Interpreters/Scheme at the end, but you will get all of the Python topics, and those will serve you quite well in Data Science.

In addition, CS88 will go at a more manageable pace. Students generally struggle in 61A if their only introduction to coding is Data 8, as 61A goes very fast through difficult topics. CS88 gets to spend a little more time on each of those topics, and many of your classmates will come from similar experience levels as yours.

I’m going ds minor so i won’t need to take 61B! but i definitely was thinking about that when i was considering taking the major instead before.
my other classes are not hard. but i didn’t find data 8 super manageable. it wasn’t like getting out hand for me but it still didn’t come super easily to me -specifically the exams. i couldn’t get away with skipping lectures and not going to OHs. but i def am someone who is slower just in general LOL so if CS 88 covers less over more time, that would be good for me. dang it. so conflicted cuz i’m in a good waitlist spot for 61A. idkkk if it’s possible during phase 2 for me to get a  CS 88 spot. do you know the liklieness for that?
Damn you escaped some hell bruh
[deleted]
You will 100% get into CS61A at Adjustment time.  If fact, you could drop/swap the class with something else rn and add CS61A at Adjustment time and still get in.  That’s how confident I am.  (Well, might be too late  rn since I think Phase 1 is over).
lmaoo. Rlly was tryna tell myself to go for the double major but i don’t think i’m built like that
Will it not swap the classes if 88 ends up not being avail? so that i can save my spot in 61A in case.
oh wow i didn’t know 61A was that flexible. i thought that was the class that i needed to get first so i signed up for it first:/ ya phase 1 over... hopefully i can just swap next phase...
[deleted]
Yeah, shouldn’t be a problem to do that.
ohhh i see. and does it swap you into waitlists or ONLY actually enrolls you fully.
do you think i’d be able to land a spot in CS 88 tho during Phase 2?
Maybe, I would say 50-50.  Are you a rising sophomore?  If so, then you have a better chance than if you are a rising junior.  Chances are a lot of incoming transfer students will eat up the remaining slots for juniors I suspect.
I’m a rising junior"

Yeah, those unknown professors like Michael Pollan who has given a TED talk, been on national television numerous times, and authored 5 New York Times best sellers. Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.  Truly, he deserves some sort of award to signify the important contributions he has made.
Most if not all of these are extremely well-known and have won many awards.
Robert Hass is excellent. He writes a lot about human connection with our environment. So does the other poetry professor next semester (John Shoptaw).

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47553/meditation-at-lagunitas 

is good, as well as 

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/06/27/the-problem-of-describing-trees.

His poems also have themes of semiotics, for the linguistics/philosophy/literary theory people out there.

> Or the other notion that,

> because there is in this world no one thing

> to which the bramble of _blackberry_ corresponds,

> a word is elegy to what it signifies.

That is, (my interpretation), if we see a blackberry and describe it as a ""blackberry"", as in ""I saw a blackberry today,"" we've essentially destroyed that blackberry's uniqueness and identity, unified it with all the other blackberries in the world. Just saying the word ""blackberry"" at once marks the funeral of that specific blackberry and sings its final elegy. There is, I think, the value of silence: in appreciating some Thing without putting a name to it, that clouds our judgement with our memories of all the other Things of that name (ever met a girl with the same name as your ex?).

That last line just struck me as particularly beautiful when I read it, as a sharp upper bound on what humans are able to communicate with each other.
What a BS article. That is not a list of *unknown* people.
At least as famous as a critical theorist, especially one focused on a field as specific as gender theory, can hope to be. I think all of us humanities people pray to be even half as notable as her.
> Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.

Perlmutter too.

At least article writer can take solace that the Nobel committee agrees  with them that these guys ""deserve an award""? :P"

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like. 

Also, could anyone recommend any easy and fun 7-breadth courses? That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",I like the first one with Data 8 instead of EPS 7
"Today is Charter Day, the birthday of the University of California! It's 150 years exactly since the first celebration in 1874.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bly7fy/today_is_charter_day_the_birthday_of_the/,2024-03-23 10:49:41,"On March 23, 1868, the Governor of California, Henry Haight, signed legislation called the ""Organic Act"" that created the University of California. (Ironically, because the capitol--Sacramento--was flooded at the time, Haight may have signed the legislation in a borrowed office in the Sacramento home of Leland Stanford.) 

The University did not start operations until summer of 1869. Four years later, in 1873 the University moved from its original campus in what is now Downtown Oakland to the Berkeley campus. 

The next year, students organized a campus celebration of the anniversary of the University's founding, held on March 23, 1874--150 years ago, today. This was the first ""Charter Day"", referring to the State charter that authorized the University. They held an oratorical contest, which was won by student Josiah Royce (who was later to be a Cal faculty member, then a notable philosopher at Harvard). 

For 17 years the annual ceremony was organized by the students. In 1892 an official campus academic ceremony was organized for the occasion, and thereafter Charter Day was an official UC event. It was celebrated with increasingly elaborate ceremonies, including speeches by distinguished visitors, and awarding of honorary degrees.  Governors of California, presidents of other universities, a Secretary General of the United Nations, a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (Cal alumnus Earl Warren), ambassadors and Cabinet members, a former President (Teddy Roosevelt in 1911) and a sitting President--John F. Kennedy in 1963--were all featured speakers. 

For many decades, students got the day off from classes, and thousands attended the ceremony.  Charter Day ceremonies were usually held in the Greek Theatre, after it was constructed, and, later, sometimes in Memorial Stadium. 

Charter Day was a really big event, the most important date, besides Graduation, in the campus calendar. Inaugurations of Chancellors and UC Presidents were often held on Charter Day. 

In the early 20th century the California Alumni Association starting having a formal Charter Day Banquet. This was also a Big Thing. It came to be usually celebrated at some large San Francisco Hotel, and several hundred alumni, students, and dignitaries would gather. An annual award, Alumnus of the Year, was given at the Banquet, starting in 1943. 

Here's a partial history of the Charter Day Banquet: [https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/summer-2012-north-south/noble-company/](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/summer-2012-north-south/noble-company/)

In 1980, there were student protests at Charter Day, during the Inaurguration of I. Michael Heyman as Chancellor. Heyman's administration began a quiet policy of de-emphasizing the annual event. The date also started moving around the calendar, not necessarily on March 23. 

Today...Charter Day seems almost forgotten at UC.  On the UC Berkeley home page today, there's no mention of it. Nothing on the California Alumni Association website home page.  

To be fair, there was a campus ""Charter Day 2024"" celebration on Sproul Plaza on March 13 that included a Photo Booth, some performances, ""a few words from Chancellor Christ and other campus leaders"" and blue and gold cupcakes. 

But...today is the actual birthday. So, Happy Birthday, Cal!

&#x200B;","Happy Birthday, Cal!
Love this. Happy Birthday, Cal!
Thanks for sharing!

Well, the ceremony is 150 years old. The University itself is 156 years old today, but didn't start operations until 155 years ago.

The only older universities in California are all private schools: University of Pacific (founded under a different name in 1851), Mills College (founded as a women's seminary in 1852, now part of Northeastern University), USF (founded as a high school academy in 1855), Saint Mary's College (founded in 1863). 

We're basically the oldest public university / college in California, although San Jose State has some tenuous connections to a school founded in San Francisco earlier."
The Killer: ME Major’s Take,https://i.redd.it/xj71injm2zzb1.jpg,2023-11-12 11:56:47,"“If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you,” remarks Michael Fassbender as The Killer in David Fincher’s long-awaited return to cinema. The Killer is chock full of these bite-sized commentaries and philosophical musings that would hang nicely next to framed “art” like “Live. Laugh. Love.” Enduring boredom, you say? Hmm, how fitting. 

In the patois of the nihilistic, Fassbender describes professional killing as tedious work. Funny that Fincher chose a script whose theme best mirrors his on-set directorial style. Fincher is famous, or infamous (depending on whom you interview) for doing hundreds of takes to get a scene. I imagine that could be tedious too. Hell, maybe the opening dialogue is Fassbender on a hot mic and they just kept it.

It must be said that I worship at the altar of David Fincher.  A filmography that consists of works like The Game, Seven, Fight Club, The Social Network, Zodiac, Mank, Mindhunter, and House of Cards puts him squarely at legend status. I also fan-boy over Fassbender too. Despite my biases, the movie is just plain boring. The plot is as simple as it is predictable. It’s a mix of Day of the Jackal and John Wick, minus all the things that made those films compelling. Just because the “hero” waxes about tedium doesn’t mean we, the audience, want to wallow in it. 10 minutes of Fassbender opening a van door, closing a van door, looking in the van, driving the van, washing the van, dropping the keys off for the van… (I think you get the point) becomes a bit much and we get six chapters of it. 

The movie is action-lite, with only one major (and intense) fight sequence and an escape scene or two. This approach would be refreshing if the idea was to substitute gratuitous action for layered suspense.  We don’t get that. We get Peter Seller’s Being There with a gun. 

My final disappointment ends with the music. I have loved every collaboration of Fincher and Trent Reznor but The Killer’s score is made second-chair to constant needle-drops of The Smiths. I also love The Smiths but again… the repetition.  I have been waiting ages for Fincher and Fassbender to do a great film again and it seems I’m going to have to wait a while longer. How tedious.",Still not as good as flushed away tbh
Warning - Craigslist Con Artist still at large,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35n3a6/warning_craigslist_con_artist_still_at_large/,2015-05-11 14:23:04,"There is a con artist operating out of Byron, GA targeting students in the Berkeley area.

On further communication, they send stock photos that they claim are of the apartment, and ask for up-front cash payment to be sent to Georgia before they overnight you the keys.

I ran across the same person a couple months ago when I was looking for a place. It was for a 1 bdr a block or two from the north gate for around $800/mo.

There was another guy running a similar scam for a 2bdr in the outer sunset I ran across at the same time. The guy was trying to get $2k. 
There is one of these (or more) in SC, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and I think one in N. Florida.  Maybe still in south Georgia, making one more of them.  Can't remember.  I was just lazy and got the wrong picture because, really, fuck you.

Open Team In Dynasty Baseball League (Again),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3cvs25/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league_again/,2015-07-10 21:41:28,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. I've posted previously about a different team that was open, and a recent Berkeley grad wound up taking it. I'd love to meet more Berkeley students (maybe who are still attending, though I'm not picky) who are into baseball.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward.

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete).
