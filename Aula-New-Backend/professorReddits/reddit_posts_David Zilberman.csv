EEP 141 with David Zilberman,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l1nunk/eep_141_with_david_zilberman/,2021-01-20 17:31:41,Anyone have any tips for his class? Is he a good professor?,"I took 141 fall 2019 , it’s a very chill class, he kind of just lectures at you, 99% of it is unimportant. Assuming the format hasn’t changed, the final project is the only thing you need to really work on, and they graded everyone very generously
Hi, how did you feel about this class? I'm taking the same class with him and the mic problem also drives me crazy... can't understand most of his lecture and I'm kinda worry about that.
Wht about the psets? Are they fair and easy?
Hi, one thing to keep in mind is that I took this class online because of the pandemic. I'm not sure if u guys online or in person now.

I honestly couldn't understand him at all. The GSI's even put the live captions on and that could make sense of what he was saying. However, he would upload a 2-4 page summary of what he went over for class. I would go through that, along with the lecture slides. Another suggestion is to reach out to other students for their notes. Lastly, go to office hours and see if a GSI is willing to give you a run down of the lecture.

The homework for this course wasn't bad at all. Just do it yourself and compare answers with a few of the other students in the class. If you really don't understand it, go to office hours with a gsi.

The most important part about his class is the final group project. Just make sure you choose the right partners and topic. He doesn't grade too hard.

I'd say the class is an easy B+. Just make sure you nail that group project. 

I hope this helped.
If I recall most of the problem sets’ problems have corresponding examples given in section. Very few were difficult
We're taking online classes for the first 2 weeks and then the teaching mode will be in-person though I'm not sure if this mode is going to change or not. Thank you so much for the detailed information! It's truly helpful and I'm feeling a lot better now lol

For the summaries of the lecture, did he upload them after or before the class? He stated that there will be readings, do you think the readings are the same as the summaries?

And how did you get attendance points? Did he send out stuff like attendance quizzes?
Ok that makes me feel better about the class. I was a bit worried cuz I can't understand him too cuz of his accent and bad camera/mic quality. 

Thanks a lot for responding and giving me some insight!
Hi sorry for the late response.

I don't remember if uploaded them before or after lecture. I wanna say they were uploaded the day of the lecture before class. I don't recall any readings.

 If I remember correctly they took attendance with really easy 2-3 question quizzes.
Lol no worries, I couldn’t understand him when it was in person either so don’t stress !
Thank you so much! I'm feeling so much better about this class now. ;)"

I want to take it but the RMP reviews are absolutely terrible for David Zilberman. If you have any experience with the class or the professor, how was it?",
