"Is this suicide? CS70, 61B and 61C in one semester",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3ju6yz/is_this_suicide_cs70_61b_and_61c_in_one_semester/,2015-09-06 01:26:50,"I'm a junior transfer in eecs, and I have a decent amount of programming knowledge. So far I have been flying through 61A, but I'm sure it will get more challenging. I had taken java at my community college but I considered it a joke (the class not java). Anyhow, to be able to intern and take upper div next year, I need to finish my lower div as soon as possible.  

I know for sure I will be taking 61B and CS70 since that's the pre req for every upper div. However, I'm stuck on what my third class should be.. my choices are either 16b(I'm in 16a right now, that's the new ee20/40), 61C, or a upper div humanity.

here is a good layout:
My current schedule is ee16a, 61a, psych167AC
Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), CS61C(Randy H. Katz; Vladimir Stojanovic)

OR: Spring: 61B (Joshua Hug), CS70(Venkat Anantharam; Anant Sahai), ee16b(Michel Maharbiz)

the 61b teacher looks good, cs70 is going to suck either way, but which is the better teacher between 16b and 61c?

","Its ok to take 61b/61c/70 together because they don't overlap that much, but you might have multiple projects due on the same week... which will be hell week for you. I took 61B with Hug, and he is one of the best professors I had at Berkeley. Sahai for 70 will be tough, but you'll learn a lot
I've heard some pretty bad things about Maharbiz for EE20/EE40, so I assume it'd be similar for EE16B. I don't think that schedule will be easy but if you have a good amount of programming knowledge and experience then it's possible. I've known some junior transfers that have taken similarly rigorous courseloads and done well.
I did something similar. I spent basically 7-10 hours in the library every weekday working on homework/projects. If you're okay with that, go for it.
A friend of mine did 61B, 61C, and 70 all in one semester, with no other classes (except a small decal). It's doable but you'll probably have to spend a LOT of time working on projects. What she did was aim to finish all projects the week before they're due so that she has buffer room to deal with other things. 
I took EE40 with Maharbiz last semester, and honestly the memes and whatnot are incredibly exaggerated imo. It's a pretty straightforward class, and in terms of work you'll be fine as long as you start on stuff as soon as it's assigned. It's a prelab that takes 2 or so hours a week and hw that takes maybe 4-5 hours."
