Swupnil Sahai Courses other than Data 8,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mscbjc/swupnil_sahai_courses_other_than_data_8/,2021-04-16 13:56:14,Does Sahai teach any other courses besides Data 8? I really like the way he teaches and I understand pretty easily considering that I‚Äôm pretty slow at processing concepts in my head. Hoping he teaches other data science courses so if anyone has ever had him for anything else besides data 8 pls lmk and if you thought he taught well in that course as well,"Broooo same i understand so well when swupnil teaches the class

At the end of the semester, Data8 professor Swupnil Sahai promised us lyrics to a rap if a previous comment on the EdDiscussion reached 100 likes. It did, and now we have this absolute masterpiece. Thought I would share it with all the Data8/Sahai/DeNero alumni on here. Enjoy!

DATA C8 w/ Prof. Sahai & Ayazifar,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jfojuz/data_c8_w_prof_sahai_ayazifar/,2020-10-21 16:46:41,Planning on taking Data C8 Foundations of data science for Spring 2021. I saw that prof Swupnil Kumar Sahai is teaching C8 right now and will in spring. How is Sahai‚Äôs class and teaching? Do you guys like how Sahai teaches/does Sahai make the class more difficult or more ‚Äúeasy‚Äù? Is Sahai nice and available for OH/Understanding during the pandemic? If anyone has had Ayazifar please lmk as well. Babak Ayazifar has 4.3/5 total rating and 3.5 level difficult on rate my prof. Sahai has 4/5 total and 2.5 level difficulty. Do you agree with these?,"Babak is pretty good and Sahai (this is not the infamous one) is quite good.
I‚Äôm confident Babak will be good for Data 8
I think Sahai is purely a lecturer; he‚Äôs never made a piazza post or comment for Data 8 (Atleast from what I‚Äôve seen) and it‚Äôs Wagner who comments/engages with the class/holds office hours. As a lecturer, Sahai is nice and good at explaining concepts clearly. Wagner is the one who wrote the super hard midterm so he explained that Sahai will write our final instead - who knows what that will be like.
Babak is an amazing professor. Take any class with him. Godsent teacher from heaven. Makes every Cal professor look mediocre or so bad.
Babak is a great guy and really good at teaching probability (I took 70 with him). Idk about the other prof tho.
[deleted]
Currently with Wagner and Sahai rn and they're both great - sans the hard midterm by Wagner but thats life yknow
Would you say they‚Äôre good professors for people who have no coding knowledge?
??? Wdym
Lol should I not take it
I would say S. Sahai is excellent for beginners.  Babak has been around for a while, usually teaches CS 70 and higher level classes, so not sure how he is with a beginning class but he generally is considered to be liked by students.
There is a very well known CS professor who well, to put it nicely, has super-high expectations from his students, named Anant Sahai.  The previous poster got mixed up with Swupnil Sahai.
Alright cool thanks:)
So does Data C8 not have a discussion section? And it has a lab instead? And does it require another day besides the lecture days? How are those?
Oh oh I see haha good to know
There‚Äôs a lab, no discussion section.  It‚Äôs a 2-hour once a week time slot.  This is where you do your assignments and project work.  There will be a separate sign up for the lab times, usually done a week or two before classes begin.
Oh I never had a class like that. So it‚Äôs basically just alotted time for you to do your own homework and not like a regular physics or Chem lab? Those r only types ive taken so far. Do you happen to know what happens if you end up having a time conflict w all of the available lab time slots?
Well there‚Äôs a bit more to the lab I‚Äôm pretty sure.  Can‚Äôt remember if this is a lab where someone needs to check off your work, probably not.  There‚Äôs going to be at least 30 lab times, so I guarantee you that you‚Äôll find a free slot somewhere.
I took it last Fall, so idk if anything changed. Basically there was a discussion section with a worksheet at the beginning and then lab for the rest of the time. You could work on the lab and get it checked off, then you were free to go home. If you did the lab before a certain day, you didn't have to go to the actual section and get it checked off. You could also do hw, projects, and other stuff during the lab and get help on them.

If you are new to coding, I think it is a great experience to go to them. Honestly the coding in Data 8 is not overly complicated. The stats stuff is a bit harder. I think you'll do great (especially since you care enough to reach out and ask these questions)! :)

Feel free to ask if you have more questions.
(Current data 8 student) 
Lab is basically a second weekly homework that you can either complete (passing all tests) by Wed morning or work on during your scheduled lab section (1.5 hours long) sometime Wed-Fri. Attendance isn‚Äôt mandatory if you‚Äôve already completed before 9am Wed. If you don‚Äôt show up or complete it by then you don‚Äôt get credit for that week‚Äôs lab assignment. 

There is discussion at some point during the week (which you sign up for, your section depends on whether you have previous stats/coding knowledge) that is only 30 minutes in which you complete that week‚Äôs discussion worksheet. Attendance is taken every week. 

This class imo isn‚Äôt ‚Äúskipping friendly‚Äù cause it‚Äôs hard to get credit for these things if you don‚Äôt show up.
Okay cool. Thanks so much for answering my bajillion questions I appreciate it :) have a good week
Oh cool. Do you have lab partners in it?
Do you find yourself getting overwhelmed a lot by the class pace
Btw is attendance mandatory to the lectures? Cuz I have a time conflict with spring‚Äôs Data C8 class. I was hoping data 8 was recorded so that I could attend the other class live
Oh wow ok that‚Äôs actually a lot more than what I was expecting... so the 30 min discussion is separate from the lab day  ? Damn . So lecture days+ lab days+ discussion days+OHs... hm
This class sound like a lot of work lmao like more than I was expecting
Sorry to ask this tedious Q but are the discussions and lab days mostly on Tues&Thursdays or r they just all over the weekdays? I wanna know so I can plan how I organize my schedule for next sem. And do they upload lectures within a day?
I think you are allowed to do it with a lab partner (might be misremembering). I always did it solo since I mostly did them at home, but if you are a collaborative learner that is an option.
Definitely, but as someone who is new to coding, the fact I have it 4 times a week is helpful for retention & learning. If I was already familiar with python and statistics it would feel much more tedious.
Attendance for lectures isn‚Äôt mandatory. But discussions are, and lab is graded by either completion by 9am Wed or getting checked off on your lab section (sometime wed-fri)
Okay thank you!!!
Fckkk that makes me feel better but worse all at the same time haha. I also have 0 coding experience and 0 stats knowledge. Idk if I should take it..:/
I guess I‚Äôm just scared to take it cuz ik I fall behind in lectures and crap like every single semester
Do you personally recommend being able to go to lectures live? Or do you feel like it‚Äôs rlly the same if u just watch the recorded lectures
I like live lectures because I can ask them questions/clarifications in real time about what they‚Äôre teaching. The GSIs who attend respond to everyone, it‚Äôs really helpful imo. But other than that you won‚Äôt be missing out if you watch them later on. It might be hard to stay engaged though especially if you aren‚Äôt familiar with coding or stats."
Incoming data science freshman schedule. Thoughts or Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xx9lv/incoming_data_science_freshman_schedule_thoughts/,2023-07-12 11:55:32,"1. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler (mixed reviews on RMP but seems like a hard professor), CS 61A with Prof. John Denero (not sure if I‚Äôll enroll as a DS major and with 300 waitlist max), and EPS 7 Climate Change and Computer science mentors (not sure how to enroll in CSM)

2. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler, DATA C8 w/ Prof. Swupnil Sahai, EPS 50 Planet Earth w/ Michael Manga

3. Math 32 (Precalculus) w/ Prof. Rui Wang (bad reviews on RMP but not suer if I should enroll in precalculus since I want to do well in calculus at Cal), CS 10 w/ Dan Garcia (friendlier pace than CS 61A) and some other random GE course

4. Math 32 w/ Prof. Rui Wang (again, has bad reviews on RMP), Data C8, and some random GE.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like. 

Also, could anyone recommend any easy and fun 7-breadth courses? That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",I like the first one with Data 8 instead of EPS 7
Data 8,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rr2uw7/data_8/,2021-12-29 00:00:36,I‚Äôm going to take data 8 this upcoming spring semester but how hard will the class be with denero and Sahai teaching it? I know they teach 16a and 16b and always hear a lot of bad stories regarding those classes‚Ä¶ üòÖ,"Wrong Sahai. This Sahai is easy going
who tf is telling bad stories about denero i'll fight them
They recently revamped the class to make it way easier, I wouldn‚Äôt worry!
It is easy. I got an A.
had this sahai for data 8 a few semesters back and this semester during data 140. pretty chill dude but exams can be a bit suprising haha
Oh really? That‚Äôs good to hear! Ty!
There are two SahaiÔºü
Sorry chose bad wording, what I mean is extremely hard af
Everyone who was promised fun 61A lectures only to get fucked over by the exams and their grade.
Yes, Swupnil Sahai and Anant Sahai. I've taken classes with both and I think both are good lecturers though. Swupnil had hard exams (the sp21 data8 midterm had some hard table questions with uniqlo) but he curved the class so it didn't matter at all. Anant, on the other hand, made exams more doable (not really but he lowered the denominators lol) but binned the class -- and didn't binshift it which like never happens in EECS. He probably gets a lot of hate for this + his amnt of homework in eecs16b/cs189 (latter doesn't have resubs oof) but Swupnil's data8 workload is really mild and they are very easygoing. He also lectures from Snapchat(?) which was interesting to see, but he was a great lecturer as is denero"
"OH GOD, DATA 8 is being taught by SAHAI FALL 2020, GOOD OR BAD?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hyazcv/oh_god_data_8_is_being_taught_by_sahai_fall_2020/,2020-07-26 10:34:37,"I heard terrible things about Sahai regarding his teaching CS 70.  I vowed not to take one of his courses and now I have learned that he is teaching a course I require at a crucial time.  

How screwed am I?  Should I prepare my anus?


EDIT:  I have been informed that the Sahai teaching Data 8 is not the infamous Sahai.  

No longer panicking.","Different Sahai, not the infamous one
Swupnil Sahai is not Anant Sahai. I had Swupnil as a lecturer for data 8 and he was decent.
[removed]
You think declaring DS would save you...
how terrifying can a professor really get
If you are in Data 8 for Fall 2020, could you tell me if lectures are uploaded up onto bcourses like the day of the actual lecture? Do they put it up before th lecture even happens or after the live lecture happens? and if after, how long does it usually take them to upload the recording?
This threw me off and didn‚Äôt sign up for it but now that I realized I am now regretting F
Sometimes ‚Äúthey‚Äù are nice enough to use lube.  But most of the time, all you can do is bite the pillow.
‚ÄúThere is no escape!!!‚Äù
Just type in ‚ÄúSahai‚Äù in the search box for the Berkeley subreddit.  There should be multiple posts excoriating the infamous Sahai for his teaching methods.
They use a separate website:  

data8.org

They put up a lecture recording after live lecture.  I don‚Äôt know how long it takes them to post the lecture recordings.
If you‚Äôre an incoming freshman there are still a few seats left
I‚Äôm an upperclassman unfortunately"
