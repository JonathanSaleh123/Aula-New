"Professor Edward Frenkel of Mathematics, doing an AMA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3bvydv/iama_edward_frenkel_mathematician_and_author_of/,2015-07-03 13:19:10,,"No he isn't 
there is almost no point to him doing an ama. he's an academic with extremely specialized and abstruse interests. what are you going to ask him about? the Langlands program? right. the 10 people in the world who have real technical questions about it are in school, have advisors, collaborators, and mathoverflow. you think he gives a shit that you're confused about calculus? no motherfucker, he wants to promote himself and his work.


And you, obviously, want to promote your ignorance. Good job!
Ty for your ama professor, sucks that it got interrupted with the recent drama.
ps your numberphile antiAI argument sucks.
you're not exactly a mainstream celebrity, entrepreneur, public figure, etc. what do 99.999% of people have to talk about with you? seriously

maybe, just maybe, you already knew what kind of crowd you were dealing with. 
/r/iama and reddit in general is a big place and an ama doesn't have to be an ultra-serious critique of a person's life's work. I don't see how any ama can do more harm than good.
One of the most upvoted AMA's of all time is a guy with two dicks. If he can post an AMA (which I read and enjoyed btw), I'd like to see prof frenkel's, where you are free to voice your opinion of him with questions."
UC Berkeley math professor Edward Frenkel on The Colbert Report!,http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/xj9d66/edward-frenkel,2014-04-08 09:03:34,,"when i was taking math 53, the only thing i could think about was how i would go gay for this man. hell i would have sex with his handwriting if i could.
From Russia with love....and math.

Math 53 and the waitlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4n7zv5/math_53_and_the_waitlist/,2016-06-08 16:18:45,"So I'm planning to take Math 53 in my first semester this fall.  There are two lectures: one by Edward Frenkel and one by John Steel.  I read that John Steel's lectures aren't really good, so I want to take Math 53 with Edward Frenkel.  However, all of his discussion sections are already full, and I can only sign up for the waitlist.  
1) How likely that I will be accepted from the waitlist?  
2) Anyone have any good/bad experiences with Steel?
  
Thanks in advance!","Generally about 10% of students will drop the course so a lot of people on the waitlist will get in. Your best bet is to sign up for a discussion section where you are number 1 or 2 on the waitlist even if it doesn't fit your schedule, once you get into the course you can work something out with the GSIs so you can attend one that fits your schedule.
What is your rank on the list?
Thanks.  How do I check the rank on the waitlist?
Could I ask how I can check that on Schedule Planner?
It should tell you your rank when you add yourself to the waitlist. You can also check the schedule of classes to see which sections have the smallest waitlists."
Easiest Upper Div Math?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7hw17p/easiest_upper_div_math/,2017-12-05 21:41:49,"I'm an engineering upperclassman looking for an easy upper division math class as a technical elective.

I'm enrolled in Math 110 with Edward Frenkel and on the waitlist for 128A with John Strain, which class would have the lighter workload or easier grading?","110
For whatever reason, this question popped up frequently two years ago. Consider taking a look at those threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/37nc8z/upper_div_math_class/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/32v69t/best_upperdiv_math_classes_to_take/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/34wxsk/hows_math_116_as_a_first_math_upper_div/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/33shcr/recently_admitted_looking_for_adviceexperience/).

In the future, also consider posting questions like this to the [Q&A thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7gzx44/15_are_you_prepared_for_finals_or_prepared_to/) currently pinned to the top of the subreddit.

Good luck!
Strain grades generously (and is hilarious and engaging as a lecturer), but the homework assignments he gives are pretty intense. Math 110 is a more reasonable workload but with a lower average grade. 
128a and 110 are both not very hard, the programming assignments for 128a especially are a joke
Ive heard Strain homeworks are very long. I’d wait to take 128A with Ming Gu where the workload isn’t as intense. Frenkel may be the easiest 110 teacher out there so don’t leave that. 
Can you elaborate on why? I'm leaning a little towards 128A because Strain curves to around a B+, whereas Frenkel usually to a B-/B. Are both classes about equal workload and suited well to someone who hasn't taken upper division math?
I'll have to take one of these two next semester, and I'll honestly settle for whichever one I can get the highest grade in as long as the workload isn't ridiculous.

Which one do you think would be better suited for an engineering major with little experience in proof-based math? I thought 128A might be okay since I have MATLAB experience, but if the workload is that intense I'm having second thoughts...
I think it's because it's Linear Algebra but with proof writing . Most people already understand the concepts, it's just now they need to apply proof writing to it. 

128A is alot less proof writing, in fact it's mostly just calculations. Unless it's the final, where they pull out every proof you didn't bother reading. 
I took 128a this semester and the psets were so long, eventually I just stopped doing them-- they aren't very helpful in learning the material-- it's just plug and chug. The exams are completely off from what is taught in lecture or given in homework. (Edit: I took it with Ming Gu, which commenter above said is the ""lighter"" workload...)

MATLAB experience helps you only very slightly. I don't know about Strain, but for our second (final) project, we literally just had to change some variable values and add a couple more from a code file the professor gave us on his website and turn it in. The first one was not too much more difficult either. So overall, it was a complete mental drain and not intellectually stimulating at all. I haven't taken 110 yet, but I do not recommend 128a at all unless you reallllyyyy care about learning about how computers approximate roots/derivatives/integrals/ODEs/Systems"
"Famous Philosophy Professor Groped His Employee And Watched Porn In Front Of Her, Lawsuit Claims [Prof. Searle]",https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/famous-philosophy-professor-accused-sexual-harassment?utm_term=.nymEp4YXo#.gmLVxD2q6,2017-03-23 11:58:07,,"damn I am currently in the class he stepped down from ... that's nuts, what a scandal
Even if porn is playing in front of him, he's not really SEEING it, is he? Maybe his eyes are perceiving it, but he's not actually watching it.
Oh wow. Hadn't been following the news so I didn't know about the previous complaints. My friends loved his class and I sat in on a few lectures. 
If he wanted to watch porn in front of his students then he should have just created a Decal called, History of Pornography.
dude I love aphex twin
so not surprised. he would always get attractive young ladies to be his ""research assistant,"" despite not being a top student. pissed my frirnds off back in the day
Sad, but not surprising.
In his day, he was one of the most (in)famous professors on campus. 
Damn. Definitely seems consistent with this story. Wonder if he was always this way or sort of declined into awfulness. 
[deleted]
This is rape culture. Searle needs to have his tenure revoked and put in jail with the keys thrown into the ocean.
What kind of porn? Couples porn no big deal. But interracial anal gangbang, wait a minute bro...
Was there any notice in advance that he was going to step down from teaching? Or he just sent an email to students he's out? Seems pretty irresponsible (no matter how famous he is) to just give up and gtfo from the campus once the scandal was exposed.
A Chinese Room full of adult videos.
Also heard he's a huge asshole in front of students though. At least not a friendly/approachable professor.
""When hot stud Edward Frenkel does something porn related, it's awesome. When I, an old man, do it, it's called sexual harassment.""
me too lol (finally found another fan here)
[deleted]
Even other profs low key knew this shit
he stepped down a few weeks before the news broke. just showed up to class one day and he wasn't there. dean of the philosophy department was there w/ our new teacher, told everyone that professor searle had had to step down due to personal issues

I honestly thought it was the consequence of his advanced age tbh
In this case, I don't think the difference has anything to do with age and looks. I think ""making an erotic film using your own time and money and not on university property"" is different from ""forcing your university employees to watch pornography."" Sure Edward Frenkel made something porn related, but he didn't force anybody to watch it (or even know that it existed).
wut"
