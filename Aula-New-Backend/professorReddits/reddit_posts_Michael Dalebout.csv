Hello Rhetoric Majors! :-),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qa3uoe/hello_rhetoric_majors/,2021-10-17 10:54:45,"Hi everybody! I’m wondering if anybody here is studying rhetoric and is willing to talk to me about the department. I’m an applied math major and I’m not really acquainted with humanities departments here, but I love writing and am eager to take some rhetoric courses!

How would you describe the major? Do the classes tend to fill up? Are lower divs necessary to build a foundation for taking upper div classes?","The rhetoric major is centered around a required four-course series: Rhetoric 10/20/103A/103B. Broadly, Rhetoric 20 and 103B focus on rhetorical analysis and theory, beginning (roughly) with Karl Marx in the 19th century and ending with (post)modern theory, including, for example, Donna Haraway, a feminist postmodernist philosopher of science. Rhetoric 10 and 103A, meanwhile, are more concerned with the development of rhetoric as a field and object of study, so the classes range from the ancient Greeks (think Homer, Aristotle, etc.) to Enlightenment-era philosophy (Kant, Bacon, others). These courses are intended to build your knowledge of the rhetorical canon; the theorists and theories that most folks in the department are basically familiar with and use as a starting point in their work. More broadly, these courses show you the frameworks through how rhetoricians are taught to understand the world around them and their selves. You don't have to take these classes in order, but it's strongly suggested that among the four, your first be at least either 10/20.

From there, rhetoric upper division courses are divided into three concentrations: history and theory, public discourse, and narrative and image. History and theory tend to be the more theoretical courses, public discourse is generally rhetoric of law/philosophy, and narrative and image are the more applied classes—rhetoric of poetry, rhetoric of the image, rhetoric of the film, etc. I've personally found that folks in public discourse tend to be going to law school, history and theory to grad school, and narrative and image are kinda varied. Whichever concentration you choose, you need to take 3 courses in your concentration, 1 course in each of the other concentrations, and 1 course in another department that is related to your concentration. It's very easy to switch concentrations, so you don't need to stress to much about which one you pick.

How upper division courses tend to work is that a few of the courses tend to be more popular than the rest, so a couple may fill up quickly, although not always. The department, however, does try to accommodate people, and in some cases will expand class sizes accordingly—one class a few semesters back reached 50 students. I've never heard of someone unable to take a rhetoric class because it was full. Most students take classes that they're either plainly just interested in, or with professors that they like—since the requirements for the major are so minimal, you don't really need to be concerned with the requirements. 10 classes over 4 years is like... 1-2 classes per semester.

The upper division courses don't require taking the four-course base sequence, although you'll learn the most if you've taken at least one class between 10/103A and one class between 20/103B. Sometimes—but not always, and not to the same degree—the upper division courses will build on knowledge from those course sequences. Many classes will, for example, consider Foucault's *History of Sexuality*, which is taught is in the 20/103B sequence, because his exploration of discursive exercises of power (through the example of the construction of European sexuality, although it applies to many other things) is relevant to a lot of topics. 

The professors generally have disciplinary focuses which they sustain in their course offerings. Nasser Zakariya will almost invariably teach courses that touch on the history of science, particularly in the early modern and modern periods. Nancy Weston usually has a course related to the rhetoric of philosophy in some fashion. Winnie Wong teaches classes related to art and authorship, although she's been expanding to consider more scientific topics. David Bates also does science, although he's more focused on AI and tech. Marianne Constable does a lot on rhetoric and law, although she also does freshman seminars on movement because she is a Feldenkrais practitioner. Fumi Okiji, the department's newest member, focuses on Black feminist studies and performance. (There are more professors, with more disciplines, but you get my point). Consequently, because the faculty's interests are so widespread, the department has a particular interdisciplinary focus you won't find in many other places.

The department also hosts a number of R1A and R1B courses—taught mostly by GSIs and some lecturers—a class on public speaking (30), and two general-interest rhetoric classes (C50, C60). None of them are required for the major, but they might be a good starting point if you're interested in the major (except for 30, which I imagine is intended to teach a somewhat specific set of skills). I'd also particularly recommend Rhetoric 20 as another good starting point, just because most people are more interested in modern theory than they are the ancient stuff. 

I'd also like to note that the department also offers extremely strong support for developing writing skills in the major. For the R1A/R1B courses, the Art of Writing program can give you individualized tutoring on writing essays. For the four course sequence and Rhetoric 50/60, Writing Fellows also give you writing advice specific to writing Rhetoric papers. And GSIs and professors, I've found, are always super willing to talk about courses during office hours, which tend not to be very busy (unlike most science classes here at Cal).
Hello!  I graduated too long ago to give you any current tips but I can say that Rhetoric was one of my majors at Cal and I loved it.  I had already aced AP English in high school so I did not want to go right back into reading and analyzing novels in English.  Since I come from a family of lawyers and newspaper owners, I thought Rhetoric would be more practical.  I went to law school, passed the California bar on the first try and have been a practicing lawyer, in the courtroom, since 1986.
wow this is super helpful, thank you!! definitely going to visit a couple office hours tomorrow 

just wondering, what drew you to rhetoric as opposed to philosophy or english?
is rhetoric 30 taught by Michael Dalebout good? thinking about taking it next semester
Will DM you.
I haven't taken the class, so someone else will need to weigh in on how good it is.

What I can say is that that course used to be offered as Rhetoric 2, also taught by Michael Dalebout, during summer sessions. It is now a course taught during the normal academic year, in spring.

Institutions offer summer courses because they bring in money, particularly for people who are trying to expedite completion of major requirements. Given that I don't think Rhetoric 2 did not satisfy any requirements for any major, and also that only a select subset of people are interested in improving their public speaking skills, I'm not particularly surprised it's been phased out as a summer course.

That being said, the course still exists, and the department has made the conscious decision to maintain it as a course offering (which may cost them more money), and the decision to have Dalebout, rather than another person, as the instructor. These are factors that seem promising to me.
You absolutely must take a class with Professor Dalebout if you can"
