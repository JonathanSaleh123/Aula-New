EECS126 with Jiantao Jiao?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18z9svn/eecs126_with_jiantao_jiao/,2024-01-05 07:43:03,How is this version of the class? Any feedback about the professor and if the course is any different from other iterations?,"final distribution was tragicomedy.. ü§° I‚Äôll let others talk more about it‚Ä¶
Ramchandran the goat I would wait for his version
Avoid the class until another prof teaches it, his lectures, exams, and overall logistics are horrible.

Could u expand a bit. I‚Äôm taking this next semüò≠
what
He basically curved the class to a B"
What is your favorite cs/eecs class at Berkeley. What was the hardest one?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cux2el/what_is_your_favorite_cseecs_class_at_berkeley/,2024-05-18 06:14:03,Preferably upper divs ,"CS 189 - so hard but worthwhile
CS 170 - difficult, rewarding
Unpopular opinion but my favorite was 186
favorite? maybe cs 182 with Professor Sahai. Hardest? EECS 127 with Professor Courtade. The hardest class I‚Äôve taken here was Stat 210A with Professor Fithian. Though I expect the hardest classes at this school to be in the math department, or maybe Stat 210B
Favorite is CS 170; it's quite difficult but super rewarding and the content is really cool.

Hardest is STAT 210B, got absolutely cooked.
Favorite: 161/189 hardest: 170
Favorite but hard - CS 170.
EECS126 on top üîù
Both are 162. It feels like this mechanics classes where you spend all semester taking apart and then reconstructing and engine to understand it. A harrowing experience but beyond informative.
Favourite: EECS 127
Hardest: Data 140
151
189 and 161 (favorite). Admittedly, I took them because of the hype surrounding those fields, but I ultimately liked them because the concepts were so cool, profs were cool and passionate about what they were teaching, and well structured.

  
Also very unpopular opinion but 16B lol. It was *a l*o*t*, but I put in a lot into the class and learned a ton. Really solidified my linear algebra concepts.
126 (courtade) - this is probably more because courtade is so good at teaching. Also good coz probability is fundamental for future classes in ML l/deep learning

184 (ren ng) - graphics projects are fun. Final project is super open ended to try and build anything. Ren makes an effort to know his students that go to his office hours regularly.
Favorite: 170, Hardest: 127
Favorite: 162. Also hardest lol
Favorite: 162

Hardest: 127
Lol because everyone is putting upper divs, heres a lower div one: CS88 (Data C88C).

Its a 3 unit alternative to 61A but slower pace and less stressful. Though wasn‚Äôt new to coding when first started, it was nice to not have a stress of the face-paced and the difficulty of the exam and projects 61A went through. Also had it with Michael Ball, which was awesome :D

Only downside is it can fulfill the DS req but not CS, but was a DS major so oh well üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Honestly CS 161; super cool to see how everything works
182 is best
Cs 162, I love low level bit twiddling though, so possibly not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, hardest 170.¬†
184/126
126 üôå
CS 170 taught me precise, concrete thinking

you can get A/A- w/o too much studying, it‚Äôs more abt thinking
i took 152 this sem and liked it a lot but boy did I get clapped by that class (for a comparison, I thought 189 and 126 were easier classes). i heard people say that doing 162 beforehand is useful though I cant comment on that since I'm taking 162 next sem
162 and 162
EE226A was the most rewarding. 162 definitely the hardest and hated every second of it
damn I hated that class. To each their own hahaha
Whose bright idea was it to have every single exam question involve counting out the exact number of operations? Also this course is hilariously boomer. The profs do know their shit, so I don't know why they continue to make this a course on counting instead of adding more useful content.
Yeah 210A was absolutely brutal. I loved it though.
Actually? I‚Äôm taking it in the fall and was curious how people like it
Would u say the eecs 127 and cs 162 the same semester is too much
Opposite for me, how bad did you find 127?
Im taking this in the fall with the FPGA lab. Any advice?
U thought 127 was harder than 162?
because it‚Äôs easy to grade, the exams used to be more interesting (like twenty years ago) but that doesn‚Äôt scale to hundreds of students. that said I‚Äôm told that course staff have heard the feedback that people dislike iops counting and they are looking into changing the format.

Who is your professor
I have no way to answer that, honestly. From what I know 127 is a very theory heavy class and lots of proofs, where 162 is 95% writing, reading or debugging code. There would be pretty marginal overlap and they‚Äôre both heavy workload. 

With that said most upperdiv classes are structured in a way that it‚Äôs very difficult to receive a non-passing grade, so you can probably pass them. Then it‚Äôs just a question of how much you care about grades and/or pursuing extracurriculars and socializing. 

I can‚Äôt answer if it‚Äôs too much, I can only say that it‚Äôd be a lot for most people.
Did this over the last semester with a good 162 group and meh linear algebra skills. It was definitely a lot and I would not recommend.
I found 127 to be absolutely lovely. In general I have affinity with linear algebra over probability and stats.
Yeah. I liked and was better at programming-based courses over mathematical ones. But 162 was plenty hard
got any advice specific for getting into database research? üëÄ
Jiantao Jiao
Thanks beast
the sad thing is I really like 127 and got a great grade in lin alg, but just did not do welll overall. I really wanna review the content still and see what gaps I can fill:) Got a good grade in 140 tho.
I heard Jiantao is not a great professor tbh
jiao is a good prof, I was in 126 just now. I think he had some growing pains in fall 126 because it was his first time teaching undergrads but 126 spring was better and I think it will likely be even better in the fall based on the way he has responded to fwedback
I had Ramachadran. It is both the hardest class I‚Äôve taken conceptually (adjusted for how old I was when I took it) and my favorite :D. It is just so interesting"
