Getting Ahead During Break,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/egqbt7/getting_ahead_during_break/,2019-12-28 04:40:49,"I didn’t do too great this semester so I wanted to get a head start during the break, could anyone give me any insight on the work load for the following classes? Or maybe point me to a resource that can?

French 1 w/ Daniel Hoffman
Sociol 1 w/ Robert Braun (?) 
Sociol 127 w/ Edwin Lin
Sociol 169C w/ Edwin Lin
Spanish 135 w/ Nasser Meerkhan

I’m obviously not planning on taking them all but I wanted to gauge the work load to decide. Thank you!","Preface: I've never taken any of those classes, so take this comment with a grain of salt. 

In my opinion, the best thing that you can do to get ahead is to take the break to relax and destress. Play some video games, read a book, try a psychadelic or two....whatever suits you. 

Trying to ""get ahead"" over the break will just leave you burnt out when the semester starts.
I took 135 with Meerkhan.
Stay on top of the readings with him...don’t slack...review your Spanish grammar over break (especially formal essay writing vocab and grammar) since that affects your grade more than you think...generally it’s a chill class though compared to some other classes I’ve taken
Hey! Recently graduated from Berkeley (Fall 2019). For context, I took SOCIOL 169C (Cross Cultural Communications) for Fall 2019 (A) for three units so I can attest to the character of Professor Lin and the workload of the specific class for a three-unit student. There are a little more assignments for that class if you are taking it for 4 units.

In regards to the workload of 169C, there really isn't much that you're graded on. In fact, I don't think I've batted an eye at the readings until the final paper came around (I only used three sources for that paper and just skimmed them). At the beginning weeks of class, you will do your proposal for a cultural sub group project. The class, in my opinion, is centered around the project for you have two assignments based on that project: a headstart for your final paper aptly named ""Deep Description of Cultural Sub Group"" (4-5 pages, double spaced)and the final paper for the project. (8-10 pages, double spaced).

There is also a cultural self-analysis paper (4-5 pages, double spaced) in the early stages of the class. As long as you start on the papers a week to a week and a half before they're due, you'll be solid. 

Everything else such as participation, a group presentation, and a presentation within a small group during the latter weeks of class is pretty easy to get. Just be sure to engage with your peers and professor and you'll be fine on that front.

Professor Lin is pretty chill. Very talkative but tries his best to get the class engaged with others and with him.

**TL:DR 169C is a pretty easy class provided that you get a headstart on the papers and be engaged with your peers and professors. Lin is a nice guy, you'll find him cool.** 

PS: I suggest you don't get ahead during break because burning out before the beginning of the semester is pretty bad. Don't know about the other classes and the other one that you may potentially take with Lin (SOCIOL 127) but I wish you the best of luck.  


Feel free to PM with questions! Go Bears!
I’ll be sure to review my grammar for sure, thanks for the advice!
Thank you for such a detailed comment !! I really appreciate it :) you’re though I shouldn’t get ahead"

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"
