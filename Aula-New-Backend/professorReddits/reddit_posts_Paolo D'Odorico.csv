Picking Classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l3u4pm/picking_classes/,2021-01-23 22:25:25,"Hi, I'm looking to transfer out of one of my classes, and I'm trying to decide which class to change into.  All the options I've narrowed down would fulfill a major or breadth requirement, so I just need help finding something that is interesting (it's ok if it's a little difficult), so if you have any experience with these classes or professors, that would be super helpful! The four options I'm considering are: 

Special Topics in Asia - Keiko Yamanka - Global 150Q

History of Modern Israel - Eran Kaplan - History 100M

Intro to Real Estate and Urban Land Economics - Mark McGranahan - UGBA 180

Intro to Environmental Sciences - Matthew Potts, Paolo D'odorico - ESPM 15","i took espm 15 last spring and it was interesting. we covered a ton of different topics in environmental science which i thought was cool, it sorta felt like a survey of all the different sub-fields of environmental science. pretty chill class too
Awesome, thank you!"
