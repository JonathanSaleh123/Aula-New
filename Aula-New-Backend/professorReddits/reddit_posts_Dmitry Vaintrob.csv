Dmitry Vaintrob for Math 113 in the spring,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9qtg3d/dmitry_vaintrob_for_math_113_in_the_spring/,2018-10-23 14:41:48,"Looks like he was just appointed this year so there's no online reviews, but I also see he's teaching 113 this (fall) semester. Anyone here taking it with him? How is he?","\+1
Did you figure out what textbook he uses?
Fraleigh's introduction to abstract algebra, seventh edition.
Thanks! Do you have his syllabus or course outline by chance?
https://math.berkeley.edu/~vaintrob/math113.html Not sure if this is from the current semester or fall 2015-- either way it seems unlikely he'll make drastic changes next semester. Looks like he actually puts effort into writing the homework problems himself, so that seems like a good sign to me.
Damn thanks mate. Are you taking him for 113 next semester?
Yup!"
Math 104 instructors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jf2zvn/math_104_instructors/,2020-10-20 18:05:24,"Sup everyone, Im looking for a good professor for real analysis next semester, but there are a lot of choices:

Mariusz Wodzicki

Yu-Wei Fan
	
Koji Shimizu 

Peng Zhou

Dmitry Vaintrob

Ian Charlesworth

Which one should I go with?","Definitely not Wodzicki. Heard good things about Yu-Wei Fan. One of my friends who took it with Shimizu said it was the worst thing he’d ever done
I’m taking it with Vaintrob rn. He’s a good guy but his lectures are not great, they’re all over the place and he is constantly making errors and correcting himself. It seems like he doesn’t prep for the lessons at all and his notation is totally inconsistent. He has also taken over a month to grade our midterms in a class of 25
Really?  Everyone I know absolutely loves Shimizu.
Ahh maybe you’re right. Math 104 is just ass no matter who you’re taking it with, I’m in it rn"
