Does Econ 100a have a discussion section attendance requirement?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zquivs/does_econ_100a_have_a_discussion_section/,2022-12-20 09:40:35,I'm considering scheduling something during one of my econ 100a discussion sections with Professor Campbell are the discussions worth it?,"discussion section isnâ€™t mandatory, the GSI just goes through problems in the course pack
Discussions aren't mandatory, but you need to do a presentation during one of the discussions, so realistically you only need to show up to one discussion to do your presentation.
When I took the class in SP20 with David Roland-Holst, section attendance was graded (6% of final grade)
It doesn't, but I really regret not attending all of them. They are useful for midterm prep, especially when you are juggling other requirements of the class which is a whole other skillset (since the assignments and the final are essay-based)."
