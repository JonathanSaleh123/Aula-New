"rate my schedule, advice/insights",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/192wjen/rate_my_schedule_adviceinsights/,2024-01-09 17:58:04,"hi! i am a freshman (2027) pre-med taking these classes and would like to know if this schedule is feasible, if you have any advice for the courses, or if you have reviews on the professors. please let me know!

* CHEM 3A - Peter Marsden
* Theater 25AC - Angela Marino
* BIO 1B -  John P Huelsenbeck, Michal Ilana Shuldman, Benjamin Wong Blonder, Benjamin K Blackman
* R1A
* Decal","This is a reasonable schedule in my opinion! Marsden has optional HW (you would still want to do it because the HW mirrors the exam) but if you don't feel like doing it you'd always have the flexibility!

BIO 1B is not set up like a weeder class compared to BIO 1A, but it is still a difficult class because of the memorization. The labs are fully done in-lab, so there's no lab report or anything like that due after class.

I haven't taken the rest but this seems very reasonable
Marsden is the best professorv
OMG! THR 25AC is going to be an absolute blast! I had a different professor for that class, but I had Angela for THR 119 and she is the absolute best! She’s really understanding about mental health, time conflicts, etc and just wants to encourage discussion :) Of course THR 25AC tends to be a bit bigger than the upper divs, but I’m sure it’ll be the same in terms of vibes :) Hope you have a great time with her!
hi! no advice but i wanted to say im also taking similar classes w bio 1b:) also pre med! we got this fr
Marsden is amazing! Have fun
The only note is that I believe the BIO 1B and CHEM 3A finals are usually back to back on the same day, but if you’re alright with that, then it looks good!
thank you so much!
what were your thoughts with THTR 119?
yes yes!!!
My class experience was a bit interesting for THR 119. Because of the events in October, our class discussions turned away from actual reading material. A lot of my friends in the class disliked it, but I previously felt like she made a safe space in the class and it was very nice to be able to talk about whatever. The only bad thing is she randomly drops assignments on you. Our final felt like it came out of nowhere. However, I had a lot of fun in the class :)"
IB C153 (Ecology) Difficulty?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y559tc/ib_c153_ecology_difficulty/,2022-10-15 19:24:41,"Hey! Soon to be graduating, but I just need 1 more biology course (literally any biology), and I was wondering what the difficulty of IB153 (Ecology) with Onja Razafindratsima and Benjamin Wong Blonder would be? Friend of mine has taken it and said it was easy but I can't find the Berkeleytime data for Spring 22. Any insight? Or any other recommendation for any other Bio classes next sem?","i am ib major. i have not taken this class but i think it should be a pretty cool class if you like ecology/nature. you can find syllabus on ib website. i do think such class suits people with prior ecology biology experience, at least some encounter in high school or bio1b. also, usually these classes ask you to do field trips or natural history observation, so if you dont like walking outside or observing trees, squirrels, or insects frequently, maybe dont take it. also, this is an upper division class. if you just want to take a bio class to fulfill requirement, maybe take a lower division class in ib. they are much more chill and easy and fun if you like the topic (same applied to lower classes in mcb, plant bio etc)
Hi! Did you end up taking this class? If so, how was it? Planning on taking it next spring and I'm curious about the workload.
Appreciate it man! It has to be an upper division, and I've taken bio1B, so perhaps it would be a good fit."
