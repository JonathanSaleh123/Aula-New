Anthro 2AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eqnna7/anthro_2ac/,2020-01-18 14:41:48,"How is Jun Sunseri for Anthro 2AC, and if going to lecture/discussion is beneficial","I had him Fall 2018 for anthro 2AC and I would say that going to discussion is worth your while- you do discussion activities that can really help your grade and you get a lot of help with the final project if you go towards the end of the class. Prof Sunseri is a mediocre lecturer who thinks he’s a good lecturer- i found that he kind of rambled and I didn’t really grasp the point of a lot of his lectures. You have weekly quizzes on reading and lecture though, which are a not insignificant portion of your grade, so I guess you need to see how much his lecturing style bothers you to decide if it’s worth it to go. Overall the class was pretty easy, although there was a large final project that required you to take a field trip with your group outside of class and discussion time. The material is interesting, even if the professor is just okay."
Does Kent Lightfoot still teach Anthro 2AC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/902ub4/does_kent_lightfoot_still_teach_anthro_2ac/,2018-07-18 21:53:52,"Next semester, Jun Sunseri will teach the course. Do u guys happen to know if Lightfoot still teaches it? Thanks!","I loved having him back in the day.  He was hilarious.  You're missing out on learning about Roberta if he's not teaching it any more.
He taught it last fall semester. Not sure if plans on teaching it in the future. He didn’t say anything about it being his last time when I had him"
