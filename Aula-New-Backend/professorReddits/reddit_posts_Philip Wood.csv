Math 53 Professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e6esdd/math_53_professor/,2019-12-05 01:18:42,How are Prof. Philip Wood and Prof. Emiliano Gomez for Math 53? Thanks!,"I don’t know Wood, but I can strongly recommend Gomez. I have him for number theory right now, and he’s been an amazing teacher. He’s compassionate and works hard to make the material enjoyable and understandable for students. (Not to imply it’s easy! Number theory has been pretty challenging, haha)
How are the assignments and tests that Gomez usually gives out? Is he a good lecturer?
Homework has been fairly challenging (with a few *very* hard problems), but he gives hard homework with the understanding that students can come in to office hours or use Piazza. (His office hours are very helpful). I wouldn't be surprised if his approach is slightly different for Math 53, however; number theory is an elective upper division course with under 40 students.

Tests have been very fair. If you have a solid understanding of the material, you'll do well; he's not thrown out huge curveballs.

And yeah, I'd say he's a good lecturer. He tries to make lectures engaging, and makes a point of clarifying ambiguous points from the book."
Help: Which Professor should I take for Math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/djhxai/help_which_professor_should_i_take_for_math_104/,2019-10-17 20:54:00,"Currently my options are; **Nicholas Miller, Mariusz Wodzicki, Ryan A Hass,**  **Yu-Wei Fan,**  **Sebastian Eterovic, Rui Wang,**  **Philip J Wood**

Thanks for the help!","Not wodzicki if you value your sanity.  I've heard very good about Hass.
I have Hass right now for 104 and he’s a wonderful teacher! Lectures are very example based, and he walks around the classroom chatting with students. Neat notes for if you miss a class, very fair midterm 1 (aside from one question but whatever), and generally available.
Echoing the comments about Hass - he's a very engaging lecturer which I find relatively uncommon among professors, and his assignments are reasonable
Can vouch for Yu-Wei Fan! amazing chalkboard work, his clarity in lecture is superb, and he answers every question thoughtfully and precisely. Every student who’s gone to his office hours lauds him for his helpfulness.

He is also great at managing admin stuff, keeping us students well informed about what material will be covered, and about upcoming deadlines. 

11/10 in my book. And I come from CC, where I feel like I had great professors, but was definitely coddled.
Not Wang. She means well but the language barrier and accent makes her hard to understand, at least for me.
Rui Wang, and I cannot stress this enough. Crystal clear lecturer (unless you have an issue with her accent - see another comment below) and is incredibly helpful during office hours and always open to questions. Of all the classes I've taken at cal so far, analysis with Professor Wang probably made me smarter more than any other class has. I found it difficult initially, but that is by virtue of the difficulty of the material and my inexperience coming into the class - not because of quality of instruction. She uses Rudin, and will give you a rigorous foundation in basic topological concepts that should prepare you well for 202 A/B. She structures the class logically, so that you get a complete treatment of the constructions of the reals, and almost everything is generalised to topological spaces and metric spaces, unlike other sections which may just state a completeness axiom for the reals, and then specify all work to the reals for the majority of the semester and do some basic work with metric spaces in the last two weeks (making for a very boring, and much easier class). You will also get some very basic introductory concepts in functional analysis which few of the other sections bother introducing at all (equicontinuity, uniform convergence, arzela ascoli).  I would take her again in a heartbeat. The only possible qualm you may have is her accent, and that the class is rather fast paced if you do not have any background in proof based math at the level of abstraction that 104 goes into (I did not. Many others found the pace just right or too slow even). I for one, did not find her accent particularly hard to follow."
