Only the Upper Div classes on this list.

Membership and Migration: Empirical and Normative Perspectives w/ **Sarah Seong-Sim Song,** **Irene Bloemraad**","Zook is a classic answer. Many students recommend his class if it’s your first upper div or just in general since there’s no discussion section, the readings and assignments are light, and he’s very enthusiastic during lectures and definitely a funny character. He usually tries to end lectures 30 minutes early. Recently, he’s also kept his covid semester recordings posted, so you could technically just not show up to class since the information usually doesn’t change too much.
Definitely Kent, he’s super man pretty much

I have a personal soft spot for Prof. Wittenberg (Witty!!!), but I know others feel differently. I took Eastern Europe with him two years ago, easily one of the most informative region-focused classes I've taken. Workload is fairly heavy though, Prof. Wittenberg loves his in-class essay exams.

Prof. Zook is easily the most entertaining and energetic PS prof that I've taken. SE Asia is one of the easier PS classes, but you definitely learn a lot. 10/10 recommend, especially if you're looking for cuisine recommendations lol.

I took Prof Mattes during the Zoom U era. I enjoyed her lectures and she was very responsive and helpful during OH, but the Zoom format made the class organized weirdly. YMMV. 

There are a few profs who I would strongly suggest to avoid, but none of them are here, PM me if you want my negative takes lol.

Side Note: Are the course offerings seriously that thin this semester? Why is there only one IR class?
Take anything with Helene Silverberg, Terri Bimes, OR Darren Zook (if you want an interesting class that happens to be the easiest PoliSci course at UC Berkeley)
These are just the classes that are still open! I am making a late change of major to PoliSci and will only be able to enroll in phase two, so I'm taking what I can get.
Seconded for Silverberg
Ahhhh makes sense. Yeah I've sort of been there too. Heck, in two years of UD I never got my first pick of PS classes lol, so you really do get what you can take."
