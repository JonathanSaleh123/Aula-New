What's with all the free space on Thursday and Friday??? Oski would be absolutely disappointed, and you'll bring shame to your family for generations.
easy! maybe add a weekend job for extra cash?
I thought you wanna have lunch with me :/
Dude is speed running college ðŸ’€
Never know there are 7am classes
Holy shit how many units is this
certainly there's a Friday PM seminar you can fit in there...
too many empty spots
No weekend classes? I hope you are doing an internship or fellowship too.
Only if you're ok with graduating later smh my head
Youâ€™re slacking off on Friday evenings.  Surely there must be a Chem 1a or EECS 16x class you could have taken with a Friday evening lab.
you forgot to  schedule time for crying
Itâ€™s enough to train a LLM
lil bro is taking math 202B and math 105 at the same time
Where are the extracurriculars? Need to join at least 5 clubs, one per day of the week
Too much free time, maybe get a job? ðŸ¤”
Rookie number
When I was at Berkeley I actually became Evanâ€™s hall. So like step it up
Too much free time Tu/Th mornings.
Looks like youâ€™ve got a bunch of lines of smarties
You forgot to add Yogurt Park to 6pm Friday.
Only one lab that goes to 10pm? Weak sauce.
There is no way you wonâ€™t have conflicting final exam times
I'm assuming your weekends are free, pls add some online classes to it
YOLO
Glad you got your r5b in
Seems a little light, maybe you should try applying yourself lol
add a few decals to cover the gaps after 9 and 10
That ChicanX studies class is gonna be tough
lol this is edited right?
where is cs70?
bro's gonna levitate to class
Itâ€™s Scandinavian so they are probably practicing daylight saving /s
itâ€™s alright I have seen people took 105 AFTER taking 202B
CS70 --> EECS 126"
I need some advice about CS classes. Help please?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/srhlm/i_need_some_advice_about_cs_classes_help_please/,2012-04-25 01:20:42,"Freshman CS/CogSci double major here, but I'm more concerned about CS right now. I've taken Math 1A, Math 1B, CS 61A, and CS 61B. I need to take CS 61C, CS 70, Math 54, and EE 42 next year in order to be able to declare at the end of the spring semester. A few questions:  
  
  
**Math 54 & CS 70**  
I talked to Barbara Hightower, and she recommended taking Math 54 before CS 70 because of CS 70's ""mathematical maturity"" requirement. However, all of my friends who have taken CS 70 say that they don't think taking Math 54 beforehand would help all that much with CS 70. The main reason I'd like to take CS 70 before Math 54 is because of the professors â€“ from what I've heard, Vazirani is good and the Math 54 professors (Grunbaum and Voiculescu) aren't great. Would I be at a disadvantage if I took CS 70 before Math 54?
  
**EE 42 & CS 61C**  
Barbara recommended taking EE 42 alongside Math 54 to balance out the workload, because according to her, Math 54 and CS 61C have lighter workloads than CS 70 and EE 42. I'd like to take CS 61C in the spring with Dan Garcia because I hear he's awesome, but if I do this, I'll end up taking CS 70 and EE 42 together in the fall. Would the combined workload of these classes be too heavy?
  
**Phase I/II**  
Any advice on which classes I should phase 1 / phase 2? My phase 1 appointment is on Thursday, which seems pretty late. The other classes Iâ€™m planning on taking are Linguistics 100 and Linguistics 106. (If anyone has anything to share about those classes, that'd be great too!)  
  
  
***TL;DR:***  
- My ideal situation: CS 70 & EE 42 in the fall, and Math 54 & CS 61C in the spring  
- Barbara's advice: Math 54 & EE 42 in the fall, and CS 70 & CS 61C in the spring  
1. Would I be at a disadvantage if I took CS 70 before Math 54?  
2. Would the combined workload of CS 70 and EE 42 be too heavy?  
3. Any advice on which classes I should phase 1 / phase 2?  
  

Thanks in advance, and sorry about the wall of text!","Math 54 and CS 70 are not really related. There's no need to take one before the other.
CS70 is a fairly light workload, and I have heard 61C is actually very heavy. I didn't take 54 before 70 and I didn't have any problems with it but YMMV. Don't Phase I 61C as it is a massive class and as long as you don't have last pick phase 2 you should be fine.
Take 61C with Garcia. I had him for 61C and he was an amazing lecturer.

I had 54 with Voiculescu as well and I'll honestly say that by the second week, hardly a single person was attending lecture because he just read straight from the textbook and it wasn't at all helpful.

Other than that, I agree with everything the other commenters said.
If you don't take EE43 (the lab class) with EE42, then I don't think it'll be that much work. You could potentially hate your schedule though as CS70/EE42 are very hit or miss. A lot of people just aren't interested in EE42, and CS70 has simple ideas but non-trivial assignments that can get kind of frustrating. I took 54 before CS70 but it wasn't really a purposeful decision; it just made sense for me to take 54 right after 53. 
I had Garcia for 61C. He was an amazing teacher, but I also thought the class was pretty tough and a ton of work (though I'm more of an EE guy so maybe that had something to do with it. 

I haven't taken EE42, but I've taken 40 and 42 is kind of the easier version for non-EECS majors, especially if you don't take the lab (which many CS people I know don't).

Honestly, I would say that 61C is a more difficult class (or at the very least is a ton of work, especially if you take it with Garcia), and 42 is probably a little easier and less work, maybe on par with CS 70.
So I've heard. Thanks!
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind!
Thanks! I'm looking forward to 61C :) Math 54, not so much. Haha
I'm definitely not planning on taking EE 43, haha. Thanks for the warning!
This was helpful, thanks!"
