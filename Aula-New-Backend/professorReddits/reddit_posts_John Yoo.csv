UC Berkeley is employing a war criminal ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush\_Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_Six)). I don't think that it's right for the University of California to continue to pay the bills of the man who authored one of the most evil American policies in recent history. 

If you would like to help put pressure on the people complicit in his employment, here are some links. Feel free to copy my text, or write your own.

""UC Berkeley is employing a war criminal"".

Whether someone is a criminal is determined by a court. Did a court try him?  If yes, did a court find him guilty?  If yes, did he appeal and lose that appeal, determining it to be a fair trial?

My understanding is that the answers are ""no"", ""no"", and ""no"" respectively.

Your post should read ""UC Berkeley is employing SOMEONE WHO I THINK SHOULD BE TRIED FOR war crimes."". It's great that you have an opinion.  Thankfully, in the US today, someone's opinion is not enough to convict a person of a crime.
He's also advising Trump on how he can stay in office if voted out.
I would just invite you to read the following, to which the United States is a party
https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Torture_and_Other_Cruel,_Inhuman_or_Degrading_Treatment_or_Punishment
To read an account of the methods used in the interrogations of the Guantanamo Bay detainees
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_interrogation_techniques
And to read about the content of the so called “Torture Memos”
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Memos
I would the invite you to think on what freedom of thought, expression, and speech mean, especially in the context of a public official, whose words and decrees shape policy. Did Lincoln free the slaves? Did Stalin kill hundreds of thousands of Poles? Did bin Laden topple the World Trade Centers? Or was it the pen in their fingers, giving direction to those who carried out the act, which has made each responsible for those things?

I think that there is a material difference between a law professor in a journal, writing an opinion on torture, which one might disagree with, and a Deputy Assistant Attorney General who is writing *the* opinion which will become *the* policy.
I don’t think he should be removed for the charge. I think that he should be removed for his actions. Actions which lead to the torture and death of people detained in Guantanamo Bay and other US detention sites around the globe. 

I think that your example regarding a person being proven innocent begs the question. He hasn’t been “proven innocent.” There are documents and reports you can read for yourself. He gave recommendations in an official capacity, those recommendations were followed, and people suffered. I don’t think those actions should be protected, by the courts or the university. But I think I can more effectively petition for a change here than I can petition for a war crimes tribunal."
Berkeley’s worst professor: John Yoo denies he accused White House Ukraine official of espionage,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/misconception-john-yoo-denies-he-accused-white-house-ukraine-official-of-espionage,2019-10-31 07:46:05,,"I'm surprised the Examiner called him the ""worst"" professor (he is).
What an embarrassment.  The man's nose seems to be firmly planted up Trump's butt.
That's not the actual title of the article.
Worst in what sense?
And that means nothing in the general discussion here.
The memo in the Bush W admin that torture is OK? He's a right wing ideologue.
As a professor, he's barely around. He's always on a speaking engagement or a book tour or something. He doesn't want to work, but he doesn't want to leave and the UC doesn't want to try to fire him. He gets assigned one remedial law course a semester, but doesn't really want to teach it, and the school has to have a stand-in to teach when he's not around.

In the past he was heavily criticized for his legal memos. He would do things like cite himself in his work, which is an abnormal thing to do in a legal paper. His torture memo has been described as poorly reasoned. He didn't produce good work, but rather he filled the bare minimum requirements so the Bush admin had things on paper that looked official.

He got mocked by legal scholars and by historians after he said that the founding fathers wouldn't want Trump to be impeached so close to an election. The historical record proves John Yoo to be incorrect.
More than that, he pioneered the legal reasoning that said you’re allowed to crush a child’s testicles among other fun means of torture
And he helped expand surveillance programs, including the mass surveillance of US citizens.
Oh okay, let’s burn him at the stake.
>He doesn't want to work, but he doesn't want to leave and the UC doesn't want to try to fire him. He gets assigned one remedial law course a semester, but doesn't really want to teach it, and the school has to have a stand-in to teach when he's not around.

This just isn't true.  First, there aren't any ""remedial law"" courses taught at Berkeley Law, unless you're referring to the ""Remedies"" class, which Yoo doesn't teach because it's a business law class and he's a constitutional law professor.  Second, professors at top-tier law schools are primarily judged on publications rather than teaching...and he has published 7 books in the last 8 years as well as numerous papers.  The idea that ""he doesn't want to work"" is just false.

>He would do things like cite himself in his work, which is an abnormal thing to do in a legal paper.

This is actually common among law professors.

>He didn't produce good work, but rather he filled the bare minimum requirements so the Bush admin had things on paper that looked official.

He was already a tenured professor at Berkeley when he joined the Bush administration.  No one gets tenure at a top law school by ""filling the bare minimum requirements.""

Look, there are lots of reasons to hate John Yoo and if you attack him on moral grounds, I'm happy to join in.  But claiming that he is a bad professor because he doesn't want to work or engages in shoddy intellectualism is incorrect.
It’s hilarious I’m reading this because I just heard about him for the first time about 30 minutes ago as they are advertising a talk he is doing in San Diego soon
Incorrect about what?
Yeh he's a real POS.
OK by me. He might actually enjoy it.
> professors at top-tier law schools are primarily judged on publications rather than teaching...and he has published 7 books in the last 8 years as well as numerous papers. 

Wouldn’t this be a measure of a researcher and not a professor? I know if my professor was too important to show up to almost every lecture I would absolutely consider him a bad professor.
Updoot for clarity.
Go online and do research on the criticism about the memo, coming from people who worked in policy, law, and even worked in the Bush administration. There is a lot of criticism that his work for Bush was poorly argued.

There are objections to his work aside from moral criticism. There are honest and well reasoned objections to his work on legal grounds and intellectual grounds.
can you read?
>Wouldn’t this be a measure of a researcher and not a professor?

Not at ""research universities,"" which Berkeley considers itself.  

When I attended Berkeley Law Yoo's classes always had a waitlist to get in and he was generally popular amongst the students who took his classes.  His attendance was never an issue, and I'm curious why you think he missed almost every lecture (or maybe you are just exaggerating for effect)?
It’s very bad form to make a claim and then ask someone else to do the leg-work. If you claim it, support it yourself.
I don’t know what is being referred to as incorrect,
Nah man, this is the first I’m hearing about all this and I’m just curious so I’m trying to get as much perspective as possible - I was going off the comment you responded to:

> As a professor, he's barely around

In my opinion (the student’s perspective), that’s basically the bare minimum measure of a competent professor; all the research they do probably matters more to the graduate students and researchers. That being said, you’ve directly refuted that concern so I don’t disagree with your conclusion.
I don't know if things have changed, but he was teaching a required class. It caused a controversy.  So, there was a time where there definitely was a wait list, but it wasn't because he was all that popular of a person. That's not to say that he didn't have his fans. I'm sure there were also people who wanted to challenge him or debate him, so they liked being in his class for that reason.
Makes sense.  If you're interested in understanding more about Yoo, I'd recommend checking out the Jon Stewart interview with him back in 2010 (this is long, here's part 1: [http://www.cc.com/video-clips/flktqb/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-exclusive---john-yoo-extended-interview-pt--1](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/flktqb/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-exclusive---john-yoo-extended-interview-pt--1))

The interview shows how smart Yoo is, how charming he is, and how Jon Stewart was unable to make Yoo look as though he had done anything wrong.  Of course, he did do something morally wrong: his memo created a legal framework to give the president broad authority to torture certain people (but proving that it is legally wrong is much, much harder).
How much of John Yoo's work is research? His op-eds aren't research, nor are his appearances on Fox News. His speaking tours weren't research. His books like Crisis and Command or War by Other Means weren't research. The guy is more of a political pundent than he is a researcher. He's been that way for years.
Jon Stewart was an entertainer who had a tv show. He wasn't a legal scholar or anything. He was heavily criticized for his inept interview, and it's considered to be one of his worst interviews. There are various articles about the disastrous ""debate"".

Colin Powell said that the memo was ""catastrophically poor legal reasoning"".  Other people who worked in policy and law had called the memo  ""deeply flawed"" and ""sloppily reasoned"". There's tons of criticism of what Yoo wrote, and that criticism matters more than the voice of a comedian."
"TIL that John Yoo, a UC Berkeley prof, helped develop the legal justification for the Bush administration's policy on surveillance by the NSA and ""enhanced interrogation techniques"".",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Yoo#Career,2014-11-13 13:36:11,,"Have you never seen the ""Arrest John Yoo"" signs around campus""
""Enhanced interrogation techniques""=Torture

These are some of the ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (according to former CIA officials):

1. Waterboarding
2. Hypothermia
3. Stress positions
4. Abdomen strikes 
5. Insult slap
6. Shaking

Also, US Armed Forces used:

1. Yelling
2. Loud music and light control
3. Environmental manipulation
4. Sleep deprivation
5. Stress positions
6. 20-hour interrogations  
7. Controlled fear

According to the NY Times:

>Experts advising the Bush administration on new interrogation rules warn that harsh techniques used since 2001 terrorist attacks are outmoded, amateurish and unreliable.

You could not be more wrong. Americans fighting for the War on Terror do not have to follow international laws for war. That's only for everyone else!
Either that or a man of extreme ignorance. The scientific community has never validated whether those extreme torture tactics work or not. So without relying on any scientific evidence whatsoever, he wrote up these torture memos because he put it on faith that the president and CIA knew what they were doing. 

He believed that the president should be able to act unilaterally from congress in time of war for quick action against the enemies. He never had the foresight to question whether those quick actions might be retarded or scientifically inaccurate.

"UC Berkeley Torture Supporter tells Fox News ""trump should not be impeached"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/djegtj/uc_berkeley_torture_supporter_tells_fox_news/,2019-10-17 16:13:47,Fire John Yoo!,"I don't agree with him, but this is textbook academic freedom. We don't fire academics for their opinions.
Another classic tropicalstream post. All sensation and editorializing, no substance and no context.
There is a point when academia and morality meet, and as a professor in the realm of law, his legal opinions are not just wrong but illegal in the court of international law. 

https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=61042&p=392134

Yoo's logic is based on his defense of an illigitimate president who is tearing apart basic constitutional norms not being eligible for impeachment because the founding fathers had constitutional language that prevented impeachment based on a ""one year rule"". This legal theory is wrong on several levels. One, we are not within a year. Two, he does not cite any evidence for this language. It is false. His legal methods are not only morally wrong but premised in fallacy.

Fire John Yoo!
His opinions may be wrong and unsubstantiated, but they are not, as you put it, ""illegal,"" at least not in a country that truly values free speech.

If you actually think that opinions should be fireable offenses at a university, then you're missing the point of a university.
He's a tenured professor.  If you think he's going to be fired for expressing an opinion (however wrong) about a political situation, you're awfully naive."
