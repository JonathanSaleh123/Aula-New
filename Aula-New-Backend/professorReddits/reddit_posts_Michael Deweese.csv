Physics 8A with Michael DeWeese,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dr8t9c/physics_8a_with_michael_deweese/,2019-11-03 15:36:58,Hey guys! I was wondering if anyone’s taking physics with DeWeese. He’s teaching 8A in the Spring as was thinking of taking his class. He has a few reviews on rate my professor but most are for the 5 or 7 series. Any insight is helpful!,"If you have to suffer through physics, taking it with Mike is 100% the best way to minimize that suffering.
He is awesome! Had him for 8A a couple of years back and he teaches in a very digestible and fun way. Plus, he is a weirdly good artist and his exam questions all include fun little hand drawn sketches."
MCB/Pre-Med summer class recc?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bho1kt/mcbpremed_summer_class_recc/,2024-03-18 04:04:25,"I’m a freshmen MCB major and I want to take a major requirement this summer but I don’t know what to take any recommendations? 
I was considering Physics 8A with Michael DeWeese but his rate my professor has mixed reviews. 

","Chem 3A/3AL if you want to get ahead of the game, but be warned that taking this during the summer is basically a part-time, almost full-time, job. The commitment is no joke"
