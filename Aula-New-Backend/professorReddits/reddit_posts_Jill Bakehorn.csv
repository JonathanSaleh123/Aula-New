Farewell to UC Berkeley's Class of 2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/glspuf/farewell_to_uc_berkeleys_class_of_2020/,2020-05-17 19:22:29,"Here's a video from the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs, and couple of professors from Cal congratulating the UC Berkeley graduates of 2020! Listen to their life advice, watch them play instruments, and more. They range from teaching at Cal for 7 years all the way to 34 years (FUN FACT: their messages are actually in increasing order from least to most years at Cal)
