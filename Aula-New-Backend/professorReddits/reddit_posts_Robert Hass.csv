Yeah, those unknown professors like Michael Pollan who has given a TED talk, been on national television numerous times, and authored 5 New York Times best sellers. Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.  Truly, he deserves some sort of award to signify the important contributions he has made.
Most if not all of these are extremely well-known and have won many awards.
Robert Hass is excellent. He writes a lot about human connection with our environment. So does the other poetry professor next semester (John Shoptaw).

is good, as well as

His poems also have themes of semiotics, for the linguistics/philosophy/literary theory people out there.

That is, (my interpretation), if we see a blackberry and describe it as a ""blackberry"", as in ""I saw a blackberry today,"" we've essentially destroyed that blackberry's uniqueness and identity, unified it with all the other blackberries in the world. Just saying the word ""blackberry"" at once marks the funeral of that specific blackberry and sings its final elegy. There is, I think, the value of silence: in appreciating some Thing without putting a name to it, that clouds our judgement with our memories of all the other Things of that name (ever met a girl with the same name as your ex?).

That last line just struck me as particularly beautiful when I read it, as a sharp upper bound on what humans are able to communicate with each other.
What a BS article. That is not a list of *unknown* people.
At least as famous as a critical theorist, especially one focused on a field as specific as gender theory, can hope to be. I think all of us humanities people pray to be even half as notable as her.

Perlmutter too.

At least article writer can take solace that the Nobel committee agrees  with them that these guys ""deserve an award""? :P"
Syllabus for ESPM C12/Eng C77: Intro To Environmental Studies,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f534xy/syllabus_for_espm_c12eng_c77_intro_to/,2020-02-16 20:28:13,"This is a long shot, but was wondering if anyone has a copy of the syllabus for Intro To Environmental Studies, taught by Robert Hass and Gary Sposito? I don't know if it's offered anymore, but it used to be a staple course for years [https://english.berkeley.edu/courses/1269](https://english.berkeley.edu/courses/1269).  


I was a student '09-'13 and took the course in Fall '11. I sold my readers ages ago but am trying to track down a piece we read in the class and I can't find copies of the syllabus anywhere online. I don't imagine the readings changed drastically year to year, so a syllabus from any year is fine. Thanks!",
