Stats 20 with Adam Lucas or Shobhana Murali Stoyanov?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6vmdi0/stats_20_with_adam_lucas_or_shobhana_murali/,2017-08-23 15:00:09,"Hi guys I'm deciding which professors to take at the minute. I'm an intended econ major and would really want to meet the gpa cutoff. Which of these two professors is better? Any advice to do well in the class is also greatly appreciated!

Many thanks in advance!","I took Stoyanov and I would advise against it if you have the option. Many people I know who took Lucas weren't to unhappy but I can safely say that he's better than Stoyanov. It's not that she's mean or whatever but I would say she is not a very good teacher. Stat 20 as a whole is basically reliant on if you have a good or bad GSI.
Took Lucas for another course. He's great at teaching and damn funny too. He's not as connected to GSIs as you might expect, so if you need support for the course admin stuff, contact him directly.
I've had both. Lucas is definitely better
Had lucas for 131a - pretty big fan of his style, funny as well
Thank you for the advice!
Thank you for the suggestion! So far I feel his lectures are very well paced.
Thank you for the feedback, was his test very tricky? Any tips on how to do well in his course? 
His tests aren't tricky. He's a really nice professor so just pay attention and you'll be fine"
Stat 20 professor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wkikwq/stat_20_professor/,2022-08-09 16:56:02,"Can anyone recommend a professor for Stat20 for this fall? For fall there is Iain Carmichael, Shobhana Murali Stoyanov, Jeremy Sanchez, and Andrew Bray (waitlist tho).

I'm currently enrolled for Stoyanov but I saw some comments from ratemyprofessor and trying to get some opinions from others. I'm an intended econ major so I hope to meet the gpa requirement to declare this semester :,)","Jeremy Sanchez was my GSI last semester and Andrew Bray was my prof last semester. Both of them are really nice and helpful, I would say Jeremy is really new so Iâ€™m not sure how he would teach in a big lecture class but if u attend his office hours and ask questions you should be fine with him!
Andrew Bay all the way!
i had stoyanov (asynch) and her exams were in-person and we were allowed 4 pg cheat sheets. her coursework is decently doable but her lecturing is not the best. class is curved as well so you should be fine if u can score above avg and take the time to review concepts wo being lecture dependent.
Andrew Bray for sure! If this isn't too late, I had him for Stat 20 and had an absolutely amazing time in his class."
How is Murali Stoyanov for stat 20 ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6mhjf3/how_is_murali_stoyanov_for_stat_20/,2017-07-10 14:19:46,"Had anyone taken her class ? How was it? What are some study tips you can kindly provide, I'm little freaked out from all the horrible reviews I read about her.","The reviews are too kind. She's fucking awful. Her pacing is garbage, her class atmosphere isn't conducive to asking questions, she starts off being ""cool"" but gets pissy and starts throwing hissy fits halfway through the semester, etc. If you can take the class with someone else or put it off to another semester, I'd seriously recommend you consider that. 
I took that class with her as well and I agree with the other post. Biggest point is that her class atmosphere truly isn't very nice or welcoming. You don't feel like she gives a shit about any of you and she calls people out pretty often and makes people feel dumb for answering wrong/asking a slightly less than advanced question.

The class itself isn't the easiest either, so honestly you're in the hands of your GSI, and if you get lucky with a good one, more power to you.
I've never taken Stat 20, but I did take Stat 155 (Game Theory) with her. She was actually a great professor - took her time to make sure things were understandable; gave out lecture packets (this meant that if you already knew the material, you could move ahead); explained the homework very well. 

The behavior difference between the two of the reviews here and mine might be chalked up to the upper/lower-division difference, where selection bias of the students enrolled plays a large part. That said, if you know your stuff and make yourself known to Shobhana, she will treat you kindly and you'll be happier.
Im gonna disagree with the other two posters. I thought that she was an engaging professor that was pretty funny. I liked her teaching style for the most part, and thought that I learned the material relatively well. However, almost all of the GSI's for that class (I took stat 21 with her but everything was the same) were pretty terrible, and the class had the single worst curve of any class I have ever seen.
Damn, I have to take her or else I can't declare my major ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Yikes..... I'm waitlisted for her class.. How was your overall experience with her? Things I should look out for?
Oh boy, balls to the wall I have no other choices lol
Any tips you can spare to do well in the class ? Thank you !!
Oh right, I blocked it out in my head but yeah all the GSIs are pretty garbage too. One of my friends literally visited a discussion taught by every single GSI to see which one was best and his verdict was ""none, they all suck.""
From my own personal experience, the homework is on the easier side, although it's relatively regular and due on weekend nights so you'll have to make sure you don't forget about them or otherwise screw yourself over. 

The midterms and finals are the hardest part of the class. You get a cheatsheet, but the sheer volume of material (aka formulas...) is the hardest part to keep track of. Some intro stats courses are more intuitive and conceptual- this one is very much rote memorization. The midterms and final cover the same concepts and have the same general style of problem as the homework, which is nice, but ratcheted up one level in difficulty generally. Stay on top of your studying. 

Lecture slides are posted online but not particularly helpful. I'd recommend going to lecture itself so that you don't miss anything, but lecture is only marginally more helpful. It mostly just feels shitty going to lecture because she takes like two or three lectures to get through what she allotted one lecture for, and the second half of the course is consequently rushed and sloppily taught. Plus she's really antagonistic half the time in lecture, so it's just not a very nice experience overall. 

Overall, it's not like the material is hard. The class just has a large emphasis on midterms and the final because pretty much everyone does pretty well on the homework, so it's essentially irrelevant when calculating the course curve. 
I'm guessing you're an econ transfer?  

I wouldn't stress *too* much over it, but don't take it too lightly either. All you need is a B- or better in that class. I'm not saying that's easy, but I mean it's not like they make you get an A. 

Word of caution though, and I know i'm not the only one who felt this way: When I sat down to take the final I legitimately thought I was either in the wrong class or studied the wrong final material. As a professor, she isn't much better or worse than the average Berkeley experience, but it just seems like she isn't very concerned with any students who aren't exactly geniuses.
Thanks for the feedback! It's going to be a pain in the ass having to wake up at 8 AM every morning. Definitely not excited for that. :/"
Which Stat 20 Professor Should I Take in the Fall?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/c029rx/which_stat_20_professor_should_i_take_in_the_fall/,2019-06-12 23:21:28,"Hi everyone, 

This is kinda early but I'm an incoming cc transfer student that has to take Stat 20 to declare econ my first semester. Prof. Murali Stoyanov and Prof. Ibser are the only ones teaching it and I'm kinda spooked by their bad reviews so far. Which professor do you think would be easier? Also, I would really appreciate any study tips or other advice.","I took Ibser. Wasnâ€™t a pleasant experience imo. I heard in class that the other teacher was better, but canâ€™t vouch for that directly. If youâ€™re taking this class to fulfill the stats requirement for Econ, I recommend taking one of the other approved stats classes, as Iâ€™ve heard they are easier. 

Edit: my friend took C8 or 88, canâ€™t remember which, but when he looked at what I was doing in my class he was spooked haha.
Stoyanov is alright. She definitely gives you all the material you need to know (discussion sheets, book) and there werenâ€™t any surprises on the exam. If you have any questions lmk I took her last year
hey, thanks for the help! I would have to take both C8 and 88 for econ (6 units total) but for some reason 88 doesnâ€™t seem to be offered in the fall. The other option would be 134 Concepts of Probability with Adam Lucas and that seems really tough too cuz itâ€™s upper division. 21/W21 isnâ€™t offered in the fall either. It seems that Iâ€™m pretty much screwed with any option ahaha.
Dmed you

was attendance required?
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be fine with both Stats 20 professors. Just donâ€™t underestimate stats bc I know a few other transfers that didnâ€™t get into the major because of that class. Hopefully youâ€™ll get a good GSI - I didnâ€™t, but I still got in haha.
On the Stat001 piazza, Adhikari said the course is getting restructured and that sheâ€™ll put out the times around Phase 2 to meet the probability requirement for the Data Science major/upcoming minor. Hopefully it will fit in your schedule once it comes out! Iâ€™ve heard pretty awful things about Stat 20, but if you can fit the 6 units in for the Data 8/Stat 88 option, it sounds a lot better. Data 8 was really fun
Yeah she used iClicker - I think she gives you 4? free days though. I don't remember if Ibser used iClicker though
>Stoyanov

Any chance of getting into data 8 in the fall if it's all full right now? Also will stat 88 be offered in the fall i cant find the listing on the schedule
stat 88 will be opened in phase 2, and it's also going to be 3 units now not 2 units ([source](https://piazza.com/class/jua820aaxcq1o6?cid=10))
I guess they adjusted it to 3 units bc ppl were saying how it was a hard class to only be 2 units lol"
