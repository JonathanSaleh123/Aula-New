Prof. Ali Niknejad of UC Berkeley has suggested some great EE books,http://www.doradolist.com/ali-niknejad.html,2017-12-09 16:56:26,,"Whenever I see Prof. _____ of _____ has _____ I immediately expect some terrible scandal or unpleasant surprise.  Thanks for the wholesome post to prove me wrong, OP!
anything similar for cs books from another prof?
Didn't look at all profs, but there are CS books taught in other schools. For example: http://www.doradolist.com/mit-computerscience.html"
Advice for EE classes for Fall and Spring 2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice_for_ee_classes_for_fall_and_spring_2022/,2022-04-21 11:34:11,"For context, I'll be a senior (EECS) next academic year.

Classes I have taken CS61ABC, EECS16AB, PHYS7ABC, MATH1AB, MATH54, and CS70

&#x200B;

Questions:

1. Is the workload manageable (for each semester) if I take the following classes?
2. Are these sufficient to jumpstart an EE career after graduating?

&#x200B;

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

105 with Ali M Niknejad - 4 units

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball  - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123, 130 and 189

Note: Was thinking of taking 140 in Spring but turns out it is only offered in Fall. So chose 130 instead.

&#x200B;

Thanks for the help!

This schedule sounds like a nightmare, and I would break it up if you could.
Yeah agree fall 2022 sounds tough

I see, since I was planning to P/NP 1 class per sem so maybe P/NP 105 for Fall (only need 20 UD units to graduate). Do you think this is a good idea (since I only have a year left)?
Yeah, I tried to fit 105 & 130 in there. Another option would be 120 & 151 for Fall and 123 and 189 for Spring.

Either way, I'm enrolling in the above classes and maybe tweak (P/NP or drop a class) as the semester goes.
I decided to do the following for now:

188->189  
120->123  
151

I decided to not take 105 and 140 to allow myself to really understand 120 and 151 which seem like the two most important classes according to a lot of people!

If I want to go into DSP, do you think it hurts if I don't take 105 and 140, or does it not really matter in the long run? What about Hardware companies in general?"
Advice for what UD classes to complete before graduating for an EE/Hardware career,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8vpfq/advice_for_what_ud_classes_to_complete_before/,2022-04-21 12:39:06,"So I guess this would be a follow-up post to my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice\_for\_ee\_classes\_for\_fall\_and\_spring\_2022/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice_for_ee_classes_for_fall_and_spring_2022/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So here is my current plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

105 with Ali M Niknejad - 4 units

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123, 130 and 189

&#x200B;

Replies from original posts mentioned that the workload for Fall might be too crazy.

And so I have an alternative plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123 and 189

&#x200B;

So it all boils down to if I graduate finishing 5 UD classes (120, 123, 151, 188, and 189). Would this be a good set of classes to take for an EE/hardware job?

If not then I'm forced to go with the first plan and finish 7 UD classes (105, 120, 123, 130, 151, 188, and 189) and suffer for 2 semesters.

 Thanks for the help!","Don’t take 188. Useless for your career goals and imo pointless to take in general. 

Taking 120/151 are a must. Simply putting 151 on my resume got me interviews from top hardware companies.

If you’re up for it you could squeeze one of 126/127 (I liked 127 better)
Since I’m not an analog hardware engineer maybe I shouldn’t comment, but if you’re interested in that kind of work I would almost suggest using summer to self study 105 and taking 140 next fall instead. I’ve heard that 105 is a good class but won’t get you any job interviews by itself. 120/140/151 will be a heavy workload but if you truly have a passion for these things I think you’ll learn a lot and have fun.
Thank you for your reply! Does it matter if I take 105 and 130 for hardware? Does having them benefit a lot? Does not having them hurt? I'm for sure taking 120, 123, and 151 just not sure about 105 and 130."
