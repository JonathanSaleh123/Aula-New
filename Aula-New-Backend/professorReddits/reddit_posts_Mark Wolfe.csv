RunningWolf For Berkeley Mayor ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12pvvn/runningwolf_for_berkeley_mayor/,2012-11-05 23:14:00,"Vote Green Party candidate Runningwolf for Berkeley mayor.  

The candidate proposes a pedestrian plaza on Telegraph Ave from Dwight to Bancroft.  Closing the stretch of Telegraph approaching UCB to cars will create an open promenade for cafe tables, music, art, and will make it easier for people to interact with vendors.  Freeing the space between People's Park and the UC to pedestrian traffic will revitalize that part of Telegraph into a new social space, benefiting businesses and neighbors.

Reducing traffic is a reoccurring theme; a bicycle lending program in Berkeley (modeled after successful bike loan programs in Europe and some US cities) will reinforce a bicycle culture.  Road maintainace is a major expense for Berkeley; the costs of supporting programs that get people out of cars will be less than the costs of maintaining a car culture.  

The Green Party candidate was a community leader in the Memorial Oak Grove Tree Sit, is a volunteer in the People's Park community, and helps with the food charity organization Food Not Bombs.  RunningWolf led a native vigil at Occupy Oakland which held down the plaza after the eviction.

RunningWolf was a Berkeley Peace and Justice Commissioner, and is active in civic discourse at city council and police review commission meetings.

As a Green Party candidate, the environment is the big issue.  Berkeley has to invest in cleaning the soil, water and air.  Berkeley needs an economy that seriously deals in urban agriculture, green transportation, cleaning the bay, and a firmer commitment to honoring natural space. 

As Berkeley has rank choice voting (3 choices for mayor), Runningwolf endorses follow up votes for Jacquelyn McCormick and Mark Schwartz (write-in candidate).",Calling Whacko Zhacko a demagogue insults demagogues because they actually attract support.
