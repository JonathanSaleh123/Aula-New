Lovejoy 113 syllabus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j3eg7e/lovejoy_113_syllabus/,2020-10-01 11:37:26,"Hi everyone, just wondering if anyone who's taken Math 113 with Jeremy Lovejoy has a copy of his syllabus, as he doesn't post them on his Berkeley page. I've heard he's pretty good and I'd just like to see how he structures his class/what the pace is. If anyone's currently in his class, how does he deal w/lectures & exams while remote? Thanks ahead of time and go bears! 

P.S. I'm also taking 104 in Spring, what teachers are good? Currently only Koji Shimizu is listed, who I've heard good things about, along with Ryan Hass.","in the class right now, here's the syllabus:

I will say though his lectures aren't anything amazing imo, they're definitely not bad but I've eventually resorted to external resources because his lectures don't bring much new insight. the class in entirely asynchronous and we get 24 hours for exams though, which is kinda nice.
Ryan Hass is the best, great lectures and really nice guy who makes himself available for OH and emails. 

Summer discussions were kinda awkward but I think most zoom classes are like that.
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it!"
