English,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1377hy2/english/,2023-05-03 19:38:05,I am an upcoming freshman at UC Berkeley. I was wondering if I dont meet any of the requirements for the ELRW if I have to take colwrit1a or if I can just take 1A and 1B. I am taking the AP lang exam in a few days and if I do pass that I dont have to take colwrit right? Can I take regular 1A and 1B if I dont have the EWRL prereqs or do I have to take colwrit1a?,"There will be a placement test sent out to freshmen soon, and if you pass with a good enough score, you can go straight to R1A. If you don't pass it AND you don't qualify for any of the criteria, you must take COLWRIT1A.
i took colwrit and it wasn’t bad. we had to do 4 essays, if that’s something you can manage
How hard is COLWRIT1A for someone who is not that good at English? And how was the placement test difficulty?
May I ask who your prof was?
I have not taken COLWRIT1A and neither the placement test because I got a 5 in AP Lang and did R1B at a CC while in high school. However, COLWRIT1A is designed for people with difficulty in English. However, it's 6 units so it would be time consuming, I believe (I heard it doesn't feel like 6 units though)
I heard it is 6 units and difficult
I was in fpf when i took the COLWRIT class, and the prof was Joseph Horton
i took it, and it felt like a regular 4 unit class
Oh alright, is it too late to take a community college class to pass the requirement?
What is fpf
fall program for first semester i think, idk if you google it there’s more information about it
oh alr thanks. I checked the prof on rmp and is there a second grader for the portfolio who is harsh?
basically at the end of the semester you have to put all your essays you worked on in a portfolio, and an outside grader grades your work. your grade is based on the outside graders opinion, and the professors (this is for all COLWRIT classes and not just my prof). of course the class isn’t going to be easy, you have to put in a lot of work. but i passed the class with an A-, and i’m not the smartest person out there. work hard, go to the writing program that’s on campus, and you’ll be fine.
Awesome thank you so much. There's people at berkeley who can help with looking over and help improve writing skills right?
yea, you just got to reach out and find help."
