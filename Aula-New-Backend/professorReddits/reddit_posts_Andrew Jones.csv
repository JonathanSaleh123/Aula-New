Chinese 157 with Andrew Jones,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15t5xhu/chinese_157_with_andrew_jones/,2023-08-16 16:32:40,Has anyone taken this course? Are class discussions and papers in Chinese? I'm concerned that my Chinese isn't good enough to take the course.,"I'm also in this class and have the same questions lol. What Chinese language class are you in?
I took AP Chinese in high school and got a 5 on the exam. I dropped the class though after emailing the professor and I read online that you need to have completed Chinese 100 series (Advanced Chinese) at Cal
I didn't complete the series but I think it depends on what you tested into. I tested into Chinese 102 and I talked to him and he said that it'd be fine."
Berkeley PPP $150k+,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hnxyhs/berkeley_ppp_150k/,2020-07-08 23:10:50,"Having ample time on my hands due to lockdown, I decided to make a google map of the PPP loans given to Berkeley businesses (aka SBA Paycheck Protection Program).

**Here is a map of all businesses in Berkeley that received over $150k in loans:** [https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1OiHIzv3r9Bfo0uHgkkxw2Kz7t9suC0IJ&usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1OiHIzv3r9Bfo0uHgkkxw2Kz7t9suC0IJ&usp=sharing)

This dataset includes: 

* Loan recipient name & address 
* Range of loan 

**7 Berkeley companies received $2-5 million:**

* Andrew M. Jordan, Inc. 
* Ashby Lumber
* Crossroads Trading Co., Inc. 
* Doughtronics, Inc. 
* International Child Resource Exchange Institute
* Moore Iacifano Goltsman, Inc. (?) 
* Technical Safety Services, Inc. 

**5 Berkeley companies received $5-10 million:** 

* Backroads
* Berkeley Cement, Inc.
* Meyer Sound Laboratories, Inc. 
* O.C. Jones & Sons, Inc. 
* Ovid Research Company

**And here are some of the linked Berkeley companies that received loans:**

* Cal Dining: $150-350k
* California Alumni Association: $1-2 million
* The Faculty Club: $350k-1 million
* UC Berkeley Center for Executive Education: $350k-1 million

I'll be looking through the <$150k dataset soon and will update this map accordingly. The original dataset (both under and above $150k) from the Treasury Dept. is here: [https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data)

Please PM me if you find any errors. Go Bears!","[deleted]
Since you posted a question mark: [Moore lacifano goltsman](https://www.migcom.com/) is a design agency, apparently
Since when is crossroads a fucking small business? Thanks for the detective work.

Is there a point to this? Are you trying to shame them for using the program?
What is this data for? Is there any benefit to knowing this?
Sorry about that--just changed it. Please let me know if you still can't see it.
It should be fixed now!
The data are from the Payroll Protection Plan/small business loans given out a few months ago by the Treasury Dept. The benefit to knowing this is to be better informed about the economic situation of businesses around you."
