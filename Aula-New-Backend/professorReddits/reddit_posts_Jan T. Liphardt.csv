Rant: this school is too expensive to be this trash,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1atnexd/rant_this_school_is_too_expensive_to_be_this_trash/,2024-02-17 22:18:49,"There‚Äôs never any places to sit, study, eat anything without the constant horde of students. I can‚Äôt even get an appointment with a counselor because they‚Äôre literally ALWAYS booked. The WiFi hasn‚Äôt worked consistently in weeks. The bathrooms are constantly disgusting, there‚Äôs literally not enough of them to accommodate the amount of students here. Same for the libraries, dining halls, fucking classes. The GYM!?! And on top of that students have to constantly worry about their safety and learn about things like shootings from social media because we don‚Äôt get warned until hours later? The elevator in my building hasn‚Äôt worked since Jan 15?? I‚Äôm losing my goddamn mind. I can‚Äôt even do the bare minimum and study because THERES NO FUCKING WIFI!! I already pay 40k a year to come here and now I have to buy a shitty $6 latte every day just so I can use their shitty free WiFi even tho I already paid the school to have those amenities?? wtf is going on. Who can I write to, who can we sue, how do we solve this problem?? There‚Äôs already so many issues that are directly linked the school not being able to accommodate the number of students here and now they‚Äôre about to enroll MORE??? This is unreal. What do we do guys, real talk.","go bears
This campus was built for a few thousand students.  It has not been built for the 40K+ students,faculty, staff, and guests at any time.

I genuinely feel this to my core. I pay an obscene rent in an old building where the singular coin-operated washing machine doesn‚Äôt even properly clean clothes. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on anymore
Absolutely. The university is over enrolling and it's turning the entire school and the area to a shit show.
For comparison:

Stanford campus is literally 8X bigger than Berkeley with the number of students admitted capped at less than half (20k) what is here today (46k). We were and still are being packed tight like Sardines (relatively speaking).

In my day ('75 and 30k), we had lower division courses in 300-500 seat lecture halls, which were filled to overflow, not sure if the lecture halls are much bigger today (please advise).  I think it's about the same, no?

There was no WiFi, but there were IBM punch cards and long lines in the basement of Evans to get them punched and into the one campus mainframe, and 30 minutes to get an output. That was pretty rough for a few classes that assigned computer homework.  Today with everything online, you need working WiFi, can't imagine why that is an issue other than fuddle.  From a strict engineering POV, there's zero issue.

In upper division, class sizes dropped to 20 give or take depending on major.  I just Googled and that figure has not budged (please advise).

Coffee and a bagel was about $3 as I recall, mostly for the bagel, which was a sticker shock but it was Peets and fresh baked.  That was an upgrade from instant and a slice of Wonderbread toast at home.

One huge difference is/was tuition.  Immediately post-Reagan it increased over three years from $150/qtr when I started to almost $250 (as I recall).  But it was possible to get a part time job on campus and pay both tuition and buy a couple books.  I was a BART commuter so can't comment on housing costs.
Sadly I hear this complaint from many students at large flagship public universities. I hear similar complaints of too many students and too few resources from friends who went to UCLA and UNC Chapel Hill. 

UCB has so many brilliant students but they should really limit enrollment if they cannot accommodate all their undergrads and grad students. 

If there are no resources you may wonder if the prestige of going to a upper tier UC is even worth it.

In general, Cal just has a very hard time expanding its facility under the current political atmosphere. This is more or less a widespread phenomenon throughout the entire nation‚Äôs blue states, bar a few places like New Jersey. 

I would even go as far as to say that this is a widespread problem that hurts the entire Anglosphere‚Äôs left-leaning areas

When Cal tried to bulldoze people‚Äôs park, you can see on Instagram Live that there were people from Australia (who probably never even set foot in Berkeley at all) says they were in solidarity with the park and yada yada, when students who actually live in the city suffer from lots of QoL issues and decaying infrastructure. The hypocrisy makes my brain hurt so much it is spinning
School needs money since state funding has been dropping since Reagan was governor. So it enrolls more students then it can and raises tuition. But now it has too many students so it needs to build new stuff (like the new transfer housing, called Anchor House, they are building). But in order to get more money the school needs more students and now we‚Äôre back at the beginning. It‚Äôs a never-ending loop of pain and suffering.
UCLA is the same. Overcrowded and that was 30 years ago.
i suggest you get some rest
with moffitt closing for renovation, ig its only down from here too
So sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Hang in there.
I went to Berkeley 2006-2010 and it was already like this. Granted, tuition was lower. But it‚Äôs unfortunately an expected issue with going to a public school that doesn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt build out facilities and keeps enrolling more students.
Wow! Is this just a Berkeley problem or is this typical of large public universities? It adds an additional element to the ongoing debate about whether an private school should even be a consideration for people in states with well-respected public universities. Most people tend to discuss the academic offerings, student outcomes, academic reputation, etc. After reading this post, it seems that people should consider the quality of the everyday experience and the impact of state politics as well.

Wi-Fi here is about as reliable as a fortune cookie predicting your future.
Living in Cali is a blessing and a curse because we‚Äôre one of like four states with halfway-decent public schools but our population is so high that that slimy mf that we call a Governor decides to somehow throttle both quality and acceptance rate to meet demand
Our dorm didn‚Äôt have hot water for the entire day.
Your options for recourse are limited, but you could transfer potentially. This post and others like it will help dissuade high school grads from choosing Berkeley and eventually it will self correct (hopefully). 

You should also realize that what you're actually paying for is being able to write ""UC Berkeley"" on your resume. That's essentially all the value you actually get, and it will definitely be of high value when your job hunt starts.
Classes also too big‚Ä¶. You have not mentioned that.
One thing to remember: the power of Berkeley on your resume. As a former ucsc grad that did post grad classes at Berkeley, the way people would act and want to call me a ‚ÄúBerkeley graduate‚Äù in the workforce was wild. Literally from only listing chem e classes I took on my resumeüòÖ

What you are experiencing sucks. But you‚Äôll have the highest return on your career compared to most other UC grads. Hope it gets better ‚ô•Ô∏è
It‚Äôll get worse
Idiots really enjoy downvoting the fact.
I think there are lots of solutions/things we could be doing. Here are a couple:

1. (for CoL) Accelerate the ongoing housing projects to meet demand. I think people's park housing will be one important step, but we will need a lot of housing to really see cost go down.
2. (for enrollment) A new UC campus in northern California. I do not know where it could go, and many student like Berkeley for its closeness to SF, but this is a pretty good idea imo. 
3. (for resources) Advocate for more state funding? I don't think the amount the state funds UC is a whole lot. Federal funding is also crucial, but that is an even bigger beast to tackle. Also, maybe accrue funding to do the important seismic retrofitting work in Berkeley
4. (for QoL) Advocate in general for better housing policies in dense urban areas in California. Public transportation too. Cherry on top dismantle Prop 13
5. (for space) make the campus bigger idk. I don't think this is totally impossible but I know you would be asking for a fight with the CEQA homeowner people
6. (best solution) annex Stanford

In any case, it's really a matter of money + evidence-driven solutions
But what about how nightmarish the RSF situation it? We need like 4 RSF level facilities for this pop
I'm a prospective transfer student. This is why I only applied to CSUs and Privates. Sorry, but large publics, especially, are catered for research and graduate studies. The undergraduate experience is WAY better elsewhere.
How is the quality of education?  All things being equal, would you still choose UC Berkeley for undergrad? Or perhaps another school?
when I was a student they banned me from the WiFi for torrenting and I had to use mobile data for an entire year lol
But at least we can afford 25 diversity officers!
This is Cal sadly. It's not going to improve quickly. The school is overcrowded due to a lack/mismanagement of investment. Try the Berkeley Central Public Library. The wifi should be better and free just pay attention because the public library can be sketchy.
Tuition strike soon üëÄ?
A lot of the CSU's campus is better than Berkeley ngl. SJSU's one and only library is better than all of our libraries, and their student union feels like the size of Dwinelle. It'd be nice if a little of the money can be used in student accommodations.
I‚Äôm sure there are many less unfortunate ones who would love to have our first-world problems.
lol well...shoulda been an EECS or CS student.  you get 24hr keycard access and there's plenty of places to lounge/work/study/hangout.  at least that's how it was when i went there. 

edit: keycard access you have to pay per semester, but it is worth it :)
4 critiques I'll point out on your post: 1) tuition isn't $40k/yr for most students, it's $15k/yr, which is in line with most public universities. So, for most students, they don't feel like they're paying a premium to be here since it's the same as any other UC or most other public universities. 2) You don't need to buy $6 lattes; go make a $0.50 coffee at home and then go use the wi-fi at the coffee shop (finish your coffee before entering, though). They're not paid enough to give a shit. Paying $6 for coffee is absolutely insane, I don't know how millennials and my fellow Gen Zers can possibly justify spending $6 on a coffee. 3) When you point out how crowded a place is that you're literally at, you're part of the people making it crowded. It's not like they're some separate entity making it crowded, and you're the one who has to suffer. You're as much of the crowding problem as any other student. You're not special. 4) Did you not do extensive research into what UC Berkeley is like before applying and deciding to go here? Why is any of this a surprise? I understand if some of the nuances are surprising, but most of your gripes with the school could have been pretty much realized through some background research.
I agree. Wish I wasn‚Äôt so dumb as a highschooler so I could get accepted into an Ivy League üò≠
the radical left west coast is a modern dystopia
The neurotic politics here makes it hard to make things function properly, which shouldn‚Äôt be a moonshot in any sense
If these young milleniums stopped splurging on their daily $6 lattes they could afford the yearly tuition. Back in my day we used to have to work to earn our degree, these days they just print it for you.

we literally pay the same amount as every other UC? what‚Äôs the problem

Welcome to college
That's what you get for coming as a nonresident to a public school
And people still wonder why I chose ucla over Berkeley‚Ä¶ 
In all seriousness though it is unacceptable that the administration is treating you this way. Tbh a lot of lower level workers really don‚Äôt know much so I would advise demanding speaking to someone higher up (say for ur dorm building and wifi). Although tbh idk how much the wifi can be fixed as ucla has wifi issues too but it may be just because the buildings on both campus are old and make it harder to connect/spotty
You are paying 40k a year or your parents?
Complaining, complaining
It wouldn‚Äôt be college without a lot of complaining. Always has been. Always will be. This is the way.
You wanted to take your snobby liberal ass to Berkeley tho!
Also, Cal kids in my humble opinion, most often say to each other, at least on Reddit, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre good enough to get into Cal, such that _____ fill in the blank‚Äô as if such a generic quantitative measure means something special.
A few more!  As students you share your public spaces  with an unpredictable crowd of people, some of which desperately need mental health assistance and may be unstable.  I also heard that the all-women‚Äôs dorm has mold
Yeah I chose Berkeley over cmu and sometimes I do question my decision, esp because I‚Äôm an international and therefore pay roughly the same amount of money as I would for a private schoolüíÄüíÄüíÄ
No for real, the student union is tiny as fuck and always packed and usually packed, there‚Äôs literally no where to sit at on campus that isn‚Äôt a library, compared to like other campuses like UCLA, there‚Äôs a million seats everywhere on campus
Hi ‚Äî PhD student here. I really feel horrible for the undergrads bc you guys have it tough. I wish the school decreased enrollment so they can focus on the students, actually cared about hiring good lecturers and focusing on improving pedagogy, and not having shit dsp counselors. I‚Äôm thankful I ended up going to a small school over Berkeley back in 2017, I would not have survived a day here as an undergrad. Your GSIs also most likely genuinely care about you, talk to them about this and what they think is a good idea moving forward.
Q
there's always Stanford or CSU Long Beach.
skill issue
we have the same issues over here on the east coast (NJ) at rutgers. big school, same price, same problems you guys have. it‚Äôs completely unfair to us students.
Where is all the CA lottery money going ?
I chose not to attend Berkeley for my masters when they tried to say I couldn't work while pursuing the masters degree. Berkeley is a joke. But, professor Johan McKesson was a cool neighbor.
You're paying for the name, not the hospitality
Its a school not a luxury retreat üòë
Would it be worth going to Berkeley if you are part of the MET program?
Imagine how it is for international students paying 80K üòÄ
Tuck your sack
This is the reason I did not go to Berkeley as an OOS student. Did not want to pay 70k per year. Chose to attend my state school
Administration is incompetent and overpaid, siphoning insane shares of school funds for exorbitant salaries. 

Increasing seats in the school benefit the social wellbeing of California and furthers the core mission of the UC system. However, expanding seats without expanding infrastructure was a huge mistake. The revenue generated by those last 10,000 students added was entirely eaten by administration.

Gob ears
Well said
rudy Gobert
Probably should be using some of that tuition money to improve the facilities, but that would take away from administrative salaries.
Then why does it have so many today? Caltech manages to be small.
I am all for increasing seats at UC Berkeley, its what made tons of my friends choose this place over Stanford. But... when we increase seats we need to increase the infastructure too.
UC Berkeley added 10,000 to the student population in a decade, without the required infrastructure to support it. I'm called a NIMBY if I point out that the quality of life suffers. 3, 2, 1...
IIRC was a NIMBY who got it ruled in court that the school had to cut it's enrollment in half due to the school's effects on the city and lack of housing for students. Newsom overturned the decision.
Yeeeeeeeeppppppp
Idk if all students were against it but, as someone who was, it was a pretty crazy idea, and it was primarily supported by NIMBYs who were against housing developments. Moreover, the tuition revenue that the uni would have lost from that probably would have been put onto students (or other resources cut), which is to say that it would only have made the problem worse. 

If anything, we should be looking to the state + fed government to do a better job funding higher education.
Before Berkeley I was in the Navy for 4 years and ended up renting a 2 story house in Hawaii with a garage and a small yard. My WW2 1 bed 1 bath apartment in Berkeley is $75 more per month than my house was.
UCSD same way. Maybe all the good UCs??
It was terrible when I went there. This isn't new. Students (or their parents) need to make better choices. The information is freely available.
Thanks for sharing your perspective. It‚Äôs very insightful :)

I do think that on average that figure might not have changed too much? Could be wrong. And here my anecdote:

Every single upper div major related course I took (‚Äò22) were quite strongly impacted since they were engineering adjacent majors (i.e. CS/Math/Stats) which routinely had >200 seats minimum from my memory. The smallest classes I took were out of my major and lower divs such as entry linguistics (~140 students?) which was interesting.
man i was born a year after you graduated!
Some upper division Stem classes today have 1300 students. Several hundred students is the norm but some math classes are still around 40 or so
I can‚Äôt even imagine how bad the basement of Evans is given the ground floor.
Interesting. I‚Äôm not in Cali but this really makes me think twice. Chapel Hill is my state‚Äôs flagship. So far both of my kids chose private schools over Chapel Hill but I‚Äôve got one more kid that will need to decide.
I imagine they're talking about the entirety of the bathroom that inevitably gets disgusting from general use by way too many people, not the contents of the toilet specifically
Maybe one day we can take care of that Prop 13
   I've been sitting on this comment since you posted it. I have a lot to say to it. But first let me get clear. 
What you're suggesting when you say hypocrisy, is that you believe progressives are inherently Yimby, so the actions of protesting people's park being turned into housing, is antithetical to progressive values?
Exactly correct unfortunately
Big Name and Big Brand Universities have big donor money coming in every year (there is even a large department whose responsibility is to get Money). Look it up. We get more than you can imagine every year!

Also anchor house - once they start moving students in - the building will be profitable. Student Housing is a revenue stream considering how expensive a single bed is (those triples in Unit 1 are bringing in like $60k per year for one room!!!)
School is most definitely not lacking financially. A lot of people don't know this but lemme tell you a lil sumn from a bay native: UC Berkeley owns 1/3 of Berkeley. All the businesses that are considered in campus? Yeah they're paying rent to the actual school. All the Subway sandwich shops, all the thrift stores, all the book stores, all the cafe's, everything except the actual housing, but anything CONSIDERED student hosting still does. It's not a money issue, it's a government issue. Take it up with the higher ups, as in school board for universities of California and State governments.
Although UC Irvine and UC San Diego are far from ideal, compared to what OP says, they are paradise! Lol. I guess one has pay bit more for more prestige
to be honest this person is right, i‚Äôm currently studying abroad at a way less prestigious public school that has a large student population and it‚Äôs a lot nicer here. we deserve better
It was like this in the mid 90s. I transferred to sf state due to class size.
[deleted]
The high cost of living (esp. housing) creates extra problems for Cal and some other UC schools - that most universities don't have.
i‚Äôm late and go to georgia tech, but i feel like the infrastructure is generally alright aside from on campus housing. if you seek out alternate places to hang out / study then you‚Äôll find good spots that aren‚Äôt crowded
HORDE
Maybe you focus on rankings too much? Awesome facilities and campuses at public schools in a lot of states.
It can be for longer . In my day hot water was off for 2 weeks
Last year my whole building didn‚Äôt have hot water for over a week.
That‚Äôs rough and hopefully that doesn‚Äôt happen too often. Is it a consistent pattern? Sometimes things like this are one off instances and I hope that‚Äôs the case
My dorm didn't have hot water for four days last month.
School like Cal, huge classes top public‚Ä¶. If you are a first gen college nobody just got in because of good grade, you are literally a sperm lost in colon since this society requires recommendation and so called net work for everything good.
You‚Äôre referring to resource misallocation rather than diversity being the core problem, correct?
You can also try PairVPN with your phone's 5G connection as temporary wifi.
I mean it‚Äôs on the table, but would lower tuition change the issues being described here about facilities not being able to handle the large number of students?
CSU had nice solid universities, it is a shame they get looked over by so many.
Their gym is so nice too! I considered going to SJSU over Berkeley, but in the end, the snob in me won (and lost too, haha).
I envy my friends who go to SJSU
I do work-study on campus, and my keycard works when other students' cards don't. It's fantastic having entire offices to myself.
1) your right. Tuition isn‚Äôt 40K, it‚Äôs actually more like 43K with housing before financial aid/scholarships
2) I have been asked to leave coffee shops for using WiFi and not buying items. While Strada might not care, most indoor cafes you have to ask for the WiFi password from the workers, and they‚Äôve literally told me ‚Äúoh, the WiFi is for customers only‚Äù. 
3) i don‚Äôt really see your point in this here? If I go to a library/study hall/cafe and there‚Äôs no places to work, I move onto another workspace, the same thing happens, I don‚Äôt see how the responsibility of this falls onto me the individual when it‚Äôs not a huge mystery the cal is not designed to accommodate the amount of students it enrolls? Most of the conversation about this is in relation to housing but there are other places it‚Äôs visible too. 
4) when I was touring/researching/etc, no it was not mentioned that was going to have to spend an hour walking around campus just to find a place to study. Ass hat.
You really know how to logic-away feelings of misery
or any top private school ü•≤
This has to be a joke? Sounds like copy pasta.
Womp womp
Bro forgot the /s :(
Ah yes, the traitorous critic fallacy (ergo decedo).

Why are you opposed to making things better?
UCLA's facilities are leagues better, with a pretty much identical number of students. the smallest of their multiple gyms alone makes our single gym look like a fucking dungeon
40k is not nonresident tuition
Im CA resident
Goobers
Gobe ars
The money coming in is insane! I'm not just talking tuition - Millions comes in from donors every year.
You can look up administrative salaries online.

Berkeley salaries are unbelievably low (relative to industry, relative to the cost of living) for most staff. Salaries for tenured EECS faculty might seem high, but they're a tiny fraction of the total.  (And ""faculty"" are not ""staff."")
fwiw, the tuition money goes toward replacing the money that the state used to give before defunding the university over the last 30 years or so
If you look at compensation, it's most faculty salaries that are really high
Caltech is private
Berkeley doesn't get to decide how many students it takes in.
Just increase remote coursework. Problem solved
Yeah, not building enough to meet demand is the root of most of the Bay's problems. As YIMBYs have been pointing out for decades. The answer isn't ""don't let more people in"", it's ""build more"".
Shhhh, you're making the ""we just need to keep developing, bro!"" narrative a little more complicated and that's a no-no
Not quite, the state legislature passed a new law that effectively overturned the decision.


https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/09/08/peoples-park-supreme-court-case-opposition-ab-1307-student-housing
And isn't there also a major pro housing development coalition in San Diego? Albeit there are geographical differences between Berkeley and SD, barriers like the border and the ocean are real boundaries sd cannot ignore. Water resources, (maybe not so much the last two years) but usually water is a big issue down there. 
,
Sorry for my late reply, the new version of Reddit is ""different"", and I missed your post.  Anyway, your convergence/overlap explanation makes sense from a crowding perspective, but I think it's likely to result in a) over supply and b) rather rapid obsolescence thanks to generative AI. The recent layoffs are a strong hint of the future trend.  See my post below for what I think is a more robust play.
My kids are in their early 30's.  I am going to outlive my father and mother by at least a decade, maybe more.  Medicine and health care (and workers benefits) have greatly advanced in two and a half generations. No world wars. We ""boomers"" are leaving some good behind, like you, your parents and their (and our) 401k's...not just global warming and plastic filled oceans (sorry about those mistakes).
[deleted]
IMO, 1300 in one upper division class is THE definition of a paper mill.  Lemme guess, CS data analysis?  My first thought is the weeder rate has dropped to essentially zero as a result of the massively increased tuition rates. People expect tuition buys a diploma, not just an education, and UC is delivering.  My second thought is the recent wave of tech (STEM/CS) layoffs is not just supply/demand in a stormy world market, it's also a shift to generative AI (which is largely a hardware wave like fiber optics was around '98).  The next wave after AI on Silicon will be quantum computing on ???.  That's what I would target in STEM.  Good luck, and go bears!
Wait there are lecture halls that hold more than a thousand people?
Evans was new in my day; the basement computer room was open 24x7 because one ""loop"" (punch, submit, wait for output) took a minimum of 30 minutes, unless you had a high priority account number on your job control card (first card in the stack).  It could take five or more loops to get the program working...so two to three hours per assignment...unless you were really good.  Students were there at all hours.  The way around the system was to have a high priority account number, which you got by coding (or just schlepping cards) for a professor.  High priority jobs executed immediately, and you could walk over to the printer and your job was done.  Luckily I had such a job...otherwise I would have slept in the basement of Birge more than I did.  BART stopped running at 9PM in those days.
And not a lot of that money is discretionary. Fundraising for capital projects isn't a huge draw-- the much-touted Gateway building isn't fully funded at this point. I'm pretty sure Athletics (and the stadium isn't paid for), Haas, and COE are the top fundraising depts on campus.  You can easily look up where their funds go with some digging.
If you look at the information on Anchor House, all revenue from the building goes directly back to scholarships and the building was completely privately funded at no cost from the University, City, or State. It was built with a gift from a private non-profit, the largest in the Universities history I think. 

""Proceeds from Anchor House‚Äôs net operating revenue will fund annual scholarships for Pell Grant-eligible students, selected on the basis of academic and personal achievement."" - According to the UC Berkeley page about Anchor House.
Do you know where to find how the university funds are (mis)allocated? Like charts or otherwise? If not that‚Äôs fine, just couldn‚Äôt find the source myself after a minute and got a bit lazy ngl
How many of those businesses are actually on campus, there's Yali's, the expensive places in the union, and that's basically it, there are no Subways, thrift stores, bookstores (besides the student store), etc. on actual campus property.
UC Berkeley owns a lot more than just the campus campus. Most of telegraph is also considered UC Berkeley. I know this because when I was homeless I stayed at people's park whenever there was trouble at lake Merritt. Talking to the police often let me know that campus police are used for that entire sector, and more. I'm a very curious person. I ask a lot of questions.
I loved UC Irvine and UCSB. My favorite of all UCs. Santa Cruz is nice as well.
UCSD also has a nice advantage with it's proxmity to SD.   def would have considered that :)
I agree. They overenroll and the physical plant can't take it.   


Although, to tell you the truth, I can't understand why the students don't blockrush Oakland and gentrify it.
There‚Äôs kids getting their houses bombed and living in cardboard boxes the entitlement of this post is astounding. You‚Äôre going to a state school with cheap tuition chill tf out¬†
Abroad as in international? I sorta expect foreign tuition to be better just because the whole decreased federal funding is an issue for US higher education.
Did you encounter any of these kinds of issues at USC? I‚Äôm assuming public vs. private is the main difference, but maybe it‚Äôs a California thing. I don‚Äôt know much about west coast schools so just curious.
Too bad employers focus on it too.
Omg that‚Äôs inhumane. Berkeley gets cold and having to shower in freezing water is bullshit. I had to stifle screams just to take a shower lol. Two fucking weeks tho???
I think it‚Äôs been off before but only for a day at a time this semester. It was happening on top of the WiFi not working while roommate and I were trying to study so we had to laugh because wtf else could go wrong that day
What?‚Ä¶
Yes.
i live now in sacramento...during covid i would take my little baby daughter on campus just to walk.  sac state is definitely beautiful ! and with so many folks moving here, there's more to expansion in the works.  hehe berkeley is #1 but i definitely would look into a CSU if that option is near me.
right!  in addition to my course logins, i also had my EECS login, which allowed me to term in to ~any~ available workstation.  sigh...when i went, we were just getting Windows NT workstations...they had pentium pro processors.  lmao goddamn i'm old haha :) but yeah...memories of soda hall...cory hall.. ahhhhhh
Out of state and Intl kids be paying >76k ü•≤
Housing should never be considered a part of tuition LOL

Also, try a new library, I bet there are at least 10 other libraries that you never heard of / have never set foot in, that would have plenty of study space available for you
1) I lived with my parents while attending Berkeley cuz I chose it since it was only a 35 minute drive from my house. I realize most people don't live close by but assumed most people could just go somewhere near their house to save a few tens of thousands of dollars every semester, but I understand that's a big assumption
2) Why don't you just study at your house/apt/dorm? Do you not have any wifi at home? I've literally never studied at a library cuz I have a home to study in
3) The entire time I was at Berkeley it never seemed overly crowded to me compared to how most popular public universities look nowadays. Obviously a random ass school or a private school will be much more sparse but that's to be expected. I think you have a negative mindset regarding Berkeley + confirmation bias
4) I didn't mean just touring, I mean look at statistics regarding student population numbers and reviews of the school's facilities and all that

Also did some math and $43k is a ridiculous of amount to be spending even after housing. If tuition is $15k and SHIB is like a couple thousand, and a year of school is 9 months, that means you're spending like $3000/mo. How is that even possible? Do you buy $6 coffee everyday, Doordash every meal, and drink every weekend? Even then, that's pretty crazy.
Yes, I believe I'm a very logical person. In economics, I'm similar to what's known as homo economicus, as opposed to normal people, homo sapiens.
Clearly a meme
Who is going to pay for it
It also isn't in-state tuition
https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/how-aid-works/student-budgets-cost-of-attendance/

in state tuition living with relatives is **16,522**.  what's your breakdown with everything else?  everything you say that is challenging is real and definitely a problem.  but to say that tuition is 40k is disingenious, esp if you are in state.
&#x200B;

boogers
Gooners
people always say you can look things up instead of just sharing a damn link.
to be fair, we need to pay the top professors in the world a salary to reflect that
They're certainly not paying the custodians or cafeteria workers much
Where can one find the faculty salaries listed?
And I'd add that those faculty who are garnering the ""high"" salaries are getting them because we are competing with T1 private schools for the best researchers. In that respect, their salaries aren't actually that high considering their options (not to mention the base cost of living).
does it not decide how many it accepts?
Actually though that would be an amazing idea. There are tons of self motivated students at this school that would love to learn online with the Berkeley quality education. If people think integrity and cheating will be a problem hold exams in person then.
That solves a ton of problems. Especially safety. Most anything else can be mitigated, albeit inconvenient. Scythe/gun wielding lunatics, not so much.
All for this!

hehe i appreciate you.  as it is with bay area demographics (i'm now in sacramento) i had my children late.  will be 47 in june.  but hopefully i teach my [3 little ones](https://i.imgur.com/UhmbYnP.png) to reach for the stars and do good in this world.  roll on ! :)

edit: my parents are old..my dad is 87, mum is 83.....but they are still alive!  https://i.imgur.com/kGfD439.png we took this pic a few weeks ago for the lunar new year :D   same house in oakland where i stayed at when going to Cal.  in indebted to my parents for raising me to be the man i am today.  my diploma (along with my sister's diploma) hang in that little home.  us Cal alums are fiercely proud of where we came from :)
haha i cannot believe the 90's/2000's....are like a qtr century away!!!!! bahhhhhh lol oh wells.  well, we're all bears!  roll on! :)
Lost the plot a bit there
Oof! Sounds like a drag.
Hahaaaa!!! You can go to the ca business records website and look into Berkeleys funds. It'll take a while, but it's definitely worth a deep dive. Very fascinating subject.
They also own a number of off campus buildings, as far as I know they collect rent on all tenants in these buildings.

They'd get shot
I feel for the students left with lousy housing options in Berkeley, but as a local I would hope Oakland doesn‚Äôt get more gentrified.
This is a dumb comment
obviously we have a lot to be grateful for and there are people in worse conditions. at the same time we can ask for reasonable conditions for ourselves. plus it costs $127,128 to go here for 8 semesters with in state tuition (which is still a lot of money)
No, I went to a UC for undergrad and USC for grad school and the student support was amazing. The resources are on another level. 

People can hate on USC all they want but the counseling , class registration, career center and alumni network are  all incredible. 

There is a big difference between public and private universities.

Some may say UCB has smarter students, but when it comes down to taking care of their own alumni and networking opportunities USC is arguably better than 99 % of colleges in the USA
I go to a California liberal arts college and have experienced none of this, but that comes with billions in endowment and few students. Out of state private college was substantially cheaper than my state school.

1. Yes, 1 is indeed a very bold assumption. Not everyone has a world class university 30 minutes from their home. If you believe a world class education and opportunity should be reserved by two factors: proximity or wealth, then sure, continue holding this point.

2. Just because studying at home worked for you, doesn‚Äôt mean it works for everyone. Clearly libraries are useful enough that there is demand (too much in fact). If OP was indeed able to satisfy all studying needs at home they wouldn‚Äôt bring it up, no?

3. Fair, in some aspects it may be over crowded. I felt in a majority of situations outside of big CS courses, it wasn‚Äôt the case. But in large CS classes, it did feel very crowded and impersonal.

Lastly on the topic of cost, a majority of middle class people don‚Äôt have this kind of money laying around to just whip out for 4 years. Did you not take out loans to pay for college Sbomb?
Wow maybe it‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve graduated so I‚Äôll try to keep that in mind. A lot has changed especially since the pandemic. For the 22-23 academic year the avg cost for undergraduate tuition was 40k, and it goes up every year. Doesn‚Äôt take more than a quick google (or logging into my own cal central) to find that info. No, im not ‚Äúdoordashing every meal‚Äù or even getting $6 lattes every day. This may come as a shock, but im literally just trying to make a point that if my tuition already pays for WiFi, it would be really nice if that WiFi would work. 
I live in an apartment w 5 other roommates. Studying here is not always an option furthermore we use the school WiFi which as I mentioned before, is always down. Meaning even if I wanted to study at my apartment, I couldn‚Äôt. 
Like you just said, when YOU were here you didn‚Äôt notice any overcrowding. But the students here NOW all notice this issue, as well as the Berkeley residents who are well aware of the literal housing crisis that is all too real for us here being exploited by shitty landlords. But it sounds like you didn‚Äôt have to deal with that since you had the luxury of living with mommy and daddy during your time here. Like you said, it‚Äôs not realistic to assume everyone has that luxury. You have no idea where people come from and what the schools/programs are like in their area compared to Cal. You don‚Äôt know what schools/programs people were accepted into and which they weren‚Äôt. 
Going back to the whole point of this post to begin with, it‚Äôs a rant. Letting off steam about something that‚Äôs quite frustrating to be frank. This is an ongoing issue that I hear a lot of my peers complain about, but ofc leave it to Berkeley students to turn everything into a competition. 
And to your comment about stats, student life etc, when I applied/got accepted here, it was the first semester that campus was returning to normal post pandemic. The conversations about ‚Äústudent life‚Äù looked a lot different. If you can imagine. Don‚Äôt know how old you are or when you graduated, but a lot of the alum in this sub seem to pretty out of touch with what campus is like for students who are actually going here NOW.
Your comments are tone deaf, misinformed and just plain dumb.¬†
you're getting downvoted for spittin' common sense.  i lived at home with parents too and in my first year, i just used AC transit --that year was the first year we got the unlimited ride sticker on our cards.  

i studied at my friends dorm....at home....in my car.  while it may seem crowded, most of the time our climate is pretty mild.  lots of places outdoors to study.  if you can find a spot to sit, you can study.  we did not have wifi then (i'm class of 1999)......but i am sure that is essential in today's age.
Pardon since I forgot you EECS majors need people to be real specific since your can‚Äôt use your imagination. Tuition (15k) + housing/cost of living, books, insurance, housing, fees etc, (28-30k) = to about 40K. It DOES actually say that on the link you posted. Not everyone has the luxury of living either family up here.
Just replace ‚Äútuition‚Äù with ‚Äútotal cost of living / expenses‚Äù and continue on. It‚Äôs just a definition difference.
GOOFY GOOBER
We should be paying professors a lot, and get rid of lots of the ass-deans.

Nope. University of California determines how much each of the campuses takes. Berkeley and its administration doesn't have a say.

Great looking family!  I've always said: getting through Cal is tough and a lot of work, but if you can make it, you'll be able to handle whatever life hands you and come out fine.  You are proof of that.
I‚Äôm still old to all these kiddos on campus. Luckily I‚Äôm
almost done. ü§ò
I am sharing my long term perspective.  I think the points are perfectly clear, but also understand it's scary for anyone caught up in it to even think that the demand for their hard earned skills has been greatly diminished by automation and the sheer number of their fellow graduates.  I simply suggested a way to avoid those issues at least through most of your career: go where the demand will be, not where it is now.  Take the trail with less traffic on it (at this point of the technology wave: and every technology is a wave that peaks and falls...).
definitely do this.  plenty of things to engage on campus while still living at home.  i hung out with my bros in the dorms.  later in the coops or apartments.  i joined daily cal to shoot photos.  some of my dudes formed a squad to play rec basketball at the RSF.  if you lean to some kind of religion...there's plenty of stuff on campus for that.  even if you're not catholic, come sit at the 10pm sunday mass at Cal Newman.  it's really welcoming and won't talk down to you ever no matter what position you are in life.  i miss Cal quite a bit and would love to be there again.  good luck !
i think OP is fucking complaining too much.  i don't know where OP is from, but it was their choice to come to berkeley.  berkeley is world class, but it's still a public university.  if you want to study....you will find a way.  because after university, work does not give a fucking shit how you get to work.  not to say that we don't value our mental health--we absolutely should.  but university is a time of adversity and growth.  some will make it, some won't.  i nearly didn't-- i was on AP 3x...by the grace of god/buddha/allah/jehovah i finished with a final GPA of 2.23.  thank goodness i was an EECS major which let me skate by with a 2.0+ GPA.  

it was tough as fuck to go then...and seems like it's tough as fuck now too.  but at some point, one has to just realize they got in and need to  make it work.
> Not everyone has a world class university 30 minutes from their home.

pretty much anyone from california does in fact have a world class uni 30 minutes from them. Study in your own state if you dont like it
Graduation 2 months ago
> Pardon since I forgot you EECS majors need people to be real specific since your can‚Äôt use your imagination. 

lol and this is why i can't with you brody.  what's with the personal attack there?  you feel a typa way about EECS / science majors ?    tuition is the cost of going to school there.  everything else is your living expenses.    i don't know where in california you are from, but if you chose to live away from home to attend this university, those are the costs you have to deal with.  unless you're living out in some podunk area, there are institutions that may have been better for you from a financial standpoint.  

while it is within your right to go to whatever school you want--the reality is that you're not just going to go to a university w/o incurring everything else related to going to school.  you're right i'm fortunate i was close by.  i actually applied only to two schools: cal and csu hayward (now csu east bay).  i was fortunate to be a spring admit to cal.  

look i feel sorry you feel this kinda way, but it's not surprising how things are the last few years with cost of living so fucking crazy in the bay area.  hell i grew up in oakland, attended cal...got an honest to goodness EECS degree, work in tech...and i still had to move to be able to afford a home to raise my family.  ain't nobody gonna feel sorry for me--it just what it is.

i hope you feel better and find your time at Cal to be better than it is now.
then sure.  but that's not tuition.
I remember Ass Dean. I thought he died at the Juggalo festival in ‚Äò04. Too much Faygo.
Oh cool, my advisor makes $1000 per day.
wow very interesting, I didn't know that
i 100% believe that getting thru cal has a great deal of my success later in life.  it was definitely tough.  but i find great satisfaction knowing that i was able to get thru it.  roll on !  :)
haha right on !  

up until pandemic...i still got to be around berkeley.  first office was above yogurt park.  then we moved to where berkeley social club is.  i was very lucky i could still roam the campus when many of my peers have long gone.  these days i'm in sacramento..so berkeley isn't very far off.  but now it really seems like a lifetime since i've last stepped on campus.  

enjoy your time on campus and good luck !
I hear you and get where you‚Äôre coming from, but at the same time there is a reason why OP‚Äôs post is so popular and is the front of this subreddit and heavily upvoted. It‚Äôs because their sentiments are echo‚Äôd / supported by their fellow classmates in some fashion. I don‚Äôt think OP is saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible to make it work‚Äù, but rather there is something inefficient in this process and that has gotten to them.

Just because when you‚Äôre off in the real world and, ‚Äúyou can make it work‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt improve where we are. And a prerequisite of trying to improve something is having to critique it.

I might be solo in this camp, but I ascribe to the idea that maybe a part of ‚Äúmaking it work‚Äù, may just in fact be trying to make it better.
First off I‚Äôm a Cali native born and raised haha.

And Yeah that‚Äôs a weird take, I can give you plenty of examples of places that take an hour to reach a world class uni‚Ä¶

once a bear, always a bear! roll on :D
Yes and for the sake of any productive conversation it is more important to focus on what a person is trying to say and not exactly what word was said‚Ä¶
and i totally get it.  i just find the tone of OP in his comment replies to be a bit trash and a bit petulant.  university time isn't going to be a big ol kumbaya where everyone has fun.  i was EECS and spent every summer doing summer courses to catch up.  and then taking general electives to round out my degree--even us engineering/cs students had to write term papers.   

being in college is a time of discovery and realization that when you land in the real world, it is going to be very challenging.  i don't know what OP's major is.....but every major has their challenge.  some are not as involved as others.  some are more impacted than others.  i do feel empathy for OP because i didn't come from a wealthy background--i was fortunate enough to have cal grant/pell grant and fed loans to cover my tuition.  i couldn't imagine affording a today's education.  

but at some point there are things one has to compromise on in order to make it.    and if one cannot make it here...then it's no big deal.  there are other learning institutions ...or heck even a different take on what to do in life.
OMG NOT AN HOUR OH NO! A vast majority of Californians live in San Fran, LA or San Diego. All close to some of the best unis in the country. God forbid people in orange county have to drive a little longer. Point is most people could commute they just don't feel like it. Nobody cares about the 10 people living in fresno or bakersfield
Not every californian needs to or deserves to attend a UC. More than half of CC students dont even finish CC. Math works just fine
so that's the thing right.  if we compare with someone going to a private school like stanford....it's even more expensive factoring in the living situation and the actual tuition.  cal is a relative bargain in terms of being at a top tier university.  

i get that OP is frustrated..but cal is far from trash and definitely not expensive compared to other universities.

There is, nothing I said contradicts that. If you do decide to pursue such a career that requires study at such a university, and you qualify to be there, and you are a californian, odds are you are within commuting range of said UC."

Spring 2022 instruction update,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rym5hd/spring_2022_instruction_update/,2022-01-07 16:10:16,"Dear Campus Community,

With COVID-19 cases surging and positivity rates on the rise, it‚Äôs clear we‚Äôre in for a challenging January. As we navigate the omicron wave it‚Äôs important that we be especially flexible and patient with one another. In this spirit, we‚Äôre writing to share some updates to our instructional plans for the spring semester.

After consultation with the UC Berkeley public health committee, input from students, staff and faculty, and much deliberation, **we have decided to begin the semester with a two-stage process, with most courses being offered fully remote for the first two weeks (Jan. 18-28) and then moving to fully in-person instruction in the third week of the semester on Jan. 31.**

Some courses such as lab sections, studio courses, fieldwork, clinical courses, and graduate seminars may be taught in-person Jan 18-28. For these in-person courses, instructors may require in-person attendance but must offer appropriate make-up arrangements for students who are unable to attend because they have symptoms or are in isolation/quarantine.¬†

Instructors may teach some courses in hybrid mode (where some students are in-person and others are participating remotely via Zoom) or allow their students to attend their lectures in-person during the initial two-week period. Hybrid is not a desirable modality for many courses; instructors are not required to teach any course in a hybrid mode.¬†

More details about these plans are available on the [instruction page](https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/instruction/) of the campus [coronavirus site](https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/).

We have chosen this approach for several reasons:

* We believe strongly in the importance of in-person instruction and in providing an in-person experience for our students. Starting on Monday, Jan. 31, 2022, we plan that all classes and sections will be delivered according to their approved modality as listed in the [schedule of classes](https://classes.berkeley.edu/). But, the plans described here are subject to change as pandemic conditions evolve.
* We expect many students, faculty and staff will not be able to come to campus because of the rapid spread of the omicron variant. While we expect this surge to peak in January, we anticipate current pandemic conditions continuing into February. We will use the two-week period of remote instruction to plan for how best to meet the operational needs of our campus with so many students, staff and faculty unable to be on campus because they have symptoms, are isolating/quarantining or have family care issues resulting from omicron.¬†

The campus will remain open; students, staff and faculty are welcome to come to campus for all other research, administration and operational purposes. Normal campus operations will continue, though we anticipate disruptions resulting from people not being able to come to campus.

As we embark on this latest phase of our response to COVID-19, we ask that you exercise compassion and extend grace to one another. While the pandemic impacts everyone, our individual experiences are deeply personal and unique. We hope that all members of our campus community will find it in their hearts to treat each other with kindness and understanding as we navigate this challenging moment together.

Email from Cal Housing about Spring Move-In: ‚ÄúGet COVID test + booster before Move-In; What to do if you had COVID over winter break‚Äù,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rx40s4/email_from_cal_housing_about_spring_movein_get/,2022-01-05 19:18:13,"
> Dear resident,  

> With Move-In for the spring semester approaching next week, University Health Services and Cal Housing strongly urge that you **get tested for COVID-19 one to three days before your arrival in Berkeley and await a negative result before travelling.** You can purchase an at-home test or schedule a PCR (lab) test at a provider near you. We encourage you to arrange for testing as soon as possible, as test appointments and at-home tests are difficult to find in many areas.  

> With increased travel and gatherings during winter break and the current surge of Omicron, we anticipate that many students will test positive during the break or in the week before Move-In.    

> ##What to do if you test positive 

>‚Ä¢ **If you tested positive at any time over winter break**, please send a message through the eTang portal to the COVID response team with the date of the positive test and upload the test result. The COVID response team can advise you on next steps, as well as update your testing requirements for your Campus Access Badge. 

>‚Ä¢ **If you test positive in the coming days**, please send a message to the COVID response team as noted above and do not come to campus until you have been cleared by the COVID Response Team or 10 days have elapsed since your first positive test.  Note that the City of Berkeley Isolation Order still requires 10 days of isolation. 

> ‚Ä¢ **If you or your helpers develop symptoms that may be COVID-19, please do not come to Move-In.** We would encourage you to take a PCR lab test, and remain at home until you have received a negative test result and your symptoms have abated. (See California‚Äôs Isolation and Quarantine guidance.)  

> ## Get a booster before returning  


>**If you haven‚Äôt already done so, please get a COVID-19 booster as soon as possible.** Students are required to get a booster no later than the start of instruction on Jan. 18 (or by the first day you are on campus if you will be on campus before Jan. 18). Please review the instructions for how to update your vaccination record in eTang with your booster information.   

>It is important that you understand that public health quarantine and isolation requirements have changed, and are now more stringent for those who have not received their boosters. **What this means:** Failing to get your booster could result in you being quarantined after exposure to a positive case ‚Äî even though other people who are exposed to the same positive case are not required to quarantine.  You will also be required to get weekly testing starting February 1st, and most importantly, not getting boosted (if you are eligible) puts you at significantly greater risk of severe disease.  

> We are counting on our community of Golden Bears; please do your part to get tested, and avoid coming to Move-In with symptoms or positive test results so that we can minimize the number of residents who need to move to isolation/quarantine housing and help keep campus safe.

My thoughts:

1. Testing before coming to campus needs to be mandated! ‚ÄúStrong urge‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to cut it. 
2. If you test positive over winter break (as many will, unfortunately), you can‚Äôt come to campus for 10 days after your positive test. How would a student attend classes then? Berkeley needs to provide a virtual option, simply expecting students to miss their classes isn‚Äôt fair.","They need to just hurry up an announce the first two weeks is remote.  It‚Äôs stupid they are taking this long.
>Failing to get your booster could result in you being quarantined after exposure to a positive case ‚Äî even though other people who are exposed to the same positive case are not required to quarantine. You will also be required to get weekly testing starting February 1st

Is this the 1st time they've actually specified what the penalty will be for not boosting? Huh less strict than I presumed. Thought it would be not allowing you on campus at all.

>and most importantly, not getting boosted (if you are eligible) puts you at significantly greater risk of severe disease.

Lol this just isnt true.
I feel like they want people to come back to Berkeley and actually stay there for the two week quarantine. If they announce remote while everyone is still outside of Berkeley, they'll just see the same explosion in two weeks when people actually come back
I didn‚Äôt downvote you but I think you‚Äôre being downvoted for your 2nd statement, which is factually incorrect, and a regular anti-vax talking point.
Nice downvotes people anyone care to challenge the science with some data? People our age are not at risk of severe disease period. Booster, vaccine, or nothing. You shouldn't downvote something if you haven't done the research.
You are probably right, it‚Äôs still the stupidest shit I‚Äôve ever heard. I hate the administration of this school so much.
I really suspect they're going to do it because this is exactly what I'm going to do if they move classes online before I come back to berkeley. Why in the world would I want to hangout doing online classes in my cramped and kinda crowded apartment when I can instead do it from my parents' nice house lol."
Massmail: Update on plans for the spring semester and new booster and testing requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rme5xh/massmail_update_on_plans_for_the_spring_semester/,2021-12-22 12:35:47,"Dear Campus Community,

We write to update you on our plans for the spring semester. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and have been meeting this week to consider changes to our response. Our decision-making is guided by science and the expertise of our own public health experts. We will continue to monitor the situation throughout the break and communicate any changes as needed.

As we write, there is great uncertainty regarding the omicron variant. Our campus public health committee advises that omicron is much more infectious than prior variants, that omicron will be the dominant variant when instruction resumes on Jan. 18, and that even people who have obtained a booster can be infected with omicron. They remain especially concerned about the impact the pandemic has on those who are immunocompromised or otherwise at higher risk of complications.

Our campus public health committee also advises that people who are vaccinated and have a booster usually have mild or no symptoms after infection. Is the infection also mild in unvaccinated people? Will the coming surge in infection also result in a surge in hospitalizations? We do not yet know. But we expect to know much more in the coming weeks. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, our plans are subject to change based on the latest public health information and guidance.

Presently, the plan is for all classes to be in-person, including those that begin before Jan. 18. Based upon the recommendations of our campus public health committee, and consistent with public health mandates and guidance, we plan to emphasize three primary strategies during the spring semester for responding to omicron: increased vaccination (which includes obtaining boosters), increased testing, and continuation of the indoor face-covering mandate. We do not expect to rely significantly upon remote instruction or large-scale cancellation of in-person activities.

Vaccine boosters
Yesterday, the UC system announced that the current UC COVID-19 vaccination policy requires faculty, staff and students to obtain a booster shot as soon as they are eligible. Our campus expects all faculty, staff and students who are eligible to get their booster no later than the start of instruction on Jan. 18 (or the first day they are on campus if they are in a program that starts before Jan. 18).

Students are reminded that compliance with the vaccination policy is a condition of being physically on campus and that non-compliance can result in discipline. Faculty and staff are reminded that compliance is a condition of employment. Please review the instructions for how to update your vaccination record in eTang with your booster information.

Please note that eligibility for the booster has been expanded. If you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you‚Äôre eligible for a booster six months after your last shot. If you got the Johnson & Johnson/Johnson vaccine, you‚Äôre eligible two months after you got the shot.

If you were vaccinated abroad with other COVID-19 vaccines you are most likely eligible for a booster as well. See the CDC booster shot eligibility page for more information.

Increased testing
We expect everyone to get tested before returning to work, study, or to live on campus. If you have traveled away from the Bay Area for the break, then we recommend that you get tested before travel; additionally, we expect you to get tested when you return to the Bay Area and before you come to the campus. If you test positive, you must isolate in accordance with the city of Berkeley public health order. 

We are working to greatly increase the options for getting tested on campus. You may also be able to access testing through an outside health care provider, through your local health department or by purchasing an at-home test kit. We are attempting to procure tens of thousands of antigen self-tests for you to use to test at home as part of our overall testing strategy.

Our focus will be on making tests easily available and we will not generally require everyone to demonstrate proof of a negative test in order to come to campus. We will however continue, for the time being, all of the mandatory testing of faculty, staff and students that was required during the fall semester.

Face coverings
The expert consensus is that face coverings effectively reduce transmission. We therefore will continue to require their use after curtailment and when instruction resumes. These requirements will be the same as those that were in place at the end of the fall semester.  The campus will continue to seek advice from the public health committee about when to relax this requirement in accordance with the City of Berkeley health department‚Äôs requirements.

With regard to ventilation: In order to provide the most inhospitable conditions for transmission, we plan to continue ventilating buildings with the maximum possible amount of outside air for the present time. This means it could be very cold inside during January; we, therefore, ask that you plan to dress accordingly. We appreciate that this is a hardship for many but believe this is the best approach when balancing all of the risks.

Instruction
We‚Äôre continuing to plan for fully in-person instruction in the spring. UC Berkeley is a residential campus and our students have repeatedly emphasized their expectation to be able to learn in person. We will make every effort to continue to offer in-person instruction to the extent possible.

We do need to be prepared for the possibility that we may need to pivot to remote learning for brief periods during the semester. For example, if a very large number of faculty, staff and students are all required to isolate at the same time, it may not be practically possible to operate our facilities. 

If we find that a remote start to classes is necessary either operationally or due to public health guidance or requirements, we will advise you of that as soon as possible.

Events
We also presently plan to continue to permit in-person events to the extent consistent with CDC guidance and state and city health department requirements. We will consider limiting or canceling large campus events at which vaccination status is not checked as a condition of entry.  We also continue to urge event planners to consider holding events remotely and to enter into contracts that anticipate the possibility of events being canceled or moved online. Event organizers should regularly check for updates to the campus coronavirus events page.

Looking ahead
The return to in-person instruction this past year has been a source of hope and revitalization for many. We are committed to doing everything we can to continue operating in person while taking evidence-based measures to protect our community.

We are incredibly grateful for the efforts of our community to protect one another and are optimistic about the future. We hope you have a restful winter break and wish you a happy new year.

When most of your professors say its unlikely for us to return to in person after Jan 31st,https://i.redd.it/cn63md68nic81.jpg,2022-01-18 13:40:25,,"What class said this?
Community College enrollment go burrrr
Can relate to nonresident

P A I N
i just wish more professors offered more hybrid options. most of my professors are saying ‚Äòoh don‚Äôt come to class if ur sick but also if u miss class we are going to do absolutely nothing to make sure u get the material.‚Äô as much as i want class to be in person, my dad has cancer and my little sister has asthma. my dad gets tested three times a week and if he catches covid he can‚Äôt receive treatment. i really can‚Äôt risk catching covid in class and bringing it home to my family. i made sure to not have class on fridays so i could come home and help my family but i can‚Äôt come home if there is any risk that i was exposed.
no pls i cant stay in my bum ass home state anymore
Hm, most of my professors seemed to think the opposite was the case.
You all realize there is a pandemic happening right?  Why are you trying to get in a classroom right now?
You know, I'm starting to feel glad I have an internship so I can dip this semester
in my UGBA classes, some of my professors said they weren‚Äôt confident of going back in 2 weeks
[deleted]
:painpeko:
I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I have a somewhat similar situation and was really stoked to hear one of my profs was trying to make some discussions online when we moved in-person. Then was bummed to hear that the school wouldnt approve of it. I know people in our boats are the minority, but if profs are on board with PARTIAL hybridity I don‚Äôt see why they won‚Äôt let it happen
[deleted]
being upset about a shitty situation isn't the same thing as actually arguing that we should do otherwise lol
I don't care about the classrooms themselves but I don't want to pay full price for this shit when I could've gone somewhere in state and get the same online experience.
[deleted]
Scamdemic
I award you one Stanford.
Lol unless your taking Public Health classes I‚Äôd absolutely take their predictions with a grain of salt.
i wouldn't worry too much *just because* of that. 

they, for the most part, don't know any more than anyone else about what is going to happen. curious as to which instructors said this though.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
yes you do
Yeah apparently those leisure activities used by wealthy homeowners are more important than the future of an entire generation. Those who are in power are passing laws that help them. Those who are not in power (ie young people and middle class) can get fucked
You‚Äôve noticed this thing is getting worse right?  I agree there are many indoor and maskless venues and I am extremely excited to get back to normal but can we get there by going back to the old ways?   Yes, but it‚Äôll cost quite a few lives still.
This is a good way of putting this. Students have the right to be unhappy. Faculty have the right to be unhappy. Just because we understand the situation doesn't mean we are happy about it.
Makes sense, that‚Äôs not the sentiment I was getting from this thread.
Berkeley is a better education though isn‚Äôt it?
Don‚Äôt lie, your paying for the Berkeley degree.
Well that‚Äôs a pretty big deal and it‚Äôs a very cool experience.  I‚Äôm betting a ton of people are delaying the when it opens back up there is going to be a massive influx of new students. Kinda screwed either way.   Maybe go to Texas?   They are totally in to getting this virus.
That‚Äôs right, you haven‚Äôt started university yet.  I forgot who I was dealing with.
How exactly is it getting worse? You can say that new variants have increased transmissibility, but the death counts have remained incredibly low, much lower than any of the other variants when equating for overall case counts. 

The issue that I have with further restrictions is that there is no practical way of ever truly getting rid of this virus, as there will always be more variants to deal with that the vaccine will eventually be rendered ineffective for. You can try to propose a forever lockdown, which has several externalities that hurt all kinds of other groups (see mental health in Australia), or you can move forward with opening up the country while still establishing certain safety measures and encouraging vaccination. 

Also, I would even say that the alternative therapies that anti-vaxxers seem to love (ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, etc‚Ä¶) should also be made widely available in pharmacies globally at this point to encourage people to treat mild to moderate, and even some severe infections, at home. This allows those who don‚Äôt want vaccines to access their therapies while leaving hospitals less impacted by their decisions, allowing for those who really need treatment for other serious conditions to get it once more (late stage colon and breast cancer rates skyrocketed during the pandemic due to there not being as many people getting regular checkups due to hospitals being too full.) 

People want their freedom again, and if they want to choose perhaps a riskier route to live, I say it‚Äôs time to let them. An overwhelming majority of us will be fine, and the externalities associated with continuing this lockdown will prove to be too severe if kept up arbitrarily.
Education? Debatable. Degree prestige? Maybe. I'm not here for the teaching that's for sure; I'm here for the labs which actually let me freely do shit compared to my counterparts back in my hometown.
Never said I wasn't. Doesn't make this any less ridiculous.
Im a senior bubsy
Easy pal, this is just a chat on Reddit.  We aren‚Äôt creating public policy here we are just chatting.  Your post was way too long, I don‚Äôt have that kind of time or energy to put into this.  Agree to disagree at this point.
Interesting, I have a few friends who get a lot of prestige from a cal degree.
You said you could have gone to an in state school. Transfer out then.
Lol well you may want to look into a refund.
Because you said the pandemic is getting worse. That‚Äôs simply not true. This is a complex issue that requires complex analysis, and if you‚Äôre not willing to provide or read a somewhat nuanced take, then I think you shouldn‚Äôt tell me to go easy
What the fuck was the point of taking the first years at Berkeley then? I'd rather take the degree here and tough it out than to get the worst of both worlds.
Well as someone married to a healthcare worker and with two sisters working in an ICU on the other side of the country I can guarantee you things are getting worse.   I also have an MBA in data analytics and have followed the data and it is getting worse but I have very little belief that I can change your mind so agree to disagree.
If that‚Äôs the case, what exactly is the data telling you? I told you what it‚Äôs telling me, which is that it‚Äôs become more transmissible and less deadly/severe. That‚Äôs a positive sign. You can‚Äôt lockdown your way out of this virus if it‚Äôs becoming more transmissible, but you can try to prevent deaths. 

If you actually have that data analytics degree, you should know about r-naught values, which gives you an average measure of how many people you will transmit the virus to if you contract it; this number has increased for omicron, but the death rate is still minuscule. Given that there is no way of absolutely eradicating the virus, this is a positive sign, as less severity and deaths is what you can control and prevent, not transmissibility, as we have not actually seen a successful implementation of absolute lockdown measures anywhere. 

Also, if your sisters are in those ICUs, have they told you about what kinds of patients are there? They either usually have multiple co-morbidities and/or are unvaccinated; as mean as it may be to say, that‚Äôs their problem, not mine. A lot of those people are at risk of dying of anything, let alone COVID. Also, there is a financial incentive in hospitals to label non-COVID related deaths as COVID if the test is positive for the patient, which can artificially inflate the r-naught value I mentioned earlier. 

So all in all, if we‚Äôre being objective and rational here, for a vast majority of people at this point in the pandemic, this virus is simply not enough of a risk to justify the restrictive policy measures being passed.
Is risk of death the measure you think we should be using?  Hospitalizations are up on those without co-morbidities, the healthcare industry is being stretched to the limits and the sick pay which was provided to healthcare workers was revoked and they must now use personal sick leave or vacation. This is driving people to come to work even when experiencing symptoms.  Both my sisters and wife were told if they have no symptoms and test positive they are still required to come to work but take extra precautions. 

The healthcare industry isn‚Äôt the only industry facing these issues. Emergency services, food supply chains, energy supply chains, and government assistance are all being stretched to the limit as people are out sick.  

The growing number of sick people is causing systemic issues which are getting worse.  Nothing is being locked down, there are mask mandates and social distancing practices that can slow the spread which will allow our system to function enough to get through this and back to normal once a treatment is found or the virus becomes endemic.  

This is not over yet or to the point where we can go back to normal.  If a new more destructive variant doesn‚Äôt happen (unlikely it will but this is still a Novel virus) I‚Äôm hoping it will only be a few more months but that‚Äôs hard to predict. 

Until then, our best defense is to follow own the guidelines we have been. Wear a mask, wash hands and distance as best we can.  In person classes are unnecessary and will just tax the system further with more sick.
You get what I‚Äôm saying right?  There are more metrics to consider than death.   Infection rate is important as well as hospitalization rates, etc. truly analyzing the data is bigger."
"Sproul Hall on Jan 29, 2021 after Protests at People's Park",https://i.redd.it/2nlb4yo5zde61.jpg,2021-01-29 19:09:41,,"Are the people protesting even students? I'm sure lots of people from outside come in
If these people love people's park so much, why don't they spend some time there in the middle of the night and savor the beautiful culture they wish to preserve.
...I disagree...
Why did students protest?
I think it's mostly outsiders or perhaps normal Berkeley residents, but there definitely are students involved. A couple weeks ago a student posted on Overheard asking about how to stop the construction at People's Park.
Agree, or try enjoying the park midday without being robbed or assaulted. I‚Äôve been adjacent to the park for years and it just get worse. It‚Äôs not safe for the unhoused people nor is it safe for the community. Let them build the dorm + housing for the homeless. It‚Äôs better for everyone.
Huh?
They‚Äôre new, haven‚Äôt learned the darker recent histories, bored, and likely protesting just for the sake of participating in a Berkeley protest.
Fences were put up to initialize the construction of expensive new student housing that would earn the UC a good chunk of change, doing so would inevitably displace the homeless residents of the park
Protests like that annoy tf out of me
Darker recent histories... Go ahead and look up bloody Thursday for me
Please note there are no homeless residents:  People's park has a 10pm curfew enforced by UCPD.  They all sleep elsewhere.
It was approved in 2018 after years of the university declaring their intention to build. So this isn‚Äôt an exactly a surprising outcome. Everyone in the park was notified of the construction before the fences went up and they‚Äôve been up for a week or two? But really loving the fake shock of this action.
So why tf did students protest against that?
Darker times... In the last five years, UC police have responded to 10,102 incidents in People‚Äôs Park, including five rapes, nine robberies, 42 thefts, 125 assaults, 15 assaults with a deadly weapon, 182 incidents of drug use and one count of arson, among other crimes, according to the university. Police arrested a woman who fed methamphetamine to a 2-year-old boy playing in the park. A man was murdered in People‚Äôs Park in 2019 and a woman was shot in the park in April 2019.

But yeah let‚Äôs protect this green space!
FYI the curfew isn‚Äôt being enforced because of covid so there are people now living in the park. I thought the city had secured hotels to house them during the pandemic but I guess it fell through.
>doing so would inevitably displace the homeless residents of the park

How about: they are people and they don't deserve to be forcefully evicted

City apparently promised to house residents of the park in hotels, no such plan has been implemented
This needs to be plastered all over this sub. Don't mind if I do a quick control-c.
[*Citation needed*]
whoosh
Yea, they are people, but unless they are paying or own for it, they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúright‚Äù to that land, not really oppressive to move them. But I do agree some housing situation should be made to accommodate the homeless

I can keep going but you get the point. The park isn‚Äôt safe for the homeless or the community. And it‚Äôs been this way for over a decade. Time to build and move on.
If they wanted shelter, they should've really thought of that before they decided to be poor
""Gunfire in the park itself is unusual, however.""

Gotta read an article before you link it, crime exists, just a few months ago there were gunshots in the street just next to mine (Oakland, not Berkeley) doesn't mean i should be terrified to leave my own home
I hope your being sarcastic, and if so, that‚Äôs why I agree they should make accommodations for them. But unless they paying for the land they sitting on, it isn‚Äùt oppressive to move them.
Cherry picking at its finest. 

You asked for a citation for the following stat, ‚ÄúIn the last five years, UC police have responded to 10,102 incidents in the park, including five rapes, nine robberies, 42 thefts, 125 assaults, 15 assaults with a deadly weapon, 182 incidents of drug use and one count of arson, among other crimes, according to the university. In June, police arrested a woman who fed methamphetamine to a 2-year-old boy playing in the park.‚Äù

I also included the murder and shooting that took place in People‚Äôs Park. Clearly, critical thinking isn‚Äôt your strength. I‚Äôm sure the family of the man murdered in People‚Äôs Park midday will feel much comfort with the very little gun violence that takes place there.

"international students, are yall staying til jan 31 or flying back early to catch classes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rypbea/international_students_are_yall_staying_til_jan/,2022-01-07 18:43:17,üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´,"There‚Äôs no chance i‚Äôm gonna move into my crappy Berkeley apartment to take classes online, i‚Äôm delaying for sure!
Delaying because the COVID situation is significantly worse in the US than my country
Pushed my flight to the 28th as soon as the news got out
Idk man, cuz they said ‚Äúmost‚Äù classes will be online so I‚Äôm thinking wtf that means
I‚Äôm just gonna wait
Delaying as well
Flying back
I‚Äôm going to Pietro Rico to take classes from there, no cap
Isn‚Äôt the point of delaying classes that international students arrive, isolate and get tested? Yizzz, I don‚Äôt get it! We are going online because people don‚Äôt follow the FUCKING SIMPLE rules
It's a tough deal to sell...Trading living in a nice place with a real bed, to quarantine in crimmen-ridden homeless-filled Berkeley? No thanks, I'd rather to drive to the gym, and get in with a fingerprint rather than go in the bus and then juggle through useless badges for a very serious student-employee in the RSF. Beside the quality education, I don't find anything lucrative about Berkeley or the Bay Area. To add an all of that, it's very expensive.
 I don't think that's the goal... The goal is mainly that too many students will literally not be able to attend classes (already sick or international flights have been limited). On that latter cause, a lot of people said how flights were cancelled and the next ones they could get only were at the end of January.

From what I understand, this current virus is so contagious that unless you have a good filter or n95 mask you can spread it extremely easily. The risk that an international student/any student on a plane poses spreading the virus not just to other students but other people (in the airport, airplane, public transportation) is very high. Given that at this current moment people are very discouraged from international travel (flights are being cancelled because it's bad everywhere), if the uni told international students to come here now, they would need to have them wear very good ppe and be very disciplined‚Äîthat's the socially conscious choice. Lots of people are out sick and, while their sickness may only last 3-5 days, it's enough disruption such that I think they would benefit from less students flying in all on the same day.
Believe me, I would rather be at home. I‚Äôm also an international. It‚Äôs just that all internationals are saying they will arrive later on January. In my case, faculty of my department is amazing, this is the only thing I like about the program."
Spring Semester Start Dates,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qr47b1/spring_semester_start_dates/,2021-11-10 13:06:35,"I'm confused on what day we should return to campus after winter break? The calendar says spring semester starts Jan 11 but classes start Jan 18, so would it be okay to come back from home just before the 18th or are there some other things I should be present for during that 11-18 interval?","Doesn‚Äôt matter when you get here just know classes start on the 18th.
Yes, you could return right before classes start in my experience. It's mostly new people getting settled in the resident halls.
Spring semester technically starts on the 11th but instruction doesn‚Äôt begin till the 18th, meaning classes don‚Äôt start till the 18th"

Did something change because before we weren‚Äôt able to do anything about it but I saw an email a few weeks ago that said to contact this address in order to keep it.,"Are you a recent grad? I thought they change the policy such that graduates after fall 2023 can't keep their Berkeley email addresses.
The badgering worked! I've been bugging the Alumni House for months about this, and I lobbied hard to compromise to let the email addresses stay.
I graduated fall 23‚Ä¶ am i just fucked
Alumni who graduated a few years back - what link are you all using to get into your .edu email?
What email did you send the question to?
Yes! I graduated spring 23. I thought so too
Thank you! It means a lot to be able to keep my email and use it for job searches haha
i‚Äôm a fall ‚Äò23 grad who emailed the cal alumni network and they confirmed that i get to keep my berkeley email. you could email them to check the status of your account, too. they can be reached at atcal@alumni.berkeley.edu
[deleted]
I sign into Google, and it sends me to the CalNet login page.
atcal@alumni.berkeley.edu
I think that explains why. You can still keep your account.
Yes
Well the thing is I was supposed to claim my email by a certain date but I never did so they were going to delete my account. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on
I thought all alumni were losing their accounts
That's interesting."

I will be wearing a pink beanie so you can spot me. I hope there aren‚Äôt too many people wearing pink beanies that day.

The meetup is no longer going to be at Pappy‚Äôs because it‚Äôs football weekend and the entire place will be packed. The last two meetups have been at Indian Flavors Express \(IFE\). There is open seating, great food for everyone \(great vegetarian and vegan food as well\), and some drinks. I‚Äòm Punjabi, so I can tell you that IFE makes great Punjabi food.

See you all next week!","I‚Äôm all set to show up briefly, not talk to anyone, and leave awkwardly. Just like I do at every department event.

Just a meetup between people who share a common interest. We don‚Äôt usually talk much about reddit as much as we do about school and city stuff. You definitely don‚Äôt need to be a reddit fanatic to go and have fun.
