did anyone take hist 137ac with David Henkin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dx0kq2/did_anyone_take_hist_137ac_with_david_henkin/,2019-11-15 17:58:36,"Hi everyone, I am wondering if anyone did take hist 137ac before. I found that I have to read seven books for this course!!! Is that terrible? I want some suggestions and advice about that. (I take it for completing my American history and institution requirement)

Thanks!!",
American Cultures/Breadth,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w2cerw/american_culturesbreadth/,2022-07-18 15:38:40,"Hi! I’m struggling to find an American Cultures course- 2AC is closed, 3AC seems to have negative reviews, and ESPM 50 AC conflicts with my schedule. Does anyone have other recs with not too heavy of a workload? I would really appreciate it

I’m considering History 7A with David Henkin but I’m concerned about the workload, does anyone have experience with this class?","LGBT 20AC or GWS 50–they’re closed right now, but it’s a good option for next semester.
I’m going to be taking history 7A this semester and if you as well let me know :) I’m not very strong in history tho just saying 🧍🏽‍♀️"
