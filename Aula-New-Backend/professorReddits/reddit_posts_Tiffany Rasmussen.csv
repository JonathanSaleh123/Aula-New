UGBA 126: Auditing and UGBA 125 with Professor Rasmussen (Highly Recommended),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dlor7x/ugba_126_auditing_and_ugba_125_with_professor/,2024-06-21 22:52:57,"I heard that Professor Tiffany Rasmussen will be offering UGBA 126 (Auditing) and UGBA 125 (Ethics in Accounting) next semester in Fall 2024. For those of you who are still looking to pursue a finance/CPA career in the future, or if you are simply interested in law/accounting/finance, these two courses are highly recommended.

The main reason is that Professor Rasmussen worked in public accounting and in consulting for over 36 years. I have personally attended her UGBA 126 Auditing class and she will literally give you a real-life scenario of every concept she teaches. Those real world experience makes the sessions highly ""practical"" in the sense that it will probably help a lot in job interviews and actual work.

She also has a way of keeping her class highly interactive and she will welcomeÂ your questions about applying the topics covered in the accounting profession.

From my experience, there will also be guest speakers from the accounting, ethics and consulting professions. I  remember her bringing a forensic auditor (I think she was a partner from the big four) to class, and it really opens my mind.",
