Incoming data science freshman schedule. Thoughts or Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xx9lv/incoming_data_science_freshman_schedule_thoughts/,2023-07-12 11:55:32,"1. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler (mixed reviews on RMP but seems like a hard professor), CS 61A with Prof. John Denero (not sure if Iâ€™ll enroll as a DS major and with 300 waitlist max), and EPS 7 Climate Change and Computer science mentors (not sure how to enroll in CSM)

2. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler, DATA C8 w/ Prof. Swupnil Sahai, EPS 50 Planet Earth w/ Michael Manga

3. Math 32 (Precalculus) w/ Prof. Rui Wang (bad reviews on RMP but not suer if I should enroll in precalculus since I want to do well in calculus at Cal), CS 10 w/ Dan Garcia (friendlier pace than CS 61A) and some other random GE course

4. Math 32 w/ Prof. Rui Wang (again, has bad reviews on RMP), Data C8, and some random GE.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like. 

Also, could anyone recommend any easy and fun 7-breadth courses? That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",I like the first one with Data 8 instead of EPS 7
