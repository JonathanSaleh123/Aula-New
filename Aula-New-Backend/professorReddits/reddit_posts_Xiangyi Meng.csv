Econ 119 with Xiangyi Meng,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17h8xcw/econ_119_with_xiangyi_meng/,2023-10-26 15:44:58,How's the workload for this class? Is the material interesting? Has anyone taken it with Xiangyi and tell me whether they are good at teaching?,
Econ 100A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cun49p/econ_100a/,2024-05-17 19:36:12,"I am a  new transfer student taking Econ 100A (with James Campbell) and Econ 119 over the summer. I'm not the best at math. Should I take just one course or different courses since summer is so fast-paced? 


-A very confused bearðŸ§¸","word of advice: donâ€™t take 119 with xiangyi meng
Nah just take 100A
just took 100a with only having taken AP calc in high school 3 years ago. No econ experience. It was totally fine. Can't speak to 119 tho
100a should be very doable even without a strong math background. also, campbell is the best!
Just do 100a. If you need full time units, grab an AC course or another course for fun â€” youâ€™ll want to focus on the 100a content.
100a is doable. 119 has now become more mathy so I would not recommend.
Oh no! It is with that instructor. Thanks!
how do exams grades weight?
Thanks!
I was considering 157 with Ryan Edwards, but I think an AC course will be a better choice. Thank you!
yeah, I took it with him this semester and it was possibly the most disorganized class in berkeley history. we got midterm review and hw solutions back the day of the exam; he last-minute changed the class from curved to binned, and threw curveballs from random parts of the textbook on our final even after assuring us in class multiple times that the final would follow past outlines. this may depend, but he also has an accent that makes it hard to follow lectures (itâ€™s just him reading slides ðŸ˜­)
Wow, thanks!"
