"One week after a stranger shoved meth into a toddler's mouth at People's Park, a local mother who took her children to play at Ohlone Park in North Berkeley said an ""unstable"" man tried to give her son liquid from a bottle he said held water and honey. Police arrested William Turner, 36.",http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/06/19/berkeley-mom-says-unstable-man-tot-lot-tried-give-baby-mystery-drink/,2017-06-19 22:44:31,,"There are some interesting people wondering around our parks o_O
I used to live pretty close to Ohlone and the tot playground where this interaction happened. There are a lot of mentally ill people hanging out and sleeping in that area, sometimes hanging out in the tot playground. Had to call BPD several times for fights and one time for a guy that ODed. 
A truly magnificent and historic cultural touchstone that must be preserved.
I can't fucking wait to get out of this place, having to rub elbows with these people has gotten old. These people need to be committed for the rest of their time on earth, the fact that Thomas isn't being charged with attempted homicide is just a reflection of the idiotic bullshit we have to deal with while going to school here.
'Bootstrap' Bill Turner
This guy is schizophrenic and has been off his medication for a year. We have been talking to police since day one trying to get him hospitalized and back on his medication but they won't listen and released him from the hospital every time only after being there for a few days. If anyone understands mental illnesses they know that it takes about 3 months of medication before they start becoming normal again. He was really trying to give kids water. There were no drugs in it at all. He had two kids and because of his illness he never got to meet any of his children so he feels that it's his mission to help as many kids since he can't help his own. His intentions are good he just doesn't realize how creepy he comes off to others because of his mental illness and the authorities are not helping him by releasing after only a few days!!!

Ok but for real why take your kids to people's park to play ?
We can't wait for you to gtfo.
Berkeley has a ton of safe parks. 
This one was Ohlone park, not People's.
Based on my upvotes, I think you might be using ""we"" a little liberally.

It's chill, I won't miss the people like you, so it's not like that statement has any impact whatsoever, it will be a very nice day when I know there will be a significantly lower chance of me interacting with people like you.
Ah
For a statement that ""has no impact whatsoever"", you've sure made a point of continuing to be defensive and abrasive.
Seriously, take your negative outlook on life and blatant disrespect for the mentally challenged and GTFO. WE, the people who enjoy living in this beautiful city, will not miss your presence in the slightest.

 You have no upvotes, seriously don't know what you're talking about there.
Meh, that statement didn't mean much. It was following up with accusing me of hating handicapped people that made it so civility wasn't a priority. 
I've never had issues dealing with the mentally challenged, but it says a lot that you'd stick up for people feeding babies meth and trying whatever this guy had in mind. The vast majority of the mentally challenged would never cause harm to another, but that doesn't mean I enjoy getting yelled at on street corners. Get your feeding baby meth apologist ass out of my inbox.

It was up to eight before, although I'm sure my attitude probably contributed to that going down slightly, not my content. 

At no point did I make any claims about all mentally challenged people, I'm talking about someone that has been identified for years as dangerous. Don't out words in my mouth.
Speaking of putting words in each other's mouth. At no point did I stick up for the guy that put meth in a kids mouth. This article is about the stranger with liquid in a bottle he said was water and honey.

We both agree that you should leave this city, why are you arguing with me?
""One week after a stranger shoved meth into a toddler's mouth..."" you're completely right, doesn't mention that at all. This was also the first I'd heard of it, so my response was fairly spur of the moment.

By making me out to be some ableist asshole (when I'm the one with a legal disability and my own learning difficulties), you absolutely did step out for the woman who did that. They're connected incidents/behavior and far from the only examples of people in people's park repeatedly harassing/injuring others. The ones with repeat offenses need some time away until they can go without hurting people, hopefully getting them the help and structure they need, and giving them shelter in the meantime.

This woman has forced cops to medically retire from the injuries she gave them. She broke another cop's wrist. Numerous citations for a number of issues, including indecent exposure and lewd conduct. There is no reason why she should have been free to harm this child in the first place.

As far as the second guy, this isn't his first issue IIRC, but that shouldn't even matter. Behavior like that isn't acceptable, regardless of whether they understand the weight of their actions or not. They need to be in a controlled setting until they habe the presence of mind to not target children. And are you really going to diminish a grown homeless man going up to a small child, forcing a bottle with an unknown substance into his face, and ordering him to drink? Really?

Idk, maybe making me out to be something I'm not and then complaining when I do it back is kinda shitty, and I don't see the reason why I shouldn't respond to that?

There are some aspects of Berkeley that I'll really miss. The food, the weather, and the music scene are all wonderful. I just don't have patience for self-absorbed weirdos and this city has a lot of that. I also really hate the echo chamber this place turns into politically, even though I actually agree with a lot of the viewpoints.

I'm leaving here to go live in San Diego. All in all, you wanting me gone just means you want me in a nicer place, so I appreciate that.
I liked your comment. It seemed to come from a much more heartfelt space. 
But you know, at the same time, you keep giving me the urge to pop up in your inbox. You make disparaging comments about a city you don't wanna live in, but don't like that I can't wait for you to leave. It's fucking hilarious. You want to leave, plenty of others want to live here. Get out, some one wants your apartment.
Thanks, I know my original comment had a lot of late night reactionary anger so that was part of it.
Ugh, I wish. Finding subletters has been impossible for my roommates that already left."
