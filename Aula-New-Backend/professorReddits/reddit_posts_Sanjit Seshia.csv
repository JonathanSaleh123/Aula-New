CS70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1aliioo/cs70/,2024-02-07 16:32:27,"WHY ARE THE ADMIN, STUDENT INSTRUCTORS, and READERS soo DAMN FINE, every single one of them 

I can’t focus during discussion or properly reply on Edstem. Keep thinking and dreaming about them fine people after lecture and discussion

Above all, ALISTER SINCLAIR AND SANJIT SESHIA absolute GOATS 🐐 🐐","lets agree to disagree💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀
Aight makes me feel better for not getting course staff, don't need to deal with thirst posts
Damn, what's your discussion section?
Lol the AI and UGSI are ………... But i mean at least they are going to be making $$$ 🥶🥶🥶"
Question about CS70 in the Fall,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4s5ccx/question_about_cs70_in_the_fall/,2016-07-10 05:46:27,So I see that for cs70 this fall it has two instructors Jean Walrand and Sanjit Seshia. Does this mean that the professors alternate lecturing or how does this work? Also would anyone recommend delaying cs70 to take it with Sahai in the spring? I've heard good things about him. Thank you! ,"They will alternate topics. It won't be a perfectly neat alternation, but it'll roughly be equal splitting.
I wouldn't recommend holding off on CS 70 to take it with Sahai. Sahai's CS 70 course is an excellent one and you will learn a lot, but Walrand is also good, too. You will find it rewarding either way. Seshia is new, so I'm not sure what he/she is like.

Go here http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/education/courses.shtml and then click the upcoming cs classes. And, yeah, only Sahai is teaching it.

Yeah avoid sahai at all cost"
Should I drop 61c?,https://i.redd.it/qjyskkz9upbc1.jpeg,2024-01-10 17:43:34,"For reference, I got an B+ in 61a and A in 61b. Is it worth finishing the 61 series now, or delaying 61c for a semester?","That 11am -2pm break

![gif](giphy|PmABbbUe3IqUKSOIBV|downsized)
Cs70 + 61c was high workload imo.  Idk ur exact situation but if ur trying to declare cs I’d drop it since u alr have 20 units.  Otherwise it’s best to get it over with
It depends on your situation, what your major in, what class are you, and what you are shooting for for a grade. In general, when these types of posts are done, you have to give full disclosure.
20 units is a lot but besides that u should be good. Just stay on top of the course work.
(lol i would personally drop physics cuz Ronnie sucks ass and the course staff is wack too) 

Lisa Yan is the best professor i have ever had so it might be worth it to take 61c just for that (imo better than Dan). and if you don’t need to declare then i would drop 70 (cuz of workload) and/or do what i first said (cuz of personal opinions lol)

BioE, but yeah college of engineering so no need to declare"

## **Kris Pister's Answer**

[EECS Professor Kris Pister](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/pister.html) replied:

> Most of the faculty in this department are in the top handful in their field.
In fact, the vast majority of the faculty at Berkeley are among the most respected in
their fields.  Pick an academic topic at random, and do some web searching, and
most of the time you'll find that one of the world experts is sitting within a few
hundred meters of you.  It's an exciting place to do research!

> When I teach the MEMS class (ee147) I tell lots of stories about how the things I'm teaching were discovered (mostly in Cory Hall) and how many of the students who used to sit right where you are went on to found successful companies, how the
inertial sensors in your phone were largely invented by, and many specifically designed by, people who sat in those same seats.
> 
> When I teach the Analog Circuits class (ee140) I do the same thing.  Those AirPods you're wearing?  The low power radio that enables that to work was designed by a former ee140 student who founded a company right out of school and sold it to Apple five years later for a huge pile of money.  And the tools that everyone uses to design integrated circuits?  Many invented at Berkeley, and sold by companies co-founded by Berkeley faculty and grads.  And the whole IC CAD industry is based on SPICE, which was invented in Cory.

> There are thousands of stories like that.  We should do a better job of sharing them.

>Hilfinger [is] the top 2-3 in [his] field

I don't think he does research 
Two more fun things I can think of that came out of our students that aren't too common knowledge: cowsay and GIMP.

EECS™
Also GNU cannot really be claimed by Berkeley. It was founded by Richard Stallman when he was at MIT and is intentionally not affiliated with any university or company.
He used to (in fact, you can even see a list of some of the grad students he advised [here](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=50158)), but at some point he decided to focus only on teaching.
Sure. I think it is disingenuous to say that he is (or was) top 2-3 in any field. Nothing against the man, he is a great educator. 

I just find the list of professors given to be a bit... sophomoric? No Karp? Papadimitriou? Vazirani?
I actually have no idea how good Hilfinger's research was. But he's certainly not as famous as I would of expect of someone who was really leading their field, so you're probably right. But your initial comment was misleading (though technically correct since he no longer does research) and that's what I was addressing.

Also, I find it a little bit silly to try to say who is ""in the top 2-3 in their field."" So much depends on how you define ""their field."" And so much about what makes someone a great researcher is at least partly subjective. For instance, you mention Vazirani. What is his field? If it's complexity theory then there's way too many great complexity theorists to say that he's one of the top 2-3. If it's quantum computing then you could argue that he's in the top 2-3 since he helped found that area of research. But there's also tons of people doing great research in quantum computing, and it feels pretty arbitrary to say he's in the top 2-3.

I think it's enough to just say that for many professors at Berkeley, the research they did fundamentally changed their field."
