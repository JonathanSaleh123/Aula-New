Anyone in or has been in IEOR 191 (Technology Entrepreneurship) with Naeem Zafar?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ez38m4/anyone_in_or_has_been_in_ieor_191_technology/,2020-02-04 19:51:45,"He has us buy case studies for the semester (which I've managed to split with other people so not an issue there) but also wants us to buy 2 of his books and I'm not really interested in that. 


Does anyone have pdfs of his books or possibly has books from a previous semester that they can pass on? Thanks!","wtfff. I took this course before and  191 was by far the least likely class to have any books. I feel like your prof is just trying to make money out of you guys which is smart considering this is an entrepreneurship class lol.
ya I hate it when you read a syllabus and the required books are ones they wrote. anyways, if I can't get a hold of them for cheap I don't think I'll bother. did you like any courses similar to 191?
I only did 191 unfortunately. Check out the challenge lab though, heard it was interesting"
