Does anyone have anthro 2ac (kent lightfoot) past exams?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/auohqc/does_anyone_have_anthro_2ac_kent_lightfoot_past/,2019-02-25 10:30:14,,"Exams focus almost exclusively on names and dates if I recall, despite what the GSI's tell you
What's that intranet the dorms all have?  Like Dnet or something?  Is that still a thing?  

That had study materials for that class on it back in 2010.  
additionally, does anyone have a study guide for this class? Haven’t gone to lecture at all this semester
Just look online for a quizlet there's dozens of them and they pretty much cover all the material you need to know
Been a hot minute since I had his classes, but I remember him posting them all online. Maybe on Bspace? "
Does Kent Lightfoot still teach Anthro 2AC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/902ub4/does_kent_lightfoot_still_teach_anthro_2ac/,2018-07-18 21:53:52,"Next semester, Jun Sunseri will teach the course. Do u guys happen to know if Lightfoot still teaches it? Thanks!","I loved having him back in the day.  He was hilarious.  You're missing out on learning about Roberta if he's not teaching it any more.
He taught it last fall semester. Not sure if plans on teaching it in the future. He didn’t say anything about it being his last time when I had him"
