Is taking 7 units this summer doable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gr9k0d/is_taking_7_units_this_summer_doable/,2020-05-26 17:52:02,"I’m thinking to take Psych 110 (with Davina Chan) and Philos 12A (with Wesley Holliday). They’re 7 units in total. I plan on majoring in Psych with most likely a double major in Data Science, but the thing is that I’ve never taking a CS or Data Science course in my life so I don’t think I would like to take one this summer (especially such a fast paced course). Thoughts?","If you don't have other commitments, two classes over the summer is manageable.
I’m taking 9. So far I’m chillin with time for Netflix and porn.
The two essentials."
Recommended Psych courses to take as an incoming freshman this summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gr752k/recommended_psych_courses_to_take_as_an_incoming/,2020-05-26 15:27:44,"I was considering Psych 110 (Introduction to Biological Psychology with Davina Chan) and/or Philo W12A (Introduction to Logic with Wesley Holliday). 

Does anyone have any recommendations for an easy course to transition into college material? Looking for something that’s pretty easy to get an A in; I also have AP Psych under my belt. I might be doing a Psych and Data Science double major though so I’d prefer a course that overlaps with the general requirements.",
