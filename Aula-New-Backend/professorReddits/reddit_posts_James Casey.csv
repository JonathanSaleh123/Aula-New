Differential Equations required MEC ENG 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l1oswk/differential_equations_required_mec_eng_104/,2021-01-20 18:23:22,Does MEC ENG 104 require a good background of differential equations? The professor is JAMES CASEY,"Probably since it's a very math heavy course. Took it under someone else and used diff eq at times. Worst case just pnp if u have to. You don't need like Fourier stuff though.
No.  Just basic knowledge of ODEs.
Ordinary differential equations ?"
