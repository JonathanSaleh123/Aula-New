"USA Today: UC-Berkeley offers summer class on 'Game of Thrones'. Film 108 is taught by Justin Vaccaro, a Berkeley Ph.D candidate in film and media studies.",http://college.usatoday.com/2015/08/18/uc-berkeley-game-of-thrones/,2015-08-18 19:49:27,,"Is this on netflix? because i haven't seen any of these shows but i don't like that gore stuff. The only gore i like to see is when i bite the meat off a cold chicken wing i find in the gutter on telegraph. This one night my best pal harry and me where walking around peoples park and i saw a piece of brocolli on the ground out of the corner of my eye and i pointed and said, 'that looks like broccolli.' I never seen harry move so fast, he pick up that broccoli put it in his mouth and swallowed it and then he screamed, 'i fucking love broccoli,' as loud as he could that he scared the shit outta these frat girls.
I took a lot of classes like this and enjoyed some of them, but now regret having not taken something more useful.  I would have explored my personal interests anyway.  Head over to https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf and go as far down the rabbit hole as you want and take a class that might help you in some other aspect of your life.
I totally thought this was going to be some hack job about how kids these days are watching TV in class at a ""good"" university, kids these days amirite? But no, just pretty much total fact reporting.
When I read the title I assumed it was a DECAL but it's an actual class. Interesting! "
