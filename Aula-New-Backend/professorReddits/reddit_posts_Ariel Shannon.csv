French 1 Professor? CYPLAN/CIVENG C88?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/z75mp6/french_1_professor_cyplanciveng_c88/,2022-11-28 11:21:32,"Hello -- does anyone have any experience taking French 1 with Ariel Shannon Hixon? If so, what was your experience like? 

Also wondering how CYPLAN C88 (data science for smart cities) is as a class?

I am deciding between these two courses and would like to know which is more valuable for my last semester at Cal. Thanks! :)","Ariel is awesome! She's very engaged with the class and very understanding. The class can be a little bit intimidating at first, but it only gets better. This goes with any language class at Berkeley but make sure you know what you are getting into. It's not only 5 times a week but full immersion and the class is conducted entirely in the language of instruction (this is only for your benefit). If you're shy or timid, tell her about it after class and she will help you. Please try your best to participate in class and speak up, even if unsure or you think you're making a mistake. I was a bit hesitant at first but you can train yourself to be more confident.

Some of my tips are:

\- memorize the vocabulary words early. Anki is by far the best tool I found to memorizing vocab words. Make sure you memorize nouns alongside their genders! If you know the vocab, you can focus solely on grammar, the real tricky part

\- read through the entirety of a chapter before the lessons for that chapter begin. Reading/skimming through an entire chapter honestly takes about an hour max and you will be ahead by two weeks and can focus more on smaller confusions/issues you have throughout the lessons

\- don't worry about too much about pronunciation. In French 1, it really doesn't matter (in terms of grading or anything like that), but I do recommend watching some phonetics guides on Youtube. It's pretty nice to get the French /ʁ/ down early on. Also pay close attention to the vowel forms (she explains these in class). French is actually not too hard to pronounce and once you memorize the patterns (like ou = 'ooh' /u/ sound), it's actually quite simple, at least much simpler than English (with all of its horrible spelling/pronunciation inconsistencies) imo

Bonne chance!
+1 to Ariel! I had her for French 1 and 2 last year and really enjoyed both classes. You won’t be disappointed!

thank you so much for the tips and your thoughts. I'm glad to hear she is a good professor."
