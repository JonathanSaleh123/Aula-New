Berkeley Prof Richard Muller Admits He Was Wrong About Global Warming [xpost from science],http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-muller-global-warming-2011-10,2011-10-25 09:00:32,,"What?  You mean someone **changed their opinion** after reviewing the data?

I am much more concerned on if he will change his stance on Nemesis, that is a way more awesome thing to be scared of
Does anyone have a link to the post on /r/science?
I bet it was last week's hot fall weather that changed his mind..
When was he a climate skeptic? Citation please?

Professor Muller is a savvy guy. He purposely likes people to not know which side of an issue he's on, so that they'll listen more. But as long as a year, he seemed to me to be a warming believer.

In his 2008 book, he says global warming is a serious problem. Why do people keep calling him a skeptic?
Not so much experiments as a broader analysis, taking some of the most common skeptic counterarguments into account (although the BEST analysis of urban heat effects indicated urban *cooling* - it will be interesting to see if that survives peer review).
He didn't conduct experiments. He simply re-analyzed the available temperature data to determine whether proposed sources of systematic error could be giving climate scientists the false impression of warming. After reviewing the data, he came to similar conclusions as those long held by climate scientists.

“A Reexamination of Global Warming”
The most quantitative evidence for global warming consists of 1.4 billion earth land surface temperature measurements dating back to Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. There is useable Earth coverage from 1800 to the present, and excellent coverage from 1900 onward. There have been several criticisms of the prior analyses of these data by NOAA, NASA, and the UK. These include data selection bias (the groups use on 20% or less of the available stations), poor station quality (80% of the US stations are ranked poor by US govt standards), unseparated influence of urban heat islands, and possible bias from the adjustment procedures applied to the data to compensate for station moves and instrument changes. We have now completed a new study of all these issues. Using a statistical approach developed by team member Robert Rohde, we are able to use virtually all the data. We’ve studied each of the systematics in depth, and have looked at possible driving forces other than the greenhouse effect. Our ongoing work consists of analysis of ocean data and exploratory analysis of other climate effects.""

Ugh. It doesn't make me appreciate science. He didn't recant his position. He passively misrepresented his old views for greater attention. If you read his 2008 book, or listened to him talk in the last few years, you'd know he's not a warming skeptic. Yet somehow that's what the media call him, because they like simple narratives."
