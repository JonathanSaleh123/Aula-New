Physics 7B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/heuciq/physics_7b/,2020-06-23 21:35:51,Has anyone taken Physics 7B? Would you choose Professor Robert Birgeneau or Professor Alessandra Lanzara? They both got a pretty good rating on ratemyprofessors so it’s really hard for me to choose between them.,"They’re both good lecturers. Lanzara’s exams are a bit more difficult
I had Birgeneau and a lot of my friends had one or the other. I'd recommend Birgeneau as the general consensus was that he was the better lecturer. Their homeworks and exams are essentially all the same difficulty. iirc they even curve their exams together."
Questions about Summer Classes (and upper div classes) (first time using Reddit) - Continuing 2nd Year Chemistry Major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13wduvv/questions_about_summer_classes_and_upper_div/,2023-05-30 22:56:58,"Hi everyone. This is my **first time using Reddit**. 

I am a **continuing second year chemistry major** at the College of Chemistry. I have some questions about the summer classes and classes in the future I should enroll in. 

For the fall semester, I am currently enrolled in Chem 12A, Math 54 (with Zvezdelina Stankova) and Physics 7B (with Alessandra Lanzara). I am going to be in Berkeley this summer due to my research group commitments and I am interested in taking either Math 54 or Physics 7B this summer. My questions are as follows:

1. I have heard rumors that summer classes are **graded more generously** or have easier material and easier exams than fall/spring classes. **Is this true?**
2. **Taking into account the professors who will be teaching these classes in the fall semester**, which would you take over the summer: Math 54 or Physics 7B? 
3. Since I am already enrolled in Math 54 and Physics 7B for the fall semester, **I would need to replace one of them with a 3 or 4 unit upper division chemistry class.** This upper div chem class would have to not require previous knowledge of whichever course I take during the fall. For instance, if I take physics 7B during the fall, the upper div chem class should not have Physics 7B as a prerequisite. One example of this situation is the fact that **Chem 120A lists Physics 7B and Math 54 as prerequisites**. Therefore, I cannot take Chem 120A during the fall semester. I'm planning on taking Chem 104A and 104B during my junior year (3rd year). Does anyone have any recommendations for a 3 or 4 unit upper div chem class that would be a **good first upper div chem class** other than Chem 104A and Chem 120A? 
4. On the [official Chemistry Major Program chart](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/chem#chart), it says a chemistry major must complete 12 units of **Chem Electives and Allied Subjects.** I read the [official web wage](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/chem/upper-courses) about it and it is still confusing to me. Does anyone have experience with this? 

Thank you very much for the help.","1. Depend on the class. Some classes are graded easier because the class moves 2x faster so it’s harder to grasp. In my experience, summer is easier.
2. Math 54 over the summer at a CC to save money + enjoy the summer. 

3 & 4. It looks like you would need prereqs for most  upper div courses. You should replace 54 or 7B with an elective/ allied subject. You can find a list of these classes that count here: https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/chemistry/#majorrequirementsbsdegreetext. Based on what you’ve said: Bio 100, Civ Eng 106 & 111, Eps 103 & C129 and Mcellbi C100A would all count and you should have all the prereqs done for them."
