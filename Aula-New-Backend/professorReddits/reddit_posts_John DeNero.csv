"John DeNero to ""take a break from managing a large course staff"" moving forward",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/132cb4l/john_denero_to_take_a_break_from_managing_a_large/,2023-04-28 15:51:41,"This morning, staff members across Berkeley (CS 61A, Data 100, etc.) woke up to the news that John DeNero will no longer be managing student workers moving forward. He plans to teach most labs and discussions himself, and the size of courses he teaches will decrease from their usual sizes to accommodate. Check out his letter to the campus community here (requires UC Berkeley login): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kwqHJjoOx7vvhKjINnOc40fuO2AJLK9qmUqRAFkY5yA/edit

My heart goes out to the AIs, tutors, and TAs in the pipeline that are affected.","This is the same school that didn’t offer CS168 for two consecutive years (the same school I spent about ~$300k as an international student). Had to teach myself this stuff on the job because the school that I went to couldn’t get basic stuff like budgetary allocations right. 

Genuinely, why are there so many issues at this school?
The university got what it deserves. It’s not like allocating a $10M course staff budget is within the pay grade of an Associate Teaching Prof. to start with. Denero went above and beyond with the interest of students in mind and now he’s getting accused of doing illegal stuff??! We’re lucky he didn’t quit and get a better job. 

My job pays me over 200k fresh grad to be a low key backend infrastructure dev and never asks me do anything that could get into legal trouble. Reading this makes me furious but I’m still surprised Denero didn’t just quit after the legal accusations.
Reagan and the air traffic controller union moment.

Don’t need to bargain with the uGSIs if you don’t have any uGSIs, I suppose.

With the department drastically cutting enrollment for CS they’re probably of the opinion that if they can just tough it out through the last big batch of CS students they can have all GSI course staffs from there on. The bargaining wasn’t going well so this is the nuclear option - temporary pain for the next 2-3 years.
so what’s going to happen to all the students who need to take cs61a?

Graduating this semester, I feel as though I've leapt out of a car moments before it smashed into a wall and exploded. Many of the opportunities I had--from being able to even come to this university to study CS to being able to take every class I wanted to getting to staff a class I loved--are now drying up for one reason or another. I've had an amazing experience here and im thankful for what I've had but I'm sad to see things getting slowly worse in so many small ways. DeNero is well justified in this and it's really just unfortunate for everyone involved nonetheless
If I speak I am in big trouble
[deleted]
Wait does anyone know where I can find the union's charge of unfair labor practice that mentioned denero?
What does this mean for course staff?
Put bluntly, the union has been unreasonable in their requests. If one looks at the arguments from an unbiased perspective, it should be clear that, aside from existing precedent, there is no reason for UGSIs to be paid more than experienced FAANG employees on an hourly basis. If students do not think getting paid $27/hr is fair on a personal level, they can always walk away from course staff positions. Who's stopping them? Let the demand and supply chain do its job. I know of several talented students who would be excited to be on course staff even for that much pay, and this would allow genuinely passionate students to take these roles instead of those who are doing it solely for the compensation. Sure, the current pool of TAs is probably the top 5% of students, and that number may drop to the top 10% instead, but I don't see any problem.
I loved having Denero as a professor in Data 8. I think it's been pretty sad how a small section of the students have been treating him lately. I hope he knows that most students appreciate his commitment to teaching and having a positive impact on as many students as possible.

It is unfortunate that ultimately uGSIs and the department could not see eye to eye. Personally I relate more to maintaining access to the courses like Denero wanted, but I understand the need to control enrollment as well. The problem is that a privilege portion of uGSIs wanted to limit enrollment significantly, increase staff hours per enrollment while maintaining their current benefits which are very generous and unsustainable (TC calculated for an 8 hour uGSI was something around 100$ per hour worked and the last proposal from the department  left it at around $60 per hour worked TC).

Also, member of the federalist society Nick Weaver is an idiot.

Edit: in a couple of minutes I got brigaded lmao

Lol
I feel so incredibly grateful to have had DeNero as my professor before this debacle unfolded. DeNero is the GOAT.
I often ask the same question.
I did briefly consider leaving Berkeley, but I love pretty much everything about this place except interacting with the leadership of UAW 2865. I tried hard this year to develop a productive working relationship with the union, but that effort failed and expended a great deal of my time and energy — much more than I spent actually teaching. I was absent for my students and my family. So, I've decided not to spend any more of my life in that environment. 

Teaching here without interacting with the union will require a change in approach. So, I'll try that out, and I think it could be great. (I would have preferred to try on a smaller scale than CS 61A, but it turns out that finding an alternate instructor for a 1,600-student course on short notice is tough.)

As for a better job, I had a great one in Google Research before coming to Berkeley, and they paid me a lot more, but I care about improving computing education, and the potential impact I can have here at Berkeley is far greater. My faculty colleagues are also amazing, and Berkeley students are delightful. They make it easy to stay. Go Bears!
How are you getting to 10M?
Hi! I'm Angel and I've been directly involved in the process of bargaining as an ASE. I've been teaching for quite a while now and I got to say I my hope has been to negotiating on behalf of the students and the ASEs. That's why we've asked for a staffing increase so that classes can ultimately get better for students with more attention towards and ASEs can avoid being overworked(which is very common)! Additionally to correct something in your post ASEs are **not** advocating to be in the paygrade of Assistant professor, and they never have! In fact they are willing to take an unprecedented pay cut from what the contract says, but as someone who works based on ASEs opinions as far as I can tell the LBFO tells me that there is a limit. That limit would not make them in the wage rate of an assistant professor at all.   


  
Additionally I gotta say I do not take any pleasure in Unfair Labor Practice charges against any of the Professors I look up to including the one which I work for. It personally makes me uncomfy to add stress onto any of my personal heros. But I am also not (yet) a lawyer and really am not for laying charges which do not have a strong foundation as that adds stress onto my heros for no reason! So the union had the lawyers look at it and the law seems pretty clear, and in their opinion the charge has a decent foundation. For example here's a law that can seen here for higher education employers: [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes\_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=3571](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=3571) and there is good reason for this law. Power dynamics can occur where there is biased information, misinformation, or it can even break up organized labor movements(even if it is not intentional). Again it brings me no pleasure to add stress to my heros so I'm incredibly saddened that this occurred at all. I would like to apologize to anyone who may feel that I failed them in the way that which I have acted; nothing in this process has been an easy decision but my goal has always been to act in accordance with the law and ASE opinion and what makes the university's education quality better.   


I can say as someone who talks to everyone involved, everyone(inculding myself) has a lot of respect and love for Professor Denero as teacher and as a person so I was saddened to see the stress that gets to everyone involved lead to a negative sentiment of the people of union team. I do hope that he does change his mind and decides to teach with the course staff that is needed to run 61A, and I hope does return to guide undergraduate teachers grow as he has done before. Definitely a sad case scenario in every way.
This. It's happened before with recordings: [https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/61frkr/ucberkeley\_forced\_to\_remove\_or\_subtitle\_20k\_hours/](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/61frkr/ucberkeley_forced_to_remove_or_subtitle_20k_hours/)

They decided to remove them rather than subtitle them -- it's just easier that way.
Denero was advocating for keeping enrollment rates as they were though.
As I told my staff, the course will be somewhat smaller than in the past, but certainly larger than the 400-student capacity currently listed on CalCentral. I think most students who want to take 61A will be able to do so, and I'll work hard to make sure that they have a great experience and learn a lot.
I fondly recall the weekly Physics Colloquium in the 70's where it was possible to fit almost the entire graduate department in one lecture hall.  Students rubbing elbows with professors and Nobel prize winners, asking questions, and later going one on one with cake and coffee.  Was an undergrad at the time, but being an RA I blended in...it was literally magic.
It is difficult for faculty to be teachers but not also be managers if course sizes are scaled to teach to the demand.  I agree that public education is struggling, and is decreasingly being funded by the public at all.
>It didn’t used to be so hard for students to interact with Professors in the past

When was that? I'm probably older than you and I had precisely zero courses with TT CS faculty until my 5th semester. CS had visiting faculty and lecturers handle the Wheeler Auditorium courses. (By contrast, 100% of my EE and other CoE courses were taught by TT faculty.)

We're still in bargaining, so nothing is decided yet.

I don't personally have plans to teach with only minimal or no course staff.

There are stringent legal precedents about communicating with members of a union during bargaining periods. For example, see: [https://apwu.org/news/apwu-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-response-%E2%80%98stay-survey%E2%80%99](https://apwu.org/news/apwu-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-response-%E2%80%98stay-survey%E2%80%99)

From that document ""In addition, an employer cannot try ""to determine for himself the degree of support or lack thereof,’ which exists for a position that it seeks to advance in negotiations with the employee bargaining representative.”""   


This is called ""direct dealing"". I'm not sure why it's illegal but I'll be there is a good reason, e.g. executives / managers abusing power dynamics to gain an unfair advantage in bargaining. There's probably some really interesting history here.

Even when I tried to hold a more high level discussion specifically avoiding these sorts of questions, I had my 61B slack messages screen shotted and an unfair labor practice filed against me (see Exhibit 13 and 14 (pages 200 and 202) of [https://eecsdsstaff.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/UAW-2865-EECS\_DS-ULP-Filing.pdf](https://eecsdsstaff.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/UAW-2865-EECS_DS-ULP-Filing.pdf)).

John (I believe) wanted to have a conversation with his staff about different ways 61A could be staffed and was told this was illegal and the meeting blocked. I'm not sure of the details in John's case.
https://eecsdsstaff.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/UAW-2865-EECS_DS-ULP-Filing.pdf
My take on this is one of proper compensation. Let's look at Head TAs first. If they are doing the work of GSIs, then why shouldn't they be paid as much as a GSI (compensated proportionally to hours/week)? I do agree that Section TAs can definitely be re-looked at and that's why I feel like the latest supposal is the best one I've seen yet: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pnufMN2wlw1dV8kBHe37dqQTSMyA39pN/view.
Unions may be inconvenient for some in the short term but they are important for long term goals of liberating the working class.
Can someone give a TLDR of DeNero’s vs. Weaver’s views/how we ended up here, of course recognizing any summary of such a complex issue is going to be imperfect? I haven’t followed the department’s issues in detail and am somewhat OOTL.
I don’t have detailed enough info to evaluate Weaver or DeNero’s positions, but it’s wild to claim someone is biased in *favor* of workers because he’s associated with libertarians
Bruh did the department write this or smth?
[deleted]
It's obvious that nick weaver is heavily biased against the university because he didn't get a teaching professor position. People should really stop treating his word as gospel tbh.

edit: this has turned into one of the more interesting reddit threads I've ever been a part of, caught between two EECS faculty. interesting experience.
Stfu
sir this is a wendy's
[Here's](https://eecsdsstaff.org/articles/wages-and-remission/) an explainer on the subject
Similarly, this bargaining process has been the nadir of my academic career, and I was also rather absent from family life this semester. Woof.

For the benefit of the random bystanders in this thread, FWIW, I think the union folks are on the whole well meaning, brave, and doing what they think is best. They seem like great people who will do awesome stuff for the world. However, I think their incredibly aggressive and adversarial posture is counterproductive. Given the various examples of massive waste in the UC system, and the horrific examples of labor exploitation that have existing through the entirety of history, I don't blame them for playing hardball, but it all feels excessive in this particular case. I'm sure we made our own missteps that were just as frustrating for them.

I'm still interested once this process is over to know what our own ASEs think about compensation (e.g. is there some better reason than existing precedent that UGSIs should make $41/hour + free tuition?). Being legally forbidden from even asking my ASEs these questions has been hard for me. I'd love so dearly to advocate for them, but it's hard to preach the cause to the legislature/regents/provosts when I don't (sadly...) believe it myself, despite wishing I did.

Good reason exists for any law but your motivation to repeatedly invoke the law and bring allegations against our own professors are questionable. Denero has made his reason for bargaining clear. He wants more access to the CS program and better student experience with a fixed budget. The result of bargaining directly impacts thousands of tuition-paying CS students who have absolutely zero say in this matter. The whole reason Denero advocates for public bargaining is for regular CS students to have a voice, however indirect. 

It seems that some uGSIs are CS students too and genuinely want to engage with the professors’ and students’ point of view. I understand the union leadership fears this challenge their united front but the purpose of a union is to represent its members, rather than block their access to information and force it views upon members. The gravity of actions taken by your leadership shows fear and unwillingness to allow the union’s stance to change or listen to the needs of your fellow CS students.
IANAL


However this is not justice.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea
Holy fuck, I get so fucking mad whenever that story gets brought up. We literally lost 20k hours of free lectures for bullshit reasons
im literally malding reading about this story
Can I ask how the department will plan to provide the same level of student support as there currently is? Would the class move towards only offering mega labs and discussions, or hiring more GSIs instead of uGSIs, or relying on AIs? Thanks!
How will students seeking a minor in cs or eecs be affected? (Incoming freshman…)
FWIW as a physics alumn from '21 it's definitely still like this for physics majors
It is still like that for other departments where you can go to colloquiums with other professors in a room with 20 people.
Teachers are not meant to be good managers and I’ve seen some pretty bad ones, like worse than Amazon managers.  Imagine with the new CS I, II, III proposals professors now have to get involved with promoting a bunch of undergrads to the “next level”.

Industry. I seriously considered grad school but in the end I felt that it was much easier to work on stuff that interests me there than trying to get at it through academia. The huge pay gap also made letting the dream go significantly easier.
Is it legal for a middleman (who is neither university-related nor union-related) to talk with both parties and pass information to the other parties? The biggest source of frustration for me is that I don't believe there has been room for debate with quantitatively sound arguments because of this prohibition on interaction between parties. I strongly believe that this, if legal, could be the start of a solution.
This is true when talking about 90% of all other professions, but CS majors are near the bottom of the list when it comes to needing liberation.
University students that are skilled enough to obtain teaching and research positions hardly need liberating
I don't know all the details but my understanding is that we are on the cusp of ratifying a new GSI contract, and the key remaining point of disagreement is how much 8 hour uGSIs should make. 

DeNero (and I believe the department overall) is in favor of ending tuition reimbursement at least for 8 hour uGSIs and potentially for all uGSIs (I'm not sure which). Weaver and the union are against this, because it's effectively a 3x paycut to uGSIs in some cases.

Honestly, although I benefitted from uGSI tuition remission, I think Denero's argument is valid. Because it substitutes financial aid, it's a pretty regressive form of compensation - someone paying full sticker price would save a lot of post-tax money, someone on full financial aid would not benefit whatsoever. I also generally feel that a department as resource-constrained as ours probably shouldn't pay uGSIs an effective wage of $70+ / hr to teach. That said, if I was still a uGSI, I'm not sure I'd feel the same way.

I have never really felt represented by our union tbh, and I'm not a fan of them trying to shut denero up. Part of this is that I've always identified more as a student of the university than an employee.
I didn’t say that lol. But yes, I think what you pointed out is weird. I think he just supports the union out of self interest because he wants to teach less people
Nah I just followed the bargaining process because I find the university’s financials really interesting being a public university.
>obsidianissimo
My comment was doing fine and getting upvoted, but in a short amount of time it got downvoted to hell. I suspect it has just been shared in a private messaging group to get downvoted. I just think people should listen more to Denero who has been so committed to teaching undergrads here. It is just a sad situation all around.
If Nick were in a teaching professor role, he'd be making the same arguments. He is a tireless and absolutely fearless advocate for students. I disagree with him on some aspects of this issue, but have zero doubt about his motives being pure.
I was a uGSI for you in the late 2010s.

I think there’s probably a combination of factors that has led to the sad situation today.

I TA’ed during the tech boom. I didn’t really care about the money because I knew I was going to make a lot when I joined the industry after graduation. I did it because I enjoyed teaching. And I felt like my peers were in similar boats.

Nowadays, with income inequality spiking, the economic contraction, the difficulty in new grad hiring, and the general sense of economic instability, I can definitely see why it’s more important than ever to secure a decent wage from your work.

Ultimately, it’s an incentives mismatch. Jobs that are valuable for society should pay the most. But right now, they don’t. Or rather, society defines value differently than what I personally believe is optimal. There’s just no way to get around the hard fact that today, teaching is a job of passion, not of personal gain. We need fundamental societal change first if we want to achieve a better outcome.
As a former uGSI, I have the unpopular opinion that undergrads don’t deserve the same level of pay as graduate students. As mentioned by others, teaching as a uGSI is primarily a job based in passion. When admitted to Berkeley, I was not guaranteed a TA position, nor was I expecting to pay my tuition / livelihood with TA money the way graduate students do. 

Perhaps I don’t have the full context on the union’s argument but it seems like the uGSI bargaining team is using pay parity as a way to take advantage of the university’s efforts to support grad students. Tuition as an undergrad is something I fully expect to take student loans for or pay out of pocket. As a PhD student I expect to receive funding through the university be it TA pay or something else. 

How much pay is enough isn’t something I really want to weigh in on, I just think that the pay parity argument really is a foot gun.

I am saddened that the bargaining process has caused so much hardship for those involved. It truly was an amazing experience being in both Hug and Denero’s classes and course staff. I have learned a lot from them and their passion for CS is infectious. I hope that both GSIs and faculty can come together to serve the next cohort of students and provide them with the same or better experience I was blessed with.
Ah that’s for the entire department, not just 61A.
It's not what I would call repeated in my opinion. I think we've only filed one document. And having spent many many hours with Denero in the past few months trust me when I say that I understand where he's coming from. I have never really villianized him, in fact I made this reddit account to stop others from villianizing him as seen in my first comment. I believe he has always done what he believes is best for students and the university and that is great as that means actually share a lot of the motives and goals! ASEs have never wanted enrollment cuts, in fact out the (I think) hundreds of DATA/EECS ASEs they will be the first to tell you that they hate it! They want staffing increases not only to avoid common overwork but to increase educational quality by having more staff hours per student. I'll tell personally as a what I find to be a grossly under represented minority in the department, the first one of my family to go to college right out high school, and CS discoverer I have pushed against enrollment cuts, for more accessibility, and more resources per student and that's why I often clock more than my allotted appointment. So I think both Denero and ASEs agree on the importance of not undervaluing the affects that negotiations has on the students.

  
I would also like to make a small correction (I swear to you I'm not trying to be annoying). All DATA/EECS ASEs are students and virtually all of them are undergraduates. 

&#x200B;

As for union leadership, I would like to confirm that it is not a secret shadow cabal where I reign as dictator. In fact I joined the team by just showing up to the meetings.  There really isn't a barrier or anything like that. I understand that meetings are bound to have time conflicts however so that's why I've spent a good amount of my time on outreach to gather the ASEs opinions on the matters and move along based on **that as the union is a democratic organization.** If anyone wants to attack me that's great! **My opinion is no more important than any other ASEs opinion. So no, I do not think that the union is afraid of differing opinions being voiced, in fact we encourage that they voice them to us so we adjust accordingly!** However call me overly legalistic but I do think we should act in the confines of the labor laws that exist to avoid any misinformation, power dynamics, or union busting.
As mentioned before in the comment I am also not (yet) a lawyer. and I do not really feel comfortable arguing law on reddit without having gone to law school, but I do trust the union lawyers who are indeed lawyers. So I don't really feel comfortable prescribing justice myself but I do trust the lawyers who believe that there is a good foundation for the charge considering everything. I know this feels like an unsatisfying answer as I am not really arguing the law due to me not really wanting to do so without passing the bar. Sorry about that but that's my perspective right now.

One meeting Price presented his claim to ""likely"" have observed a magnetic monopole and Alvarez began to probe.  First some softballs, then hardballs.  Price went to the board but was stumbling a bit, then made an error and stopped, things got quiet and tense.  Suddenly Prices' post doc jumped to the board and did the full derivation.  This got a ""Thank you, that's what I wanted"" from Alvarez,  a standing ovation from everyone else, and a tearful hug from Price.  Drama!
What proposals are you referring to?
I'll upper-bound it - I was able to take a course with Gene. 

My point is just that CS faculty skipping out on those big courses is not a recent development.
This isn't a law that we are all just stuck with. The union has specifically chosen to aggressively control the flow of information, as evidenced by the legal document they prepared complaining about my unfair labor practices.

The union could unilaterally decide to allow direct discussion and quantitative debate as you propose, but unions typically don't want to allow their bargaining opponent to directly influence their members\*. It's worth noting that the union has laid out their case in a quantitative way in some detail on their website ([https://eecsdsstaff.org/](https://eecsdsstaff.org/)).  Though I'd have loved to have actually held such debates in real time rather than on asynchronous websites, videos, documents, etc.

If you think about the personal sway that John and I have (having taught many of the ASEs in the past and supervising many of them currently), it doesn't seem illogical for the union to try to control the conversation tightly. This is especially true given that the union leadership strongly distrusts John specifically.

Similarly, some of the ASEs have mentioned that they're briefed to not react to what we say in bargaining meetings. And when John/Ani/I tried to co-develop a survey for ASEs, the union leadership responded by giving us a last best and final offer (LBFO) and saying they'd sue for millions of dollars if we didn't accept it.

In short, I personally think they are doing the wrong thing by restricting all communication into a tiny channel, but I get why they are doing it.

\* In the reverse direction, I'd love to get influenced, and I actually did have a really great hour long chat with a couple of the major bargaining team members, who I'm sure felt I was vexingly unpersuadable.
This process is called ""[mediation](https://eecsdsstaff.org/bargaining-updates/mayors-mediation-bargaining-update-4-26/),"" and the ASE and university bargaining teams are about to begin engaging in mediation as part of the bargaining process
EECS enrollment has increased significantly in the past 10 years. To make it work when campus said they wouldn't support that financially, the department created position of UGSI to help cover the increased workload from larger classes. Should central campus prioritize funding teaching in general over whatever else money is spent on (athletics, administration, etc.?)   Absolutely, that seems indisputable.  

Should EECSDS specifically get more funding from central campus because it is a high demand major?  How much more?  Demand here is infinite, so what is the appropriate budget level?  What kind of EECS department do faculty and students want to have?  This is debatable, and I would guess there are many opinions within the faculty, staff, and student body.

These issues are mostly unrelated to what fair compensation is for a UGSI, but they seem to be the root of much of the conflict.  

If campus money appeared to be managed well, people would be less jaded and have more faith that the university was doing the right thing.  If students, faculty and staff had a common vision for the department, it would be easier to work towards the goal.\`\`\`\`
> I also generally feel that a department as resource-constrained as ours probably shouldn't pay uGSIs an effective wage of $70+ / hr to teach

Sure, maybe, but the solution to this is for tuition to drop. 

A lot of these problems are caused by the state's continuous 50 year campaign to defund the public university system so that it could be ""self sufficient"" (ie, charging students through the ass) rather than a public good that costs the taxpayers more upfront. 

It's created perverse incentives and behaviors within the system: Higher enrollments, more out of state attendance, general assignment classrooms with the same tech for 15+ years, and, finally, shifting the teaching burden toward ASEs. The ASE contract *does seem kind of insane*, but that's because of how underpaid everyone is (obviously not including the football coach, etc.), along with the cost of living around here.

The state needs to fund the UC better, period. From a 2019 Chronicle article:

>The costs of mass incarceration have left the UC and the state university systems gasping for air. As UC itself reported, in 1970, prisons represented less than 4 percent of state general fund revenue, while the UC and California State University systems combined received nearly 14 percent. **Today, the prison system’s take is nearly double what higher education gets: 9 percent compared with 5 percent for public higher education.**

Our priorities are fucked.
> Because it substitutes financial aid, it's a pretty regressive form of compensation - someone paying full sticker price would save a lot of post-tax money, someone on full financial aid would not benefit whatsoever.

I've heard conflicting things from both the department and the union on this. Department claims what you say, but union claims this: https://eecsdsstaff.org/articles/wages-and-remission/#remission-financial-aid. Does anyone know what is actually factual?
No, I want to teach where a University supports teaching.

The huge enrollment cuts to the major that kick in this fall (which I publicly refer to as the Thanos Snap, but Thanos was satisified at 50%, not 66%+) are something I viewed as necessary because the problem is you need both will and money to teach at scale, and the department had neither the will, the money, nor the will to get the money necessary, and the central campus administration's priorities are not teaching but the ass-deans and the football team.

And calling me a libertarian is laughable.
I will add a caveat that I don't know Nick personally. I have a lot of respect for you, and maybe I'm just the cynical asshole here, but here's a direct quote from him:

> Ex-faculty affiliated: This is the last semester I will have any affiliation with this place, which means I am able and willing to call in napalm airstrikes on any bridges I want...

> The tl:dr is the majority of the CS dept faculty would rather have ""nobody"" as a teaching professor than me. I could have understood selecting somebody else, but they literally would rather have nobody than any of the candidates who interviewed.

> Since teaching professor is what I've been doing for several years, although with more respect and less workload, I do not believe I can continue to teach in a department who's faculty majority do not believe I am not suitable for the job.

This was also largely unprompted; the original comment was about the negotiation process.

He clearly harbors some resentment toward EECS faculty, and I find it hard to believe that someone in his position wouldn't have at least some subconscious bias against the department.
You, sir, are one of the only people on this thread that seem to be willing to look at this situation in the full picture and have come out with a decently reasonable take.  Bravo, and kudos to you.
CS + DS + EECS
All legal analysis is subjective.  Anyone can argue it, not just lawyers.
This is certainly not true.

I mean to be fair, Nick does deserve some nonsignificant input in this.  He did teach at Cal for many years and probably more years than you have taught at Cal surely.
I agree with you on all points, having independently noticed the same beforehand.
Probs meant Myers (cs170 prof in fa04)
Sure, I'm not saying I know more than him about this situation, or even that his opinion is necessarily wrong. But I felt that his post was a bit unnecessarily abrasive, and I'm just pointing out he's not an entirely impartial party here.
The problem is it was abrasive but necessary, because John in particular was presenting a woefully incomplete view of the situation:  The root problem is John and Josh are not actually negotiating on the behalf of the department or the students, but on behalf of the central campus administration.

And in the end the impasse isn't just about salary (the Union's final proposal is a huge salary cut for the 8-hour TA position and right from the start what was the 'fair' answer: proportional fee remission, since almost all our TAs are not on full scholarship so fee remission is part of the student's income), it is about staffing levels.


For a decade the University has squeezed the TAS budget with a ""do more with less"" attitude.  The Union grievance over the 8-hour TA position was a huge problem (and a huge mistake on the part of union leadership to bring it), but the problems existed before.

And although John and Josh are legally required not to admit it, the amount we overwork many of our TAs is an open secret.

The way the University allocates TAS funding is deliberately and ***willfully*** broken: departments get less per student than they actually need, and they are supposed to back-fill that with department unrestricted funds.  And every year it seems to get worse, except when the department pushes back publicly.  So instead the attitude has been years of ""do more with less"".


A notion of minimum staffing is something the department and students need (the Union's final offer isn't the best on that front, its too inflexible, but a straight 15% increase in staff-hours, combined with the hugely expanded role for renamed tutor position, would maintain flexibility and make things so much better.)

But it is apparently not acceptable to the central campus.  Because apparently it is considered unacceptable by central campus that they ***actually commit to providing the resources necessary to teach our students***!

I have advocated to John and Josh that they need someone from central campus in the room, and let ***them*** take the blame for the University's refusal to consider any notion of staffing level guarantees, despite the huge problem we have.

Our students aren't stupid, they know that promises not written down are not worth the paper they aren't written on.  

""Economic incentives"" to hire more staff get quickly replaced by economic incentives to cut the staffing budget: if not by the University by the department (to preserve department unrestricted funds because of the ***willfully broken*** funding model).


And it is stupid economy.  I teach my students about Amdahl's law: ""the overall performance improvement gained by optimizing a single part of a system is limited by the fraction of time that the improved part is actually used"".  The same thing applies to budgetary issues:  https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/pdfs/lectures/lec19.pdf#page=7 

The University system spent a ***billion*** dollars on UC-Path.  The entire central campus contribution to the TA & lecturer budget for the entire campus is only 3x what the campus provides to the ""self funding"" Athletic department so it can show a ""profit"".  

The amount of money a staffing guarantee would cost is in the absolute noise from the University's budgetary viewpoint.  

Heck, I have a standing offer that could provide enough money right away:  Have me coach the football team.  I'll take a 75% pay cut relative to our existing coach, I'll only lose 4 more games next year compared to what happened this year, and that would free up $3M which would easily solve the department's staffing woes.


It is just apparently that central campus doesn't want to set the precedent of having a binding obligation to actually teach!

John and Josh need to stop being willing to take the blame for what is a problem arising from the chancellor's office and ***get someone from there to take the blame***:  What you fund is what you prioritize, and this University wants to fund the ass-deans and the football team.
He isn't entirely impartial here but at the end of the day when costs and salaries and livelihoods are on the line, who is?  Surely you don't believe that DeNero is the absolute True North, squeaky clean, Berkeley EECS Jesus Christ himself, do you?  Everybody is somewhat partial in this disagreement, which is why it is a disagreement in the first place.  Ruling out Nick's viewpoint entirely, a viewpoint I add has provided at least some clarity in this situation, because he may be impartial, seems contrary and reductive.
How much do you know about university willingness to permanently increase CS teaching budget? My understanding is that the entire EECS department have been trying to get the school to do just this for years... Right up until a few years back when they gave up and tried restricting access to CS courses, CS major, and CS admission with varying degrees of success. 


The fact that we are here with direct admission to CS and 0 seats in CS classes for other majors means that the entire EECS department tried and failed to get more funding. The school would rather have fewer CS students than give EECS more teaching budget. What would you try that the department haven’t?
yenno, at the end of the day, I don't know that much about this topic,  and as an alum, I'm not that invested in the outcome. at some point I don't want to get caught in this back-and-forth between faculty.

I apologize if you felt personally attacked by my comment. Maybe I was entirely incorrect, but I think I inferred what most people would have inferred from your response.
LOL we absolutely should cut funding to the football team yeah.
I did not rule out his viewpoint. I just said people shouldn't take it as gospel. 

getting caught in a reddit debate between CS faculty has certainly been an interesting experience lol.
Go public.  Make a stink.  Silently working within the University system is a recipe for failure.

A few years back the Dept got sick of the ""do more with less"" TAS budget and simply cut the available spots in the classes, the students screamed, and somehow central campus found the funding.
Wait, if you don't know that much about this topic and you are not that invested in the outcome, why did you comment so strongly about it in this thread and others?  Your major says stats, but I grow more and more doubtful with every comment you post and conclusion you draw.  You came in too hot and are in too deep to weasel your way out of this one I am afraid.
The only opinion I’ve espoused is that subconsciously or not, Nick might have his own biases. I don’t know Nick. Maybe I’m wrong, and maybe I should’ve qualified my opinion more instead of coming in so hot, but I feel it is a completely logical interpretation of what he wrote. I don’t think I’m just making stuff up here. 

I have no idea what you’re implying with the stats comment tbh."

I’m most likely going for DS minor cuz double major w DS will prob be rough for me at this point. ppl tell me to go w/88 bc most who go data science pathway do that i guess, but then others tell me 61A will be more worthwhile. Is there a big difference in level of difficulty between the two? If 61A is significantly harder, might just try to enroll in 88. I’m already enrolled in 61A on waitlist but like #41 so i’m sure i’ll get in. But if it’s a lot harder i’ll just try to get into 88. But if it’s not much of a difference, I think i’d rather take 61A to learn some useful technical skills. The only thing “close” to programming i’ve had is taking data 8. I liked the class more than i thought but it wasn’t a walk in the park for me personally, for reference.","I recommend Cs 88. However you might find 61B a bit harder coming from cs 88 rather than 61A. Just a thought.
I recommend CS88. The only topic you will miss is Interpreters/Scheme at the end, but you will get all of the Python topics, and those will serve you quite well in Data Science.

In addition, CS88 will go at a more manageable pace. Students generally struggle in 61A if their only introduction to coding is Data 8, as 61A goes very fast through difficult topics. CS88 gets to spend a little more time on each of those topics, and many of your classmates will come from similar experience levels as yours.
[deleted]
I’m going ds minor so i won’t need to take 61B! but i definitely was thinking about that when i was considering taking the major instead before.
my other classes are not hard. but i didn’t find data 8 super manageable. it wasn’t like getting out hand for me but it still didn’t come super easily to me -specifically the exams. i couldn’t get away with skipping lectures and not going to OHs. but i def am someone who is slower just in general LOL so if CS 88 covers less over more time, that would be good for me. dang it. so conflicted cuz i’m in a good waitlist spot for 61A. idkkk if it’s possible during phase 2 for me to get a  CS 88 spot. do you know the liklieness for that?
Damn you escaped some hell bruh
[deleted]
You will 100% get into CS61A at Adjustment time.  If fact, you could drop/swap the class with something else rn and add CS61A at Adjustment time and still get in.  That’s how confident I am.  (Well, might be too late  rn since I think Phase 1 is over).
lmaoo. Rlly was tryna tell myself to go for the double major but i don’t think i’m built like that
Will it not swap the classes if 88 ends up not being avail? so that i can save my spot in 61A in case.
oh wow i didn’t know 61A was that flexible. i thought that was the class that i needed to get first so i signed up for it first:/ ya phase 1 over... hopefully i can just swap next phase...
[deleted]
Yeah, shouldn’t be a problem to do that.
ohhh i see. and does it swap you into waitlists or ONLY actually enrolls you fully.
do you think i’d be able to land a spot in CS 88 tho during Phase 2?
Maybe, I would say 50-50.  Are you a rising sophomore?  If so, then you have a better chance than if you are a rising junior.  Chances are a lot of incoming transfer students will eat up the remaining slots for juniors I suspect.

"EECS Social Hour with John DeNero notes (February 28, 2017): Discussing elitism. ""The CS/EECS major being superior to other degrees is a symptom to society’s view on degrees. Rather than asking people to say year/major/name, why don’t we talk about pronouns to establish identity?""",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ym-wzMSsafkqO0-enZYiCEmoTM-4QY1v4Gwk6vnCaEg/edit,2017-03-23 09:15:55,,"There is a lot more in this discussion then the cherry picked headline, but,

Because your pronouns don't say anything about what your interests are, what you do academically (which is what most people are concerned about here), what kind of shared university experiences you have etc, etc. Now yes the topic here is addressing that additionally there are some damaging stereotypes that do come along with that, but people while in the university environment have a huge sense of identity based around their major, which isn't going to go away.
What you do tends to be more important than who you are.

[This town hall was a complete joke.](http://i.imgur.com/wN7KUot.png)

[Seriously.](http://i.imgur.com/ahvK6rY.png)

I agree that there's some degree of elitism within the EECS/CS community, but stupid complaints like this drag down the entire event. Oh, boo hoo. The professor wants to see who took calc and physics and is making you feel bad. 

Get over yourself. It's not the school's job to cater to people who can't deal with real world conditions. Guess what? When you get a job at google or amazon or whatever unicorn you manage to find, there WILL be people who are smarter than you, and you WILL feel inadequate. Guess what? that's part of life, some people are better than you at some things and worse than you at others. Fuck, we're all battling feelings of inadequacy. But *no*, instead of working harder to do better in classes, I'm just going to complain about it. Waaaaaaah.
What I study says infinitely more about me than my pronouns...or maybe my male professors (Searle?) disagree, which is f'ed up.
I don't like this like of reasoning at all. We *shouldn't* talk about pronouns as a way of establishing identity because this suggests that there is a hypertypical norm which the sexes ought to conform to. Are they suggesting that women and blacks, for instance, *ought* to think differently and have different interests than men and asians? 

We are interested in what we are interested in, and the trials, tribulations and exaltations which we know are shared by others who are seeking the same thing. How can we as (EE)CS people possibly expect a Women's Studies major to understand the uniquely triumphant feeling that emerges as the result of uncovering a clever trick to solve that CS170 problem that you've been stuck on for a day and a half, or the brief moment of clarity that comes after wrestling with a difficult concept, and then truly understanding it?

Elitism is a problem, and I think that recognizing that at some point everyone faces intellectual struggles is the remedy. There will always be gifted but arrogant (and unteachable) people. Most of them will eventually hit a plateau because they never learned to grow. Disregard them, and focus on everyone else who recognizes their own ignorance and wants to do their best to reduce it.
I was intrigued by this question when I saw it in the Facebook thread for the event. I couldn't figure out what it was getting at about ""asking people to say year/major/name"". Was this a commentary on how college students meet one another (""hey I'm _____ and I'm studying _____. what are you studying?""). Is everyone asked ""year/major/name"" at some event that I missed?

And re: pronouns, I still personally have difficulty caring about pronoun preference, to be honest. I get more out of knowing your name and your favorite hair color. I'm always down for deep discussion on trans issues and the gender binary, but I see preferred pronouns inevitably becoming unique to every individual. And we already have words that uniquely describe individuals. They're called names.
If EECS guys are so great, why can't they do math? ^I'm ^just ^^messing ^^^with ^^^you


[deleted]
That's exactly what happens when college people meet each other 
pure Math is hard :(
I agree that the elitism phenomenon is due to societal standards that are being set, but that doesn't mean that the EECS community shouldn't be responsible for trying fix internal feeling about EECS compared to other majors.
along those lines, society's choice of EECS isn't just arbitrary; they're much more useful to the world than people from any major. Consider how someone who designs a good app can improve hundreds of millions of lives. Humanities majors simply can't compete.

>I think the AVERAGE inventor is more useful than the AVERAGE writer.

That is an absurd claim.

For someone who is (presumed to be) pursuing data sciences, it's interesting to read a completely unquantifiable statement made exclusively to confirm biases.
It's difficult to even make that claim because one cannot quantify the benefit with a philosopher/writer the same way that they can with an inventor/engineer. For example, an app can have an approximate x hours/dollars saved per person, while a philosophy may be more useful but that's subjective.
Ok, medicine, engineering, and most of the sciences are indispensable. I'd just argue that, at this current moment, the EECS major is the most useful. The growth of electronic technology is still logarithmic, idk if you could say the same about any other field of science, medicine, etc...
Wait, do you mean logarithmic or exponential? Because I think you could make a case that plenty of fields are logarithmic with respect to growth.
ya, exponential"

**Economics 1.** (Really interested in economics. It also fulfills my social sciences breadth requirement. I definitely want to take a business class)

Lmk how hard my schedule is, and if I'm on track to reaching my goals. Thanks!!","I would figure out what you hope to get out of Berkeley before you submit yourself to the brutality of 4 techs. You can’t be a coding doctor investment banker. If you want med school you need a high gpa and research and you likely won’t have time if you’re swamped with techs and lengthy cs projects. Med schools will not care you did cs so if it’s just a back up I would look at DS instead since you can take more chill classes and can do the bio related focus
That is a packed schedule, especially with both Chem 1A and 1AL in the mix. I would hold off on Econ until another semester, especially if this is your first sem at Cal, since it's important to land on your feet once you get here and to maintain a proper work/life balance. For prereqs in competetive STEM majors, you need to work extra and attend your section, office hours, GSI office hours, study sessions both official and unofficial, etc. You've chosen pretty much only classes with that environment, and that makes it harder for you to end up with a high grade. It's doable, but really difficult and probably not necessary considering you still have 8 semesters (and 2-3 summers!) ahead of you.
have not taken a business class so i cannot attest to whether econ 1 is a prereq for any. 

That being said, if you’re really interested in economics, and you’re premed and cs, working a ground up foundation in econ from econ 1 seems like kind of a waste. I would say take something else (either a non tech breadth, or another premed req if you’re up for it so you can hit more upper divs earlier) and take an upper div econ class later—you’ll pick up a lot of econ in that. I personally enjoyed econ 157, healthcare economics. I had taken ap macro 3 years prior to that, so i was basically entering knowing vaguely what supply and demand were and not much else. Did very well and learned a lot, am glad i took that over an intro econ class. If you’re into business, take a business class that doesn’t have a hard econ prereq and brush up on econ in your spare time. 

if you’re looking to go to med school you’ll probably want to take psych and or soc at some point, both will also fill social science.
How about this instead? CS10, Math 1B, Art 32AC, Chem 1A/1AL
I don't know too much about CS10 or Art 32AC but that seems a lot better imo than your OP schedule. Check out the Berkeleytime website for grade distributions as well. All the best"

2. John DeNero or Hany Farid(Currently taking CS61A with them, doing alright in the class)

Denero would probably not agree to write you one given 61A is such a large class, or even if he does I bet it’ll be pretty generic and thus less impactful 

Not sure about Rao but I’ve heard good things from Gomez so I’d shoot my shot with him
Thank you so much for the input! I think I'm gonna take your word and reach out to Paulin & probably Gomez.

Well the number they admit as “cs” has always been sorta low, but the number of actual cs majors are high cuz people in L&S came in undeclared and then switched into cs. So the true number of cs majors you see on campus is much bigger than what they admitted. Now that it’s capped the number of cs majors will be more representative of the number that actually get admitted from the get go.
as a lscs admit, feel like all i see are eecs majors and barely any cs incoming first years
[deleted]
Blame the greedy unions
does anyone know if its the same for ds this year?
According to the first town hall April 2022 the estimated LSCS enrolled number would be 250, so the admit number has to be well higher than 100.  Remember there are no more switchers anymore, so the admit number should be more.
yeah, same! nice to meet a fellow CS major
Ahh yes because it’s the union’s fault they’ve been over enrolling cs classes and refusing to staff them adequately. It’s the union’s fault that almost every single CS GSI and UGSI works significantly over their hours. It’s the union’s fault that office hour queues are 7 hours long. Oh wait those are exactly the kinds of things the union has been trying to prevent
The union can’t magically get the department more funding from the university. Pushing for absurd levels of TC like full remission for 8 hour positions. (I say this as someone on course staff) isn’t helping anything. Neither is fucking with Hug and DeNero.

Not saying the union is responsible for this (they’re not) but please stop acting like they’re some universal force for good that would fix all the problems if they had their way."

The UC's outrageous plan to cut TAs and pay in EECS: Work-in @ Soda,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11shm8k/the_ucs_outrageous_plan_to_cut_tas_and_pay_in/,2023-03-15 19:32:55,"**TL;DR: UC has proposed fewer TAs and massive cuts to TA pay and benefits. Come to the Work-In tomorrow starting at 10am outside Soda 380 to decisively reject this proposal and demand real staffing increases.** 

For five weeks, ASEs have been engaging in negotiations with the university to increase staffing in the EECS/DS departments. Earlier today, the university passed its first major supposal. Here's what it looks like: 

Cut TA appointments by 15%. Cut enrollment by 11%. And cut wages & benefits (including remission) by 76%. This is the university's latest proposal for the EECS/DS departments. **The number one priority of ASEs is to increase staffing in the departments, but—after more than a week of waiting—the proposal that the university passed across the bargaining table today will make nearly every problem in the department worse than it is today.** 

Here's what was in John DeNero's proposal on behalf of the university: 

* **No guaranteed increases to staffing.** 
* A **non-binding** “commitment” to adhere to the university's ""sustainable staffing model,"" which involves the following changes to enrollment/appointments: 
   * Cut enrollments by 11%
   * Cut TA headcount by 15%
      * Cut 20-hour TAs by 7%
      * Cut 8-hour TAs by 18%
   * Increase tutor/reader appointments by 39% to supplement some of the TA cuts.

In addition for these staffing figures that will **harm course quality**, the university has also proposed a compensation scheme that will be **bad for ASEs:** 

* **No tuition remission for any undergrad TA, including at 20 hours.** 
* All undergraduate salaried ASEs, including TAs, **become hourly**.
* **Immediate reduction in total 8-hour TA wages & benefits (including remission) by 53%**
   * By 2024, wages & benefits for 8-hour TAs will be **76% lower** than what is guaranteed by our union contract. 
   * The university **did not offer compensation figures for head TAs**

(You can read their full supposal [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s1vwDsFqtJyxxcys9FxjDXbvJtrNFABy/view?usp=sharing), and the entire history of bargaining at our [bargaining tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EY9Kz5y0Jh8M4cLpdZR_s-Q0aJup5EvDjW_IyxWKNno/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=116679352156687843386).)

For **5 weeks**, ASEs have been bargaining in good faith with the university to increase staffing in the departments. In our previous proposal, we agreed in principle to take lower remissions and wages than those under the union contract, saving the department over **$700,000**. However, the University’s last proposal guarantees no increases to staffing. **Our goal is to increase staffing. We are not seeking further increases to our wages in the contract.**

We can and must put pressure on the university to fully fund the EECS/DS departments. And you have the power to change it. Here's what we need every ASE and student in EECS/DS to do. 

**Work-in at the Soda 3rd floor hallway outside Soda 380**: Starting at 10 a.m., workers will occupy the 3rd floor of Soda Hall and do a ""work-in"" to show the university that we mean business and that we will not stand for this insulting and absurd supposal. Join us and work on grading, homework, projects, or anything else you were planning to work on. 

**File grievances**  To put pressure on the university to fully fund EECS/DS, ASEs across the departments are beginning to file grievances relating to overwork, misclassification, and other rampant violations. It's super easy—I just filed my first grievance yesterday. See our grievance guide [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/111jPYLO21fioYgNN4M9OLGbkw6XHzpqJ-HLzVPRj7Gw/edit) and reply to this email if you'd like someone to reach out and help you file a grievance. 

**Call and email EVCP Ben Hermalin** at 510-642-1961 and hermalin@berkeley.edu (cc: EVCP@berkeley.edu) to tell him to fully fund instruction in the EECS/DS departments. You can use a template email/script [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BoAjtyOE3XEU86-NWuWcQNXe2CTx5U-fomsBOSi3k_s/edit), but make this your own — describe the unique and troubling circumstances within the EECS/DS departments that you have personally experienced as a student/ASE. 

And **keep calling and emailing** every single day until the university funds instruction.","The UC is a joke. We went on strike last year for more pay and staffing and won, their new plan is cutting both of those.
I am very confused by this whole post.

""By 2024, wages & benefits for 8-hour TAs will be 76% lower than what is guaranteed by our union contract.""

Someone down below said the university now only wants to pay $23/hour to TAs. Maybe I'm bad at math but does that mean the contract guarantees $96/hour? My math is:

$96 - $96 hour \* 0.76 = $23/hour.

Where am I messing this up? Or does the contract actually guarantee $96/hour? I've been trying to follow this whole thing but it all feels so complicated I don't even know what's going on, even with basic stuff like this.

departments budget X dollars for Y workers at Z rate

it was naive to assume demanding an increase in Z would force an increase in X.

the other obvious answer that no one seemed to consider was maintaining X and reducing Y.

the budgets will stay the same, no extra money is coming out of thin air, and they aren't pulling it from other budget line items.

increased rates will translate to fewer workers, not increased budgets.

this is not an EECS things, its across all departments.
At this point, is it even worth going?
Outcomes such as this are exactly why I have been against the union (and therefore the strike) from the very beginning. Almost any gain that any union makes in any industry comes at the expense at both the consumers of the product (in this case, undergraduate students and prospective undergraduate students), as well as *prospective employees*, in this case, uGSIs.

I think back to when I was a lab assistant and academic intern my sophopmore and junior years, which was only about 4 years ago by now. I saw other people in my year were already becoming uGSIs which meant I knew that I could to. Why would I support a union that would effectively fight to increase barriers to entry for people in my position?
The whole department is bloated. There is no justification for having so many so many undergrad course staff. Cut enrollment, cut some undergrad TAs, hire more grad students.
The strike is to advocate for GSI not earning a living wage, not uGSI who don’t have to teach to earn their degree. To be honest, more tutors instead uGSIs to help OH is a great idea. It makes the budget works without drastically cutting class sizes. 


Look at Denero’s data sheet, under the new contract 8hr uGSI would effectively make $75/hr with tuition remission. How does that make sense when there’s a $2M budget deficit and actual GSI got less than half the raise they were striking for?
These new proposals are explicitly a result of the strike. When some positions are paid more, that takes money out of the budget and there's less money to pay for others.
With benefits and remissions as well as pay it’s about $101/hour for 8hr TAs. Take a look here if you want all the data. This edstem post contains the link to the data https://edstem.org/us/courses/23247/discussion/2773473 .
Current 20hr UGSI. This is my own understanding and opinions on the issue.

Most large CS classes are effectively completely UGSI run, even compared to large classes in other majors. When I say UGSI run, I mean the class top to bottom, including all logistics, all student activities, all course content, and more. It’s to the point where professors effectively disappear outside of lectures and maybe writing a couple exams. In all the other non-CS classes I’ve taken, professors have had a much bigger role in the class even in big classes and perform many of the roles that some TAs especially head TAs would perform in CS courses. 

Full tuition remission for 8hours was never the goal of negotiations. Rather it is the primary tool used to negotiate a commitment to maintaining staffing levels and funding. It’s true that the effective hourly rate for undergrads is high in CS, but you should also consider that CS TAs are doing many more roles than just teaching discussion and OH, which is not nearly as common in other departments.

The primary issue I personally take is that the school is cutting staffing and funding much more significantly than enrollment. And at the same time, there’s no clear direction on how classes ought to be run with this new model other than it balances the budget. Massive classes do not run themselves. You need a massive staff of TAs well versed in the subject, familiar with how the class is run, and compensated to run such classes. With many professors indifferent to running the courses they teach and eliminating most TA positions, there will likely be a significant hit in the quality of many classes.

This has been an issue in EECS for years, long before the most recent contract negotiations. In fact, the entire reason the bargaining right now over staffing in EECS is even happening is that during the strike, the university recognized that there was an issue in EECS and Data Science staffing, and agreed to bargain with the union over resolving these issues specifically. Ultimately the university for years hasn't allocated sufficient budget to staffing in EECS, and has instead relied on ASEs to overwork and on students to be okay with having insufficient support in classes. The union has even proposed compromising on some of the wages and benefits of the new contract to save the department money and encourage the university to finally fund us appropriately, but they have refused to do so. Ultimately, long as the university thinks we will accept a proposal that cuts costs for them, they will hold off on proposing anything that would actually allocate more resources to fix the problem.
That's exactly right. It's the same as research money. Increasing pay for students and postdocs is great, but funding agencies won't increase project budgets because of union negotiations. Inevitably, this means fewer hires.
UGSIs are often a better idea IMO than GSIs since UGSIs are typically much much much more acquainted with course material. 

I think replacing UGSIs with more tutors (and have tutors that are more specialized eg, Ed, OH, and Discussions) is personally the way to go. 

For the course staff I’m on, I think personally if everyone worked ~10 hours but ran efficiently and things were reorganized, the course quality would be significantly better. It would be better to the point where you could probably cut 20% of people or so.
DeNero just made new proposal today. The plan is to remove tuition remission entirely and pay TA's $23/hr (that's 5 dollars less than they make now and when you take into account fee remission about $32 per hour less). There may be a deficit but the solution is not to cut wages and staffing even further.
I kept throwing around the $50+/hr number because that was the effective pay rate the union was bargaining for... union didn't even get that much and still look what's happening 😂😂
> With many professors indifferent to running the courses they teach and eliminating most TA positions, there will likely be a significant hit in the quality of many classes.

I believe the school is better off fixing the main issue here than working to duck tape it with more uGSIs being paid FAANG internships level to do administrative work. There are professors who like to teach, and there used to be more including Weaver, Hilfinger, and Fox. Now there are fewer of them, and that impacts students and ASE experience.
As an addendum, if we switch to the new model gradually, it’ll probably be fine in the long run as newer classes of TAs, course staff, and students get accustomed to the new arrangements. However, since this is such a drastic change happening out of the blue, in the short term it will likely cause a bunch of issues on either the staff side, student side, if not both. The issues could probably be ironed out in a year or two, but no student or staff member will volunteer their entire major to decrease in quality for such a long period of time. This is especially true for students taking important classes in their major.
[removed]
Yep, tuition remission is supposed to be for grad students who usually take 2-3 courses/seminars that are approved by their advisor each semester. It was never meant for uGSIs to come in and get their full tuition waived.
That is untrue. OOS and international students are charged the same “tuition” as in state but then charged significantly higher “supplementary tuition” which is not charged to in state students. Only the normal tuition gets waived.
You're absolutely correct. I don't think our comments are really in disagreement. But yes, you're right.
Tuition remission is not wages. The proposal increases more staffing through more tutors positions. Even if the EECS has money to pay 8hr uGSI more than FAANG interns, which they don’t, there would be better place to spend that money to help student experiences. For instance GSIs and lecturers  compensation and developing more experimental courses. 

Both professors Weaver and Fox left because, #1 low compensation and #2 high student load. The faculty that actually likes to teach left because, #3 they’re forced to teach the same big courses over and over to maximize value for their labor. Weaver’ and Hug’s special topics courses has been hyped for years but never came to fruition. 

Why should a fall/spring uGSI earn 3x the money compared to a summer uGSI? Especially when summer comes around those fall/spring uGSI took off to make more money doing tech internships anyways? With the current $75/hr price tag, it makes more sense to have the tutors help with long OH queues instead of bending the budget 180 degrees or cut enrollment to meet that price.
There are some justifications behind UC's proposals:

\- UC wants to cut enrollment by 11% (although idk how I feel about this in the first place). So if the reason for advocating for an increase in TA count is to achieve better support for students, cutting enrollment is some way of achieving that.

\- UC wants to decrease TA count, but increase reader/tutor count. Like LandOnlyFish mentioned, the main issue with staffing shortage is *not* the lack of TAs, but rather the lack of support during OH, which I'm sure most students have experienced first hand. I think it makes sense that UC wants to reallocate more funding towards hiring more tutors/reades.

\- As a uGSI, it's in my best interest to continue getting full tuition remission. But to be honest I don't know if my effort justifies the original $28/hr + full tuition remission. And also agree with LandOnlyFish: our situation is different from the GSIs who are trying to earn a living wage.

If you disagree, I'm open to any critiques. Also not trying to say that we should settle with the proposal, but I think the email is painting a one-sided picture.
mit pays there undergraduate TAs 17$/hr so not sure why’s everyone complaining so much.
I agree. And this proposal does neither.
If uGSI want more staffing then why are they opposing increasing the number of tutors hired to help with long OH queues? More staff at the expense of fewer $75/hr uGSI positions. Looks like more staff is not the only or primary goal uGSI union members want here.
I’ll respectfully disagree on the second point since UGSI’s to all of the tasks listed above. Although professors have input on content, worksheets, review sessions, and exams, these are ultimately things that UGSI’s put together and sometimes with little to no input from professors who elect to delegate all responsibilities to TAs. Of course our UGSIs also perform standard tasks such as teaching discussions, office hours, and grading exams. And to your first point, yes plenty of material is reused, but also plenty of new material is added or modified, similar to what all classes do everywhere.

Our class has both GSIs and UGSIs and we all perform the same set of tasks distributed among staff members. Our UGSI’s often also take many graduate courses in the relevant area and/or do research which although is not as rigorous as that of graduate students, is still well above and beyond what is strictly necessary for teaching the class.

I do agree with you that the existing pay structure is inflated. If nothing else, you could ask GSI’s about research opportunities and letters of recommendations, whilst you can’t really do the same with undergrads. This is a natural result of their academic standings. However in terms of the tasks they perform as TAs, there is no meaningful difference. Having a pay differential between GSIs and UGSIs would be fair and acknowledge the higher amount of experience GSIs usually have in the subject. However, in my opinion the massive pay cut proposed, along with a simultaneous cut in staffing is not fair at all. Therefore, I do think it’s outrageous that BOTH pay AND staffing are being cut at the same time, especially with pay being cut so severely, and undergrads still being expected to perform the same tasks which all classes CS or otherwise requires their TAs to perform.
UGSIs also host review sessions, grad exams, have discussion sections, and available via email. UGSIs in EECS/DS deserve their compensation. 

Some of the cuts are outrageous just because a student is an undergrad doesn’t make them less qualified compared to a grad student. And the students shouldn’t be getting punished just because they have the potential of making a significant amount of money. If you are qualified you get paid.

There is a reason why there is UGSIs because there aren’t enough GSIs. I do agree that 8hr UGSI TAs shouldn’t be getting full tuition remission. However, the 20hr TAs should get remission.

Hi! I just want to respond to a few of these points, because I think you're right that these are important things to consider.

\- While I also disagree with cutting enrollment as a solution on principle, I also don't think that this would be sufficient to solve the issues in the department. For context,  after surveying ASEs in the department we estimate that around 15% of the total work done to run the EECS department comes from ASEs working above their hours, which is a systemic issue. That means that reducing enrollment by 11% would only serve to somewhat reduce the amount of overwork, and wouldn't even start to cover the issue of increasing the amount of student support, which from my experience will require substantial increases.

\- As part of this negotiations process, we have talked to many members of course staff from many courses facing the highest levels of understaffing and asked them what would fix staffing levels in their courses, and across the board the number one piece of feedback we heard was that increasing the number of 8 hour TA positions would be the most effective way to solve the staffing crisis. You're right that there are issues with OH, and we need to increase staff there, but there are also places behind the scenes where TAs are severely overworked with other kinds of work (such as administrative work or hosting discussion and lab sections) that cannot be taken up by tutors. 

\- I disagree with this framing for a couple of reasons. The first is that this is not true of all uGSIs -- for many undergrads, they are responsible for earning a living, and the salary is not a ""nice to have"" but a meaningful part of determining whether they pay rent. When the wages for undergrad TAs are insufficient for that, it discourages undergrads who have to support themselves from applying for course staff, which contributes to making course staff less diverse and representative overall. The second thing I want to point out is that every other department in every UC across the state follows the same funding model for their staff, and to my knowledge (based on talking to people who have worked with many departments) there is no other department in the state that has these issues. As uGSIs, we are doing fundamentally the same work as GSIs, and as such, we are under the same contract. In every other department in the state, the department pays all of its TAs full fee remission, and does not have such systemic issues with lack of student support and overwork as a result of understaffing. To be fair, we all recognize that the department has budget concerns, and to alleviate that, the union has proposed maintaining some level of partial fee remission for the EECS department (which again, is an unprecedented step) -- so long as in return, the university takes steps to remedy the underlying issue and allocate more funding to the department. However, we have seen with the most recent proposal, the university has been unwilling to commit to any solution that would put more resources towards staffing in the department -- which, from my experience and the experiences of many that I have talked to, would be the only type of solution that can actually address these problems.
Tutors are not able to perform nearly the same range of tasks necessary to run the class as UGSIs. To be sure, tutors are immensely helpful in the classes which currently use them; however, they are not the same as UGSIs and you cannot run classes by just eliminating your TAs who do almost all tasks necessary to running a class and replacing them all with tutors and readers who have much more focused but limited roles.

As mentioned above, full remission for 8hr UGSIs was never the end goal. Therefore, I would insist that your statement is inaccurate.

As an additional addendum, I’m not a union member. I am however heavily invested in this conversation.
[removed]
I’m not sure how it works for graduate students, but undergrads are definitely not getting there OOS and internal tuition waived. We have plenty of 8hr OOS UGSI’s in our class, and they are not getting 20k of their OOS tuition reimbursed.
To your third point that uGSI need $75/hr to pay rent, what about the rest of us? Denero mentioned the portion of uGSIs receiving any financial aid at all is close to 5%. That’s *way* less than the Berkeley student body, ~40% or something. To the point that I question if uGSI represent the student body they’re supposed to serve at all with that demographic miss match.
The proposal did not “eliminate” uGSI, merely  decreasing the amount of uGSI to what the budget allows, and use the saved money to hire 3-4 times that number of tutors. 

As a student this is a better solution that solves budget, long OH wait time without drastically cutting enrollment.
[deleted]
Can confirm
I would argue that that's part of the point. There are many factors that contribute to the demographics of course staff not matching the student body (much less the state, which is what we are supposed to represent), and one of those is compensation. How do you think those numbers would change if we were to slash benefits?
Yes, I should rephrase my statement. This proposal does not eliminate ugsi’s; however, it treats many of the responsibilities carried out by UGSI’s as interchangeable with those performed by tutors. This is not the case, one job cannot not just be simply substituted for another.
[removed]
Tuition remission for uGSI wouldn’t help students with 0 EFC who already received full financial aid anyway. It’s a drain on limited budget that could’ve been used to hire more OH support staff and tutors to improve the experience of those underprivileged students.
I understand your frustrations as a graduate student (I’m assuming). However I would like to suggest a counterpoint which is whether or not such a pay cut would be acceptable if all of our UGSIs were instead graduate students. CS hires UGSI’s to perform the tasks that GSI’s otherwise would since there are not nearly enough graduate students to staff these classes. From a class’s perspective, a UGSI costs about the same as a GSI. Therefore, even if all of our UGSI’s were instead GSI’s, we would still be having the same budget issue.

As I’m not a graduate student, I will not have the same perspective as you in terms of work done outside of teaching. Being said, my primary issue is still that the school continually shortchanges its funding for teaching. If all of our TA’s were graduate students, we would still be facing the same issues. Therefore, I would suggest that the school must also commit more funding to actual teaching, as simply papering over the issue with part time undergraduates."
Major in something I love (English/History) or major in something that brings in the money (CS)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2sd1r8/major_in_something_i_love_englishhistory_or_major/,2015-01-13 19:36:58,"I'm an L&S freshman. I took CS61A with John DeNero last semester and got a B+. I find computer science not as interesting as English and history, which I love. I took a history class and an English class and got A's.

My parents don't think English and history are very practical majors. They point to my cousins. One graduated with master's degree in English five years ago and is still working as a barista. The other graduated with a psychology degree two years ago and is working retail.

I was reading *Cracking the Tech Career* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (who wrote *Cracking the Coding Interview* and founded CareerCup) and got to this part:

> **Majors**

> Although some well-meaning people will advise you to find a major that you love, that isn't the best career advice.

> If you want to get a job at a top tech company, some majors will simply make it easier to get in. The more directly applicable your major is, the better. Computer science, marketing, finance, and accounting majors will have a much easier time getting their resume noticed than, say, a history major. After all, they have academic experience, and possibly other work experience, that lends itself to a specific role.

> Even majors that aren't necessarily directly applicable (like mathematics, in most cases) can still show rigor.

> But there are all kinds. Paul landed an internship at Microsoft as a music major from Berkelee College of Music. Not a dual computer science and music — just a plain old music major. And even he had a directly applicable role: making sound effects for Xbox. He spent his days using ordinary household objects to mimic sounds like a golf ball hitting the grass.

> **Minors**

> If you choose to major in something less applicable, like history, your minor is your opportunity to add an applicable skill to your resume. Seek out a relevant minor that complements your path, whether that's finance, marketing, computer science, or one of several other career majors.

> A minor is also a great place to prove that you're quantitative. A minor in math or engineering will do that, but so will a minor in economics, finance, or accounting. Whether fair or not, many techies associate the ability to work with numbers as a sign of intelligence (as well as an important job skill), and a minor is your chance to show that.

I'm torn between majoring in computer science and something like English or history. English and history assignments are relatively easy and enjoyable for me to do because I love reading and writing. Programming on the other hand is doable though takes a lot of time and effort.

You could play around with the idea of double majoring or minoring in one of them and majoring in the other. Just the CS minor gives you enough experience to land a entry internship that can lead to a career!  (for the minor: along with the lower divs, you'll be taking 3 upper divs, as opposed to the 27 units of upper-div technical courses + EE16A for the major). My friend majored in linguistics and minored in cs and works in software now. You could consider that as your backup, if you want to get by with a decent amount of experience but not tooo many technical courses. Or you could major in CS and minor in English/History and take the classes you find interesting. 
You're still a first-year. (You probably hear that a lot.) But as a first-year, you still have plenty of time to take classes that interest you. So take 61B and 70, because they teach skills useful for many programming jobs, but also take some English and History classes. (I'd recommend upper-divs over something like the English 45A/B/C series, since they better resemble the things you'd be doing in the major, plus you get a chance to choose classes that more closely match your interest. Plus if you decide to go with the minor, the 45s won't count toward that.)

Then, when it comes time to declare, choose the major that gets you out of Cal the most painlessly, while continuing to take side-classes either for your own edification or for career, or both.

I think that the choice of majors and minors *as a resume-building tool* is overrated. Woohoo, you have a line on my transcript that says you're an English minor, so you can clearly write better than anyone else I hire. No.

In my opinion:

> many techies associate the ability to work with numbers as a sign of intelligence

Probably true, judging on my limited experience with said techies. But not necessarily intelligence, per se, as much as problem-solving competence. For instance, a lot of techies have a better opinion of engineers than of math majors, even though the latter are clearly better at math.

> and a minor is your chance to show that.

Probably *not* true. What, when you apply to a job are they going to look for that one line in the ""memoranda"" section on your transcript that says ""completed a minor in applied math""? Probably not--they're going to focus instead on what sort of specific math skills you know. I think it's more important to have coursework in those areas than to have a specific minor. For instance, say you want to get a job in high-frequency trading. ""Major in econ with a minor in math"" means much less to a hiring manager than ""studied economics and business, with an emphasis on quantitative analysis."" (You can tell I know nothing about econ; just using it as an example.)
Why not do both? Also there are plenty of people who don't major in CS but program after college. Zuckerberg wasn't a CS major but he obviously ended up fine in tech. 
I'd recommend majoring in something you care about, it'll make college more enjoyable. At the same time, take the CS 61 series, and if you enjoy it consider minoring in CS. The skills you'll get from a minor will be more than sufficient for most programming oriented jobs.
Don't major in English unless you're going to double major or pursue graduate study.
I'm a dad with a student at Cal. She wants to major in art. I support her choice. She worked hard to get in to Cal. She deserves to make her own choices. I'd have to be a real dick parent not to let her pursue her natural interests and talents. 

Part of me thinks you're conflicted between what you want, and what your parents want. Nothing you've said makes me believe you enjoy programming. 

McDowell is right... Doing something you love, won't prepare you for a successful career in something you don't love. 

The real question is what do YOU want? As a loving parent, I will support you and encourage you in any field you choose to study at the best university in the world.

If you can't use an English degree from the best university in the world to build a career, you're not trying, or you have unsupportive parents. I believe my daughter will succeed in art. Why don't your parents believe the a same about you? If I were you, I'd ask them that question specifically: why don't they believe in your talents and judgement?

Another thought, If you're going to be an English or History (or art) major, you may need more support and encouragement in a career than if you majored in C.S. Are your parents up to the task? Doesn't sound like it.

Finally, I'll give you the same advice I gave my daughter: choose the major you want, and seriously network with your professors and classmates. Build relationships with the movers and shakers. At worst, you'll have a network for job opportunities in your field. At best, you'll learn from them how to become a mover and shaker in your field yourself. 

Don't let other people make your choices for you. 
TLDR: If I were you, right now I'd plan on dual majoring in English and CS, but only consider that a tentative plan. That lets you put off the decision for about 3 more semesters while keeping both majors available to you, which is great, because with only one college semester under your belt, you are Jon Snow (""You know nothing"") with regard to what you want. You can narrow that down later, or major in both.

There's two ways to look at college, neither one of which is better than the other: 1) using college to educate yourself and as a finishing school for being an informed and educated citizen, ie classical liberal arts. 2) stepping to stone to a career that pays well.

Neither of those are mutually exclusive; you can totally do both. An English degree, by itself, pretty much falls into category 1, and a CS degree, by itself, pretty much falls into category 2. The trick to college is it should be more than just a degree. You should use it to network, both with classmates and with prospective employers (esp. cal Alums), and to get relevant industry experience via internships.

English (actually any prototypical category 1 major) isn't a bad major for being employed after graduation, but unlike the more tradeschooly majors in category 2, there is no easy-to-follow path into a career or non-dead-end job. That means you have to forge your own path, which means internships and networking. Start thinking about what you'd like to do with our life. Marketing? PR? Sales? HR? Pretty much every company has those 4 jobs and they don't require any sort of technical degree. Perhaps you can think of an industry that interests you that doesn't require a technical degree either, like attorney (though that requires a JD) or paralegal, teaching (you'll need a cert, but not a full-on education degree), journalism, etc.

Then after finding a field or two, look for people in that field with a Cal degree and use/abuse your Cal network to network with them and maybe ask for an internship. Make sure to mention in your intro email that you are a Cal student when you fist make contact. Don't ask for an internship right away. Ask them if you can chat with them over coffee (if they're local) or over email about their career field, because you are thinking about what you want to do after you graduate and how to prepare yourself for being a competitive applicant when you graduate.  What do they like about their field? Dislike? Where is it going? What challenges will there be in the future? What do they look for in successful applicants, for both full-time and internship? What don't they look for or what do they ignore? If you find a few people you like, ask them if they know of any relevant available internships you could apply to. This is how you use your network. Most good jobs are never actually advertised, because people use their network to find someone qualified.

This is how you get a white collar job with a 'useless' degree. Sidenote rant: it's not fucking useless because there are lots of jobs that require a BA/BS of some sort even though you never actually use the degree directly for the job and because a degree is more than just a job certification.

For CS, if you take the required classes to apply to the CS major, you will be good enough to hustle your way into a programming job after graduation, even without the CS degree. You'll still need to do a bit of networking and you'll need a side-project or two to show off your skills, but its not impossible or even very hard, if this is what you want to do.

The CS minor is less than useless right now, because of how impacted the major is. As I'm sure you know, even declared majors are having trouble getting their classes. CS minors get about as much priority as undeclared L&S students (ie none). Either just take the required classes to apply to the major (and then stop) or take the major.

Regardless of what you choose, use college to get internships doing something you could see yourself doing as a career. Decide what you want to do and start working towards getting there. The two big things will be networking and relevant experience. Use your internships to get both. Even a CS degree isn't super helpful without an internship or two.

Good question I saw once and you should ask yourself: ""Do you want to live to work or work to live?"" I've been asking myself this a lot recently. 

I'm just going to very briefly plug the incredibly vibrant Digital Humanities scene on campus. If you are interested in the humanities, and know how to program, there are a TON of very rich opportunities for you. Check out the [Berkeley Center for Digital Humanities](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/) to get a sense of what it is all about.
You can become a lawyer with a history degree, which can potentially make more than a large majority of cs majors.

There are non software jobs by the way that aren't baristas.
Honestly, I would recommend majoring in CS, or double majoring.  It's still early for you as well, so take your time in exploring it.  It's very possible to start as an engineer and transition into other roles once you're in a tech company as well, and having a background is always helpful.
Do what you love. But take enough math/science to minor in a technical subject. Then go into banking
people hire cs, because its hard. 

Because its hard, its in demand.


Anthro major now product manager at large tech firm checking in. College is where you learn how to learn. Money will come, but this is your only time in college. Do what makes you happy!
I'd rather program than work as a barista or in retail. I'm aiming to work for a tech company so I'm reading Mrs. McDowell's books.

I don't live and breathe programming, but I think I can do it okay.
> it's about what you do outside your major. if you do end up majoring in history or english, the most important thing is that you don't JUST do that. that's what makes it unpractical. you need to do work/internship/clubs/research/whatever helps you get on a path of what you want to do after college.

What are you doing outside of history?
Nice, thank you for the story about your friend. Did s/he find it difficult to get a software job as a non-CS major? I heard that it's hard to enter the industry without a CS degree but the CS minor must help a bit.
Thank you for the advice about taking upper-divs over English 45A/B/C. I took R1B this semester and loved it! I'll look into taking an English upper-div or two this semester.
Zuckerberg started coding in middle school and stated in an interview that he ended up taking as many CS classes as psych classes. *Before college*, Microsoft wanted to acquire a media player he wrote and have him work for them. So suffice to say that's a bad example.
You're right, I could double major in CS/English or CS/history.

One major for career purposes and the other for fun.
That's amazing that you're giving your daughter so much support for majoring in art! Kudos!

My parents would freak out and say I'd end up a starving artist if I majored in art.

Did you study something like art or English in college and make a career out of it?
Wow, thank you so much for your advice! It's very helpful!

What did you major in? Are you more English/history inclined or engineering inclined?
> As far as anecdotes, I've seen very similar results to the ones you listed. 

What majors/schools did they attend? Did they get into better jobs after a couple years?

I'm hoping that my cousins will get into better jobs once the economy gets even better...I can't imagine doing retail or being a barista until they're like 60. :(

That's why I'm willing to study something I'm not super passionate about so I can get a job like software engineering and have a better future.
As an econ grad, you probably should know better to say that it's in *demand* because it's hard. :)

brb going to declare Japanese, and also to cleanse myself for having made a supply-and-demand joke
Remember that it doesn't have to be CS. There are so many other career paths out there that you can be successful in as well. Maybe try exploring what else you could do if you enjoy it more.
I mean, saying you'd rather program than be a barista doesn't really make sense...you're comparing a career to a part-time job. Do you *like* to program?

Why not look for jobs in English or history-related fields? Contrary to popular belief, such jobs *do* exist!
Do you like working 10 hour days, 6 days a week?

If not, then tech might not be the right field for you.
[deleted]
If you have the relevant skills, people will hire you. My friend tailored his resume for the tech interviews with a bunch of programming side projects. My cousin majored in Art, didn't even have a minor in CS but knew enough programming to get a CS job after she couldn't find any good opportunities with her art degree. A lot of software engineering jobs are about on-the-job training/learning, so they want to see that you are a quick learner. It's more about the skills than what is written on paper/what your degree says. 
You don't need CS to work as a programmer, many developers, myself included, are not CS majors, there are other resources and ways to learn and if you have experience in English, or history, or something else interesting companies will value that; they like having diverse teams.
It sounds to me like you wouldn't starve. It might be hard, though. My philosophy is that if it's really that hard to succeed as an artist, she needs all the help she can get, ~especially~ from your parents.  If the world doesn't support your dreams, shouldn't your parents at least believe in you?

I was actually a poli sci major, but never really used it. I've instead taken an entrepreneurial route.

Good luck. It I could reassure your parents, I would. I think you'll do great no matter what YOU choose. 
Glad you found it so helpful!

I came in engineering undeclared and graduated EECS. I can't say the salaries didn't inform my decision in deciding EECS and engineering undeclared, but they definitely weren't the most important criteria by far (if they were I'd either be finishing law school or med school right now). EECS was actually my 'default' major if i didn't like any of the other majors, because I enjoyed the limited amount of coding I did in hs (i took ap cs junior year).

I'm very STEM inclined and I nearly tried to do a pure math or physics double major with EECS, but decided against it due to bureaucratic hoops i'd have to jump through to get through both degree and because I didn't have a good GPA.

Like I said earlier, I'd recommend trying to double in both. If you are ~~smart~~ hardworking enough to get into L&S CS right now, you can almost certainly manage a double major in English. And if you can't get into L&S, well you at least have enough CS knowledge to get a junior software engineer job and you aren't off track to get an English degree.

The problem with English degrees and the like isn't that the degree is useless, but that the main point of such a degree isn't to guarantee an interesting, high paying, and relevant job, so you won't automagically fall into a good job after graduating. People calling them useless didn't do anything to make themselves competitive in the job market while they were in college, and expected the degree to do all the work for them, like how certain engineering degrees can do. But even they aren't a guarantee. I know I guy who graduated from another college with a civil engineering BS and is now spending his time reffing high school and semi-pro soccer.
Really? My time at Berkeley has taught me that the only jobs are tech and business? All non-EECS or Haas majors are going to be baristas and the only value in education is money.
I agree so much with this! Because we're living in a time where the lucrative jobs are in tech, that's what so many of us hear about. But the ""average"" jobs in other fields very much still exist - you won't be making 6 figures out of school, but you're also not struggling to pay rent. 

I know English majors who have graduated to work in publishing, copy editing, journalism, and other related fields. Similarly, I know History majors who do museum work, or teaching. While not the most popular jobs on the listings, they're there if you want to put in the work towards landing them. 
Wow, you have a lot of good extracurriculars! What kind of jobs do you think will be a good fit after graduation?
Exactly! And to be quite honest, such jobs often *will* ultimately lead you to 6 figure salaries...and fairly quickly, too!

Your TAs need your help: sign the petition to save EECS/DS,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11ytb7x/your_tas_need_your_help_sign_the_petition_to_save/,2023-03-22 12:13:46,"Sign the petition to save EECS/DS: [eecsdsstaff.org/petition](http://eecsdsstaff.org/petition)

As you might have heard, TAs, tutors, and readers (or academic student employees, ASEs) in the EECS/DS departments are currently bargaining with the University of California. After last year's historic strike, the university agreed to negotiate with us over increasing staffing and improving instructional quality in the EECS/DS departments. We hoped this would be an opportunity for us to solve the long OH wait times, packed classrooms, and overwork which have plagued the departments for years. 

We've been bargaining for almost two months now. A bunch of detailed proposals are involved, and if you'd like to learn more about them, please visit our website at [eecsdsstaff.org](http://eecsdsstaff.org/). But **here's the bottom line:** the university currently spends $9.8 million per year on undergraduate instructors in EECS/DS. Its proposals want to take that to $5.8 million. That's a $4 million, 41% cut. **There is no way to improve instructional quality when you slash teaching spending by 41%. It is not mathematically possible.** 

As a student worker at the bargaining table, it has been extremely frustrating to me that the faculty on the other side of it—including the university's lead negotiator, Professor John DeNero—have been publicly advocating for me and my colleagues' pay and benefits to be cut by 76% rather than focusing their efforts on pressuring central campus administrators for more funding. And while ASEs are willing to take less pay and benefits than the university agreed to pay us to help the department save money, it is simply not possible to make up that 41% cut. **The only reasonable solution to this crisis is an increase in support from campus administration.** And the only way we can achieve that is if we come together as a community—students, ASEs, lecturers, and faculty—and demand it. 

The first thing you can do is **sign our petition** at [eecsdsstaff.org/petition](http://eecsdsstaff.org/petition). The next thing you can do is to **call and email EVCP Ben Hermalin** at 510-642-1961 and hermalin@berkeley.edu (cc: EVCP@berkeley.edu) to tell him to fully fund instruction in the EECS/DS departments. You can use a template email/script[ here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BoAjtyOE3XEU86-NWuWcQNXe2CTx5U-fomsBOSi3k_s/edit), but make this your own — describe the unique and troubling circumstances within the EECS/DS departments that you have personally experienced as a student/ASE. 

This is a battle for the soul of the EECS/DS departments. And we need your help to win.

This place is so poor. Can’t wait to get out of this broke shitter and enjoy my 500k income
[deleted]
Don’t CS TAs already make way more than they’re worth?
I can’t help but notice the the Google form purposely leave out the proposed 39% increase in tutors and readers positions, which is over 2.5 times the 15% decrease in uGSI roles. 

Not to mention, 15% headcount decrease on its own is not out of line with the rest of the market. I’d argue the proposed offer from the university is generous in light of Meta recent layoffs of 21,000 headcount and Amazon cutting 27,000 headcount.
[removed]
This is a specially an exception for the Berkeley EECS department whereas the rest of the strike was for student workers (specially grad students since basically no one else hires undergrads for this sort of thing). At the end of the strike it was put in the contract that a specific agreement for EECS would be made at a later date. Unfortunately getting to that agreement has gotten pretty difficult in the past few weeks.
The bargaining during the strike last semester involved negotiations over ASEs for the entire University of California System, whereas bargaining over increased staffing has involved the University and the EECS/DS department at Berkeley specifically. As part of the agreement, for the first time in history, the University agreed to negotiate over increasing EECS/DS Course Staffing levels starting this past February, and since then ASEs have been trying to reach an agreement with the university.
[deleted]
I agree that we don’t want to hurt other departments in the process, but it is worth noting that last year CS + EECS + DS majors made up 23.6% of all graduating students. I think the argument that this department is special and is different from the others and therefore deserves more attention and money has a lot of merit.
Historically the administration will always make the claim that there is simply not enough money and that agreeing will result in a collapse of the administration, however, almost every time the administration is able to provide the money and the university remains intact with the most recent example being the strike last semester in which the administration claimed they would not be able to afford the increases in wages initially proposed by the Union but by December had agreed to pay significantly more.

I would also like to note that while the university claims it does not have the money, the CDSS's creation of a new college has expanded the roster of vice provosts and associate deans in a way that has added $2M payroll costs, as well as $30M for the athletic department. It is not a problem of the university being unable to pay, it is that the university is unwilling to pay. If the central administration did not have the money they would not have agreed to negotiate for increases in staffing.

The EECS/DS Department has the highest student-to-faculty ratio out of any other department but is also the most understaffed. This is not to say that EECS/DS should be placed on a pedestal above other departments, but a call for the University to address the current state of overwork and understaffing in the EECS/DS Department.
For those who have (or are interested in) rebutting this comment thread, I encourage you to tune in to the campus conversation tomorrow at 4pm. They will be discussing budget. I don't know enough about campus finances to comment with any expertise here, and I hope others will also get more information before making assumptions.
Agreed, I’d argue the university’s offer is generous in light of Meta recent layoffs of 21,000 headcount and Amazon cutting 27,000 headcount.
[deleted]
Just curious, how much do they make? I thought GSI wages were standardized
Compared to other Universities, the EECS/DS Department is unique not only in the amount of undergraduate TAs that are hired but in the responsibilities they carry out. At most universities across the campus, undergraduate teaching instructors have considerably constrained responsibilities such as not being able to lead discussion or lab sections on their own, play a role in the creation of course content, and other administrative roles, all of which undergraduate student instructors in the EECS/DS regularly perform.

Looking back to this past fall and the impacts of the strike we can see how a majority of the classes in the EECS/DS Department that were held together by TAs were unable to function when members of course staff went on strike. I'd argue that EECS/DS TAs contribute immensely to the inner workings of the department as a whole.

For many ASEs the absence of fee remission and a decrease in wages would not allow them to continue in the role which would lead to a drastic decrease in the number and diversity of an already understaffed system and the severe overwork of those who were able to remain on course staff.
Nah, they’re easily capable of earning just as much from Faang, so by definition they’re paid similar to how they’re worth on the free market
why would private companies cutting headcount influence the amount of TAs? The number of students in these classes is not expected to be cut so why would we hire less uGSIs?
Cry more pls 🥲🥲
EECS is always special, it seems, in many regards
never said I’d be doing quant… you’re just making shit up
[deleted]
Well CS is not the only department experiencing cut here. With this market downturn Berkeley already shut down 3 libraries. No big tech money from Apple and FTX to bridge uGSI funding gap like previous years because big tech is busy doing layoffs and FTX is busy going bankrupt.
[deleted]
So are you calling for money to be diverted from athletics for EECS? Not saying that would necessarily be a bad idea, but we have to be clear here. The university has money yeah but it's not unaccounted. It's all being allocated for some purpose, good or not. We have to be specific how the budget should be changed.
[deleted]
Normal wage + tuition remission, not to mention a lot of the time they aren’t working for the full time they’re hired for
Sure, I don’t agree with getting rid of fee remission entirely. I wonder how TAs would react to a smaller pay cut though.
Have you look at the market before commenting? Meta laid off 21k employees and Amazon is at 27k layoffs now lmao. Even OG Google and Microsoft are doing similar layoffs.
I meant worth in terms of the amount of work they contribute
Total staff hours won’t decrease but increase once you consider the 39% tutors and readers increase to help with the long OH that OP complained about. What decrease are you talking about here? If you mean budget and pay decrease, please look at the job market as a whole.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I don't think reducing enrollment really solves the problem. The fact is, enrolling undergraduates brings in much more money that it costs to teach those students. Currently, the department as a baseline only allots $50/student enrolled in a course to hire staff. Each of those students pays tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, so even if the university allocated more money for staffing per student, it seems absurd to me that cutting enrollment would solve the problem of paying for staffing.
Apologies again, I could've worded that sentence better but it is a total of $30M. In regard to having to pay grad students more, I would argue that this is not an issue that is weighing too heavily on the EECS/DSUS department, simply being the fact that the majority of classes, especially the larger lower division courses are staffed entirely by undergraduate ASEs.
Apologies if it came off that way! I'm not calling for the diversion of money from athletics in favor of EECS/DS but would argue that if education is as big a priority as the University believes then the crisis in the department would not have been allowed to go on this long.
The university explicitly forbids ASEs from bargaining over university budgets. We could all come up with our ideal plan of how to redistribute the money to the places that need it most, and if you ask me there are plenty of places we take money from (e.g. the increasingly huge amount spend on administrators) but the university would explicitly reject our ability to determine that. What we do have the power to do is to say where we need more funding, and force the university to commit to funding that.
[deleted]
You’re last point is definitely not accurate. TA and tutor overwork is the big reason the union is currently asking for an increase in staffing. No one is just sitting around and taking checks for doing nothing, and even when TAs have time off (like in Spring break) the huge overwork the rest of the semester means they are still working more hours than they are appointed for.
You're grossly overestimating how much smart people need to work during internships
why is the job market relevant to pay practices of undergraduate gsis? you mention layoffs as if there is any relevance to what we’re discussing
The problem with the 39% increase in tutors and readers is that neither position are able to host discussion sections in that there are certain instructional duties specific to GSI/uGSI series that these positions are not able to conduct. Alongside the decrease in uGSIs the University proposed the idea of Mega Sections in which a single uGSI would lead a single section that would be recorded in place of multiple smaller discussion sections. The problem with this is that similar to a lecture, students may not feel comfortable asking questions in these larger sections compared to a smaller setting, which will lead more students to office hours to get their questions answered, which would negate the increased OHs that would accompany this change. 

I also wanted to note that Readers are not allowed to hold weekly office hours or office hours unless the sole purpose of the discussion section is to discuss assignments that they are grading and that tutors are not supposed to host office hours without the instructor of record or a uGSI/GSI present which is already happening in a number of courses in the department. The mass hiring of readers/tutors will not solve the problem in that these roles will inevitably end up carrying out the responsibilities of a TA while receiving less pay.
What a great way to gain the support of all
I wasn't really talking in those terms. I'm talking in terms of the way to do business and run operations.  They run their own network and mail services, for example, despite everyone else on campus using campus network and mail services.

In other words, they like to do things their way.

How are they overworked?
So you agree with me that they are overpaid? Then a pay cut doesn’t seem so outrageous. Maybe not such a large one but a smaller one is reasonable.
Berkeley is not immune to market downturn duh. Last minute money from Apple and big tech to bridge CS budget gap not gonna happen like last year. FTX philanthropist turns out to be fraud.  The fact that they’re *increasing* staff hours at a time like this shows that they’re doing a pretty good job given budget.
[deleted]
It's true that the total cost of instruction (averaged by student) is less than the total tuition & state support given to the university. However, the amount of that instructional cost in the EECS department that actually goes to funding course staff is an exceedingly low fraction of that $33,000/year total cost estimate. In EECS, it's currently roughly $50 per enrollment per 4 unit course, which is roughly $800/student/year for hiring course staff (less than 3% of the ""total instructional cost""). Given that the funding gap is currently 10x that number, I don't think it's fair to claim that the cost of hiring course staff is the problem here. The university is already planning to cut enrollment, and I don't think that is a good outcome, but I don't think it's fair to blame the decision to cut enrollment on the cost of course staff when that comprises such a small portion of the total cost.
Bruh, I belive that, but I'm amazed at how the university can manage to do that...
They are appointed for a number of hours a week to work and are expected to exceed that number. Tutors especially who have to log their hours on a time sheet are regularly told to just 8 (or however many they are appointed for) hours regardless of how much they work a week.
Oh wait, I understand now, we were talking past each other. TA compensation is how much their labor is ""worth"" on the free market because it matches the jobs those TA can easilty get. 

As for the amount of work TA's do, they probably work more hours doing TA work than FAANG work, because FAANG work is relatively easier for them.

And as for whether or not they should recieve a cut, I honestly haven't made up my mind yet, I just have an issue with saying the're paid more than they're worth when they're actually worth that much.
it not being immune to market downturn has nothing to do with what we’re talking about lol. Berkeley cs doesn’t have to upsize/downsize based on the market, it has to upside/downsize respective to student demand
And I’m in Viking studies
Sorry that seems vague to me, how exactly are they expected to exceed their hours?
Can’t upsize if you don’t have the money to so good luck. Want to accept Bear Coins instead of cash for your next pay check?
[deleted]
They are given more work than can be accomplished in the time they have to do it so they have to go over.
And I shouldn’t have expected you to care 😌
Still very vague. What exactly are they doing
The list of tasks and expectations for a TA usually exceed the hours they are hired for. For example, an 8 hour TA might be expected to do a discussion (1 hr), a lab (2 hr), office hours(2 hr), answer Edstem questions (1-2 hr), administrative duties, help students with debug tickets (1-2 hr), exam and content writing, and more. The baseline adds up to more than 8 hours and on busy weeks like exam and project weeks, significantly more. Many of the course staff love the courses they teach and will do the extra work to run these classes, but they are often not paid and not recognized for what they do.
Not paid? They make like $600 a week. Also, from what I’ve seen, running things like discussions and labs are not hard when you already have a set curriculum. If anything they are more than fairly compensated already for their work.
you make x amount a week for a specific number of hours, no overtime. Yet, you work overtime quite frequently . if you think it’s so easy try to work for one instead of speaking like this and yes i am on staff, there’s a reason not everyone wants to do this job
Maybe you are right, it’s harder to speak on something when you’ve never experienced it myself. I do plan on joining course staff as a uGSI as well. What are your thoughts then on the negotiations?"

Do you have the link to this Ed page?

will this affect my job hunting or graduate application in the future as an international student if I pnp the ds major requirement rn?
Leaving it up to individual departments was such a bitch ass move.

there is a link on the bottom of this [page](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/data-science-advising) to join the forum! anyone can, you don’t have to be declared
Yeah how do we make it on the ed pages? Or is it expected that we are declared majors for that?
Nope, not at all. GPA more important
No. They only care about high GPA

Four EECS technicals for first semester?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hqj36e/four_eecs_technicals_for_first_semester/,2020-07-13 09:59:29,"Hi, I'm an incoming EECS freshman. Is it insane if I take CS 61A, CS 61B, CS 70, and EECS 16A first semester?

I have a lot of coding experience (I've built multiple apps) and I've won awards in coding competitions (Gold division in USACO). Plus I've done proofs before in a math summer program. And since the professors are John DeNero, Josh Hug, Satish Rao, and Gireeja Ranade respectively (which I've heard are the easier professors for each of those classes), is it doable?","Tbh tho... finishing nearly all CS prereqs in your first semester is some major clout. Might as well throw in ee16b in there too for the true speedrun
Denero is not easier for 61a, people just like his teaching style.
I could see 3 (say 61A, 70, 16A) if you’re a solid independent worker, but that still leaves you with no time for anything else.  The experience in general helps, but the coding expertise is somewhat mitigated in 61A because of all the templaticizing (for lack of a better word).
Frankly, if you've made usaco gold, you won't find 61a/b hard.

Have you made aime multiple times? Would you consider yourself to be a (very) strong math student? If so I'd say this is pretty doable. I know people with similar-ish backgrounds who've done 61a/16a/70 + breadth, and if I could redo my freshman fall I'd probably take that courseload. 61b will essentially be breadth-level workload for you with your background, since 1) you're a fast coder and hug's projects aren't that long and 2) usaco gold means all the data structures material will be review.

Also, it's not like you can do anything fun this fall anyways, might as well grind lol.
That is insane, even with your experience. It’s the amount of work those 4 classes together have that would make your life miserable.

At most take 3 technicals, and add a H/SS or AC or R&C for your last class if you are really rushing to get through your requirements. Also you should look through the class websites (just google them) to get an idea of what stuff might be new and maybe even take a look at the hw and projects.
Add CS189 with Sahai too while you're at it. Don't want you to miss out on a legendary teacher teaching some Machine Learning.
baaaad idea
If you're confident, you can do CS 61A, EECS 16A and CS 70 + a humanities class; wouldn't recommend adding CS 61B to that. But remember you have other requirements beyond the CS classes. More common dedicated EECS schedules are like CS 61A + EECS 16A + Math 53 + Humanities and CS 61B + CS 70 + EECS 16B + something else for the spring which is a more balanced schedule.
dont do it.
This was my friend's first semester schedule, except he had one more AC class. He was plat in USACO and did some google challenge (basically like you). You'll be fine :^) Good luck bear!
It’s quite possible you could do it, I had a friend who had similar CS experience going in and they got through that exact schedule their first semester pretty effortlessly. But I would say it’s a risk, and won’t get you exceptionally far ahead compared to taking three.

Although that’s far above what I or most people are capable of / ready for at Berkeley you seem to have a very strong background and people of that type can sometimes pull some crazy stuff off if they don’t get distracted or lose discipline from what I’ve seen from friends and classmates.
yeah would not do that. Is there a reason you want to take all 4 in the first semester?
F
if you're trying to do any clubs / research most definitely would not recommend this. it's not about the difficulty of the classes but rather the sheer workload - 61A/61B tend to have conflicting project deadlines - CS70 is a pain in the ass and EE16A isn't a walk in the park either. you could do 61A/70/16A if you have a strong discrete math/linear algebra background but don't push yourself too hard first semester - you are just discovering college after all!
With OP's background 61b will likely be lighter than most breadths. USACO gold means he already knows all the data structures material.
There's something to be said for balance and variety in a schedule beyond workload + I know Hug's projects are easier than Hilfinger (with whom I took 61B) but that's still going to be a decent amount of work even knowing the material."
61b Hug and Hilfinger discrepancies in content?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s5d5b3/61b_hug_and_hilfinger_discrepancies_in_content/,2022-01-16 06:37:08,"Hey fellow Bears!

Due to personal reasons, I'm taking a rather long break from academia. When I get back from this hiatus, I plan on taking the LNS CS prereqs, and thus, I have been pre-studying. I think I'm a bit more paranoid than I should be, but oh well. 

I've already gone through the content/projects for 61a (John Denero is such a legend for making everything so accessible to people outside of Berkeley), and have been meaning to start 61b for a while now but have an issue. 

From what I've heard, there is quite a bit of difference between the versions of the course taught by Hilfinger and Hug, and I was wondering if there are also differences in the content(ie. does one prof teach a topic that the other don't and vice versa). I know that the projects and exams are different, but does the discrepancy extend?

I've been using the [course website from Spring 2021](https://sp21.datastructur.es/), and it looks splendid (Hug's lecture vids are a life saver), but was worried that this won't translate well to the version of the course taught by Hilfinger. 

If anyone knows anything about the discrepancies, it would be of great help! Also, any tips regarding CS prereqs in general would be very much appreciated! (I already know CS70 is going to screw me HARD)","[deleted]
Hilfinger teaches regex, game trees, bits, topological sorting, and deemphasizes WQU.

Hug teachs kd Trees
some differences but i watched hugs lectures as a hilfinger student and then just covered the content discrepancies with hilfinger lectures
i think the material is the same, projects might be harder in hilfy’s, and exams are worth more in hugs.
I wish you luck
Even then dp, pseudorandom structures, threads, etc. will not be covered on exams
this
In terms of projects, would you say it’s okay to watch hugs lectures only and be able to do the projects or are there certain topics only covered in hilfingers lectures for projects?
the only project where i used extra hilfinger material was on the jumping cubes project with game trees
Gotcha. I think this semester, enigma and gitlet are guaranteed but project 2 is diff than last semesters."

Should I take self-study CS 61AS? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vyo4o/should_i_take_selfstudy_cs_61as/,2012-07-02 21:17:01,"Hey guys, I'm an incoming freshman planning on majoring in CS. This semester the lecture 61A class is completely full; they opened up a 2nd lecture section but it's going to be ""a webcast of the original lecture."" 

So that is an option I guess, but I also wanted to see if anyone had thoughts about the self-study version (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a.html). Why do so few ppl. take up on it? Also, is not having a physical lecture that big of a deal considering there's webcasts? I guess I'm anxious about what I would miss out on by not taking the regular 61A class. I would appreciate any input. ","Former 61A TA here. I worked with John DeNero (61A instructor) last fall, and Brian Harvey (61AS professor) before that.

First of all: screw all the haters. 61AS is a good course taught in a great language. Anyone who says that Scheme isn't useful is missing the point; it's a no-frills language with an elegant syntax that distills programming down to the basics so that you absolutely must understand how everything works. There's a reason why lisp is such a highly-regarded language in the CS community. As great as the new Python version of the course is, I actually really do miss teaching in Scheme. But I digress.

61AS will work out well if you're incredibly motivated, but if you're already inclined towards 61A I'd recommend taking that one. 61A is a tough course, and having a normal class structure tends to motivate people a lot more than taking a self-paced course. Also, John did a great job last Fall, and [people really liked the course](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/course/CS/61A/2011_Fall/0?instructor=Denero%2CJohn).

For what it's worth, I talked to John earlier this summer, and I got the impression that the second lecture session is *officially* for webcast, but is intended merely to get people enrolled in the class on paper without breaking any laws. (The class size is limited by the size of the lecture hall, so they can't just increase the enrollment limit.) You will almost certainly be able to attend the regular lecture (but expect it to be REALLY CROWDED for the first couple of weeks).

Feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
Just in terms of usefulness, I'd lean towards normal CS61A. I've heard from reputable sources that John DeNero will be teaching it again in the Fall, he is pretty awesome. Even though there's a ""lecture 2"" that shows the webcasted version, I'm sure you'll be able to sneak into the real one by the 3rd or 4th week (I wonder how they're going to police this, doesn't make much sense).


Here are some pros/cons I can think of:

Pro 61A / Con 61AS

-Python is super useful and used in the real world like literally all the time. Scheme is basically only used in AI and is otherwise useless.

-Structured, difficult to fall behind.

-In a huge group of people, will meet LOTS of EECS/CS


Tie 61A, 61AS

-John DeNero is awesome

-Brian Harvey is da boss

Con 61A / Pro 61AS

-You can move faster if you'd like.

-Not in a huge group of people, fewer chances to meet people


Thanks for all the responses everyone; they've been extremely helpful. I should use reddit more! Anyways, since it looks like the preference of the regular lecture is unanimous, I'll sign up for it and pass on the self-paced version. I'm gonna have to work pretty hard in this class as it is, and based on what you guys have said I don't think going self-paced will make that any better. 
Honestly, I love 61A when I took it, and glad I'm becoming more involved with the course right now.

Scheme has an unfair reputation. It's really not as bad as people think. You will learn it in normal 61A anyway....because it's being used for the last project. In some ways I wish I could have taken the early version of 61A with Harvey because it's one of the best CS courses ever and because I would be much better with recursion and a couple other things for it --that said, the current course really is great, and it's getting better all the time.
If you can take the regular lecture version of the class, I'd advise it. As EpicIOError says, Python is useful and Scheme is not. At all. I took the self-paced one and it was fine, got an A in 61b the next semester, so you won't be totally unprepared. 
NO!  You will not learn the class material correctly.  Take 61A!

""If you can't stay disciplined about doing the work without a fixed schedule imposed, take 61A""

You might think you can, but you can't. As a college freshman, you will be stimulated with new opportunities incessantly. You will not do the work without the lectures and the structure provided by the lectures. Plus, you'd miss out on getting to work with others, which is half the fun!

In short: take 61A, not the self-study. You could self-study without coming to Cal.
You will suffer.
No, don't do it.
As another person who TA'd both the Scheme and the Python versions, I'd say I mostly agree except perhaps I wouldn't use the phrase ""screw them"" when talking about non-lovers of Scheme.
>Even though there's a ""lecture 2"" that shows the webcasted version, I'm sure you'll be able to sneak into the real one by the 3rd or 4th week (I wonder how they're going to police this, doesn't make much sense).

I'd like to emphasize this to OP.
Meeting lots of people and not meeting lots of people are not really pros and cons of 61A and 61AS, respectively. I don't know about you, but the chances of you getting to know any of your classmates well in a class of 30, as opposed to a class of ~550, are much higher.
[deleted]
Also, remember, you don't absolutely have to take it in the fall. Depending on your experience programming you may find CS10 to be a class to take if you can't get in. The class is harder than the description seems, but probably won't be challenging if you've done a fair bit of programming - it is however a very fun class.

Also, many people drop 61A within the first few weeks, if you keep up checking on telebears you can probably get in too.
Are there group projects in 61AS?
Well, you also have your sections for 61A so there are groups of 30. But it's very easy to meet people in a 500 person class, IMO. I've met most of my college friends so far through CS classes!
It's really not THAT much more terrible in terms of work. Yes, Hilfinger is a bit pedantic about certain things, but he knows a hell of a lot and is most definitely willing to help you learn if you want to."
