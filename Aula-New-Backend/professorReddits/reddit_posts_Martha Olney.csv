Professor Martha Olney (@MarthaOlney) sent this email to her students today,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2u4ypd/professor_martha_olney_marthaolney_sent_this/,2015-01-29 15:32:56,"Hello everyone,

I'm writing with very sad news which I'm sorry to share by email.  One of your classmates, George Shum, died Sunday.  We don't know the circumstances.  The Dean of Students spoke with George's family who confirmed the news. George was a PE major from Oakland.

This is already our second death this term in Econ 113.  Apoorve Agarwal, a junior Econ and math major, died December 20.  http://www.dailycal.org/2014/12/30/uc-berkeley-junior-apoorve-agarwal-dies-20/ and http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_27245934/coroner-student-found-dead-at-uc-berkeley-frat.  Apoorve had been registered for Econ 113.  

So there are two things I want to ""talk with"" you about: grieving and drinking.  Neither George nor Apoorve's  deaths have, to my knowledge, been linked directly to drinking.  But I want to say a few things about drinking anyway.

First, though, grieving.  Death sucks.  There's no doubt about it.  Death is hard to deal with when it's someone who has lived a long, full life.  It's extraordinarily hard to deal with when it's someone in their 20s.  It brings up all sorts of questions.  It creates all sorts of emotions.  It's hard.  

The first time I had to deal with the death of a friend my own age was when I was about 23.  I can still see myself in the room where I was when I learned the news.  (Ironically, that room is essentially my office. 691 and 691A Evans used to be one room, the Econ grad student hang-out room, and that's where I was.)  I can still see my reaction.  I can still remember how it felt as if everything I'd ever known had just been yanked away.  That same day, a 90 year old man in my church died after a long, full, extraordinary life of ministry and service.  I remember feeling angry at the juxtaposition of those two deaths.  

Whether or not you knew George and Apoorve, you might be affected by this news.  Remember that everyone reacts differently to death.  One of the things I had to learn as my brothers and I went through the deaths of our brother and our parents was that how I grieve is how I grieve (lots of tears, lots of philosophizing, lots of distraction through organizing and doing), and how my brothers grieve is how they grieve (only the third of those three things), and that's ok.  Everyone grieves differently.  Be patient with yourself.  Be patient with others who grieve differently.  However each of us grieves is how we grieve, and that's ok.

Reach out to others.  Family, friends, religious leaders are all sources of help and comfort.  The student services staff in the Economics department is available to chat.  There are counselors at Tang to talk with, especially if you are concerned about yourself or anyone else in your community.  Here's the official info from Tang:  Students interested in support please contact: Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) located at the Tang Center.  If you would like to talk to a counselor, call 510-642-9494. Students can also be seen on a drop-in basis between 10am- 5pm.  http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/students/counseling/cps.shtml

And here's a website that UHS has put together that might be helpful:  http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/home/news/copingwithtrauma.shtml

And now my second topic, drinking.  Listen, it's hard to accept, but your parents and your faculty were 20 years old once too.  I remember my teen age years (so do your parents).  I get it.  But drinking until you pass out is just not good.  It's not safe.  It's not smart.  It kills brain cells (http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/01/28/381622350/why-teens-are-impulsive-addiction-prone-and-should-protect-their-brains).  

And it can kill you.

Alcohol poisoning can kill you.  Stupid decisions can kill you.  (I'm not saying this applies to either Apoorve or George, but while I've got your attention...)  You're too damn special.  Stay alive.

I know there are all sorts of alcohol awareness and other programs.  Go to those.  But more to the point, value yourself.  You were created for a reason.  You -- just by virtue of your birth -- are a terrific, wonderful, valued, precious person.  This is not about you getting into Berkeley or having some gpa or some major or a packed resume or any of that.  It's just about you.  And life.  You -- just by virtue of your birth -- are a terrific, wonderful, valued, precious person. (I thought it was worth repeating.)

Make smart decisions.  Help your friends make smart decisions.  Recognize that there's a statistically significant negative (inverse) relationship between the ability to make smart decisions and your blood-alcohol level.  Don't kid yourself into thinking ""it doesn't affect me""; it does.  (Oh, and just as a minor point: make it a rule never to email your professor or your GSI at 2 a.m. after a few drinks.  Jus' sayin.)

Stay alive.  

With a full heart,
Professor Olney","Professor Olney is an absolute boss. Her Econ 1 class was the only class of the semester where the professor cared whether we cared and actively taught instead of being a warm body.  

I can hear her voice through this email. I respect her opinions.
George was a great friend. He will always have a place in my heart. 
Love Olney.  Thoughts go out to the Shum family 
So disappointed that I couldn't take an econ class with her. I specifically waited for her to teach and she decided to let that one boring asshole guy do it.

This is my first semester with her, but I can already tell that she gives a shit about every one of us. It's refreshing.
Someone's gotta ask...how did he die?
Also a lot of Cal students were very sheltered growing up or had strict parents, which is part of why they were able to be accepted to Cal (forced them to work hard and study, not socialize) Then they get here and they have freedom for the first time in their life and go a little crazy. I was definitely one of those students. 
Cheap alcohol, young people, it's a large problem everywhere. 

A guy fell three stories at my university after a night of drinking. He ded. 
She got a standing ovation at our last class of the semester when I was in Econ 1 with her. So glad I'm taking another class from her this semester
She's amazing, one of the few professors I had who I still remember very clearly. She made econ really interesting (pretty damn impressive imo).

That's very cool to hear, we don't live in that area and I've never met Professor Olney, but she is my Mom's cousin."
Professor Martha Olney sent out this email to her students today,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9s9vhs/professor_martha_olney_sent_out_this_email_to_her/,2018-10-28 21:03:41,"The times we live in

In my years as a faculty member, there have been times when I've been able to dig down and offer wisdom to you all. Sometimes it is wisdom borne from experience: my brother died suddenly when I was in my early 30s, my wife had breast cancer, I grew up in a different era and have too many experiences of sexual harassment to even remember them all, I vividly remember 9/11. Sometimes it is wisdom derived from my philosophy/theology of life: I truly believe that we are all loved and lovable simply by our existence, I believe you are worthy independent of any external measures, I believe life is about striving to become the person we were created to be. 

And sometimes, I feel that I don't have much to offer.  Like now.

So let me see what falls out of my fingers and onto the page. Perhaps I can offer something useful.

Even before yesterday's horrific shooting at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh PA, the week had left many of us reeling. The dozen or so bombs sent to former Presidents and others. The targeted shooting of two Black individuals at the grocery store in Jeffersontown (outside Louisville, KY), which we later learned was the target location only because the shooter had found the doors of the nearby First Baptist Church locked. And that's just this week. Parkland. Pulse. Vegas. Charleston. The list has grown too long.

In any moment, each of us needs to decide for ourselves what we can and will do. I'm not talking about those damned ""active shooter drills"" you all had to do in high school. I mean something larger.

For some of us, we need today to put on emotional blinders, focus on something else, filter out the news, take care of ourselves first and foremost. If that's where you are today, tomorrow, yesterday, that's ok. Be sure you know ways to care for yourself. Call home. Don't call home. Go to Tang, 3rd floor, Counseling & Psych services, talk to someone. Or don't. Go for a walk with a friend. Go find a dog to pet. Do something else altogether. Whatever methods of self-care are effective for you, practice those. 

I keep looking at all the Halloween decorations on the houses between campus and home, so many more than I remember from previous years. I think a lot of us are engaging in escapism right now. Whatever methods of self-care you need to practice, do so. Take care of you.

Be mindful as well of those around you. I took the Pulse shooting very personally. I appreciated that some straight friends reached out because they were aware that the Pulse shooting was particularly hard for those of us who are gay or lesbian. It's been a hell of a week. Check in on your friends. Be sure they're doing ok. Offer to walk with them down to Tang if need be. Understand if they simply can't think about any of it today. Or tomorrow. 

For others of us, we need to confront what's happening directly. Perhaps get involved, do something. I imagine you're tired of hearing me say it, but you Simply Must Vote. That is how, in our representative democracy, laws are changed. Or not changed, whatever your preference. I don't presume to know how you would vote. But I do think that we need everyone actively engaged in voting so that the changes that are made are truly a reflection of what we *all* as society want. 

Do you really want climate change policy determined by the votes of people who are going to be dead anyway by 2040 or 2050?

You may want to join a vigil. You may want to get out the vote. You may want to protest. However you want to get involved, do so using the skills and knowledge you are obtaining here. Use critical thinking. Understand the role of assumptions in arguments. Identify key assumptions. Challenge assumptions, not conclusions. The conclusions flow from the assumptions, so start with the assumptions.

And if getting involved is what you want to do, be mindful that not everyone is in that same place. There will be days, weeks, months, years, when even you -- activist you -- will need a break.  If that's where some others are today, so be it. Make your voice heard, aware that you are speaking for those who, today, cannot.

The times we live in are, to me, disturbing and sometimes scary times. Getting discouraged is easier than I wish. Being optimistic in the moment is sometimes impossible. Many moments in recent days have been hard.

But when I look to the future, I still have hope. I have hope because of you. Because I believe that you will not let our future be taken. Because I believe that you are here, at Berkeley, getting a Berkeley education, becoming a Golden Bear, for a reason. Because I believe that you will use what you learn here to make the world a better place for all. Because I believe in you.

If you need a stamp for your ballot, I'm bringing stamps tomorrow

The midterm is on election day, so vote early by mail. If you live in Alameda County, you can deposit your *signed* ballot in the box on Sproul plaza. If you live outside Alameda County, *sign* the envelope, put stamp(s) on it, and put it in a mailbox. If you need stamps, I am bringing stamps to class tomorrow. To get free stamps from me, ballots must be completed, envelopes signed, and ready to mail. I'll then give you stamps. You can then drop your signed & stamped ballot in the mailbox near Barrows/Sproul or outside Evans. I can't legally mail your ballot, but I can give you stamps.

Prof. Olney","I'll never forget having Olney as my Econ 1 professor during my freshman year at Cal. Her love for teaching, her students, and Berkeley made every single 8am lecture worth it.

Thank you, Professor Olney.
Thanks for sharing this. 
Thank you so much for sharing this, it was much needed.
I thought the mail in ballots are prepaid. 
That’s beautiful.  And as an old bear let me echo what she said about believing in the future because of you all. Your generation fills me with hope. You WILL fix this. You WILL solve these problems. I’m so continually impressed by your collective awareness and selflessness and brilliance.  Please bring all of that to the voting booth now. The time is now.
Yes yes and yes.

One doesn't actually need to vote in America.
They used to be, at least for 2016, but they aren't now. Idk if that's because midterms or if the law changed.
Just checked for Alameda county and they are not :( Get yours stamped! 
Mine is prepaid but I don't live in Alameda county. I'm still California though
There’s a free drop off on campus. Check http://www.acgov.org
Always. There are state initiatives on the ballot that can permanently change aspects of California (housing market, dialysis treatment, etc) and ALL offices matter — from state superintendent of public instruction to local assembly members. 
A one hour drive east from the Berkeley bubble brings you to a [hotly contested US Congress seat](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/26/california-gop-rep-jeff-denham-battles-democrat-josh-harder.html) in Stanislaus County. Whether that seat stays red or turns blue has a direct impact on whether Trump has a compliant House of Representatives or whether we have checks and balance between the legislature and executive office. A morning of your time this weekend [walking door-to-door to get out the vote](https://www.harderforcongress.com/volunteer/) can have a lasting impact on national laws and policies. It's not as hard as you might think to make a difference. 
This comment should not be downvoted. It asks a valid question that a lot of registered voters in CA are asking themselves, and should remain visible so they may read the answers.
Hilary Clintion's entire margin of victory in the popular vote was due to California.  Trump won the popular vote in the other 49 states.   
I mean, technically you don't *need* to. But you *can* and you *should*. 
Just a fact.
Beyond that you need to be aware of how you voting in this election affects future elections. If only 20% of people aged 18-35 vote and 70% of people age 60-75 vote then what policies do you expect candidates to produce (these numbers were completely made up as an example btw)? The same can be said about race, religion, sexual orientation, et cetera.

Econ 100A v 100B - which is better to take for freshmen?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/japluh/econ_100a_v_100b_which_is_better_to_take_for/,2020-10-13 16:59:16,"Hi title says it all, am prepared for either and like both micro and macro equally so any insights will be appreciated. Econ 100A is being taught by  Martha L Olney while Econ 100B is being taught by James Campbell. Thank you!!","100A is considered a little harder than 100B because it requires more math but Olney is a great professor.
I’d say you can do one of two things:
1.) Take 100B in your first semester since it’s easier, but you’d probably end up having to take 100A with an upper div/econometrics which is a P A I N 


2.) Take 100A with Stats 20, because 100A is a bit hard but stats is a lot more straightforward (I took statistics in community college so I might be biased.) That way you can pair up Econ 100B (which is mainly theory) with a harder course in another semester and it should balance out.


Side note: take Econ 140 as close as you can to stat 20. Econ 140 borrows some terms from stat 20, and it’s helpful to remember them/have them fresh in your memory.


I’ve heard Olney is great, and I’m taking Campbell this semester (100A) and he’s super understanding and an all around saint. For 100A, he’s got us doing 6 quizzes, a presentation, a reading response, and writing final, so all the work is distributed. 
Hopefully this helps!
Dude I have the same problem as you.  I'm a freshman and I also heard that Professor Olney is retiring after Spring semester (I could be wrong). That's why I'm taking 100B before 100A.
OMG THANK U SO SO SO MUCH! I’m currently a freshman so I think maybe I can try to organise my schedule in a way that I don’t have to take 100A with an upper div. I’m planning on take 100 A with CS 61A and a couple other classes. Also, glad to hear Campbell is so understanding! Good luck!!
i could be wrong but isn't olney teaching 100b and Campbell is teaching 100a?
Thank you so so much! If you don’t mind me asking, which order did you take them in? And when?
Do you think it's good to take stat 20 in the summer and then Econ 140 in the fall? Is it too hard to take 100A and 140 at the same time?
same bruh, well we'll be in the same class then :)
Yeah I got it confused but I’m going to go with Macro so 100B
100A and 100B at the same time in my first junior semester.
Oh wow! Thanks for answering :) I’ve taken math 1B and planning on Econ 100B so hope that works out"
