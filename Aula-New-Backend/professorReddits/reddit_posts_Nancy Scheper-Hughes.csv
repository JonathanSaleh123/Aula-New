"For more than five decades, UC Berkeley anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes has worked tirelessly to expose ""uncomfortable truths"" across the world. To honor her work, Berkeley's Department of Anthropology is holding a two-day conference on May 1 and 2 called ""Anthropology on the Front Lines.""",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/28/celebrating-barefoot-anthropology-nancy-scheper-hughes/,2017-04-29 22:01:39,,
"UC Berkeley looks back on dark history, abuse of Yahi man 106 years later. As Cal anthropologists continue to reconcile Cal's past treatment of Native peoples, prof Nancy Scheper-Hughes suggested creating a fund to build a place where indigenous groups can keep their sacred objects for themselves",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/01/uc-berkeley-looks-back-on-dark-history-abuse-of-yahi-man-106-years-later/,2017-09-02 00:54:21,,"And this place will be a called a ""muesem"" / ""bank"" . Kind of ironic to suggest building a place to keep their sacred objects, given the history."
"Let Right-Wing Speakers Come to Berkeley? Faculty Is Divided. Cal math professor Katrin Wehrheim: In Germany today, ""you will get jailed for certain speech—and I think that is absolutely the right thing."" Cal anthropology professor Nancy Scheper-Hughes: ""Words can be like rape—they can destroy you.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/free-speech-week-berkeley.html,2017-09-23 00:51:39,,"Did she really just compare words to physical rape? Lmao 
Pathetic.
Comparing words to rape lessens what actual rape victims go through.  
I'm speechless to what has happened to universities. If their ideas are truly awful then protest them, but let them speak so we can discuss why they are wrong. As someone from the center, the left will not win the culture war by banning ideas. You are loosing people.
Yeah, I know it was an analogy, but hey, maybe back off a little here. I'm against them being here and that's fucking outlandish."
"Cal anthropology professor Nancy Scheper-Hughes: Chair announced my retirement without my knowledge or consent. ""All one can say about 'retirement' UC Berkeley-style is 'caveat emptor'—let the buyer beware! … closed-door private negotiating process…You'd best hire a lawyer. I wish I had done so.""",http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2017/09/28/retirement-by-fiat/,2017-10-01 01:27:53,,"Sounds like she got screwed over, if her version is accurate:

> My retirement was was accompanied by an ambiguous honor: I would retire as “Professor of the Graduate School,” a one-sided contract that would require my residence at UCB for one semester a year and a commitment to teaching and working (without compensation), as I found out. The title was presented as a gift, but who was the recipient of the gift?
We should all be so lucky to work in retirement for ""no compensation"".    Her 2016 salary was $195k.  My guess is that her ""retirement compensation"" (footed by UCRP and Social Security) will be close to (or exceed) her current ""net pay"" (salary - FICA - UCRP contribution)."
