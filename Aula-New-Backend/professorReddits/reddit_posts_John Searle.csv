I Blew The Whistle On John Searle,https://jacksonkernion.com/posts/I-Blew-The-Whistle-On-John-Searle.html,2021-07-15 10:40:18,,
Thinking about taking Philosophy 138 with John Searle,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4de4k4/thinking_about_taking_philosophy_138_with_john/,2016-04-04 18:00:39,"I have never taken a Philosophy class at Berkeley, but I have gotten recommendations to take a class with John Searle. My question is: how doable is it to take an upper-division philosophy class (P/NP) without taking any philosophy classes before?","It's really not that bad, I'm taking Philosophy 132 with Searle right now. I haven't taken any other philosophy classes and it's going well. PM me if you have any questions 
I'm a philosophy PhD student here. I would recommend against taking Searle's 138. In short, some people find Searle entertaining, but his classes don't teach you how to do philosophy. You will, instead, hear Searle rant every lecture about his own (often confused) interpretation of the reading.

There are far better philosophy classes here at Berkeley.
The key to succeeding in Upper Division Philosophy courses is understanding how to write Philosophy. Regardless of what field you come from, you won't have written a paper in proper philosophical form before. That's not to say Philosophical writing is more difficult than other non-fiction, but its much different. Before taking 138, I'd read some Philosophy and familiarize yourself with how it presents ideas.  When you have a grasp on that, the material comes easily and won't be too challenging. 
Don't we read Searle's own work, though? That's why I was particularly interested in taking 138; *Construction of Social Reality* is a good book. 
What's frustrating about Searle's classes is that you'll get force-fed Searle's highly-idiosyncratic views no matter what: either he assigns his own work or he gives a highly Searle-ified presentation of others' work.

I'll be blunt - he's neither a good teacher nor a good philosopher.
Thanks for the info. I was strongly considering taking 138 in the Fall, reconsidering now.  My gut tells me that I'd be remiss not to take at least *one* of Searle's classes while I am in the program (undergrad).  Would you say that it just isn't worth it? Or is mind (132) better than society?
I'd say it just isn't worth it. There are too many other good philosophy classes."
Major change and difficult,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3d37zw/major_change_and_difficult/,2015-07-12 21:06:41,"I am transferring from De Anza community college into Cal for this upcoming fall semester. I was admitted as a Philosophy major. However, I wish to change it to Political Science. I have the pre-requisites done for both majors. Does anyone know how manageable it is to do both majors and maintain earn A's for grad school? Would it be realistic to do both majors? (At Calso we were told to focus only on one major)

If anyone could clarify the average workload for Political Science and Philosophy, that would be cool beans. ","Dual majors are usually unnecessary for anything you'd want to do. You are usually better off with major in one, taking the useful/interesting classes you want from the other and using the extra time for extracurriculars, research, volunteering, whatever. 
Everyone in L&S (even transfer students) enters undeclared. You only declare a major after you get to Berkeley, and you're not bound to your intended major on your application. So if you want to just declare PoliSci, then go for it. (Not sure about the workload, sorry.)
It really depends. Chances are you would be fine doubling if you really wanted to. However, keeping a single major can allow for greater flexibility (you have more freedom in course choices) and focus (you can go in-depth within the department). Regarding workload, it again depends on you and your preferences. Philosophy majors I have been around usually take between 3-4 philosophy classes a semester (each is worth 4 units). 
PS workload is fine. If the philosophy major is only 8 upper-div classes like PS then you could do 2 classes per major per semester. 

Personally Id get burnt out on all the reading and writing expected from both majors. Also its difficult to get the classes you want in 1 major, so i can only imagine how it would be with 2
All good advice here, though I'd like to add that if you can should the PoliSci and Philosophy major advisors an email with your questions they would more than likely give you some useful insights as well. Ask them about signing up for classes, as whether everyone enters undeclared, some seats might be saved for people saying on the application that they *intend* to apply for the major once they're in. Never hurts to double check and good luck!
if you're going to try to go to law school or pursue a phd I suggest doing political science since it's more likely you'll have a higher gpa. it's pretty damn hard to get consistently good grades (As) in philosophy unless you're naturally talented and very good at technical writing; most likely you're going to overestimate your abilities . also, philosophy support system is fucking terrible, there are only like 3-4 actual helpful gsis

TL;DR: it's not realistic to do both majors to get A's for grad school unless you're the best of the best and since you went to community college i'm assuming you didn't get in from high school so just do one major

> Does anyone know how manageable it is to do both majors and maintain earn A's for grad school? 

Before spending a few years on this, please read about the employment outlook for PhD grads in PoliSci and Philosophy.
I appreciate the advice, I will probably go ahead and focus on Political Science. I also have an additional question about grade delation. I read an article talking about it awhile back: http://www.dailycal.org/2015/05/15/grade-deflation/

My friends (mostly STEM majors), have told me it's incredibly difficult to earn good grades (A's/B's) at Berkeley because of the grade deflation. Does this also apply to Political Science or philosophy classes?
I changed from philosophy to political science at calso haha. Have you seen the lower division courses? If so, I think you just need 2 to actually declare, and I was able to do it wit an elective from my CC and an AP test. But you should talk to the advisors and see how easy it will be to do it. They helped me a lot.
I'm a third Poli Sci major, took a few upper-division classes already. The workload is quite manageable, but I advise taking a non-reading/essay class just because you'll get burnt out easily. I'd say it also depends on the classes you're taking. The typical structure I've encountered in my classes: 2/3 major essays, 1/2 midterms, attendance, final/essay. Also participation is really important, especially in discussion sessions. Make sure you get to know your GSI as he/she determines your grade. Go to the professor's office hours because they'll be writing your letters of recommendation. They're also lonely because students don't approach them outside of class. I'm not sure about philosophy, but I heard it can get quite intense.

Welcome to Cal! :)
4th Year Political Science and History double major here. You're going to need 8 upper divs for political science once you get here and you NEED to phase 1 poli sci upper divs or you will not get them. You can only phase 1 upper div poli sci courses if you are a declared PS major, IIRC, so you're going to need to get over to Barrows Hall and talk to Efrat and Suzanne, our counselors, to make a game plan and learn about the distribution requirements within the major that you'll need to meet. So can you switch to Political Science? Yes. But be aware that you are going to have to commit to two of its upper div classes per semester if you want to graduate in two years. Also there was an extra upper div poli sci class added a couple of days ago (very rare this late in the summer) and it's practically empty at the moment. It's PS143A, Northeast Asian Politics, with Professor Dittmer. 

Good luck, welcome, and go bears! 
In addition to what other people have said, for various reasons, getting As here is much more difficult than at De Anza or the other California CCs, so keep that in mind. Double majoring in two very work-intensive majors is going to be rough to pull lots of As in. 
He could mean for law school. Philosophy and Poli Sci are two majors that feed into law programs
[deleted]
He did say ""grad school."" I suppose some people use that to include professional schools. 

Even for law school (and post law-school employment), I think that a STEM major would serve better in today's tech-dominated economy. And I'm saying that as someone who took several PoliSci and Philosophy electives myself.
lol r u john searle?
I think (my opinion) a STEM major wouldn't teach you the advanced reading and comprehension skills that you need for law school and the law profession. Now, you could learn it on your own, but i'd say its just about as hard as learning python and data structures on your own. (that is to say, definitely doable, but still difficult)
no i am a spooky ghost
In my experience, upper-division PoliSci and Philosophy classes at Cal do not teach advanced reading skills, nor writing skills. It would be great if they did - would have helped me - but they didn't, not at all. I can't imagine the situation has improved over time.

well i still like u anyway
