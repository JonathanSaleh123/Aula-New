"Five UC Berkeley faculty have been selected as recipients of the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award, Cal's most prestigious honor for teaching. They are: Wendy Brown, Political Science; Georgina Kleege, English; Anne Joseph O’Connell, Law; Lisa Pruitt, Mechanical Engineering; Irfan Siddiqi, Physics.",http://teaching.berkeley.edu/distinguished-teaching-award,2016-03-22 21:17:15,,"If anyone's anybody they know receiving that particular award means they're fucked for moving up on the academic ladder. Almost no-one who receives that award moves up from the professorship rank they received it at.
Alexander Coward gets snubbed once again!
maybe if you're an assistant prof., but for someone like lisa pruitt, no, that would be completely wrong
Do you have any evidence of that?
Well, I did say ""*almost* no one"".
Not really, a friend who worked at Cal and then later became an adjunct told me. She's been here for at least two decades, knows how things go."
"Cal's Wendy Brown to Elizabeth Abel's tenant David Peritz, an academic from Sarah Lawrence: ""It's past time for you to leave. And in case you are wondering whether there are any future possibilities of teaching at Berkeley, the answer is an emphatic no. The game is up.""",https://newrepublic.com/minutes/139555/dont-mess-judith-butler,2016-12-30 22:04:13,,"Ayyyyy that's my Queer Lit professor! Abel is such a sweet person, I could see this happening. God bless Judith Butler. 
David Peritz must be a Drumpf supporter. Just like people in red states take more welfare than other states, Peritz is a parasite.

Wendy Brown is so progressive and strong! Parasites like Peritz are not welcome teaching at Berkeley because they will pollute our students' minds.
You read like satire, except I agree with the basic principles of what you say and your post history seems earnest
This is so progressive!
Reverse Poe's Law? When your post is so earnest it reads like satire?"
Is Poli Sci 4 manageable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eoclme/is_poli_sci_4_manageable/,2020-01-13 15:43:22,"I took Poli Sci 1 this past semester and I ended up doing well... how does PS4 compare? The professor is Wendy Brown... I’ve heard she’s good, any tips?","manageable? It’s a lower div. it’s as much reading as any other class
Yes because CS16A is just as manageable as any other class. Because PS3 is just as easy as PS1. Clearly different classes have different levels of difficulty. I’m asking how easy it is relative to other PS classes.
I gave you your answer, it’s just as much reading as any other PS lower div class."
