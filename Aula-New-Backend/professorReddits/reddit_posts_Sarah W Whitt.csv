Legalst 138 vs 107,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/158or5y/legalst_138_vs_107/,2023-07-24 15:07:43,"I’m considering adding either Legalst 138 (Supreme Court and Public Policy) or 107 (theories of Justice). The professor for 138 is Kyle Deland, who has no reviews ( I believe he’s a grad student, and this is his first solo instructor class). 107 is w/ Sarah Song.

138 looks very Interesting but I’m hesitant due to the workload I’ve heard it entails w/ memorizing cases, and since it might be a wild card because the professor is new. I know I’ll take 107 eventually since it’ll be for a core requirement, but I heard professor Song is really good and the seats are more competitive to get her courses.

I would appreciate any feedback, especially from students who’ve taken either/ both courses!

Thankssss","138 is pretty easy, no matter who the professor is. I lucked out and got a special guest professor for this course, none other than the Dean of Berkeley Law, Erwin Chemerinsky himself. It was magical. But, regardless of who teaches it, it's about the Supreme Court, so it is modern, relatable, and most importantly - your opinion counts as a correct answer. You will examine the history of the Supreme Court and the most famous/socially impactful decisions of (mostly) the 20th Century, and on exams you can argue for your opinion without worrying about a right or wrong answer. You just have to use the concepts/points of law correctly to argue for your point of view. If you're interested in pursuing law it's kind of an essential course. That being said, I have no idea who this other professor is. I haven't taken Theories of Justice so I can't speak to that.
is law school in your future? always take the class with a predictable professor. a wild card new professor might make your life hell or not, but it’s better to know what you’re getting into. a B/A- could actually be detrimental in the long run, sadly for prelaws
both suck. 138 sucks a little bit less.
How was your experience with Kyle Deland? I am considering taking 138 with him this semester but the average grade on Berkeleytime looks very low.."

Contemporary Theories of Political Economy w/ Steven Vogel

Membership and Migration: Empirical and Normative Perspectives w/ **Sarah Seong-Sim Song,** **Irene Bloemraad**","Zook is a classic answer. Many students recommend his class if it’s your first upper div or just in general since there’s no discussion section, the readings and assignments are light, and he’s very enthusiastic during lectures and definitely a funny character. He usually tries to end lectures 30 minutes early. Recently, he’s also kept his covid semester recordings posted, so you could technically just not show up to class since the information usually doesn’t change too much.
Definitely Kent, he’s super man pretty much
[Prof Zook reviews his reviews](https://youtu.be/ZNFsmGz129I)
I have a personal soft spot for Prof. Wittenberg (Witty!!!), but I know others feel differently. I took Eastern Europe with him two years ago, easily one of the most informative region-focused classes I've taken. Workload is fairly heavy though, Prof. Wittenberg loves his in-class essay exams.

Prof. Zook is easily the most entertaining and energetic PS prof that I've taken. SE Asia is one of the easier PS classes, but you definitely learn a lot. 10/10 recommend, especially if you're looking for cuisine recommendations lol.

I took Prof Mattes during the Zoom U era. I enjoyed her lectures and she was very responsive and helpful during OH, but the Zoom format made the class organized weirdly. YMMV. 

There are a few profs who I would strongly suggest to avoid, but none of them are here, PM me if you want my negative takes lol.

Side Note: Are the course offerings seriously that thin this semester? Why is there only one IR class?
Take anything with Helene Silverberg, Terri Bimes, OR Darren Zook (if you want an interesting class that happens to be the easiest PoliSci course at UC Berkeley)
These are just the classes that are still open! I am making a late change of major to PoliSci and will only be able to enroll in phase two, so I'm taking what I can get.
Seconded for Silverberg
Ahhhh makes sense. Yeah I've sort of been there too. Heck, in two years of UD I never got my first pick of PS classes lol, so you really do get what you can take."

## **Student's Piazza post**

> **LS to EECS Transfer**
> 
> I noticed that the department adopted this new policy, essentially closing the EECS major off from anyone who didn’t apply directly to college of engineering.
> > Effective Fall 2017, the College of Engineering will not accept change of college applications for the EECS major.
> > 
> > http://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergrad-admissions/change-college
> 
> What was the rationale behind this and are there any possible exceptions? I understand that there is high demand for the major, but it seems rather unreasonable to expect students to have their life plan decided on while they’re in high school. This move shuts people who may be interested and more than qualified in electrical engineering out from pursuing a career in that field simply because they came into college unsure of their major. 

## **Instructors' Answer**

Instructors wrote:

> EDIT: This policy was put in place this year to reflect the practice that has been going on for some time. Due to constrained resources, we have not been able to accept change of college students into EECS for some time. This policy only makes the practice more transparent. As everyone else has mentioned, we encourage folks who discover their passion for EE/CS to pursue the Computer Science major in L&S. 
> 
> To reiterate what Halley said, the rationale was that students in L&S have the option to pursue the Computer Science major and have the option to take EE/EECS classes so there shouldn't be a need to switch colleges. For the LSCS major, eight out of the 27 units in upper division need to be CS, but the rest could be EE/EECS. Employers and graduate schools are going to be interested in the classes you took over the label of EECS vs. CS.


## **First Followup Discussion**

An instructor wrote:

> If you are in L&S, you can still pursue electrical engineering. The two majors have the same requirements.

A student wrote:

> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd imagine that companies that are hiring electrical engineers would look for applicants who majored in electrical engineering.

An instructor responded:

> If you have to same technical background, why would that make a difference to companies? This is why you submit cover letters when applying to jobs. Students that minor in CS or EECS still get tech jobs without CS or EECS being their major.
> 
> instead of tech jobs, i should say software engineering. some are even pursuing PhDs in Electrical/Computer engineering

A student wrote:

> Electrical engineering jobs often require more specialized expertise than software engineering jobs; as such, companies are often more selective as to what major their applicants are for electrical engineering positions than for software positions. Especially for more interesting/higher paying positions, having an electrical engineering degree is, I would think, a huge advantage over having to explain one's situation in a cover letter, which may not even be read. If someone takes ee-heavy courses, why shouldn't they be award with a degree that reflects their education?

An instructor wrote:

> I'm not disagreeing with you, and i agree that it is unfortunate. however many EECS students choose to not take any EE course, other than the lower division requirement that both CS and EECS students must take. Yet, they get the stamp of Electrical Engineering. 
> 
> If you decide you want to take more EE courses, you are taking to same coursework and taught by the same professor as the EECS person next to you. These professors will be writing your recommendation letters. Having a specific major on your transcript is not the only way you can get a job/internship.
> 
> I am sure staff/faulty can talk more as to why this choice was made. But I do not believe they are cutting off the opportunity to pursue EE from L&S students.

An instructor wrote:

> One thing you might want to do is talk with industry recruiters about this.  Often there are misunderstandings about what industry is looking for and requires. 

A student wrote:

> Would the notion that companies prefer to hiring electrical engineer graduates for electrical engineering positions be a misconception? I haven't talked to recruiters specifically, but job postings for these positions seem to be rather inflexible. 

A student wrote:

> As a general rule, job postings are usually written to be more rigid than what the company is looking for.
> 
> If you really want, just note on your resume that your degree is called CS, and your focus is in EE. It provides the complete picture regarding your situation.

A student wrote:

> Almost all midsize and large companies use software to filter out applications that don't meet certain criteria. While it certainly is possible to get an EE job with a CS degree (just like it is technically possible for an English major who took some EE classes to get an EE job), there is obviously a significant disadvantage and extra barriers one would need to go through. The department should be giving students with the adequate ability the necessary tools to succeed, not telling them to fill their resume/cover letter with excuses.

A student responded:

> Agreed, and even if there is a good enough reason for this policy change, I believe that the lack of communication about it is still an issue and needs to be addressed as well.

## **Second Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> I've been perfecting my gpa and drastically changing my academic schedules(did CS61A, 61B, 61C in one semester and EE16B 16A for the other) for the entire school year just to submit an application in this fall. It is really unfair closing the application without giving any prior notice. Why is this change made so abruptly and what do I do now??

A student responded:

> EECS has been pretty impacted, and hard to transfer anyways.  I don't know their exact reasons, but since its very unlikely that you will be able to transfer, they might as well just not take applications, especially now the LS CS is pretty much the same thing as EECS; the electrical engineering requirements are the same.  Even though there are some potential disadvantages in the discussion above, if you want to do EE, your best bet is probably LSCS and just take EE classes.

An instructor wrote:

> Agreed and please note there are a lot of rumors and misunderstandings of the benefits of an EE degree compared to the CS one in industry.

A student wrote:

> Not able to transfer because of academic qualifications and completely close the application are not the same. The unlikeliness of transfer doesn't justify tearing down the whole process overnight. I did acknowledge the difficulty of this undertaking at the very beginning and I still chose to do it anyway because I believe in my academic records. In my humble opinion the College should at least pay some respect to the students who already put efforts into this process instead of dismissively referring to the ""unlikeliness"" of transferring.

A student responded:

> What really frustrates me is that students like me who have put tremendous efforts into this endeavors end up doing everything in vain. I know a couple of other students who are in similar situations and even though there might only be a handful of students trying to transfer from LS to EECS each year, it doesn't mean our needs can be disregarded.
> 
> If the College made the decision and notified us one year in advance, I have no question about that and I would perfectly understand the rationales behind the decision. I could've enjoyed my first year of college by taking classes at a much slower pace and declared LSCS last semester if it's not for transferring to EECS.

A student responded:

> Completely agree with the statements above. If I am excluded from a major, I would prefer it to be because I got too many A's/not enough A+'s, not because the department closed the major off abruptly.

A student wrote:

> +1, closing off the major entirely seems too particularly extreme of an action as well, unless there's a particularly strong reasoning for doing so (e.g. takes up too many resources, not enough interest). The unlikeliness of transferring isn't enough of an argument imho, that's pretty much like saying you're blocked from applying to a certain college now because it's not likely that you'll get in (the analogy isn't perfect as schools do make money off of more applications). There definitely should've been more discussion with students and foresight into this policy change, as the department seems to be out of sync with some students about this.

A student responded:

> y'all flexing 2 hard smh

A student wrote:

> But that's precisely the reason? Not enough resources

A student wrote:

> Is there a significant difference in resources allocated per EECS student vs per LS CS student?

A student responded:

> I don't think so major wise, maybe college wise (ie CoE v. LS). This has just been my personal experience and should not be taken as indicative across campus

## **Third Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> I'm going to have to agree that not enough of a notice (if any at all) was given in regards to this decision to close off the EECS major for transferring into. Even though this policy may not affect much in terms of how many people are actually able to transfer into EECS in the first place, this decision seems rather off on a whim, as there were virtually no discussions of this policy prior to now (that I know of). Disclosing this important information at such a short notice seems particularly disrespectful to those who've already heavily invested into the prospects of transferring into EECS, and others who would like to pursue that path. Is there any reason in particular why not much of a notice was given in advance for this policy change? I certainly believe quite a few could have definitely benefited from knowing about this in advance, not to mention that the department should strive to notify students of important policy changes in a timely and responsible manner.

An instructor wrote:

> I agree that there was not enough notice given. It is so hard for students who take such a rigorous schedule in the hope of transferring to EECS. I know some of the staff feels the same way. I feel like you will get better answers to these concerns after the 4th of July because I am a student and not included in staff meetings. However, it might be in your interest to shoot an email to the College of Engineering in the meantime because it is ultimately their decision. I think it would be interesting to here what they have to say.

An instructor wrote:

> Please see Sarah's edit above. In addition, the College of Engineering and the department had no way of knowing who was interested in this pathway. We can't simply email all students in all colleges about policy changes. Undergraduate students are admitted to the College they select on their application; those admitted to L&S are undeclared and have the right to pursue any major in their college. This does not necessarily include EECS. 

A student responded:

> I'd assume that the College of Engineering does have the ability to update their website several months in advance of a policy change so perspective transfers would not be loading their schedules under false pretenses. I'm sure I can speak for most student that we were admitted to UC Berkeley under the assumption that, given the necessary academic standards, we would be able to switch our course of study, an assumption that until a few days ago was reflected in the College of Engineering's policy and website. It is unreasonable to assume that all high school students have their course of study completely planned out. Had I been aware of the policy, I certainly would have applied to Berkeley differently.

An instructor wrote:

> It is super unfortunate! But it is kinda unfair to all the students that applied EECS and got rejected from Berkeley, when they could have just gotten in undeclared in L&S and then switched. But, like Sarah's edit says, it was already EXTREMELY rare for students to switch into EECS. So now that it is officially on the website future students can apply for admittance accordingly 

## **Fourth Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> If the department is going to make sweeping decisions like this without consulting students, why not just fix the problem at the root and do away with the EECS major altogether? This is not to say that the EECS major itself is the problem-- it's great, and it's the reason I chose to come to Cal-- but by jamming all students who are interested in EE into a major that is by and far dominated by CS students, you are doing them (and anyone else who'd want to pursue EE) a terrible disservice. Simply making the already-existent split between ECE and CSE into a formal major division would be a simple way to solve the problem, and you could ensure that students that pursue both EE and CS (at least within CoE) get the resources they deserve. In all likelihood, in my mind, CSE would become what EECS is now (ultra competitive in terms of admissions and with an overwhelming focus on CS) and ECE would fall in at the tier of, say, MechE in terms of transfer availability. The department could keep the already different course requirements for the two (perhaps tweaking ECE so that more EE classes must be taken at the upper-div level), and I feel this would be a reasonable solution to a lot of the department's problems with regards to major selection for students. Is there a reason people don't talk about this more?

An instructor responded:

> The department is exploring the possibility of an EE focused track within LSCS. EECS is not going to be eliminated.

A student wrote:

> I have COE EECS friends who take a mix of CS/EECS/EE classes.  Many CS and EE classes complement one another to form a cohesive area of study (ex. see the many threads about AI/ML/Robotics or IoT/Cyber-physical systems).  I don't know what administrative/resources changes you are hoping to see with a formal split between EE and CS, but it sounds like it disadvantages the students who take both.
> 
> Anyways, I believe many students, myself included, can only work with anecdotal/personal evidence.  Are there any statistics on EECS students who take exclusively either EE or CS courses?
> 
> For those with interest purely in software engineering, being LSCS rather than EECS makes more sense to me, especially since it sounds like employers/grad school doesn't really care.

A student responded:

> note that we only have an EECS department - not EE or CS individually (much like MIT's course 6) that merged together something like 50 years ago done by exceptional people (Prof Zadeh, 100% worth reading his biography) that knew what they were doing. it wouldn't make sense to have a split between EE and CS if we only have one EECS department. 2cents

A student wrote:

> I think what the guy above is saying: you can have one department offer two majors.  Kind of like how the math department has math and applied math.  Maybe it could help with dividing resources?  But in other aspects, not sure if this would be a good move.

A student responded:

> My point was that EECS is largely a heavily ""impacted"" major because it has ""CS"" in it. I don't want ""EE"" or ""CS"" people in CoE to lose their privilege of taking courses that are in the other specialization.That's why both names, ECE and CSE, have ""computer"" and ""engineering"" in them. This is not a radical idea, considering basically every other UC school does it. It would be a simple formalization of the currently symbolic choice EECS students already have to make between the two concentrations. Simply put, if the two were nominally separate, admissions would be a lot simpler. My rationale is that Cal is not able to admit as many intended-EE students because EECS is the only major for EE students, and this is reflected in the relatively smaller number of students who take core EE classes compared to other schools of similar stature. It was difficult for me to get concrete data on graduating seniors in ECE, but the best fit for me was looking at enrollment in EE 105 and mapping that over 8 semesters of undergraduates. Obviously, EE is not just circuits, but, as was pointed out, enrollment in other core EE classes like EE 120 includes students who are ""double-dipping"" (as they should) but will eventually become CSE or CS. Currently, EE 105 for Fall 2017 has 37 students enrolled in it, and, although this is larger than the sub-30 number who finished the class last semester, I think it is reflective of a good approximation for half of the ECE students for one class (i.e. C/O 2019, etc). Just for the sake of argument, I'll boost the number to 60 (although the other core subset of EE, signals, is not large enough to justify this, considering EE 123 enrollment for Spring 2017 was just 12 people). I understand that there are AI/ML/Robotics, etc. but those students would likely fall under CSE, so I'm not including them in this argument. Anyway, 60*8 is 480 and 480/27496 (<-- total undergrad enrollment) is ~1.7%. Remember, this is a generous estimate in my opinion. Compare this to EE + CE enrollment for the University of Toronto (a similar large public research institution, where I'm studying for the summer, and the most convenient for me to get data on), which is 1510 and dividing by the total undergrad enrollment of 56261 yields ~2.7%. That's a whole 1% difference! 1% of 27496 is 275 students (who could be in ECE but are not because EECS)! You can run the same analysis on basically any other similar school, and I guarantee that you will see a trend. That Cal lags behind in attracting students to EE despite being the ~3rd best undergrad EE program in the WORLD is honestly pathetic. 2cents.
> 
> Additionally, I feel like creating EIS for L&S is an imperfect solution because the subject matter of the major means that someone in EIS really deserves a place in CoE: it's called ""electrical engineering"" for a reason. Making ECE separate in terms of admissions would ensure that everyone who wants a chance at EE when they apply to the university has a fair shot at it. And, because I feel that it won't be as severely impacted as EECS, transfers should be possible, without the need for a whole new major.

A student continued:

> Also, to respond to the anon who is advocating MIT's style of doing things, I think EECS as a major should be done away with, not as a department. Plenty of other universities have ""EECS"" departments, and MIT is really not special on this front, but it is different from Cal in that it offers courses 6-1 (Electrical Science and Engineering), 6-2 (EECS), and 6-1/8 (EE w/ Physics) as separate degree options for students interested in EE. Cal has nothing like that, and that is a problem. 

An instructor wrote:

> There has been a lot of internal discussion about separating EE and CS amongst both faulty and staff, but the decision has been to keep them together.

## **Fifth Followup Discussion**

An instructor wrote:

> Just a reminder that any student who wants the ""Electrical Engineering"" line on their resume or transcript can complete the EECS minor :)

An instructor responded:

> +1","I fully support the split of EE and CS. The influx of students in CS has caused so much trouble in fundings. EE upper div classes used to have 2 TAs for a class size of 30+(roughly). Now because of CS, they can only have 1 TA per class. It just makes no sense to drag EE into it.
Earlier post: https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6lzbl0/psa_newly_admitted_non_eecs_coe_majors_interested/

> This is for changing into EECS from LS. If you're in CoE already you can change your major to EECS provided you fit the prereqs. Last time I checked it was 3.3 in major/technical + 1 EECS technical per semester after 1 year.
If the department is unable to accept transfers from LS, then it makes sense to just close off the application entirely.  There was a student above complaining about how he re-arranged his schedule just to be able to apply, and I think this is exactly the scenario they are trying to prevent in the future.
Feel like I'm in the minority here but I really wish that just put CS in CoE and make it so that the only way to major in CS is to get admitted into it through the college application. it'll fix our overflow of CS students since admissions will control how many people are in each class
Yeah, why not allow students in both colleges to pursue EE, CS, or EECS? Or you could limit pure EE to the CoE and pure CS to L&S but make EECS available in both colleges. 
Again, no one is suggesting split the DEPARTMENT (which is where funding is allocated) just split the majors. That will essentially not make a difference in terms of funding.
Split the department, split the fundings, split the majors

The combined EECS has made it so hard for people pursuing EE, both in terms of fundings and admission.
EE would *probably* lose funding in that scenario just fyi. It benefits from a symbiotic relationship from CS. Its not like a departmental split will result in 50-50 fund splits
I highly doubt if EE gets any benefit staying with CS. The student-to-faulty ratio has increased significantly since CS started to expand. And I don't see any reason that staying with CS will improve this, especially when CS has expanded to a size that they can't even support themselves. There's no way they have any extra to help EE.

In terms of research fundings, EE probably draws in more money than CS. Fundings in EE are usually larger in scale as they require more equipments than CS. "
