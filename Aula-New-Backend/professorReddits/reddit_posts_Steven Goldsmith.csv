English C107 Bible as Literature is missing from the Course Capture/Webcast archive,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ezgokk/english_c107_bible_as_literature_is_missing_from/,2020-02-05 13:20:20,Does anyone know why or know where I can find it? Instructor was Steven Goldsmith last time I checked. Thanks!,"Not all classes are in the archive, some are there but only have audio, etc. It's just based on whether the instructor submitted webcasts to the archive.
Sucks :( I had them on itunes and it obviously disappeared during the purge. Thanks for the update"
