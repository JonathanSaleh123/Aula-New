Math 54 professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bj1g6p/math_54_professors/,2019-04-30 02:51:26,"So there is Vera Serganova, Constantin Teleman, and Katrin Wehrheim who will be teaching in the fall of 2019 and Iâ€™m not sure which one is more preferred than the others since rate my professor seems inconsistent","[Thread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bfj22p/math_54_fall_2019_prof/); [Thread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bfyfg0/math_54_with_telemanserganovawehrheim/)

In general, I highly recommend using [push-shift Reddit search](http://redditsearch.io/) to look for frequently asked questions!

Edit: fixed typo
I had Teleman; he's a very intelligent man and a fast-paced lecturer that can be hard to follow at times. However, I would always read the textbook before lecture and that helped a lot and made the class pretty enjoyable actually. When I was taking 54 I think he covered more material than the other professors, which is something I liked about his class. Pretty entertaining guy at times and an unbeatable sense of fashion. Tests were pretty fair with decent curves, so my friends and I ended up doing well in the class. I recommend him if you like lectures that are engaging and cover more content at the expense of being more of a challenge to keep up with and greater reliance on spending personal time (reading textbook/notes or office hours) to cover gaps in understanding.
lol poster of the second thread deleted it already?
I linked it because someone gave feedback about Wehrheim, but it's otherwise redundant with the first link yeah."
