PSA: Consulting Clubs Need YOU More Than You Need Them,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/huuxp8/psa_consulting_clubs_need_you_more_than_you_need/,2020-07-20 15:08:12,"After reading u/Independent-Common95's post '[Don't apply to the consulting clubs/CS orgs/business frats](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hudiv0/dont_apply_to_the_consulting_clubscs_orgsbusiness/)', I was particularly moved by one quote:

&#x200B;

*""People at these clubs are not more successful that other people. These clubs perpetrate the idea that if you don’t get into their club, you won’t be successful at Berkeley. This is completely untrue.""*

&#x200B;

And I felt compelled to write this post, provide additional context, and be a resource for anybody and everybody who wants to learn more about recruiting, hunting for jobs + internships, and breaking into ""prestigious"" roles in consulting, investment banking, product management, and more.

I personally have met some of the most spectacular, genuine, amazing, inspiring, empowering, gentle, and loving people in my life here at Cal. And yes, some of them were in what I would call the umbrella term of the wider 'consulting community' (re: consulting clubs, business frats, etc.).

And just to get this out of the way: yes, I was a part of this community. I can't speak for coding clubs, design org's, or other student groups in those kinds of spaces, but I am quite intimate with the Cal business scene. And after spending these past 4 years working my ass off in this space, I can safely assure you this: we ain't SHIT.

I could aim for the low hanging fruit (re: sexual assault, racism, ridiculous and illogical recruiting practices, toxic membership practices, a complete and utter disregard for diversity and inclusion), but honestly this post isn't about them. It's about YOU, and what YOU are capable of.

The community's marketing strategy is built on the fundamentally incorrect notion that you need them in order to earn internships and full-time jobs at the hottest spots in Wall Street and Silicon Valley. One afternoon scouring LinkedIn's may convince you this is true. And if it isn't the LinkedIn stalking that does it for you, it's the endless tabling and flyering on Sproul, the deluge of information sessions, and wave-after-wave of obnoxiously branded Patagonia-wearing 20 year old's reminding you that they're interning with Morgan Stanley next summer.

In Statistics, one of the most simple but lasting concepts you'll learn about is 'Convenience Sampling'. Our perception of reality is essentially distorted by data that is easy to draw upon, but ultimately misleading. For instance, would you believe the results of a presidential election poll conducted solely on UC Berkeley students?

Hopefully you wouldn't, because our (relatively) small campus sample size is by no means indicative of our actual voting population. Likewise, our consulting club bubble is a poor representation of what the actual professional world is like.

When I interned in New York, my club had little to no network for me to reach out to. So I learned how to build my own network for myself.

That summer, I had ***over*** ***100*** coffee chats with Cal alum working everywhere from Goldman Sachs to Google, from Wall Street to up-and-coming startups and everything in-between. What surprised me was witnessing how warm, helpful, and inspiring our alumni could be.

And what may surprise you even more is how very few of these alumni actually belonged to the wider consulting club community. Of the 25 alumni I got really close with, only one came from a consulting club. And she left after spending ***only two*** semesters in it.

These people made it to the hottest, hypest positions available to undergrads. They were consultants at BCG and Deloitte. They were bankers at Goldman and J.P. Morgan. They were PM's at Venmo and Twitter. Some of them even founded their own startups. And regardless of industry and role, of major or club affiliation (or, more commonly than not, lack thereof) they were 100% killing the game.

It opened my eyes to how insane of a bubble we Cal students live in here at Berkeley. Because once you get out into the real world, you will begin to see how much potential you truly have.

Because every single year, hundreds of students - some in these clubs, and most of them not - land amazing opportunities by virtue of their OWN hard work, grit, dedication, passion, and will.

My own personal experiences - and talking with my friends, mentors, and wider network - helped me challenge my past, misguided biases and convinced me of two simple, pervasive truths.

You don't need consulting clubs. They need YOU.

Who else will wake up at the ass crack of dawn to set up shop at Sproul, pitching tents and mentally bracing oneself for a week's worth of tabling and flyering? Who else will drink the kool-aid and indoctrinate the next generation of naive freshmen and sophomores? How else will current members direct their repressed stress when welcoming new recruits (re: you) to a series of family-friendly, ASUC-approved wholesome ice breaker activities (re: hazing)? Who else will uphold the legacy of prestige, most of which is flimsily held together by a pathology of poorly-disguised inferiority complexes?

So go out there and get that bread. Join clubs because **you** want to join them, because its members excite you and inspire you, and not because they claim to have a fast-track pass to the Goldman Sachs (hint: they don't). Make friends in the unlikeliest of places. Don't be afraid to shoot your shot DM'ing cool people on LinkedIn. You never know what you'll find.

In fact, I wouldn't be where I am today with having taken those risks. And neither will you.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** Membership in these clubs is neither validation of your personal/professional worth nor affirmation of your success in the real world. Only *you* have the power to determine that.

&#x200B;

**P.S.** Feel more than free to DM me if you have any questions or just want to talk. I know this is Reddit, but screw anonymity (this isn't my actual Reddit account anyway), and DM me here on Reddit if you want to chat and/or talk about anything recruiting, college, or postgraduate life!","Excellent post!!!!!
How'd you talk to 100 people over the summer? How do you even start a conversation like that? What did you talk to them about? 

Asking as someone who's never really figured out what ""networking"" entails.
Some of these orgs will do you absolute wonders—so far as they have a healthy social scene, valuable resources, and meaningful projects that teach you something new. That being said, OP is right that our mindset around applying should be much different (if you’re thinking of applying at least)
Consulting clubs are a complete joke, all they do is make you work really hard on some fake project that a company will throw away.

Thank you so much <3 always happy to help anyway I can
I 100% get what you're saying, networking is an incredibly vague and abstract concept. I think it doesn't help that Cal kids lack formalized or institutionalized resources/support from the university, so we're mostly left to figure this out for ourselves.

I basically just checked out people's profiles on LinkedIn and reached out to anybody who seemed interesting. I was practically on a coffee chat every day, some of them in-person, but most over the phone/Face Time. I also attended alumni events over the weekend, and got to meet some awesome people in-person through fun social events.

If you want to learn more about networking, I'd definitely check out [some](https://bryanwang.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-authentic-networking) [of](https://www.cio.com/article/3219704/how-to-network-17-tips-for-shy-people.html) [these](https://link.ucop.edu/2020/04/14/share-with-your-network-tips-for-job-searching-during-covid-19/) [resources](https://career.berkeley.edu/Info/InfoInterview), and of course the best thing to do is just take that leap of faith and get a conversation rolling. Networking (rightfully) sounds snakey, but once you treat it like a conversation (and actually getting to know the person you're talking to) it can quickly evolve into pretty amazing friendships. I used to talk to my mentors about investment banking recruiting; now I'm helping them plan their engagement surprises and wedding plans, so I absolutely see networking as a win for both sides.

Feel free to DM + connect with me, and we can schedule some time to chat :)
Alum here. Honestly, if a Cal student reached out to me on LinkedIn and just said “hey I’m interested in M&A. Would you be willing to grab coffee and chat?” I would definitely reply and almost certainly make sure we met up soon.
Absolutely. I personally found my community in these kinds of org's, and have received so much love and support over the years. But it breaks my heart knowing this very community is exclusive, and doesn't intend to provide these resources and support to other students. I more than understand why this is the case, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about it. 

And I think we need to normalize non-membership in these clubs, at least in the context of finding fulfilling friend groups + jobs and internships. These student org's are by no means a golden ticket to the top internships/jobs, nor are they validation of one's worth and potential. Cal is a huge place, and while that makes it hard to navigate, there are countless communities one could be part of. I wish it was easier, but a huge part of finding those communities is putting yourself out there.
It honestly depends, IMO lots of them pretend they’re prestigious but, in reality, they beg their clients to work with them and also offer their work for free; that kind of attitude will surely lead to less impactful projects. 

There are a number of consulting clubs that do have their recommendations implemented (at least partly) and to produce solid revenue though, but that doesn’t mean they’re worth applying to either
Personally, I disagree...obviously if the org works with predominantly massive companies like FAANG+ or sth then it'll be hard to make something that they'll keep, but in my experience, orgs that work with smaller companies or startups can make a difference.

A lot of these small startups lack the brand name, but they'll often work with the club PMs at the beginning of the semester to craft a project that they'll actually keep. I won't sugarcoat it, because sometimes you'll be doing busy work, but I'll tell you that it feels good to see execs actually attend your final deliverable and discuss the merits of some of your ideas, then actually see some of them be implemented in the following few months

I think your blog post has a lot of useful advice. It feels really uncomfortable for me to initiate these conversations with a stranger but I’d be more than willing to be on the other side. 

Thanks for the offer to chat but I’d like to keep my reddit at least somewhat anonymous for now.
Out of curiosity, what universities DO have institutionalized support and resources to teach students how to network? I thought that was a systemic issue with all/most universities, not just Cal.
honestly I get that and five years down the line if someone hit me up for CS advice I’d be more than willing to meet up too. It’s just feels very very uncomfortable to me to be on the other end. I guess I gotta grow out of it :P
As an alum, this \^\^ 100%. I've personally been ghosted by plenty of alumni, but many more got back to me when I was a student and helped me get to where I am today. We need to stick together :)
No worries! And I definitely agree initiating is really, really tough. Call it lack of self-awareness or an over-abundance of self-confidence, but I think taking that initial plunge will vastly accelerate your appetite for networking. I more than respect your privacy, though -- just know my DM's are always open :)
I was definitely simplifying the problem, but there are a lot of key ways Cal underserves students in the recruiting scene. I'll also add that this analysis is *relative* to private schools, and the experiences my friends have had there (in contrast with mine and my friends' here at Cal). When compared to other *public* schools, though, we 100% have a leg-up (though that should be expected, considering we're comparatively well-funded and enjoy an amazing brand).

While we have a ""Career Center,"" it is severely underutilized by both students and administration. For instance, my friends in the Ivies, Stanford, etc. personally were *always* able to score 1:1 advising with dedicated career counselors to discuss professional goals and be personally connected to relevant alumni, professors, and grad students. These schools have dedicated staff constantly holding office hours for resume and cover letter review, mock interview sessions, and are 100% in-sync with alumni such that they can easily match make students with opportunities in any conceivable space they want. These schools also typically have tighter-knit alumni communities in the first place, and that is absolutely because they institutionally have stronger best practices securing alumni support (re: how many Cal alum do you know feel strongly enough about the university go give back?).

To make a long story short, networking is easy when you're spoon-fed contacts. And *this* is made easy by universities employing smart practices that actually serve the best interests of its students. I more than understand Cal is pretty resource-restrained, making it quite difficult to develop anything more robust than it already is. It's just that when you're practically forced to have to put yourself out there - with nothing but your name and what some may see a flimsy reliance on school pride - you can imagine the odds are stacked against you.
Thanks for the thoughtful response! That makes sense, especially the public versus private comparison. But how do you get such a huge institution to make meaningful change like that? That's not just rhetorical, I mean in reference to the reality that *how to change* any large system is a tough nut to crack. What's the answer, more staff, better communication? I wonder if it's easier to get help now that everything is online? No tables to man, lol!
Great questions! There is the question of *doing*, and then the separate one on *trying*. You're right; these are all insanely large, complex issues that will require years of systemic effort, funding, and strategic direction. I emphasize effort, though, because I think that's where our university is most lacking. 

I do believe, at the end of the day, you are responsible for your own growth and development. I personally am not a fan of how the Ivies hand-hold their students (for me, this is actually a huge reason why I'm proud of us Golden Bears). That being said, I'm certain our generous salary allocation for our football coach (among many, many other things) could be allocated instead to paying career counselors and major advisers more (re: increase retention, quality of service, etc.), expanding services under our Disabled Students Program for Career Services, etc. There are a lot of minute policy changes that need to be made, but I think the university is generally sluggish in addressing socioeconomic mobility and the need for high-paying jobs for high-caliber students like us. Considering income inequality creep and that cost of living (especially in the Bay) is outpacing wages, universities *must* do a better job preparing its students to succeed post-grad."
