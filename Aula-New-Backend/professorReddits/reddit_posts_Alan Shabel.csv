Is Alan Shabel teaching Bio 1B in the summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13es4uu/is_alan_shabel_teaching_bio_1b_in_the_summer/,2023-05-11 09:23:58,"If so, how is he","Not sure if he's teaching it, but I had him last year over the summer and he was amazing!  He's definitely understanding, has clear lectures, and pretty reasonable exams. I would recommend taking it with him if it's an option.
I had Shabel for another class and he's one of the best science profs on campus. Super friendly and understanding and makes lectures interesting.
Love shabel ü´∂üèª He is a great professor. The exams are reasonable
He‚Äôs a great professor. Make sure to actually pay attention to his anecdotes ‚Äî some of that stuff showed up on his exams
I took him for a integrative bio class and it was the easiest one I‚Äôve ever taken in my whole life"
IB 104LF,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rxz6vi/ib_104lf/,2022-01-06 20:58:28,has anyone taken this course with alan shabel? i saw that the avg grade was a B and was wondering how much effort i need to put in to get an a- or above ..,"I took it last spring, ended up getting an A- which honestly was pretty generous because I waited way too long on my final project and really didn‚Äôt put much effort in it. That being said, doing well on exams is important, the class isn‚Äôt curved and to my recollection neither were any individual exams. You will need to put in the effort to identify and learn the names of native species of birds, herps, and mammals- with the latter two also requiring Latin names. Exams were definitely fair and representative of the lectures, but not something you could get away without studying for. If your class ends up having an open note policy for exams like ours did, you will need to provide answers to a deeper understanding than just what‚Äôs explicitly stated on lecture slides. The other big grade component I alluded to earlier is the final project, which is mostly just a big time commitment and planning is your friend. Overall the expectations for the project were low- especially if you opted for the research project over term paper options, and as long as you put in some clear effort it should be ok. The staff really just cares about getting people excited about field biology, if you‚Äôre looking for an easy A, that‚Äôs not what this class is for. 

The bird and herps professors this year will be different from who had previously been doing it for years because they are both teaching their specific herpetology and ornithology courses this semester. If you are primarily interested in either of these over mammals, I highly recommend just doing those ones specifically, they don‚Äôt truly require 104LF as a prerequisite especially if you send an email to them. I could not say enough things about how great these two professors are, Shabel is also great but it was really Bowie and McGuire who made the course so special for me. 

Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions :)
If the GSI is Jackie Childers, she would make the class a lot better even if you don't get lectures from Bowie. Maybe I'm biased because I was her URAP but she is genuinely a great person
thank u üò≠
i took ib 117lf thjs past sem and it was complete memorization, so i was wondering if 104 was simpler or if i had to memorize like 2000 slides again.. but thx so much ill def shorten my course load this sem for this class :‚Äô)
shes my gsi :) awesome thanks"

Any easy A physical or biological sciences breadth courses you recommend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yn3odu/any_easy_a_physical_or_biological_sciences/,2022-11-05 12:28:36,Unsurprisingly in need of a GPA boost and need to fill a couple requirements. I personally don‚Äôt like sciences all that much so my background in the physical and biological sciences is very limited. Specific instructors you liked are also very welcome!,"Eps 20
