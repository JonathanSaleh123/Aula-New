Does anyone have an experience with a L&S Retroactive Withdrawal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e5u6ji/does_anyone_have_an_experience_with_a_ls/,2019-12-03 21:02:29,I've got a meeting with an Assistant Dean (Professor Daniel Melia) and just wanted to know if anyone else ever had a retroactive withdrawal go through successfully or have met an assistant dean before?,"I’ve done it before.

Basically just present proof that your semester is not a reflection of how you would do under normal circumstances. Explain how an event or combination of events prevented you from being successful.

For me, I got hit with severe sickness and then I broke my hand, so my attendance and note-taking was abnormally low. Retroactive withdrawal granted.

#Edit as of 2023: 

Over the past few years, a lot of people have been asking questions about this in my DMs. I'm usually happy to talk via DM, but as for general advice:

> 1: Get your entire story put together with evidence to support it. You'll be telling this information to a bunch of different people over the course of the retroactive withdrawl process, so having it in one place is absurdly helpful.

> 2: A lot of different stuff can count as proof. You may not have a doctor's note for physical/mental illnesses, but have you texted your family/friends about it? Emailed a professor? Been to university student services? All of these help corroborate your story, even if they aren't individually ""good"" pieces of evidence.

> 3: Don't stress too much about presenting stuff. In my experience, the people you're presenting to generally assume you're acting in good faith. Clearly state what happened, provide proof for it, and answer any questions they have truthfully. Deep breaths; they aren't out to find ways to reject your late withdrawl.
Hi! Where did you end up with finally? I am kind of in the same boat
Great, thank you! There's not really a lot of information online regarding the process and counselors often have given me contradicting information. Could I PM you a couple questions?
I am entering the same situation. Can I dm you about the withdrawal process? Thanks a lot!
Sure. I have class soon, though, so I’m going to suck at responding until ~4
Sure
no problem, just pm'd you! thanks :)"
Take Earth and Planetary Science classes!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mwbkcc/take_earth_and_planetary_science_classes/,2021-04-22 11:40:10,"Hello everyone. I'm writing to put Earth and Planetary Science classes on everyone's radar for the upcoming phase 1 enrollments. This fall we will be teaching breadth courses on climate change, earthquakes, the oceans, and introductory Earth science.

I personally will be teaching EPS 102: History and Evolution of Planet Earth (M,W,F 3-4) and I would really like to get people with diverse backgrounds taking the class.

This class covers the origin of our solar system, the origin of life, Earth's climate and tectonic history from the recent ice ages to global catastrophes billions of years ago, the evolution of life from microorganisms to complex animals, and more! The class has no prerequisites other than high-school level math, chemistry, and physics. Anything you need to know is taught.

Average grade in the class: B+. Most common grades A or A- depending on the semester.

Example comments from recent course evaluations:

•*The course does a really great job being accessible to students outside the EPS department. I took it as a breadth class and was daunted in the beginning looking over the syllabus. Even though many students had taken EPS 50 as an ""unofficial"" prerequisite, I didn't feel like I was disadvantaged coming in with zero knowledge. It was well organized to build understanding from the ground up. I also think Professor Stolper is an engaging lecturer and he took the time to go over key concepts patiently multiple times to reinforce them, which is surprisingly uncommon. I think this course should be publicized more as an alternative to classes like Chem 1A which students from other departments take for the Natural Science breadth. I learnt a lot more than I thought I would as the class (not being central to my major) was low priority for me but ended up being one of my most interesting classes at Berkeley.*

•*Professor Stolper is a very strong, engaging lecturer. I really enjoyed the way that he explained the course concepts, and his style of teaching ensured that I always felt included, even within the lecturing format.*

*•It was like listening to a well–made podcast: lots of compact, in depth, well–explained info*

Main criticism? I have bad handwriting. This is true.

*His handwriting is a little yikes but he knows it and will try to rewrite for you.*

Other classes to consider:

EPS 7: Introduction to Climate Change (M,W,F 2-3)

EPS C20: Earthquakes in your backyard (T/Th 11-12:30)

EPS 50: The Planet Earth (T/Th 2-3:30)

EPS 82: Oceans (M/W/F 10-11)

&#x200B;

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

UC Berkeley","Took EPS C20 last semester and had loads of fun! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a cool class to fulfill their Physical Science breadth
Have not taken this class, but can attest that the EPS department is a fun one! I have taken an enviro science class (80) and the oceans one (82), and both were definitely fun, informative breadths that I actually enjoyed going to!
EPS classes are wonderful! Looking forward to taking 102 in the fall!"
5 Keys to Start a Conversation with Strangers (Part 1),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pgwunw/5_keys_to_start_a_conversation_with_strangers/,2021-09-02 20:12:20,"Starting a conversation with strangers can make many people anxious.

I still remember that time when I was invited to a party. I was supposed to meet my friends there but I didn't see any of them. On one side, I started feeling pretty anxious since I hardly had some experience socializing out of my friends circle. On the other side, I didn't want to leave that early since I felt that would be perceived a rude (I was 15), so I decided to stay at least 1 hour.

I instantly realized I had a big issue... I didn't know how to start talking to people I didn't know. It was an uncomfortable experience since I could see other guys and girls having fun, throwing jokes at each other, telling stories, and enjoying themselves, and there was my boring self, isolated. Being at a party, but not being part of the party. The hour passed and I left the site, feeling sad and mad to myself for not being able to start a simple conversation.

Luckily, I've learned a lot from my past. From a current perspective is not that hard talk to strangers. We are social animals, but there exists something like a ""social muscle,"" which entails practice to become good at it. Here I give you 5 keys you can start putting into practice right now.

# 1. Get rid of embarrassment with the Mask technique

The **Mask Technique** consists of creating an *alter ego*, a character that allows you to leave your daily reality so that you can do and say things that you would not normally do. This way, if someone rejects you, you're not the one being rejected, but your character.

This technique is used by actors and comedians like ***Daniel Tosh*** to overcome his shyness on stage. Even ***Beyoncé*** has created an alter ego named Sasha for when she has to act. In both cases, extroverted and provocative characters have been invented, and when it corresponds they act as such.

Logically, in the long term it is much better to overcome shyness by facing its origin, but the Mask technique is a very useful tool to start behaving in a more open and sociable way.

&#x200B;

# 2. Never forget your real goal

This is the main reason many people fail before they even try.

When you want to start a conversation with someone, you must be clear that your goal is not to impress, or to try get liked. People don't know you and any of these attempts can play against you.

&#x200B;

* Your goal should only be to show yourself as social and chill person who wants to have a conversation to see if there are common interests.
* Then you can set more specific secondary objectives, such as exchanging business cards or giving each other the phone to meet another time, but for now you should not think of anything else.

&#x200B;

The moment you are clear that your goal is to find common interests to turn them into conversations, you will stop being distracted by other matters that actually get you out of your way.

# 3. Smile and the world will smile back at you

Before saying any word, this simple gesture can make the difference between a good or bad first impression.

We are all aware of the power of smiling, but there's [research](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120125132814.htm) confirming that the simple act of nodding and smiling when you meet a stranger on the street can create a strong connection. Not to mention the entire collection of studies showing that smiling makes you look more attractive.

This doesn't mean you permanently force a grimace of joy on your face. It wouldn't be honest or look natural. More than just smiling, it's about your attitude. When you approach to start a conversation for the first time with someone you should do it from a positive and friendly attitude.

Show that you come to provide energy, not to suck it up. Nobody wants to put up with a grumpy guy for half an hour, so from the beginning you must predispose people so that they don't see you as that kind of person. Smile, and others will smile back.

# 4. Prepare the ground with this simple phrase

*""How is the day going?"" ""Hi! How are you?"" ""Hi, how you doing?""*

I could use many more variants, but the goal is for the other person to answer **he/she is doing good.** These questions are interesting because it has been shown in a [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1990.tb00399.x) that by answering ""*good*"" the other person will be more likely to **have a social behavior.**

When someone tells you that he/she is fine or doing great, he will hardly have a negative behavior immediately afterwards. So, a good idea is that your first sentence is a simple *""Hey, how's it going?"".*

If the other person is busy or just for education, it's also better to **start asking for permission** by saying ""*Excuse me*"" or ""*Pardon me*."" Especially when you want to enter the conversation of a group, since it shows that you are aware of the social situation of others.

# 5. Ask something related to the situation or place

The most natural way to start a conversation is probably to **make a comment or question about the situation that you and the other person are sharing.** Its simplicity doesn't make it less effective and, after all, it's the only bond you have before approaching.

This conversation starter also prevents shy people from being rejected if it occurs, as they can always justify they just wanted to ask something.

According to [Dr. Carducci](https://ius.academia.edu/BernardoCarducci), director of the Shyness Research Institute, the initial question does not have to be particularly clever: *the best phrase is simple and should only refer to the environment or situation that is shared.* Ideally, an open question so that you cannot be answered with just a yes or no. Here are some examples:

&#x200B;

* In a bar: *""Excuse me, do you know what time this place closes?""*
* In a training course: *""In which classroom is the next lecture?""*
* At the station: *""Do you know when the last train leaves?""*

&#x200B;

Even if you think a question may be too obvious, don't worry. These phrases can be interpreted as if you really need the information or that you just want to start a conversation, so it doesn't really matter that much what you say.

**If you still struggling with starting a conversation, and want an easier way to do it** by connecting with new people through in person on campus through common interests, [**join**](https://discord.gg/8cKxSgaF) our *Discord Community* or [**sign up**](https://www.vibed.io/) on our *website* and become a *Beta Tester*. We are a currently creating a solution for that problem.

As I already mentioned, we all are social animals that are always willing to have at least a little chit-chat with a stranger as long as it feels natural. In this first post, I gave you 5 keys on how to achieve that goal that you need to be putting into practice right now!","I really appreciate this. I've been wanting to go to bars or something and just strike up a conversation with someone, but I'm always to scared/shy to do so I guess. I also just don't feel like I'm an interesting enough person to have a conversation with? I tend to trip up on my words and thoughts a lot, and thinking about that makes me even more anxious lol.. I also feel like I can't gauge well if people do/don't want to be approached? Like what if they're acting all nice and stuff during the convo but in reality they're uninterested and want to get the hell out of dodge?? Talking is hard sometimes.
Step 1. Be attractive 

Step 2. See Step 1.
Would change #2 — if you’re of the mindset that the people you’re around are a cool bunch, then you can direct your attention to wanting to get to know someone more, instead of pressuring yourself to play it smooth. People are much more approachable than we tend to think!
Holy shit hahahaha I just realized I’ve been using the mask technique my whole life and never gave a name to it
I pick up Montgomery’s card and actually finger it, for the sensation the card gives off to the pads of my fingers.

“Nice, huh?” Price’s tone suggests he realizes I’m jealous.

“Yeah,” I say offhandedly, giving Price the card like I don’t give a shit, but I’m finding it hard to swallow.

^(*Bot. Ask me how I got on at the gym today.* |) [^(Opt out)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=botrickbateman&subject=Opt%20out)
Just remember, everything your mind is telling you about other person’s thoughts might be true. That’s something you’ll never know, it’s not under your control. Whatever is not under your control, should be overlooked and do your part (taking a “leap of faith” and approach that person you want to strike up a conversation with).
In my experience, Raleigh's and Tap Haus generally have the best vibe for stranger chatting of the bars near campus. I personally love going to them alone at the end of a long day and just seeing what happens. Sometimes you find someone or a few someone's down to chat, sometimes not, but it's a fun way to chill and maybe get in some random socialization regardless.

(Also when people are drunk, they find EVERYTHING more interesting, so that helps)
Definitely not true for starting conversations
How to be attractive:
Step 1. Don’t say shit like this
Being attractive is definitely a bonus, but I’m pretty sure I won’t be the only one saying this: from my personal experience, I’ve seen not attractive at all people surrounded by many people. It has more to do with the Vibe your portray than your physical appearance!
The intention behind Key #2 was to keep the focus. Many people create scenarios in their minds and so the conversation direction doesn’t go anywhere when, in reality, a cool friendship could’ve been developed. 

On the other hand, I totally agree with you. You shouldn’t force yourself to talk someone who doesn’t want to be talked to.
Many people actually don’t realize their using it, lol. How has it worked for you?
Okay?"
