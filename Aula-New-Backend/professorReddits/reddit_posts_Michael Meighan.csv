Sounds like a reasonable answer.
I was really hoping the piazza army would win the battle vs Michael Meghan but he doesn’t give af about anyone’s problems lol. I don’t think the class has been unfair and I don’t think he being a complete asshole, but it is funny he just roasts students on piazza. I was hoping the final could count as a midterm but doesn’t look like Michael Meighan gonna let that happen.
This is a perfect answer lol. Bio 1A is filled with kids who don’t want to learn just get As and complain that it’s too hard. He can be unreasonably dickish but at some point you can’t expect him to put up with everything.
all the homies hate m**ghan
He really do be switching up at every possible moment. Idk a lot of his responses in the past makes it seem like he's annoyed that we are wasting his time with our questions
Same haha it would be nice but I doubt anything is gonna happen
Sometimes it's completely reasonable but he has sent us so many emails just complaining about how much time he spends working on stuff even though he is the one that messed something up
He’s like a cranky endearing bat that does a job people don’t really want to do. He does care about students but the job seems like it sucks. I found him to be useless outside of office hours so if you need something talk to him instead of piazza/email.
For some reason, I always find his piazza responses to be extremely confusing and I end up hoping that a GSI or professor will respond to my question instead.  Idk, I guess I'm used to the chemistry department or Bio 1B where the staff are extremely accommodating and responsive to student's concerns"
