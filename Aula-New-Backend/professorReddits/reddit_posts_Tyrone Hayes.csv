Silencing the Scientist: Cal Professor Tyrone Hayes on Being Targeted by Herbicide Firm Syngenta,http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/21/silencing_the_scientist_tyrone_hayes_on,2014-02-21 13:34:49,,"Here's the [original article from New Yorker Magazine](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/10/140210fa_fact_aviv?currentPage=all). The drug in question is [atrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrazine) and is suspected to increase aromatase activity. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts Testosterone to Estradiol, so increased activity may lead to feminization. 
Yes, this is the same Tyrone from the ""Tyrone got his shit together"" meme and the [inappropriate emails](http://gawker.com/5619556/worlds-greatest-angry-scientist-ya-fulla-my-jz-right-now) and [more](http://gawker.com/5620781/dr-tyrone-hayes-biologist-cock+fixated-megalomaniac-email-addict) though he might just be trolling  Syngenta if they're trying to silence him
This is so sad. We see it, left and right. Scientists, highly respected in their field, completely ignored. Why?
Hayes' response about tape recording these supposed threats is ridiculous.  Rather than just record the alleged verbal threats against him, he decides to let the ""bad guys"" worry about whether he potentially recorded them or not...  Why not just record them, come forward with the evidence, and go from there?  Everything he says is rather circumstantial for someone who makes a living by proving things...
This thread is being gamed.

You have to remember that this is only tadpoles. Not humans. He's never suggested it would do that to humans. It's also important to note that no one has been able to reproduce his findings. Was he treated unfair? definitely. To what extent? Who knows. 
California is a double consent state wrt wiretap laws.  He would possibly be committing a crime if he recorded them without their knowledge.
i doubt it
People have differing opinions on a controversial topic and so your ""thread is being gamed""?

The paranoia is strong in this one.

>I didn't get into Cal last year for transfer, but I got into Columbia. I still would prefer Cal. Going to an Ivy I realized it's not where you go to university it's what you do with your time there. Stay active at Davis and Cak will beg you to come there for grad school.(probably not begging, but you get the gist)

I just find it interesting how these types of anti-corporate agriculture articles always attract spirited defenses of such corporations, even on lil' ol' subreddits like ours. 
Good to know.  Thanks.  Possible source?
Wow way to go deep into my history. I sub to this sub because I still live here. It attracts ""spirited defenses"" because people who are interested in agriculture don't like seeing their area of study and by proxy the companies that take part in said area bad mouthed because people want to get their fix of anti-corporate conspiracy. I also have no idea how clarifying that no one is talking about humans when the guy I replied to implies Dr. Hayes was talking about humans was anyway a spirited defense, but to each his own. I even admitted Syngenta has treated him unfairly. I'm not defending them. 
I found [this link](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/california-recording-law) pretty helpful when I was looking this stuff up a while back. 
Perfect.  Thanks!"

He gave an amazing guest lecture on the topic in my Bioethics class a couple of years ago. One of the best lectures I've heard at Cal.
That sucks. He guest lectured for NST 11 when I took it and was really interesting.
Hell ya you watched the new flagrant 2 podcast today?
Isn‚Äôt true that his research has not been replicated
Yup. Pretty neat, right? I mean, he got the details wrong, but still."

Thanks notkmbabua; they were pretty hard. But I think I did well :) hope yours went well

What's most annoying around this time is all the STEM kids complaining about how hard they have it. And I'm like HELLO, try filling up a green book where you deconstruct the patriarchy. And they usually shut up and realize how foolish they are. ü§£"
