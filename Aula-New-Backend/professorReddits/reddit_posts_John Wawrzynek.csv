A sense of pride when something is invented in Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pu77q4/a_sense_of_pride_when_something_is_invented_in/,2021-09-23 16:17:08,"Y'all know when the professor is lecturing about a new research discovery or a cool theorem/algorithm and they say ""This was invented here in Berkeley!""

Most recent example I could think of was when in 61C, John Wawrzynek mentioned that a completely, free instruction set for computers was invented right here. It's kind of an amazing feeling that I never really experienced. Another I can think of was the Berlekemp-Welch Algorithm for sending messages I learned from 70, it was so brilliant, so simple, but it felt so amazing knowing that it was achieved quite literally on the grass I'm standing on. (crispr too! like WTF)

The feeling it kinda engenders is a little nerve wracking ""how will I ever do something like that??? I would've never thought of that in a million years"" and etc, but also something really inspiring. I get to go to a school where people think at a level that is almost unreal; there's no time to wallow and doubt  yourself, too many ideas are bustling and people to talk to which really do have an impact. i literally cannot be happier to say this is the school i go to","While not technically invented, several elements were discovered at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab too.
Reading this made me happy, you are absolutely right!
Taking particle physics and almost every lecture we’re learning about some new Berkeley invention has me 🤩
Today in CS70 when Rao casually said he worked with Miller of the Miller-Rabin Primalty Test and that he’s a nice guy
Berkeley was a key component in the victory over the Nazi’s(: the manhattan project was heavily studied & theorized at Berkeley. Oppenheimer way anybody? Gotta love history(:
some big names in behavioral economics (and i’m sure other branches of econ) are in berkeley, such a great feeling learning from them!
It's not just STEM. 

E.g. *King Leopold's Ghost* is a wonderful and important book - everyone should read it - by a Journalism-school lecturer.
Sometimes I love walking through random parts of campus and buildings thinking about how many genius students and researchers walked the same paths. It's wild to think that I somehow ended up in the same place as them and hopefully I can make even a fraction of an impact they have
Just the kind of post I needed after the shit-storm reddit has been the last couple of days :)
Risc-v is lit
From a townie, raised there last century. Perhaps the following is obvious to you, but I gotta ask.

Are you aware that any “greatest plays in sports history” will list “The Play” from 1982 in the top three? I was in junior high school at the time, on the way home from San Francisco with a friend of mine, and we came across several groups wearing Stanford gear. 

We asked the groups what happened with the game that day (this is pre-internet, mind you), but we couldn’t get a straight answer. At the time, that made absolutely no sense whatsoever. One guy even said to us: “Cal won, but they cheated”. WTF? 

My friend and I are the only two people we know who did not actually attend that game. Dammit.
The Berkeley Software Distribution, which still (through various forks) provides the software that underlies the infrastructure of the internet, macOS/iOS, and more, was created right here on campus. As you mentioned, David Patterson and RISC, which made ARM (the architecture in almost all phones, tablets, and now laptops) possible. The Unabomber. Early work on machine learning. The basic idea of open-source software. This campus is behind it all!
It’s an honor to be among them, even if we’re just lowly students atm 🤩
Check out the university website (: There’s a whole page of life-changing inventions/discoveries that come from Cal
For all the CS and DS folks, the popular open source relational database PostgreSQL was first developed at Berkeley in the early 90s.
Do you know the full form of BSD?
Once again I say, Go Bears!
And for that reason, Berkeley's the only school with an element named after it. Given how difficult it's become to make new elements, that may never change.
Indeed, I took Game Theory with Debreu.
good lord every time we go over the Akerloff lemons situation or the Card minimum wage study!! Such a sense of pride I definitely feel this post
>King Leopold's Ghost

Not sure I'd call it wonderful, maybe powerful or stunning.  Definitely important.  Hochschild has a great heart and a gift for writing about deep truths. One of those great classes you simply must take while you can.
>Debreu.

Would love to hear his take on our current socio-politics..."
