These included enhancing the glade and connecting campus green spaces and making the creek a prominent feature
Are there any more of those cool renderings I've been seeing?
This is awesome, as an alum I’ll definitely be more excited to come back and visit campus with these changes
As someone who graduated 4 years ago, seeing the pictures in the document puts a huge smile in my face.
Did they announce a general ""end"" date for construction?
So, University of Construction at Berkeley for the next five years? It’ll be worth it - plan looks great
I was about to be very upset if RSF wasn't there

When will this be completed by?
There are lots and lots more in the linked document! Lots of fun to check out :)
From what I understand these proposals are all dependent on funding
2050
Decade+
Most campuses usually have construction so yes
Never
So end date: never
Could be a league of years!
Honestly, I feel like constructions in college are not really as messed up as constructions in infrastructure and etc.

When I was at Berkeley I feel like most of the proposed construction projects are done in a reasonable amount of time."
