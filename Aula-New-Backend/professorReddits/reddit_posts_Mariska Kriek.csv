Astro 7A with Mariska Kriek,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3kqbfe/astro_7a_with_mariska_kriek/,2015-09-12 18:03:01,How are the exams for Professor Kriek's Astro 7A class?,"I found the course much easier than the physics undergrad courses (H7A,B,C).  The exam questions are a bit easier than the homework problems.  When I took the class there was no significant curve so make sure to study all the material.  If you understand all the homework problems you should understand all the exam problems
Thank you! This helps a lot. Also, does she provide practice exams because tbp.berkeley.edu doesn't have any. 
Near the time of the exam she either posted practice questions online or the GSI's handed them out in section."
