Nobel laureate Randy Schekman will give 2022 commencement address,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uhrtfg/nobel_laureate_randy_schekman_will_give_2022/,2022-05-03 15:29:31," [https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/04/29/nobel-laureate-randy-schekman-will-give-2022-commencement-address/?utm\_source=Berkeleyan&utm\_campaign=419b8e57cf-berkeleyan&utm\_medium=email&utm\_term=0\_99ee3800d7-419b8e57cf-389846113](https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/04/29/nobel-laureate-randy-schekman-will-give-2022-commencement-address/?utm_source=Berkeleyan&utm_campaign=419b8e57cf-berkeleyan&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_99ee3800d7-419b8e57cf-389846113)

This year’s commencement will also feature a speech from the  soon-to-be-named University Medalist, the top graduating senior from the  Class of 2022. And California State Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) and  Assembly Member Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) will be presented with the  Chancellor’s Citation Award for their efforts in passing legislation to  allow the admission of thousands of Berkeley students this year.

Schekman, a staunch supporter of public schools and universities,  said he hopes to encourage Berkeley graduates to stay engaged with the  UC system even after they leave and to always remember the campus  community they came from.

“I would only hope that they look back and reflect on their time  here,” said Schekman, “and whatever field or profession they pursue,  take full advantage of the opportunities they are given — for  themselves, for the communities they come from, and for the  institutions, like Berkeley, that want them to succeed.”","his address will be the most interesting moiety of the commencement, that's for sure
Haha took me a second to get the joke lol"
