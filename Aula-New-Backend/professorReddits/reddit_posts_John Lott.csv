Math 1B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qgkci1/math_1b/,2021-10-26 17:33:02,any opinions on which professor i should chose? options are John Lott and Sung-jin Oh,"When I asked Paulin, he recommended John Lott since he's more experienced but it seems that a couple ppl here have expressed enthusiasm for Sungjin Oh so I'm not too sure.
Like I‚Äôm someone just trying to get my math reqs done it isn‚Äôt rlly important for med school and I vibed with sung jin oh more so I picked him. The one review on rate my professor hooked me lol
how was his class?
I never took him! I am taking the course next semester I was just comparing his page and rate my professor vs John lott‚Äôs. Sung-jin in my opinion seems more organized and I personally have no strong opinion on the other math professor. I want to go to a class with a professor I feel I will get along with/ will enjoy learning from.
I only picked Lott cuz Paulin recommended him and I heard his exams were easy üíÄ
Did you email him and he told you this? Did he talk abt Lotts teaching style at all?
I heard Sung Jin teaches clearly and fairly so I‚Äôm assume it‚Äôs the same
I'm in the Precalculus essentials pilot program and he asked which professors were teaching math 1b next semester. Out of the two, he recommended Lott but idk how much I should trust him üòÖ
Tbh it‚Äôs your own opinion every professor has their strengths and weaknesses I feel like both are good :) lowkey for me I am just tired of older professors and I‚Äôve never had a younger professor before"
I will be an academic weapon this whole week,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13birhq/i_will_be_an_academic_weapon_this_whole_week/,2023-05-08 01:38:57,I need to learn all of math54 and Data100 in less than 3 days,"![gif](giphy|QMHoU66sBXqqLqYvGO)
if you don‚Äôt know just close your eyes and start row reducing
Sure, that's completely doable!
take this from someone who was you, once upon a time.

don't do this to yourself. your grades will worsen over time. if you can build a habit of consistent study, R&R weeks become actually relaxing, rather than this.

good luck on finals!
bro pls help me with math 54

i haven't gone to any lectures since we got a new prof and i only go to discussion to get 1/15 on my quizzes
I'm in the same boat dude, I stopped paying attention in data100 after the midtermüò≠. What's your plan to study?
Nah this is fr me ü§° gonna do a bunch of past quiz questions for the next 2 days tho, won‚Äôt even bother learning the conceptual stuff
you're not alone king
I haven‚Äôt gone to any lectures at all and I haven‚Äôt gone to any discussions since the week before spring break :‚Äô)

Time to learn everything in 48 hours :P
On Ed they said they‚Äôre having a ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù final so I‚Äôm just planning on knocking off what I already know pre midterm and rip on the other stuff ig though random guessing on the MCQs
John Lott needs to stop it with the T/F questions"
