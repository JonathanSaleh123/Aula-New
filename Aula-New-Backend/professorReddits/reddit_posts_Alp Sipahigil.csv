"EE 105 w/ Alp Sipahigil, Recorded Lectures?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cxmzfs/ee_105_w_alp_sipahigil_recorded_lectures/,2024-05-21 17:13:12,"Hello! I'll be taking EE 105 next semester and was wondering how difficult the class was overall, especially if anyone has any experience w Sipahigil since I believe he hasn't taught 105 before last semester? Also was wondering if lectures were recorded, lec will be in Soda 306 HP Auditorium so I want to assume yes? Thanks!","I took it this semester and yes the lectures were recorded. He's a good professor (attentive and excited), and the course comes with an extremely good reader (covers everything in a lot of depth). The course is really interesting, just had some logistics issues (hmwks having mistakes) here and there (though that may have been because it was his first semester). feel free to pm if you have any more specific questions!
Thank you for the info! Will follow up if I have any more questions üôè"
