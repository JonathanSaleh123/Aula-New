Legalst 138 vs 107,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/158or5y/legalst_138_vs_107/,2023-07-24 15:07:43,"I’m considering adding either Legalst 138 (Supreme Court and Public Policy) or 107 (theories of Justice). The professor for 138 is Kyle Deland, who has no reviews ( I believe he’s a grad student, and this is his first solo instructor class). 107 is w/ Sarah Song.

138 looks very Interesting but I’m hesitant due to the workload I’ve heard it entails w/ memorizing cases, and since it might be a wild card because the professor is new. I know I’ll take 107 eventually since it’ll be for a core requirement, but I heard professor Song is really good and the seats are more competitive to get her courses.

I would appreciate any feedback, especially from students who’ve taken either/ both courses!

Thankssss","138 is pretty easy, no matter who the professor is. I lucked out and got a special guest professor for this course, none other than the Dean of Berkeley Law, Erwin Chemerinsky himself. It was magical. But, regardless of who teaches it, it's about the Supreme Court, so it is modern, relatable, and most importantly - your opinion counts as a correct answer. You will examine the history of the Supreme Court and the most famous/socially impactful decisions of (mostly) the 20th Century, and on exams you can argue for your opinion without worrying about a right or wrong answer. You just have to use the concepts/points of law correctly to argue for your point of view. If you're interested in pursuing law it's kind of an essential course. That being said, I have no idea who this other professor is. I haven't taken Theories of Justice so I can't speak to that.
is law school in your future? always take the class with a predictable professor. a wild card new professor might make your life hell or not, but it’s better to know what you’re getting into. a B/A- could actually be detrimental in the long run, sadly for prelaws
both suck. 138 sucks a little bit less.
How was your experience with Kyle Deland? I am considering taking 138 with him this semester but the average grade on Berkeleytime looks very low.."

Only the Upper Div classes on this list.

Many students recommend his class if it’s your first upper div or just in general since there’s no discussion section, the readings and assignments are light, and he’s very enthusiastic during lectures and definitely a funny character. He usually tries to end lectures 30 minutes early. Recently, he’s also kept his covid semester recordings posted, so you could technically just not show up to class since the information usually doesn’t change too much.
Definitely Kent, he’s super man pretty much

I have a personal soft spot for Prof. Wittenberg (Witty!!!), but I know others feel differently. I took Eastern Europe with him two years ago, easily one of the most informative region-focused classes I've taken. Workload is fairly heavy though, Prof. Wittenberg loves his in-class essay exams.

Prof. Zook is easily the most entertaining and energetic PS prof that I've taken. SE Asia is one of the easier PS classes, but you definitely learn a lot. 10/10 recommend, especially if you're looking for cuisine recommendations lol.

I took Prof Mattes during the Zoom U era. I enjoyed her lectures and she was very responsive and helpful during OH, but the Zoom format made the class organized weirdly. YMMV. 

There are a few profs who I would strongly suggest to avoid, but none of them are here, PM me if you want my negative takes lol. 

&#x200B;

Side Note: Are the course offerings seriously that thin this semester? Why is there only one IR class?
Take anything with Helene Silverberg, Terri Bimes, OR Darren Zook (if you want an interesting class that happens to be the easiest PoliSci course at UC Berkeley)
These are just the classes that are still open! I am making a late change of major to PoliSci and will only be able to enroll in phase two, so I'm taking what I can get.
Seconded for Silverberg
Ahhhh makes sense. Yeah I've sort of been there too. Heck, in two years of UD I never got my first pick of PS classes lol, so you really do get what you can take."
