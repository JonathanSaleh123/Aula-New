Petition to the Music Department to create more Music and Technology courses (from the STEM point of view),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1conhr/petition_to_the_music_department_to_create_more/,2013-04-19 09:58:07,"This is really directed toward Cal students, so sorry for being uninclusive if you live here but don't go to school here.

Hi fellow students,

Music 158 is a class that teaches students to use the Max/MSP programming environment to write programs that have to do with music and audio. I know that many of you are musical and possibly interested in creating software that deals with music in some way. (You do not have to be good at computer science to take the course -- it is a music course, after all, and people are allowed to focus on music or CS or both.)

However, the class offering is very small (35 students), and by this point in telebears, it is already full. I've been talking to Professor Campion, who is one of the professors that teaches Music 158, in an attempt to expand the class. (I have also been coordinating with the L&S CS scheduler, the L&S CS undergraduate advisor, and the Music undergraduate advisor). Professor Campion told me that he would love to increase the offering of music and technology courses, but he needs to show student support for more such courses: with support, he can argue that the department needs to offer more courses and also needs to hire more faculty that are capable of teaching such courses (this is the bigger need). He asked me to create a petition of sorts saying so, and told me he would sign on to such a petition. So I have written the following:

Dear Benjamin Brinner (Music Department Chair),

We are interested in taking music and technology courses, but there aren't very many of them. Many of us are not music majors; some of us are music minors. The class Music 158 is offered, but we would like to take more classes in music and technology, and see a wider variety of classes offered in this vein. We would also like to see classes with a larger capacity (currently Music 158 can only support 35 students a semester). We undersigned students would support and take such classes.

If you are interested in your name and ID number appearing on the petition, please send it to me at music158petition@gmail.com . I promise I won't use it for any purpose other than this petition.

If you are graduating and still want to endorse this, let me know. A woman who graduated with a PhD in 2010 asked to endorse it, and I added a section for her called ""with support from"". You don't need to provide your ID number if you are graduating and want to endorse the petition.

Regardless of whether you are interested, please consider sending this to your friends who you think would be interested in signing this.  I know that there are a lot of us, and it would mean very much to have course offerings that better reflect our interests.

Best,

Lawrence (Jack) Atherton, CS '15

(I created a new account to post this so that my other accounts would remain anonymous.)","Best of luck to you on this.  I graduated way back in the dinosaur age of 2003 in music, and I can tell you that this music class did *not* exist.  The Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) existed, but us undergrads at the time could not take any of their classes since it was always filled with grad students and science/tech people.  It is good to see the department expanding and evolving.


Definitely backing this. I became interested in electrical engineering via music-tech-stuff, and I'd love to see more people getting involved. I am taking 158 in the fall, hopefully you can get in as well!"
