Shaq 100%, Cuban is definitely the best technical choice but imagine telling people Shaq spoke at your commencement ceremony?
Why are so many from Shark Tank? And why so many sports players? Are these really the only people available for a commencement speech?
Steven Curry for the clout.
Steph wtf
Shaq
Can this weak ass school get lebron on there??
Wait, I‚Äôm a rising senior but I haven‚Äôt gotten this email.
Jennifer Garner is so random lmao.  Also, fuck Kevin O'Leary.
1) Eric Schmidt

2) Mark Cuban

3) Steph Curry
why is everyone glazing mark cuban so much jeez louise
i like how no one has said Chris Pine so far LMAO
[deleted]
Are we already forgetting about Kevin O Leary‚Äôs enthusiastic participation in the FTX clusterfuck?
Eric schmidt or you dumb
Shark tank is so cringe
Alex morgannnnnn yal wild for mark cuban. I want an athlete who cares about business bro. We could here some dope stories from athletes that got the mental game on lock in the industry.
Majorie Taylor Green
STEPH STEPH
Where do u even vote
Why no Guy Fieri?
Cuban, the Ayn Rand fanboy?   What is wrong with you‚Ä¶really?   Shark Tank?
Eric Schmidt obviously is the best option but all the zoomers here will probably choose Cuban. Embarrassing and incredibly depressing how far that generation has fallen.
Shaq for sure
Nah I think shaq would be best
is none of the above an option? this commencement would literally just be capitalist propaganda üò≠. but if i had to choose i‚Äôd go with shaq or steve kerr
„Öì
cuban would be really cool so everyone can clown the mavs. shaq would also be really dope.
Wait, are all of them Berkeley grads?
Mark

Steve Kerr or Stephen curry
shaq, Steph, or Mark cuban
Did jennifer garner go to cal? Lol
Immediately voted for cuban
Yoooooo that‚Äôd be the bomb
Cillian Murphy
Yeh, that's what I think too. Like, the clout would be insane getting to name drop shaq
don't care
[deleted]
my thoughts exactly. honestly kinda depressing that all are either business or sports related.
For me it was in my personal email not my Berkeley email. Idk if you‚Äôve check there or it could be in your spam folder
this, except shaq for curry (bro has literally become a festival dj i want to hear him speak)
only arts person on there. christ that‚Äôs fucked up.
agreed
Would fit well with FTX being the sponsor on the field at Memorial
the billionaire doesn't care about business?
We got an email from Senior Class Council titled ‚ÄúCommencement Speaker Survey‚Äù
Bruh capitalist propaganda?üòÇüòÇ
kyrie is curry's dad
No only the ones that say ‚Äúalum‚Äù
He was the recent commencement speaker for the English department back in May!
nah u gotta look more into shaq and how he‚Äôs built businesses and invested his money. his influence goes way beyond the basketball court
It wasn‚Äôt anywhere in my emails (both personal and Berkeley)
Ok makes sense! Totally missed it"
Fed up with the strike? Support the strike? Email leadership,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yxe6x3/fed_up_with_the_strike_support_the_strike_email/,2022-11-16 18:40:37,"As the university‚Äôs customers, the most powerful action you can take is directly telling them you‚Äôre unsatisfied. Right now the university thinks that they can wait out the strike and instruction will continue as usual. We‚Äôve even heard department chairs say ""everything is running fine without the striking GSIs and postdocs."" Students need to tell them that the way things are right now isn‚Äôt normal and can‚Äôt go on. Please email your department chairs and deans telling them that your education is being disrupted. Ask them to pressure the university to bargain fairly now and end the strike. Tell your friends to do the same.

**A list of people to email**:

* The [chair of your academic department](https://apo.berkeley.edu/quick-links/chairs-deans) (you can look up their email on their website if it isn‚Äôt linked)
* Jennifer Johnson-Hanks, Executive Dean, College of Letters & Science: [ug\_dean@berkeley.edu](mailto:ug_dean@berkeley.edu)
* Sunny Lee, Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean of Students, [deanofstudents@berkeley.edu](mailto:deanofstudents@berkeley.edu)","I wouldn‚Äôt email profs or department chairs ‚Äî they have severely limited power in this process and might not pass on your concerns or feelings or emails to whoever really makes decisions. Go straight to the administration. Deans and assistant deans and chancellors ‚Ä¶ excellent.
I‚Äôll email them after winter break if they don‚Äôt have my grades by then. But for now, I‚Äôm taking a long break and watch the saga unfold from my couch.
noooo. keep the strike going until finals so we can get p/np.

/s but also not /s
This isn't going to do anything our emails will bounce
One person walking around at Sather gate shouting picket chants also doesn‚Äôt do anything. 100? 200? More? Sends a message. We also want to shut this campus down, and that includes their inboxes
Yk what, you're right"
