What is Cal like for chem students?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1biphq1/what_is_cal_like_for_chem_students/,2024-03-19 10:11:04,"I heard it’s the best campus for chem students but I want to know more than just that! I’m transferring from a small community college and I want to know all the good and bad parts of UCB to make my decision a bit easier, I want to know what life is like there, what to beware of either as a chem or non-chem student, I want details that the staff or social media posts won’t give me","First year chem major here! The college of chemistry definitely seems to be more of a community than some of the bigger colleges (like L and S). There’s only about 300 people in each year and the course schedule is pretty rigid so you end up taking the same classes as most of the other chem majors in your year. Though I haven’t gotten into it yet, there seems to be a lot of opportunities for research here and some upper classmen even become UGSIs. I also feel like the lab work we do here is pretty advanced and there’s a good amount of resources available. 

Now, as for my personal experience, I’ll say it has definitely been challenging. I have a strong love for chemistry but sometimes this school does test that lol. The course load is pretty difficult, but there are lots of resources available (peer tutoring center, GSIs office hours, professor office hours). The thing that helped me most was finding chem major friends and studying/ doing homework together (it worked really well for us because we also all live on the same floor of our res hall!). I would also like to throw in that some of the professors are MUCH better than others, and most of the time there’s only one time slot for chem classes so you’re basically stuck with whichever professor you get. 

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I went to an easier school but I know there’s opportunities available to me at Berkeley that I wouldn’t get anywhere else. I hope this helps answer your question and if you want to know anything else about campus life feel free to reach out to me!
Depends. I was chem e and met some great people here. CoC has helped me get some pretty good opportunities and I was employed immediately after graduation.
The classes are pretty rough. The chem department itself is absolutely HORRID at managing the logistics behind classes and is pretty severely underfunded. The chem eng classes that I took were pretty hit or miss - I had some phenomenal professors and I had some awful professors.
I’m chem bio in the Coc. I think chemistry is a hard subject but there’s a lot of support from professors, GSIs, friends, ect. especially because it is a smaller college. I feel like I’ve been well prepared to go to grad school or industry. Theres also a lot of opportunities for research, even if it’s competitive to get some. 

Overall I think it’s rigorous (for me personally) but a good experience and can definitely find a sense of community if you want it.
pretty fun
Horrible

To give you a perspective, the graduate students in the chemistry department have the lowest pay
This is very helpful!! Thank you so much, I have about a year but this is the best time to prepare and this gives some good details on how it can be as a chem major (I had a friend who is a philosophy major and he says how it’s a breeze to go there, but I couldn’t take his word for it thanks to his major!)
That feels strange, I’ll still think about it but the thought that chem students going to the best chem program in the country (from what I’ve heard) being paid poorly is mind boggling
Happy to help! And haha yeah I would say your Major definitely dictates how difficult your time here at cal is (and that’s not to dog on any certain majors because everything’s important in its own right). Let me know if you have any other questions:)
It most certainly is not the best chemistry program in the world.

Especially considering we lost John Kuriyan…

Also Berkeley as a whole scks"
