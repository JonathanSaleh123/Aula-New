Tragedy has struck Berkeley…,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ohgen/tragedy_has_struck_berkeley/,2023-05-21 22:25:02,"It is with deep regret that I inform you all that today, at approximately 9:30 PM PDT, prominent(and incredibly sexy) r/Berkeley shitposter u/Cal_Aesthetics_Club has been found alive and well at his residence.

Authorities have determined the cause of life to be birth via c-section and, although the investigation is ongoing, no foul play is suspected at this time. Police were en route to notify u/Cal_Aesthetics_Club ‘s kin and spouse Oski of the tragedy only to discover that they(with the exception of Oski) were already residing in the same house that he was found in and were aware of him being alive.

Suffice it to say, his family has been deeply impacted by the tragedy. “I don’t see what the issue is if he’s alive and well…”, said his mom, appearing perplexed. “I don’t even know him and why did he say I was his spouse?!?!?!,” exclaimed Oski, also very much perplexed. “The shit’s still alive?? Goddammit!,” said his little brother, crying tears of frustration and sadness.

In the words of police spokesman rcinvestments, “Ayo this is an unprecedented disaster of epic proportions with no comparison, with the exception of maybe the death of Harambe. That gorilla was just chill like that, you know?”.

Both President Biden and Vice President Harris have been notified of the tragedy and have cancelled their planned trip to Wakanda, accordingly. In lieu of that, they will be flying to Berkeley to console the city’s grieving residents and offer light in a time of darkness. When asked for comment, President Biden replied, “I, as President, swear to solemnly uphold my duty and ensure that such a catastrophe never occurs agai-Oh look! A squirrel!”

Other political figures have also weighed in with their opinions: Former US President Donald Trump tweeted, “Shit like only happens in Biden’s America! When I become President, I’m going make America white…err…umm…I mean great!…again…”.

Additionally, leaders from around the world have offered their condolences in unique ways: “If you want, I could make him disappear! But remove those semiconductor sanctions, first!”, said President Xi Jinping. “I, too, can do that! Just undo all the Ukraine sanctions!”, exclaimed President Vladimir Putin. “ “I, three, can do that, if you reinstate the 2015 nuclear deal!” said the Supreme Leader of Iran. “I don’t even know what’s going on but, if you piss me off, I will send nudes…uhhh…I mean nukes!”, threatened Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.","man has too much time

The HONEST guide to Economics @ cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16s03zd/the_honest_guide_to_economics_cal/,2023-09-25 11:38:04,"EDIT: I graduated Winter 2023. GPA 3.6 - Reivising some stuff so it isn't as ranty and adding insight to the classes I marked as in progress originally  
  
I know there's already a [very good guide on a lot of the Econ classes here on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mgwgnc/comprehensive_guide_to_econ_upper_divs/)  - and I'll say it right now, if you're looking for more info on a lot of econ classes, that guide will work way better for you.

The gist of this guide is to give you the information: What classes are easy? What classes are hard? In the final sems of uni I needed to load up on exclusively Econ classes and I was really nervous since I didn't know if I was loading up on 4 hell-on-earth classes or not. Unfortunately there was no info on the internet so I was going in blind. Ratemyprofessor is useful until you realize every econ professor is rated shit - some deservedly, most not. So here's the info I wish I had:

Here are all the Econ classes I took at cal:

**PREREQUISTIES/lowerdivs:** Math 1B, Stat 20, Econ 100A, Econ 100B, Econ 140, Econ 2

**Upper divs:** Econ 139, 155, 119, 121, 130, 139, C110

**PREREQUISITES:** --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Math 1B: Calculus (Paulin)` - As someone who *just* passed the Calc BC exam coming into Cal, I thought it would be a breeze. **It was not a breeze**. Luckily Paulin is probably one of the best professors I've ever had and one of the most understanding/forgiving. He forgave the lowest 2-3 quizzes, the lowest 1-2 hw assignments, and even pushed back the midterm date because of the elections that were happening.

* **TLDR -** Super chill guy teaching a very hard class, though keep in mind this was in COVID so who knows what happened.

`Stat 20: Intro to stats (Ibser)` - Stat 20 wasn't particularly hard - it's statistics, and you either love it or hate it. Ibser as a professor seemed like a chill guy irl but was the most disorganized professor I had ever seen. Maybe it was COVID so things got better when it was back in person but OH's weren't really helpful and the homework barely matched what was on the slides. There was R too! But he barely taught us how to use it.

* **TLDR -** It's standard stats, with an assumption you know R (why??), and a professor who's disorganized.

`Econ 2: Intro to Econ (The romers)` *-* The Romers are now officially retired and are Professor Emeriti. But if you want to know what they were like (or in case they decide to pop their heads in) - they're one of the best professor(s) that taught Econ I've ever had. Both their resumes are wildly loaded (One was an econ advisor to Obama and the other on the IMF) and they pretty much are an old couple who's seen everything and wants to share their love of Econ with the little kiddos to hopefully inspire them into their field. The rare case of someone who's smart AND good at teaching. I wish they didn't retire.

* **TLDR -** They're retired. But they're great! But they're retired.

`Econ 100A: Micro (Campbell)` *-* He's one of the few econ professors that has stellar ratings and he deserves them. Microeconomics is a tricky subject but he managed to tie it all together by teaching concepts through simplified examples and stories. It's evident he **REALLY** wants you to actually *learn,* which means if you want to learn, that's great! If you want to BS this class, it will not work. This is evident by the 3 midterms (one the week before deadweek) that are all math and the final which is 2 essays and has nothing to do with the math before. It can be challenging (and I definitely got extremely lucky since the GSI strike wiped out the 3rd mt and made the final graded on completion LOL) but you can honestly get by with a few hours and doing the entire course pack and not going to lecture at all if you wanted to do that

* **TLDR -** A great guy, a great professor, teaching a topic that's challenging. He gives you a course pack which could honestly substitute section, lecture, and OHs if you're really smart. tbh I'd get a beer with this dude

`Econ 100B: Macro (Hawkins)` *-* As with most of the econ professors he seems like a great guy. Apparently in other years he was a great professor as well! But for some reason I didn't get that experience - maybe it was coming out of COVID and he was still tired. I tried to sit through a few of his lectures but almost fell asleep. The GSIs taught better than him and honestly there is no need to go to lecture beyond reading the slides (which is what he does in class) and going to section. Take a step back and know where all the concepts slot in and you'll be golden - they all interrelate to each other.

* **TLDR -** Good professor (allegedly), not such a great professor (anecdotally). Has a lot of wall street stories (allegedly), his voice puts me to sleep (anecdotally). Class is hard if you lose the trees for the forest, and becomes a whole hell of a lot easier if you take a step back.

`Econ 140: Econometrics (Faber)` - Man what the fuck can he **STOP TALKING SO FAST????** Metrics is a statistics with empirical stuff in R primarily (tho u can use stata or python) but the R instruction is lacking. The homework is graded strictly but the questions are *just vague enough* so it causes confusion and keeps you up 5 hours working with other people as you all argue trying to figure out what it actually wants (true story). GSIs and OHs were helpful though but Faber talks in a way that makes the class harder than it actually is since he talks equations in purely mathematical terms (ie instead of Y = a + beta(xi)+ error he'll say the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variable is affected by a slope coefficient point estimate along with a residual and a constant). Reading that might seem easy to understand but trust me when it gets more complicated and he's talking at 1000mph you're gonna have an experience where you space out for one second and you don't know where in the lecture you are (also true story)

* **TLDR -** Hetalksfastlikereallyfastandtalksinalotofmathetmaticaltermsinfactit'sexactlylikeyou'rereadingthissentenceyouneedtokeepupallthetimeorelseyou'llmisswhathe'stalkingaboutalsowhocantellmewhythepointestimateslopecoefficentthat'sgiventousbyanOLSregressioncouldalsobeafunctionoftheresidualterm and yeah anyways you get my point

**UPPER DIVS** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Econ 119: Psych and Econ (Taubinsky)` - I dropped this class. It's an interesting class but it is **MATHY**. And what's worse is lecture doesn't actually cover how to do the math, it says ""oh the math exists"" and then goes on to cover a lot of irrelevant (but interesting!) examples on the application of Psych and Econ. It's a unique class definitely, I just wish he would actually go over the math in depth. Go to section! The sections help.

* **TLDR -** Interesting mathy class taught by a professor that expects you to do all the math but doesn't actually teach you how to do the math. You must go to section or else you will be perpetually lost

`Econ 121: Industrial Organization + Public Policy (Barahona)` *-* The class I *wish* I could drop. Lectures aren't recorded, though the lectures are pretty unhelpful since it's another one of those ""here's a bunch of interesting math"" and none of it is used on actual tests/hw, though unlike Econ 119, it's hard not because he doesn't go into depth on the math, but he goes way too far into depth on math that is not even used so you get confused on what you need to actually know. This is also the first instance where I went to an OH and the GSI **refused to answer questions about the problem set**. Again, sections are important - go to them. They cover problems very similar to the psets

* **TLDR -** Another interesting (mathy) class taught by a professor who expects you to do all the math once you figure out what math you actually need to use (by going to section) out of the super complicated equations he puts on the lecture slides which he doesn't record. Go to section. GSI OHs vary greatly

`Econ 130: Econ and public policy (Lafortune)` - Chill guy! Chill class. Honestly felt like easy mode and it was interesting to see how all the stuff I learned was applied to the real world. The one thing is that he takes attendance via iclickr, which uses geopositioning on your device to check whether you're in class or not, and attendance in lecture and section is worth 6% of your grade (if you go to over 50% of them). The only math is regression and some very light econ 140 stuff, which if you are in the major is pretty much 20% of the class being redundant

`Econ C110: Game Theory (Kariv)` - Chill guy, chill class. Talks slowly, the class goes from 6:30 - 9:30 **PM** this sem (???) but the content seems easy enough. Unfortunately I had to drop this class because of skydeck, but I would've totally stuck with it if I didn't need to.

`Econ 126: China (Roland)` - one of the few 3 unit econ upper div classes. Chill professor, chill class. More of a history class than an econ class tbh, which is heaven for people who don't like math and hell for people who do. There are no sections for this class. Be warned that this is one those classes where there are very few things that comprise your grade. At the end of it all my final was worth 80% of my grade (missed the mt so the 30% mt was rolled into the 50% final). Final was 20 questions and 4 essays, which meant that each mcq was 2% of my total grade and each essay 10%. There's bcourses quizzes which are 3 questions each, each quiz 5% of your final grade.

**UPPER DIVS (DONE):** ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Econ 139: Asset Pricing and Portfolio management (Bianchi)` - Econ 139 is the harder version of Econ 136, but you wouldn't know that unless someone told you (true story). I went into this class thinking it would be something about how assets are priced and managing a well diversified portfolio. Which is what it was - but it's not about how to build and manage your own portfolio, it's about building and managing a theoretical ***everyone's portfolio.*** AKA it's quantative analysis with stochastic calc (calc with time) and risk across time - basically theoretical financial economics and hard microeconomics stuck together which made this by and away **THE HARDEST CLASS I TOOK AT CAL**. If you're good at theoretical math then by all means, but if you're in the majority I say **STAY AWAY** unless you're really really really interested and want to become a quant. Though if you wanted to become a quant you should be a math/stats major... not an econ major. Bianchi's lectures are boring and extremely hard to keep up with because of the scattershot way the content is organized - they're not organized compartmentally and for the first half of the sem we weren't doing anything with asset pricing **OR** portfolio management which made me question why I was in the class in the first place. CAPM appears like halfway through the course. HW is on completion but is unbelievably hard and the mt and final are the same. The one saving grace though is that the curve is **ridiculous**. I'm not sure if it was just my class but at the end of the class he said that everyone who turned in homework would be guaranteed a B in the class no matter how they did because **that's just how lost everyone was**

* **TLDR -** The hardest class I took at Berkeley. It's quantative analysis with a bunch of theoretical financial math and hard microeconomics. Equations everywhere. Equations within equations. Equations within equations within equations. Seemingly no relation between any of the lectures. Everyone is lost - which means that the curve is great. Bianchi guaranteed everyone at least a B- no matter how they did. One of my friends literally got a panic attack and had to leave the final, got a 0, skipped the midterm, submitted all the homeworks: got the B because of the guarantee. It's a mess. You'll get a decent grade because it's a mess, but you'll feel like shit the whole way through

`Econ 155: Urban economics (Nilopa)` - The *other* 3 unit econ class that I took. Nilopa was a new professor on tenure (I think) so she might not be teaching it anymore and we might never see her again, but for what it's worth she was on par with Campbell with how she taught the course material (without the 3 mts). Easy to understand, goes to absurd lengths to make sure that the course content is so. And the content isn't particularly hard either

-------------------------

So there you have it. Feel free to leave your own honest thoughts too! The more information the better\~","""As with most of the econ professors he seems like a great guy but he is evidently a researcher and not a teacher. ""  


Funny enough Hawkins is indeed a teacher but not a researcher lol
didn’t read but awesome 😼
I'm just going to add on thoughts as a Econ bear from 2016-2020:

\- Berkeley Econ seems to have gotten more specialized and added courses where there were previously gaps in content offerings. Courses like Econ 148 (Data Science for Econ), Econ 139 (Asset Pricing and Portfolio Choice), Econ 144 (Empirical Asset Pricing), Econ 165 (Money and Banking), Econ 127 (Antitrust Economics), and Econ 130 (Using Economics for Public Policy) appear to not have existed until 2021/2022. Take advantage of this specialization to take courses you are interested in. 

\- Berkeley Econ also has hired a slew of new professors (and lecturers) since 2020 who will change the future experience of these courses. \[These new-ish professors are Profs. Valenzuela-Stookey, Semenova, Munoz, Lian, Hermalin, Goldberg, Echenique, Caldwell, Barahona, and Backus\]

\- I was able to double major in Economics and Data Science (as the third batch of students ever, before it exploded in popularity and well before CDSS was formed). I don't think this is possible for most future students since there are restrictions on enrolling in high demand majors.

*Stat 20- Intro Stats (Prof. Sanchez), Spring 2017:* This class was not remarkable other than the group of frat guys that showed up drunk to every Friday afternoon lecture. Just basic statistics that you may have seen in AP Stats already. This course just checked a pre-req box. If you can check this box in another way, you should do it with another course. 

*Econ 2- Intro Econ (Profs. Romer), Spring 2017:* This course was well taught and should be the intro course you take if you want to major in econ instead of Econ 1. However, both **Profs. Romer** appear to have taken **emeritus status and have retired**. This means that future students won't be able to take Econ 2 or Econ 134 (Macro Policy from the Great Depression to Today) from them. 

*Econ 100A- Intro Micro (Prof. Carson), Summer 2017:* I took intro micro after my freshman year. This course was nothing special, just a box to check. I liked the class, I got along well with this professor (who only taught in the summer), but others did not like the course or the professor. **Your mileage may vary.** 

*Econ 101B- Intro Macro (Math), Fall 2017 (Prof. Sergeyev):* The more math intensive macro was fine with Math 1A/1B level calculus. I learned a lot about macro and it prepared me well for later macro sequences. This class was curved generously, but don't expect that normally: Prof. Sergeyev was visiting from 2017-18 and went back to his home university (Bocconi in Milan). \[Side note: This professor was the most fit/jacked prof I have ever seen.\]

*Econ 121- Industrial Organization, Fall 2018 (Prof. Kawai):* Industrial Organization should be an interesting course since you're trying to understand how economies and businesses are structured. However, this class was BS with this professor. The course was way too easy (except for the Final Exam which was intentionally difficult just to set a curve for the class), you didn't feel like you were learning much, the professor/GSIs didn't seem to be putting in effort \[one time I went to the prof's office hours and he told me I was the only one who had appeared for the whole semester....\], and everyone (including the students) were just going through the motions and checking boxes. **Your mileage will be better with a different professor.** Prof. Kawai also appears to be moving back to his native Japan and the University of Tokyo as of Fall 2023, so you may not have to take courses from him in future.

*Econ 136 - Financial Economics, Spring 2018 (Prof. Hawkins):* This was a great course. I took it Spring 2018, and I was engaged the whole time (and it showed with lecture attendance always being high). This is the course you should take from Prof. Hawkins, since he lived it for decades on Wall Street \[his last job before going to academia was at Countrywide Mortgage running risk management and trading for subprime mortgage debt....before it spectacularly collapsed in 2008\]. 

*Econ 141 - Econometrics (Math), Spring 2018 (Prof. Pouzo):* This is the theoretical/math intensive version of intro to econometrics. You should take it if you have interest in econ research/phd track or if you like math. The course itself was well run and the material was good. Two of my TA's from that class are now rising professors in Europe. (I took this class too early before I took discrete math or any kind of proof-based math and got my ass kicked.)

*Econ C142 - Applied Econometrics, Spring 2020 (Prof. Card):* This course was a masterclass because of who taught it and when I took it (when I had complete mathematical maturity and 3 years of econ under my belt). You will understand econometrics much better after this course and you will actually have powerful tools for applied economic research after this course. However, **Prof. Card** also took **emeritus status** after 2022, so you won't be able to take courses from him. This course also appears to have been replaced with *Econ 143 (Econometrics: Advanced Methods)* as the follow-on econometrics course after 140 or 141. 

*Econ 152 - Wage Theory, Spring 2019 (Prof. Walters):* I really enjoyed this course because I was interested in labor markets and how they function. Prof. Walters is also a leading researcher in this area and made the class interesting as well. 

*Econ C181 - International Trade, Spring 2018 (Prof. Fally):* If you have an interest in learning how trade works or understanding international economics this is a good place to start. This professor was not the best though in the sense that I didn't find his lectures that engaging and the exams that he wrote were more than a couple of levels harder than what he taught or what you saw in homework. He also accepted this lack of engagement and low lecture attendance, which I did not like. Nice guy, but **your mileage will be better with a different professor.** 

*Econ 191 - Economic Research, Fall 2019 (Prof. Eichengreen):* This is the course where you are supposed to write a full-length econ research paper over the course of the semester that can then become your senior honors thesis in your final semester. The lectures themselves are mostly seminars from outside researchers/profs who come and talk about their research and give advice, alongside some crash courses about how to do research/basic programming stuff \[this may have changed\]. I enjoyed it because I came up with a cool, researchable idea about labor unions to write about along with a clear empirical strategy, but others struggled because they couldn't come up with a topic. **Your mileage may vary.** 

Funny side note: Econ 191 was where I had the most bizarre exam at Cal. The professor asked us to read a bunch of papers from the seminar speakers, himself, and other selected papers, and then take an exam where you would write essays evaluating papers or answer open ended questions from a list that you picked from about the papers or overarching topics. It ended up being farcical because the professor allowed students on exam day to bring in with them an unlimited amount of papers printed out of any kind to use for the exam. What ended up happening is that everyone (including myself) printed out copies of all of the papers verbatim as well as any summaries/notes that we had written about them, or review/commentary/response reports that other people/researchers had written about them. You can imagine what it looked like with people bringing binders/bags/bins full of papers to a lecture hall with \~100 people in it was like.
I don't think is fair to say that Hawkins just reads the slides. He tells a lot of anecdotes about his time in Wall Street and will tie what you are learning to events in the real world. However, if your objective is just to get a good grade and get out you probably are fine missing the lecture and just reading the slides and going to section.
Does Econ 155 have math?
Take Ryan Edwards’ econ classes, and you can thank me later!
Can someone pls do this for CS + DS?

Sincerely,

A very confused and struggling golden bear :(
fairly great guide but half of your course reviews are just unsubstantiated opinions with zero examples or insights
What semester did you take 139? Took it Fall 2022 and it wasn't too bad
This is so perfect as an Econ major, ty!
Can anyone who took Econ 155 with Nilopa Shah provide their thoughts on the course? Also, if anyone has the syllabus, it would be super helpful!
ok now this is news to me LOL
Definitely true
Yes - a little bit. As with econ classes a lot of is simple math but its really how to apply it. Also it depends on the prof heavily and I can't speak on anyone outside of Nilopa
do u think u need to have taken econ 100A before to succeed in econ 155?
I took it Spring 2023 and it was crazy.. maybe you're just really smart ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
hi! did u end up taking 155 with Nilopa? If so, how has it been?
hawkins basically walked off wall street into a professorship here lol. i've taken a bunch of classes with him and he always brings up his backstory in the first lecture. he was great for 136 for this reason
He was a physicist by training, if I'm not mistaken, but then AFAIK right off of his phd he went to work in finance. Worked in finance for 20 and something years and then 2008 hit. He then became a lecturer here. So he never was a researcher in econ.  


FYI, whenever someone is listed as a lecturer, that means Berkeley is not paying to do research (which in most cases implies that they do not do research)
For some reason when I took 100B with him he never actually brought that up, just went straight to slides. Maybe it was just coming out of COVID or something"

VI.

The Monterey sun, a white disc burning through the coastal haze, glinted off the chrome of the waiting car as Jack and Nick disembarked from the plane. Jack squinted at it, the brightness mirroring the knot of worry tightening in his gut. Nick, beside him, stood stiff as a marlin gaffed but not yet brought to heel. The crisp ocean air whipped at their faces, a salty reminder of the legendary Stoney Beach course that awaited.

Jack watched Nick closely. His uncle, usually a man as steady as a seasoned captain navigating familiar waters, seemed oddly on edge. Their flight had been smooth, the taxi ride efficient, yet the usual shuttle was absent. Instead, a sleek black shadow detached itself from the curb, a predator closing in.

Chris. His smile, usually as wide as the Pacific itself, was strained, a hooked fish fighting the line.

""Hey, guys,"" Chris said, his voice too loud in the stillness. ""Welcome to Monterey! Figured I'd surprise you and give you a lift.""

Jack raised an eyebrow, suspicion prickling at his skin. Chris, ever the meticulous planner, wouldn't be here by chance. Their surprise – a round of golf at Stoney Beach meant to mend fences – was starting to feel… surprised upon.

""Rooms are booked, tee times secured – the whole shebang,"" Chris continued, popping the trunk.  Inside, alongside Nick's own well-worn bag, sat a  pristine golf bag and a new pair of shoes.

""Remember your size, cuz?"" Chris said, a hint of his usual playful smirk returning.

Jack couldn't help but offer a wry smile. Chris never forgot the details, especially when it came to Jack's shoe size.  But the warmth of the gesture couldn't erase the growing suspicion.  Chris wouldn't be going to these lengths for a round of golf – not unless their startup was facing a tempestuous sea.

""Nick asked me to be his caddy,"" Jack revealed, his gaze meeting his uncle's, a silent understanding passing between them.  This wasn't just about golf anymore.  This round, it seemed, held the fate of their business ventures – and maybe even their fractured relationship.  A tight smile played on Jack's lips.  ""Let's just say,"" he drawled, hoisting Nick's bag onto his shoulder, ""I know all the sharks hiding in these waters.""

VII.

Quickly they piled into the car, the weight of the situation settled over them. Chris, sensing the tension, put the car in gear and pulled out smoothly. Jack stole a glance at Nick's clubs resting in the backseat. Memories flickered – childhood rounds together, their first shared victories, and the quiet companionship forged on the course.

""Mind if I take a peek at your clubs, Uncle Nick?""

Jack carefully lifted the bag and unzipped it, running a practiced eye over the familiar set. He traced the worn leather grips, the slight bend in the driver, the gaps in the irons. These weren't just clubs; they were an extension of Nick, a record of countless rounds played and battles won.

Before long, they sped down the coastal highway, the rhythmic hum of the car blending with the ocean's roar, Jack formulated a plan. He knew Stoney Beach well – every tricky wind shift, every hidden hazard, every green that sloped like a treacherous mountainside.  With each passing mile, Jack mentally mapped out Nick's shots, selecting the club that would best suit the upcoming terrain.  This wasn't just about winning a game; it was about giving Nick the confidence and support he needed to navigate the metaphorical course ahead.

A silent pact formed between them, a bond reforged in the face of a challenge. Taking a deep breath, Jack knew it was time to tee off.

VIII.

As they approached the 14th tee box, the legendary par-5 that snaked along the California coastline, a reverence settled over them. This wasn't just any hole; it was a notorious beast, a reputation solidified by its unforgiving dogleg right, relentless ocean winds whipping in from the left, and strategically placed hazards that could swallow even the most precise shots. A group of venture capitalists were finishing up here, adding another layer of pressure to the already daunting challenge.

Nick gripped his driver, his knuckles white. The weight of the potential investors and the hole's infamy weighed heavily on him. Even for seasoned pros, par on 14 was a badge of honor, a testament to both skill and a bit of luck.

Jack clapped Nick on the shoulder, his voice calm despite the challenge. ""Alright, Uncle Nick, listen up. This is a hole that humbles even the best. We can play it safe and focus on securing a par, but there's also a chance to make a statement.""

Nick's eyes narrowed, a flicker of competitive spirit battling with the caution the hole demanded. ""You got a plan, Jack?""

Jack calmly outlined a daring strategy. ""The wind is a beast today, pushing from left to right. We could lay up with a three-wood off the tee, but that leaves a long approach shot with the ocean breeze potentially messing things up. Here's the gamble: we go for the green in two, but it requires a precise tee shot.""

Nick's competitive spirit flared. ""High risk, high reward, huh?""

""Exactly,"" Jack confirmed. ""We need to clear the dogleg right and avoid any potential hazards lurking just beyond the corner. But that's not all. The real challenge is the green. It's tiny, elevated, and slopes precariously to the left, right by the trees. If we miss the green on the right, it's a guaranteed chip out and a tricky uphill putt. But if we land it on the green, even if it's towards the left side, we have a fighting chance for birdie.""

Nick took a deep breath, the weight of Jack's words settling in. He trusted Jack's judgment. They had conquered tough courses together before.

He gripped the driver, visualizing the perfect shot – a high, powerful draw that would cut through the wind, hug the dogleg right, and leave them in prime position for their second shot. Ideally, finding a good lie on the fairway for the long approach to the elevated green.

With a powerful swing, Nick unleashed the ball. It soared through the air, defying the wind's pull, and curved slightly to the right, just as planned. It cleared the dogleg with a comfortable margin and avoided any potential hazards. A collective gasp escaped the group of venture capitalists watching from the green. They had witnessed a daring shot that promised a strong start on this demanding par-5.

The ball continued its impressive flight, carrying a good distance down the fairway. It wouldn't reach the green in one shot, but that was never the plan. It landed smack dab in the middle, just a few yards short, offering a clear path for the crucial second shot.

Nick let out a sigh of relief, a mixture of adrenaline and accomplishment coursing through him. He now faced a challenging uphill lie, but the fairway offered a clean path to attack the green. He turned to Jack with a wide grin, a silent ""I did it!"" radiating from him. Jack simply returned a wide smile, his course management instincts not only surviving the treacherous 14th but also making a statement in front of the potential investors.

IX.

While they walked the course, a familiar prickle of awareness tickled the back of Jack's neck every time Nick finished his tee shot. He'd glance around subtly, searching the tree lines and brush for a flash of movement. This feeling, a mix of anticipation and a pang of guilt, mirrored an experience he'd had pre-pandemic on this very course.

Back then, amidst the rhythmic swing of clubs and the occasional chirp of unseen birds, a pair of beautiful brown eyes had started gazing at him from behind a thicket of cypress trees. They belonged to Crystal, a local girl who'd silently observed him play several times. Her silent admiration had left a lasting impression on Jack, a flicker of intrigue that lingered even after he returned home.

Now, with each stolen glance, a different kind of hope, tinged with uncertainty, bloomed in his chest. Could Crystal still be here, watching him again after all this time? The California coastline, with its rugged beauty, had always held a certain magic for him, and perhaps, a part of that magic was the possibility of reconnecting with a captivating stranger.

He quickened his pace slightly, hoping to catch a glimpse of her, a fleeting flash of brown hair or a hint of movement through the trees. But the course remained stubbornly silent, offering no clues to Crystal's whereabouts. Disappointment settled in, a bittersweet ache that mingled with the nostalgia of the memory.

Still, a spark had been ignited. The possibility of seeing Crystal again, a chance encounter on this familiar Californian stage, added a new layer of complexity to his already tangled emotions. He was in love with Mei, his life intertwined with hers back in Berkeley. Yet, a forgotten promise to Crystal, whispered on a warm California breeze years ago, flickered in the corners of his mind.

The California sunshine, usually a source of pure joy, now felt strangely heavy, laden with the burden of unexpected consequences.

X.

As they finished the round, the tension was thick enough to slice. Nick and Jack approached the group of investors, their faces masks of poker. William, the salt-and-pepper bearded VC and Nick's playing partner, stepped forward, a smile hinting at more than just post-game pleasantries.

A glint of gold caught Jack's eye as William extended a hand in greeting. A massive Berkeley ring adorned his thick finger, the insignia instantly recognizable.  A sudden flash of understanding hit Jack. Nick's earlier insistence on having him caddy, his uncharacteristic nervousness about the investors – it all clicked into place now.

""Nick,"" William boomed, his handshake firm. ""That was a phenomenal display of sportsmanship and skill out there. You handled the pressure like a true champion.""

Relief flooded Nick as he grasped William's hand. ""Thank you, William. It was a pleasure playing alongside you all.""

One by one, the other investors shook Nick's hand, their earlier skepticism replaced with genuine respect. A silent handshake with William sealed the gentleman's deal – Nick had secured the investment.

Just then, William, his gaze lingering on Jack with a hint of a sly grin, excused himself from the congratulatory circle. He strode over to Jack, who stood slightly behind Nick, a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes.

""That was some phenomenal course management, Jack,"" William boomed. ""The way you navigated that 14th hole was truly impressive. We noticed your strategic thinking while playing with Nick.""

Jack, ever modest, deflected some of the praise to Nick's execution. ""It was a team effort, William. Nick hit some fantastic shots today.""

A knowing smile spread across William's face. ""Indeed he did. You boys are quite the duo. By the way, Jack, where are you from?""

""I'm actually based in Berkeley,"" Jack replied casually.

XI.

William's eyes widened in surprise. ""Berkeley? No way! That's my alma mater!"" He boomed with laughter, a sense of camaraderie bridging the gap between investor and caddy. ""Haven't been back in ages, but I still live down in San Francisco these days.""

Jack chuckled. ""Small world. Maybe you can show us the ropes sometime then, William. We'd love to experience the city beyond the golf course.""

William's grin widened even further. ""Now that's an idea I can get behind! Tell you what, how about I take you both down to the City Golf Club for a round next week? It's a private course, but I think I can pull some strings.""

Nick's eyes lit up. The City Golf Club was one of most exclusive private clubs, a dream course for many golfers. ""Are you serious, William? That would be incredible!""

William winked. ""Let's consider it a victory handshake, with a San Francisco twist. Besides, after that display on the 14th, I think you both deserve a challenge on a truly special course.""

Jack, ever the strategist, couldn't help but add, ""We wouldn't want to disappoint our new sponsor, would we, Nick?"" He nudged Nick playfully, their teamwork evident even in casual banter.

Nick nudged him back playfully as well. ""Looks like we've got some extra practice on our plates, buddy.""

""Practice makes perfect, gentlemen."" William leaned towards Jack and bumped his fist with a hearty ""Go Bears!""

Jack grinned, returning the enthusiastic fist bump. The unspoken connection between them, forged in the fires of Cal spirit, promised a future filled with not only business prospects but also potentially a newfound friendship.",
A Non-Berkeley Chinese American Student’s Response to a Korean and Japanese Student’s take on Oppenheimer,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/157eu9x/a_nonberkeley_chinese_american_students_response/,2023-07-23 06:26:12,"I’m an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Please forgive me for not being a Berkeley student, but I really like your school and your subreddit, so I’d like to post my thoughts here regarding two recent posts regarding Japan’s involvement in World War II.

For some background information, my relatives and ancestors from both of my parents’ side came from Eastern / Central China. Over this summer, I visited my childhood hometown of Shanghai, something that I have not had the opportunity to do so in over three years due to the coronavirus pandemic and various policies stemming from it. During my visit, my maternal grandfather unexpectedly fell ill and passed away due to long-term symptoms from the coronavirus. I reflected on his 88-year lifespan with my grandmother. From the time when he was born, China went through major historical events, such as the Second Sino-Japanese War, the resumption of the civil war, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and the eventual opening and modernization of the Chinese economy. My maternal grandmother also lived through the Japanese invasion. Her family is originally from Jiangsu Province, relocating to Nanjing where the seat of the ROC government was. During the invasion, she and her family escaped from Nanjing, where the Imperial Japanese Army committed horrific atrocities against civilians. Her family ended up hiding in the mountains of Sichuan Province, where every night Japanese air raids would wake her up and force the people in the city to escape to the countryside. Despite all the suffering that my grandparents went through due to Imperial Japan, my grandmother insisted that my mom go study abroad in Japan for her own sake, leading her to settle in America years later. I find this act of forgiveness to be inspirational, and this action has probably changed the course of my life for the better.

When I was a child growing up in Shanghai, 80’s and 90’s Japanese-imported anime would play on the television all day. However, as I return each summer to Shanghai, I find that they have all but disappeared, replaced with domestic production that is edging on communist propaganda and anti-Japanese war films. This honeymoon period of China-Japan relations has all but ended and is back at hostility. I am in the camp that this is caused by politics, especially the rise of Xi Jinping. My family from my mother’s side has suffered so much more from communism and the people of China than Imperial Japan. My grandmother’s father was killed by party officials for being a former KMT government official, despite renouncing all ties and not fleeing to Taiwan like so many others. My own grandfather was sent to the countryside for being college educated and forced to build a dam. While Imperial Japan has committed horrific crimes against the people of China, Korea, and many other countries, I am reminded of the fact that Mao Zedong and the Communist Party, whether it be through mistakes or intentionally, has killed a significant number of people as well. That’s why I don’t 100% buy in to this new political position. Even Mao once said that “The people of China and the people of Japan have a common enemy, and that’s Japanese Imperialism” (中国人民与日本人民是一致的，只有一个敌人，就是日本帝国主义与中国民族败类). Although I am cognizant of the horrible war crimes committed by Imperial Japan, the topic is often politicized by the present-day government of China and Korea, to whenever the topic is most convenient to them.

Recently, I visited Tokyo and other parts of Japan for a second time. There, I saw the Yasukuni shrine, a controversial place where many Class A war criminals are martyred and prayed to. This shrine feels like an antithesis to the Nanjing Massacre memorial I recently visited. While I was reading comments regarding the uncovering of a written record of Unit 731 “experiments” on Japanese Twitter, I saw various users praising the “discoveries as advances to modern science”. Even Japanese history textbooks pushed by ultra-conservatives now refer to the Rape of Nanking as a mere “incident” and a footnote. I am horrified that there are still denialists and revisionists despite the overwhelming evidence. I have no good feelings towards Imperial Japan apologists from any country. However, I’d like to believe that this is not the norm, and most people of Japan do not think like this. My mother befriended several Japanese students during her time at a Japanese university, and all of them and their parents were very apologetic towards the people of China for what they had caused during the war. I myself had a similar experience when I was visiting Shizuoka.

Back to the previous two posts on the Berkeley subreddit. One user commented that “Taking a neutral revisionist, ""both actions were wrong"" stance means that you're literally defending the oppressor over the oppressed.” I respectfully disagree with this. While Japan has committed atrocities in the invasion of Korea, China, and SEA, has the United States also committed crimes, albeit to a lesser degree? Setting aside the foreign policy of the US and the Middle East in the last 30 years, I believe that the imprisonment/detention/internment/concentration of Japanese Americans to be one of the greatest race-crimes committed by the US Government against its OWN citizens. Despite this, the 442nd Infantry Regiment, made up of Japanese Americans and descendants, is the most decorated unit in the US Army for their bravery. The dichotomy could not be starker. America often focuses on European and White history while casting aside the treatment of Asians, Blacks, Native Americans, and other minorities. Remember when we learned that World War II began with the invasion of Poland in 1939 in high school? Manchuria was invaded as early as 1931, and the rest of China in 1937. I don’t think the U.S. can claim a moral high ground in the annals of history whatsoever. It’s true that the atomic bomb forced the Emperor to surrender, but so did the Soviet Invasion of Manchuria? History books often overlook this to feed into the narrative of American greatness / exceptionalism.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant. To conclude, I think that:

1. The people of Japan need to be more educated about the atrocities committed by their government in the 30’s and 40’s. While Germany has done a great job confronting its dark history, Japan has much to learn from here.
2. The issue of war crimes is often politicized by the governments of Korea and China. This DOES NOT NEGATE the fact that the IJA committed war crimes against Asia. The current government of Japan should apologize sincerely to better mend relations.
3. Americans need to learn more about some of their own mistakes. This is the ONLY way for us to improve as a nation.
4. In my opinion, the atomic bomb led to an arms race and mutually assured destruction, leading to a 75+ year long period of relative global peace which would not have been possible otherwise.
5. The original OP isn’t responsible for the war crimes that Imperial Japan has committed but should probably read up about it if they haven’t already.

Please let me know whether you agree/disagree in the comments or if I got anything wrong (input is welcome). Go Bears and Go Blue.","Korean poster here. Very well put, and more thought out than my crap sleep-deprived and format-copied post.

I'd like to add that none of the involved be claiming the moral high ground here - South Korea also has civilian blood on its hands (Google Jeju uprising if you're unfamiliar - I'm not sure what the status on this event in Korean history education is).

My stance was and continues to be that we must not forget about any of the mistakes made in the past and their consequences.
Somebody call Ja Rule. Where is Ja to help me make sense of this all
Your post is well written and objective than the previous two. Please don't be apologetic to haters. You are equally American. 
For haters, not every Chinese support communist government. That's why they are living in US.
Honestly, this has been one of the most interesting chains in this subreddit in a while. It's interesting to see people's perspectives. I think that most people agree that a nation ignoring the atrocities of the past is a bad idea, regardless of the country. It's sad to see some states in the US regressing on this topic. I think Berkeley's history department did a good job of this compared to other schools. Many of the comments are mixed or negative but I'm sure there are many reading the threads who are interested in the discourse.
Very well done. I appreciate your intellectual honesty and sincerity.
Japan: “Okay but did you see what Nanking was wearing?”
This chain is cringe
Japanese people were horrible.
OP, I think I wrote the comment you referenced in your post, but I think either you missed context I wrote it in or you're deliberately removing it from its original context. That comment was in regards to another person commenting that neither Japanese colonialism nor the US' use of the bomb justified each other. ""Defending the oppressor over the oppressed"" refers to my opinion that claiming the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings should not have occurred is essentially saying that the oppression of hundreds of millions of people in the Asian/Pacific territories that Japan had subjugated should have continued, a stance I'll continue to stand by.

The way you referenced my comment in your post makes it seem as though I was saying that the US is completely right in all of its actions uring the war, a point that I never made nor believe. The US was correct in freeing Asian countries from Japanese occupation and wrong in what they did to Japanese-Americans; the two are not mutually exclusive. Idk if you did it intentionally or not, but portraying my comment as if I were defending American greatness or claiming the US as a guiltless nation is disingenuous to what I originally wrote.
Why is OP so stuck in the past? Jeez…we have Kpop and Nintendo now. At some point you gotta move on and stop holding onto grudges. Make the world a more peaceful place going forward. 

OP, you should be embarrassed at the amount of text you just wrote. Enjoy the sunshine instead of airing your grievances about ancient history. Next thing you’re gonna write about is the horrible suffering dinosaurs went through because of a mass extinction event caused by a comet.

I don’t know why we’re trying to talk about this in this sub. If you really care about this issue, please go read a history book or essay on the issue written by a respected academic.

I first learned about this event from the movie Taxi Driver (awesome movie btw, would highly recommend to anyone who hasn’t watched it), had absolutely no idea about it.

Heck not every Chinese person in China supports the communist government, they just have to be a lot more careful about what they say and when
The cringe is the 'go bears' at the end of every post. They're talking about war crimes, stay on track.
The only cringe I see is your fucked up face.
You are awfully uneducated and, dude, you really didn’t read his post, highly suspect that you saw the word Chinese and just started typing those regular shit “propaganda” without thinking but only dehumanizing
Did you even read my post? I have no love for the current government of China. My family came from KMT government officials, and were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution by the Communists. By the way, I descend from the Chiang family. Why would I, an American citizen with KMT family members, be spewing Chinese propaganda?   


Also let's be real - killing, torturing, raping, and experimenting on people is the definition of an atrocity. No need to be neutral about that. I don't know why you're using whataboutism to conflate Chinese concentration camps in Xinjiang province with Japanese war crimes. I am firmly against the unlawful detention of Uyghur people in Xinjiang, but that has nothing to do with my post. I'm not pointing my fingers at countries, I'm just giving my input about my experiences with the countries I'm most familiar with?
How on earth did you get into Berkeley with that reading comprehension?
And a lot of Chinese people in China are basically apathetic to what the government does because they're focused on other parts of life, like people in most places.  And a lot of Chinese people in China might have one opinion or another about the ideological bent of the CCP while mostly being a fan of having government services keeping things running, like people in most places.  And a lot of Chinese people in China might have various opinions on CCP policies while resenting the idea of foreigners telling them they should oppose their government, like people in most places.

People are people, all over the world.  Most people aren't defined by their attitudes towards their government.  And even a Chinese-American student who thinks the CCP is hunky-dory is equally American, no ideological qualifiers needed.  There's no CCP two minutes hate on the citizenship test or at the hospital.  I say that as a Chinese-American whose grandparents fled the mainland ahead of the civil war.  If Americans had our nationality canceled for dumb political opinions, it'd be a much smaller nation.
It’s in the Berkeley subreddit so it seems appropriate to address these posts with a common refrain, a conveyance of pride to be participating in the discussion

Murder of civilians

No need to go to personal attacks by saying I am a Chinese propagandist or that my familiarity with Japan is very limited. I'm pointing out the fact that there are still ultra conservatives who deny these events, but as I said in my post, I believe a majority of Japanese people are either apologetic or at least aware. Besides, I spend a large portion of my time on Japanese Twitter watching memes, not politics. I recommend you should watch Vox's video on right wing nationalism though: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHJsoCAREsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHJsoCAREsg)

&#x200B;

An atrocity, according to Google's dictionary, is ""an extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury.""  Americans did not kill or maim Japanese civilians, so I didn't use that word. However, as I said in my post, the internment of Japanese Americans is one of the greatest crimes the American government has committed against its own people and not enough people learn about this. Maybe mistake wasn't a great word to wrap up my concluding thoughts, but I definitely wasn't diminishing what America did here by any means.

&#x200B;

It's sad that while I love Japanese culture so much, including its food, media, and language, I have to consistently point out that to a few apologist or denialists regarding the actions of the government of Imperial Japan throughout the war. I hold no grudge against the people of Japan and hope to visit there again soon.

&#x200B;

EDIT: A note to add, loving one's country includes embracing both its achievements and its faults, that's how a nation advances forward together.
The Japanese government in 2017 tried to get the Supreme Court to make WW2 memorials unconstitutional in the United States

Nobody cares about the Twitter people when it’s the government

Thank you for the last part OP <3 totally agree"
