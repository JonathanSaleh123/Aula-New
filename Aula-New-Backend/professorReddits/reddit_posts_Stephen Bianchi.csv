Stephen Bianchi for Econ 136,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zxnovo/stephen_bianchi_for_econ_136/,2022-12-28 14:50:32,I'm taking Econ 136 next semester and thought the instructor would be Raymond Hawkins but Cal Central is showing it's Stephen Bianchi. Has anyone had him for 136 or other classes? How is he?,"Bianchi for 140 was a toughie, he’s not anyone’s *first choice* of a professor to put it bluntly
Contrary to popular opinion, i think he's a decent professor. the only problem is that he's a little dry so he might sound boring. BUT i will take him over Hawkins ANY FUCKING DAY because Hawkins digresses every fucking ten mins. I took both profs once and the only prof i'm gonna take classes from again is bianchi.
Had him for 139 this semester. He's okay. Thought his exams were fairly easy and he grades the homework generously. Agreed that he is a meh lecturer though.
From someone who got A's in 140 (Bianchi), 136 (Hawkins), and 139 (Bianchi). Hawkins is legitimately bad; Bianchi is eh.
Wait what happened to Hawkins ?
I second this statement, thank your lucky stars hawkins isn't teaching. I'm taking Bianchi this upcoming semester too
Second this
Hawkins lectures: random digressions and nothing useful or related to the exams

Bianchi's lectures: math, math, math. Sometimes relevant but usually much more in depth than necessary
Is 136 and 139 curved?
He’s not teaching anything next spring — most of the Econ professors have other side jobs/businesses so it’s quite common for them to drop off the map occasionally
That makes sense , I forgot that he usually teaches the fall semester"
Econ 140 with Stephen Bianchi,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l0x9zk/econ_140_with_stephen_bianchi/,2021-01-19 16:24:01,"Anyone have any tips about 140 with **Stephen** **Bianchi, how bad is it and do you have any suggestions on how to do well.**","I personally hated Bianchi’s lectures and never attended them (although I hear he’s a nice guy in OH). What got me through was coming in with stat 20-level knowledge and taking upper division courses with some foundational statistics in them concurrently (think expectations, basic probability rules, central limit theorem). If you have that, you can practically self study the course!"
What is Econ 136 like ??,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17cikae/what_is_econ_136_like/,2023-10-20 11:54:29,trying to decide on classes next semester and saw econ 136 was taught by stephen bianchi. is this class super hard ? what are the assignments like ?,"If you attend all the lectures and do all the problem sets, it’s actually quite easy and straightforward... Highly recommended since it’s the most practical and used course in econ
I took it last spring and I thought it was hard. I think it was Bianchi’s first time teaching the class so there wasn’t any practice midterm or final to study from. The only reason I was able to get a decent grade was because in my GSI’s final review session, he went through most of the final exam and advised us on what to study for each problem and the approach to solve them. Also, if you do better on the final than on the midterm, the final percentage would account for the midterm percentage.
not too hard, the math is pretty easy (max you'd have to take a first derivative)
Just finished the mt in econ136, it’s pretty easy and I did almost full point. The practice mt is almost reflect what will be in the true mt! What you need to do is go to lectures EACH time. It’s not mandatory and it might seem that bianchi just presents what’s in slides. But actually no. You can learn lots of different things from his lectures. Also, he’s really nice! Highly recommended!
Yah agree! Midterm was hard, but final was easy
who was your GSI?
Not much derivative tbh
Also, I think its mt is even easier than Econ 140(Ryan), not matter in terms of time limit and difficulty
Are lectured recorded by any chance?
No, unfortunately
Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question but I probably gonna miss the first lecture next semester. Does you think I would be behind by a lot?
No, because it’s just the first class. You can catch up the class later by reading slides. The first class is all about straightforward formulas.
Thanks!"
Econ 136 Textbook,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18lg8a2/econ_136_textbook/,2023-12-18 10:49:37,"Taking econ 136 next semester, how important is it to get the ""Investments By: Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan Marcus"" textbook for the class ? i see that its optional in the cal student store and when looking at old syllabuses for hawkins he eventually just took it off by 2022 ?? everything is assigned via ereader things. i dont know what stephen bianchi requires, help.","Not important really, professor Bianchi basically said everything you read in the book will be mentioned it lecture. If you don’t want to go to lectures, however, it may not be bad to have it."
econ 139 w/ bianchi,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zxw0xc/econ_139_w_bianchi/,2022-12-28 20:46:05,"has anyone taken econ 139 with stephen bianchi? if so, how was the class - especially the workload? and are lectures recorded? ty!!","Nice guy who tried to help, it’s just that the material was difficult"
"CS61B, ECON100A and ECON140",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y9mxv9/cs61b_econ100a_and_econ140/,2022-10-21 00:25:53,"Is this doable? Also, if you’ve taken econ140. Which professor do you recommend? Benjamin Faber and Stephen Bianchi will be teaching in Spring 2023.","Not a bad workload if you’re worried. Econ classes don’t have too many weekly assignments so you have lots of time to do 61B
Thank you! Did you take econ140? If so, whos your professor?"
Difficulty for Econ 140 in Data Sciecne major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/107ysqs/difficulty_for_econ_140_in_data_sciecne_major/,2023-01-09 19:07:40,"I'm a third year transfer Data Science student who plans to take econ140 on Spring. I wonder the difficulty of the class with Stephen Bianchi . I took econ1(A),data8(A), and cs61a(B+) last semester. As for statistics, I took stat134 equivalent  class before. Is it gonna be a difficulty course for me? How's the workload since I also take cs61b and data100 this semester.

   I take econ140 as an elective for computational and inferential depth requirement. Any other advice course for this requirement if Econ140 is too difficult for me? Thanks for your help!","Thought it was VERY easy as a DS major, especially after the curve. Had I only taken the prereqs required (which is typical for an econ major), I would have found it quite difficult.

The class is mainly econ majors who have significantly less prep than you (often just stat 20 or comparable) while you've learned parts of the class before and are very very well prepared for the rest.
Thank your soooo much! How about IND ENG 173: Introduction to Stochastic Processes? According to Berkeleytime it has higher overall grade than econ140. I'm not sure to take which one.
sorry, don't know about that one!
Hey! wondering if u ended up taking 140 or 173, and how either went? I'm also a DS major and I'm currently trying to decide between risking it on the waitlist for 173 or enrolling directly in 140."
How hard is Econ 136 and 140?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f31owe/how_hard_is_econ_136_and_140/,2020-02-12 17:06:32,"I'm pretty lost in Econ 136 currently and the book is hard to understand. Does the course get better as it goes on or just gets harder? I was also wondering how hard 140 is with Stephen Bianchi compared to Econ 140 in the fall with Evgeniya A Duzhak? 

Also would it be a heavy course load to have back to back final for these two courses?","136 i felt was hardest at the end and easiest in the middle and ok in the beginning.. Econ 140 with Bianchi was really hard.. but maybe not that hard grade wise because everyone was confused and it's curved
Donkey trippin balls on E & viagra hard
oh shoot it gets harder than the derivative stuff? rip i heard it gets significantly easier so I stuck with it."
ECON classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dnpvgh/econ_classes/,2019-10-26 23:44:06,"Hi, I will declaring my Econ major after I finish Stat 20 and ECON 100B this fall semester. I just had a few questions regarding who to take for 100A/101A. My two choices are ECON 100A spring semester with David Roland or ECON 101A with Stefano Dellavigna!

I'm also planning to take ECON 140 Stephen Bianchi or ECON141 Bryan Graham but just wanted feedback or any experiences from these professors and classes.","I took 101A last semester (not with dellavigna unfortunately) and I'm in 100b this semester, and I'd definitely say that the 100 series seems a lot more practical in terms of teaching intuition, whereas in 100A I learned lots of equation but didn't really learn the theory behind it.  That being said, Dellavigna is supposed to be an awesome professor, so maybe your experience would be different"
