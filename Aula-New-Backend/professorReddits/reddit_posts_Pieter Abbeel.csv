Has there ever been a transfer student who was able to work in a super competitive BAIR lab like Pieter Abbeel or Jitendra Malik?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xvtogo/has_there_ever_been_a_transfer_student_who_was/,2022-10-04 16:09:46,It seems all the students who managed to work with these legends are non-transfer students. I think time is the most important reason but still quite depressing,"There are many other (and better) labs than Abbeel and Malik
Transfer student here.  In my second semester, working at BAIR under a reputable professor in computer vision & embedded systems.  Stop stressing.  These labs aren't the end of the earth.  Calm down.  Find something you are passionate about.  Work on it independently.  Find a professor working on a similar topic and cold email them.  Bam, you have a position
Do you have an A in 189?
Don't look for labs based on prestige or competitiveness: look for labs based on your interest. If you're not interested in vision or RL but you care deeply about NLP, then these ""competitive"" labs are pretty useless for you.
My guy. You get jnto MIT, Stanford, CalTech by doing good research work not working in Pieter or Jitendra lab. The path of least resistant is to do research in an assistant prof lab that you enjoy since they most likely won’t have any absurd requirements for you to participate in their research.

Source: me a phd student who worked with a no name assistant prof that wrote me a killer LOR because I did good work
Maybe if you had previous AI lab experience prior to transferring they would consider your application. You could even have reached out to one of those profs your freshman or sophomore year.
I mean those labs are hard to get into too
which classes did you take and what were you're grades if you're okay with saying them? and when did you apply/cold email
Professor Kurt Keutzer?
Yes! But I haven't taken 182 or 126 or 127 yet..
But isn't the name of the one who writes the LOR the most important? I always hear that if you can secure a good LOR from a superstar, you can go anywhere and if the writer isn't that famous, the LOR might not be good enough to get into a super competitive labs
as a freshman or sophomore at a community college??
Not rly, Abbeel is almost hyperbolic in his requirements for undergrad researchers. If you can get past “prestige”, go find a grad student project who is happy to give you a learning opportunity and integrate you in the experimentation process instead of using you as a code monkey.
At the time, I had just transferred and took cs 70.  I did terribly in cs 70, but had reputable embedded systems background.
Then just cold email. If they like you and your previous experience you’ll get in. 189 is the biggest hurdle for transfers as they likely can’t take it till senior year
I think people like Pieter and Jitendra are more well connected, but younger professors are just starting their careers and your success is more important to their success. For your undergrad research, it kind of matters?, but I think it’s less important. More important is to just do good work. If you publish a nature paper under an assistant no name prof and get glowing letters from him, it doesnt matter who signed that letter. A professor from berkeley still said u are amazing and you still got a paper published in nature. Assuming you’re not an insufferable personality and your grades are decent, that’s basically an admission in to all the top universities.
Yeah I knew some people at CC who did research with university profs… they had some kind of connection though I’m not sure what it was exactly. Even without the proper intro you could probably cold email or even just go to Abbeel’s office hours in person to meet him.
Thanks for your response. I'm in the same boat rn and I'm in CS 70. wdym by ""reputable' btw? Any internships/research exp?
Can i join super competitive labs with only 189?
Both internships and research.
No you have to have other things. Either exceptional coursework or previous experience. 189 is the hurdle to applying. Just email link resume explain in succinct but extreme depth why you want to contribute to their work and you’ll be considered
Did you get research experience at community college ? Damn
Thank you so much for the help!
Yes."
Is there any undergrad doing research with Trevor Darrell or Michael Jordan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w3rqbx/is_there_any_undergrad_doing_research_with_trevor/,2022-07-20 10:09:33,It seems most undergrads do research with Pieter Abbeel or Sergey Levine. Are there any undergrads doing research with  Trevor Darrell or Michael Jordan?,"I worked with one of Mike's students while as an undergrad at Berkeley.

Even his PhD students don't really ""work"" with him, they are all quite independent and doing their own research and Mike sort of provides general feedback about things like direction and whatnot. If you want to work with some of his students, just look them up, see what they are doing and fire them an email. Typically you'll get no response because most undergrads aren't able to meaningfully contribute to ML theory research (unlike groups like Abbeel or Levine which are far more applied) but your email should try and convince them that this is not the case for you.
Michael's probably playing basketball.
Thank you for your reply! Btw can I join ML theory groups as a PhD even though I did my research in applied field as undergrad?"
CS or EECS for unit ceiling at Cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16haesd/cs_or_eecs_for_unit_ceiling_at_cal/,2023-09-12 19:08:13,"Hello, 

I'm considering transferring to Cal from a CCC for EECS or CS and I'm curious about the experiences of others in managing the 5-semester timeframe set by the CoE. 

Has anyone found this time limit restrictive, especially when aiming to enroll in a series of highly rated courses such as: 

\- CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory (offered by Satish Rao or Anant Sahai)

\- CS170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (by Christos Papadimitriou)

\- CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (taught by a team including Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, and Dan Klein)

\- CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning (with Johnathon Shewchuk)

\- CS161: Computer Security (Nick Weaver)

\- CS168: Networking (Scott Shenker)

\- CS186: Databases (Joe Hellerstein)

\- CS164: Programming Languages and Compilers (Paul Hilfinger)

\- CS162: Operating Systems (Ion Stoica)

\- CS184: Computer Graphics (Ren Ng)

Would it be better to apply for CS in the College of Letters since I received most of my credits through AP or dual enrollment during HS?

I would love to take all of these courses if feasible. Would it be better to consider taking some of them (if possible) or their equivalents during graduate school instead?

Thank you!","I don’t think it matters since CS is direct admit now. It seems doable in 5 semesters.
Typically you’ll want to take 2 techs a semester and transfers usually redo cs61a and Cs61C, many do 61b as well. Also, eecs16a and 16b are mandatory for EECS, so basically junior year is for lower divs. Then with three semesters left you can take 6 techs comfortably or 8/9 very uncomfortably (or using summers). There are two CCCs that can give you credit for 61C and 61B I think.
So does that mean that CS also must be completed in 5 semesters? Is it not in the College of Letters and Science?
The 5 semester ceiling is only for CoE transfer students in EECS. 

For L&S CS, you can go as many semesters as you want as long as you are under 130 units (for a single major).  In reality, it would be extremely difficult to go over say 6 semesters without going over 130 units.
No CS has a unit ceiling policy where you can keep extending if you have <= 130 units."

Is this a bad idea?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d9c6ws/is_this_a_bad_idea/,2024-06-06 00:04:37,"Context: I'm an incoming freshman with quite a bit of CS & Math experience. I have pretty much all the undergrad coursework for math & cs majors (except for 61A and 70) through my local CC and am coming in with 70 transfer units (basically a junior). I have experience taking large workloads in high school (10 course workloads: 6 AP's and 4 college courses concurrently for a year)

Do you think this is a reasonable schedule for my first semester or is it too many classes too close together. Also, if you have any recommendations for classes or specific professors please let me know.

https://preview.redd.it/44eiavg1fw4d1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=360c8ba442ea6849e644a25433f9fca136af0b7e","Whenever someone tells me they're gonna take 4 techs, I ask what they're taking and try to convince them to pick easier classes or make sure they can handle it. Whenever someone tells me they're gonna take 5 or more, I just sit back and say nothing because

1. they are cracked out of their goddamn minds, guaranteed
2. they literally always do fine, never seen one of em do poorly even with that much workload
3. I cannot stop them. nothing I say will change their minds.

So yeah, go ahead :)
huge difference if you're eecs or cs 

1. cs majors will not be able to enroll any of these upper divs until you finish 61ab 70

2. now if you are an eecs major, obviously i don't truly know how much cs and math you know but you can always look over the topics on all of their course websites to see what you know and don't know. that said it is honestly doable to do everything besides 186 if you put in the work. not to say 186 is incredibly difficult but the projects will definitely be time consuming and take up time needed for example 70 or 170 psets. if you believe you know much of the content in those classes many ppl can't stop you. but many ppl have a very similar hs background to you and they struggle with the triple crown 61b 16b 70. think of it what you will, the choice is ultimately yours.
Are you even going to be able to enroll in those upper divisions? I'm not sure what the policy is these days. Take out 188 and you'll be good btw, that class is not known for being a good use of time.
as someone who came into college with a similar amount of experience (in math it cs) you’re gonna want to enjoy your time in college but if you do this as soon as you start you’re gonna feel like you’re missing out. id say take it a bit easier, but you can prolly manage to get good grades in the classes if you really apply uourseld
First of all, you need your check if you are declared for CS from Day 1.  The rules are a bit different on this now that CS has moved to its own school.  If not, you can’t take any upper division classes until you are officially declared for CS. 

Secondly you need to understand the prerequisites.  170 is a complete hard stop without 70.  You shouldn’t take 186 without 61C.  188 is a no-go without 70. 

Thirdly, this is Berkeley.  The classes are infinitely harder than any course you have ever taken, even the beginning classes.  This is not community college, this is not some run of the mill university.  There are no easy courses in CS at Berkeley.  All CS classes will either have high workload, tremendous difficulty with average test scores around 50%, or in most cases, both. Don’t let the high GPAs fool you.  Even taking 61A and 70 together your very first semester is iffy unless you’ve done some sort of competitive math or equivalent. 

No one will recommend taking 4 CS technicals, much less 5.  My kid had a similar profile to you. Actually quite a few CS students have a similar profile. He actually took 4 technicals in 3 of his semesters at Berkeley. (Did it after freshman year).  He did pretty well a couple of the times, but one semester he had a nervous breakdown.  If you’re going to do so many technicals, do it after your first semester. 

One final note on registration - you won’t be able to get into 186 until maybe later, it’s already full.  The best laid plans of everyone is usually messed up because of demand and lack of resources.  And also depends tremendously on your registration position.  In other words, you should have backup classes in hand.
OP you are extremely underestimating the rigor of UC Berkeley. Quitely take 61A and 70 and explore the opportunities on campus. You have 4 years then why rushing to ruin your GPA right on the start. You can easily graduate in 3. If you are not EECS you can't take CS upper div anyways. No one stop you taking 4 upper div technicals once you are declared.
will you come in as declared in CS/EECS? if not then you won't be able to enroll in the upper div CS courses
if your high school/cc courses were known for being rigorous then you’re probably chilling, if not then i’d consider maybe swapping in an easier breadth class or some other requirement to be safe since you’ll end up having to take those anyways

honestly if i were you though i’d skip 188 to just do 4 techs this semester and use the time for a research lab or clubs, then do 189 next semester. Ive been told that 189 should end up kind of covering most 188 topics as long as ur a fast learner and willing to do some learning outside of lecture.
Go for it. If you crash and burn, well ya learned a lesson. If you succeed, then you know what you can handle and are going to go places.
Do you have comp math experience? What the other guy in this thread said basically.
I mean it depends on you. Tldr, this is roughly a 20-60 hrs per week workload depending on how good you are. 

61A is probably a non issue for you.

Cs70 is a non issue if you have comp math experience.

Cs170 is a non issue if you have competitive coding experience. 

Cs188 is a bit shallow, projects are spoon fed so don't take much time

Cs186 projects are somewhat of a waste of time.

Here is a rough breakdown of the time you'd need to spend per week on average (assuming you are cracked and watch lecures on 2x speed)

Cs61a - 3 hours
Cs70 - 3 hours
Cs170 - 4 hours 
Cs188 - 4 hours
Cs186 - 6 hours (debugging time)
Total = 20 hours per week

The times calculated are assuming you know the answer instantly for all homrwork problems and the only bottleneck is physically writing the answer out.

If you don't have prior experience, you can easily net +10 hours per week for each class due to getting stuck, being stupid, or having a bad teacher.
So you are potentially looking at 20+40 = 59 hours per week.

I mean you could go for this schedule if you want. You picked out 2 lower divs plus three easy upper divs. This seems like a schedule I would do if I could turn back time to freshman year.
For your first point, is it true even if you were admitted directly to cs?
yes
I would like to do research, but I don't know how I would get into any lab in my first semester. Is it just cold emailing or are there any programs open?
Yo suggesting five technicals could take only 20 hours of outside work time a week is actually bonkers. I’ve always seen the “for every credit hour, study for 2-4 hours outside of class” and while that specific measurement is def up for debate, that seems much more reasonable
yes, you have a reserved spot in the cdss cs major. But you aren’t declared until you finish ur pre reqs, so you can’t take any upper div cs (probably spring for you)
Ya, but u can look into 270 instead of 170, which is probably more interesting for you and is more project-based than exam-based. Grad classes are usually open to anyone that the Professor okays and ime that’s very easy to get
Tbh I don't know cuz the new CDSS policies aren't exactly clear, you can probably check your calcentral to see if the CS major is on your profile. That'll tell if you can apply to upper divs or not.

but please have fun for your first semester in college. this isn't high school where you're required to fill your schedule to the brim anymore. this also isn't high school in the sense that you can clown around for all your APs and grind study a night before tests. taking 5 tech finals isn't fun at all, let alone taking maybe 2 or 3 at 8am. explore other things while you're settling in - clubs, parties, recruiting (lol).

but also again you don't have to follow anything i said bc im not your advisor (although they would probably suggest you to take 2 max first semester so i wouldn't listen to them either). bumping what i said in point 2.
you my friend are a stud, i applaud you
Urap and cold emailing
I haven’t done upper div cs classes but if they are cracked and already have some related knowledge it’s not impossible. last semester i was taking 61B~1 hrs a week, 16B~5 hrs a week + 20 per exam, 70~20 hrs per exam and none on a normal week and physics 7b ~ 1 hr per week + 15 per exam so in total like 6 hrs a week plus 150 ish hours for studying for tests in total. 

The 2-4 hours per credit hour is probably reasonable for the average student but anyone willing to take 5 technicals is probably some level of cracked
I mean by this logic, 6 ap classes and 4 college courses simultaneously should be impossible. Some people really are just good. I dont blame you for thinking its unreasonable since thats understandable For example, as an average person, could you imagine running a mile in 3 minutes 43 seconds?

I measured time based on personal experience. I have personally taken harder schedules and know kids that are even more cracked. If you just look through LinkedIn and resumes of random people, you will also occasionally find these kinds of cracked ppl on accident.

Also cs70 can take 0 hours per week with the no homework option. You don't even need to study for exam or look at lectures if you have comp math experience. 

So this course loadout is more like 4 technicals. And technicals are actually much easier for some STEM kids than humanities. People always tout technicals as super hard, but for me technicals have always been far easier than english or history. This workload of 5 technicals versus 10 ap/college courseload might actually be a reduction in workload."

CS188 workload?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3nebre/cs188_workload/,2015-10-03 16:37:25,"For those who took CS188 with Pieter Abbeel, how was the workload? How many hours did you spend per week on the class?","Low.

If no project that week about 1-3 hours, if a project about 3-5.
whoa, what about homework?
That was the homework time, it was assigned weekly and extremely easy with an auto checker that let you know when you got it right with infinite tries.
wow this is surprisingly low workload... Is it the same with Stuart Russell or it's lighter?
The project workload this semester isn't that bad, but the homework assignments are set up differently with Russell and Virtue.  Half of the assignments are with the autochecker but the other half is handwritten.  Those are about five times harder than the autochecker ones and take way more time.  If you study sufficiently for the midterm you will do well (it's pretty straightforward). The last homework was more difficult than the midterm.
I think Russell gives out actually somewhat difficult written homework along with the online which is a lot more time.

If you are in the Cognitive Science (or Computer Science) field I *highly* recommend taking CS188, no matter who is teaching.  Topics such as this are discussed, and it is pretty interesting. Must have at least knowledge in 61A, 61B, and probably Math 54 (or higher) to succeed.

>Sometimes it's hard to separate signal from noise when you're not part of a field and just hearing about projects/papers, so I wanted to quickly pitch in to say that this is a legitimately ground-breaking approach and line of work that you can expect to hear much more about in the future.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9586582
So what, I can do all that
You really don't need math 54 or higher for 188. 188 doesn't go that heavy on the math and theory, but 189 does so you'd definitely need it for that. 61B would be pretty important for the data structure knowledge though.

Are events like these open to the broader community?  Is the vibe friendly to undergraduates, or is it a professional soirée kinda thing?","Give it a try! I went to one coordinated by Pieter Abbeel, and it was pretty fun (but tbh, I had no idea about most of the math/theory they presented... just the demo was cool). I can't remember what's it called, but seeing Pieter's name, you can guess it's a probabilistic robotics workshop.    

They only check your ID (or some sort of confirmation if you are not affiliated with the UC I think) at the beginning, and nobody questioned me whether I'm undergrad or graduate. I think you should be fine, but definitely sign up and give it a try.
Hey!  I work at the MSRI, actually.  If you have any questions, feel free to message me -- one of our biggest donors is the Simons Foundation, so we're always doing stuff w/them too. :)
Great to hear!  I was browsing the events calendar recently, and with 2-3 talks scheduled per day, I felt a bit overwhelmed.  Do you have any recommendations for upcoming workshops/lectures?  I'd like to know more about differential geometry, also topos theory, but I'd be interested to hear what the upcoming highlights are!
Any of the Evans talks (which are usually on Mondays) are supposed to be really good.  Anything by Villani or senior MSRI members is legit too.  Don't feel intimidated by the volume of talks -- even the people researching here don't go to every single one.  They're all open to the public and we encourage participation by everyone who's interested!"
