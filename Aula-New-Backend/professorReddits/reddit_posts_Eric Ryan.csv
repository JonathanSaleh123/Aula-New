Math 104 Fall 23 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12tfzom/math_104_fall_23_professors/,2023-04-20 14:36:40,"There are currently three professors for 104 this fall. K Beal-Uride, Eric Chen, and Ryan Hass.

How do they compare? I saw on berkeleytime that Beal-Uride and Eric Chen gave better grades, although they only taught for one semester.","[deleted]
Hass 100000% man that man is a gem of math department
From what I have heard, they are all great, seems to be a lucky semester to take 104!
Thanks for the info. How's grading with Hass, tho? On berkeleytime he is below average grade of 104.
thanks but isn't he a tough grader?
lucky! thx

Open team in Dynasty Baseball League,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35vah9/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league/,2015-05-13 13:25:13,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. This isn't an all Berkeley league, but I figured this would be a great opportunity to meet other baseball fans at Cal.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward. 

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete). 

The team roster is below. The minors system is pretty barren and the roster has too many bench offensive pieces, but there's a great deal of elite talent here. A smart owner could turn this team into a contender in short order, either through rebuilding or with a shorter term strategy. Reply or PM me if you're interested!
