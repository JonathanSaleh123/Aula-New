In the East Bay, a UC Berkeley professor is gaining attention by vowing to remain in his campus office until university officials take action against antisemitism on campus. He says recent violent events prompted the sit-in action.

""I'm just sitting in my office with the light on in the window,"" said Cal Professor Ron Hassner.

Hassner is leaving a light on in his UC Berkeley office, a signal to the campus that he's here 24/7. Hassner is staging a 'sleep-in' protest to help prevent violence between students.

""I decided to engage in a quiet, non-aggressive peaceful protest by dragging mattress into my office, change of clothes and lots of food,"" said Hassner.

This political science professor says he's making his small office his temporary home, teaching all classes on Zoom until the university takes steps to address antisemitism on campus; he says many students have faced harassment.

""They are facing bullies who are anti-semitic in addition to being anti-Israel, without things getting out of control like they did two weeks ago,"" said Hassner.

Last month, the university condemned a demonstration by activists who surrounded Zellerbach Hall where a pro-Israel advocate was speaking.

Protestors broke doors and windows to get inside, the event was canceled.

On Monday, Jewish students are planning a march to 'Liberate the gate' where activists have blocked passage through Sather Gate for weeks.

""Our message - is Jewish students have a right to be present and safe on this campus as much as anyone else,"" said student Daniel Solomon.

""Students must be a allowed to protest but that can't mean blocking access to parts of the university,"" said Hassner.

Hassner says he's not leaving his office until the university removes the Sather Gate barricade and provide antisemitism and Islamophobia training to campus personnel.

In a statement, the university said:

*""The administration is committed to confronting antisemitism and holds Professor Hassner in great esteem and it is in conversation with him about his concerns.""*

Several pro-Palestinian groups on campus declined ABC7's interview requests.","Edit: Before you guys downvote me, just read what I've got to say, and if you disagree, either with my account or conclusion, leave a comment and we can discuss it. I'd like this to be a dialouge rather than an uncritical space. These are important issues and I want it to resolve conflict and promote understanding rather than division. ​ 

I went to his middle east lecture on anti-semitism vs anti-zionism. He showed a bunch of pictures of various graffiti, protests, signs, etc, and tasked us with figuring out if it was anti-zionism or antisemitism. Picture after picture went by and each one he showed he slowly tried to lead the class to the conclusion that they were all in fact example of antisemitism. He didn't say it explicitly, but the obvious conclusion he was trying to build towards was that there were no examples of antisemitism and anti-zionism being two separate things, because they are in fact the same thing. This one presentation was the 90 minute entire class period aside from one brief moment where proposed a very biased (not necessarily wrong) definition given by an Israeli supreme court judge of anti-zionism. ​ 

The lecture didn't seem to really even touch on any sort of broader class concepts, historical context, etc. What was this lecture trying to teach within the course? It was so out of place within the lectures before and after it. ​ I remember one specific example of how he spoke of these ideas where he posed the following question: ""It seems strange that people would want to destroy a country because because of what it's government does. You wouldn't see anyone saying china should be destroyed because their poor policies."" Here he draws a 2 clear false equivalencies. China's founding is both far less recent and not based on the forced relocation and violence towards the indigenous population. Additionally one doesn't need to believe Isreal needs to be ""destroyed"" to be against their public policy. The lecture was full of these little rhetorical techniques, and it seemed like he was trying to convince of the conclusion that there's no difference between antizionism and antisemitism. The thing is it doesn't even take a very critical person to see these sorts of things, which is what made this lecture feel so strange. It felt like a jew-belong billboard as a Berkeley class for actual academic credit. ​ 

Just thought I might share that experience with him as context to his actions and perspective.
roleplaying as an eecs freshman to own the libs??

what a fucking dork lol
Professor Hassner describes his protest as “peaceful and non-aggressive.” The implicit criticism here is that the pro-Palestinian protesters are violent and aggressive.

But what he seems to be most upset about is the blockade at Sather Gate. Is this a violent or aggressive protest? Doesn’t seem like it to me. It’s disruptive for sure, certainly more so than Professor Hassner refusing to leave his office. But someone with his level of influence and prestige can get media coverage for this kind of non-disruptive protest. People with less power don’t have this sort of privilege.

And what does he want the university to do? To forcibly break up the Sather Gate blockade? Wouldn’t that require some kind of coercion?

Ultimately, it’s not really about “peace” or “non-aggression.” He’s pro-Israel, he doesn’t like the pro-Palestine protests, and he wants the university to deal more harshly with them. 

Here’s hoping for a ceasefire so Professor Hassner can take a shower!

Criticizing Israel =/= antisemitism. There are millions of Jews who also criticize Israel. Tired of this manipulative strategy to conflate the two. We, as Americans, give BILLIONS of our taxpayer dollars a year to Israel. More than we give to any other nation by a landslide. You bet your ass we can criticize it all we want.
[deleted]
If you’re in the comments saying criticizing Israel is not antisemitism, you should be ready and willing to recognize examples of antisemitism, which span from physical attacks to certain rhetoric and ideas that are common within anti-Zionist speech. Stand on your ideals and learn what antisemitism actually is, and stand against it. Even beyond antisemitism in discussions about Israel, of which there has been plenty, there have been physical attacks and threats as long as there have been Jews in the U.S., and a 400% rise in antisemitic incidents in the US since October 7. I would give these statements more credibility if a Jewish person speaking about experiences of antisemitism wasn’t immediately met with “criticism of Israel isn’t antisemitism.” Maybe clarify what antisemitism they experienced? Because I as an alumni of Berkeley and someone who has lived in progressive communities all my life have certainly experienced plenty of antisemitism which no one seems to want to hear about.

Wait, I thought professors already did this. Not because of protests but because of fears of being homeless in case they can’t afford housing.
I hear Stanford is nice.
Saving on rent i see, interesting move
Yes girl give us nothing
This whole ""if you're against the Israeli genocide you're anti-semitic"" thing reminds me of the dozen or so logical fallacies we had to learn about in 7th grade. The fact that this rhetoric is not only being implemented but is actually *working* is hugely disappointing. I mean, we understood that this shit was idiotic even back when we were 7th graders.

A hell of a lot of Jews and, btw, many Israeli Jews are against the genocide. I'm disgusted by the people crying anti-semitism when children and animals are being bombed, starved, and tortured.
End the occupation. Period.
bro is a zionist
Imagine going around Sather and adding like 3 minutes to your walk. What a concept
They should not block the gate.
This sleep-in is the way. IMO There’s a time and place for criticizing Israel. Right after the murders of 1200 children, families and concertgoers is NOT one.  But that’s my opinion not the reason for violent demonstrations. Peaceful demonstrations. Peaceful civil disobedience is the only way real change occurs in this country. Not one sided social media posts without a semblance of historical research designed to insight violence.
I’d say this is the laziest most pointless protest effort on Berkely but it’s not even in the top twenty
Such a pathetic reaction to hearing people essentially say “let’s not support an ethnic cleansing campaign and crimes against humanity that we all see videos of occurring every day”
There’s a genocide happening.
Good, get the pro terrorism trash off of campus.
They need to rename this university to UC Hamas. Strip their funding and see if anyone in the middle east wants to sponsor their education or even allow women on campus.


The youth is being brainwashed by left wing professors, glad to see there is one man fighting for what's right.
I think some Palestinian protesters should *peacefully* gain access to his office and sleep there.  He needs to sleep somewhere else.  Students have the right to occupy the university, after all.

Edit: Don't really get the downvotes.  It's what this professor is advocating for in Palestine.
Meanwhile, Professor Hatem Bazian is blocking the Sather Gate. Which professor is acting in good faith?

Antisemitism should be punished by the deportation of antisemits and their families to terrorist countries. No tolerance to antisemitism! Photos and profiles of each antisemit should be available online for public. They are predators and our society will not tolerate it.

*pro-hamas*

Students should block his door so food delivery and other aid can’t get through
So property was destroyed? That’s what he’s protesting? No Jewish students were hurt? Hm
Question is whether it's the professor sleeping through class or just some homeless dude who broke into the building
Leaving lights on 24/7 is wasteful af for a fake cause
If you haven’t had a chance to go to office hours, you should. He has often spoken about his critiques of Israel and his displeasure for people glorifying it. He does possess the capability to criticize the country and does so openly and often. I do agree the lectures were out of place—but he also said students had requested it. Which is why two weeks later in class he addressed his desire to cover Islamophobia and had let us know he opened the stage to experts who had yet to take him up on the offer. From my experience, he was very open to giving the topic equal attention. The GSI’s have been facilitating open conversations about the topic as a well. 

He also mentioned in that lecture, that he had been doxxed in the weeks prior, which was why he was so upset about the school doing nothing to offer protection to students and faculty that have expressed fear. He also expressed that he did not want the march on Sather to happen, because he didn’t think it would be productive.
Of course it always goes both ways; there is bias present, as often happens when something deeply personal is brought to the forefront of not only the campus, but that nation.
I don't think you are characterizing the lecture accurately. He made it very clear that you can and should criticize Israel, and that it is incredibly easy to do so without using anti-semitic tropes. The slides were meant to show how these tropes can make their way, consciously or unconsciously, into certain images used in anti-Israel messaging. 

  
I don't think he was trying to goad people into equating anti-semitism and anti-zionism; he said explicitly that they are two distinct things but that there is overlap, where the former can motivate the latter. How much overlap there is is up for discussion - he thinks there is a lot but was open to others disagreeing (as I do).

  
A specific example he gave for the ""country doing bad things but isn't called on to be dismantled"" was Russia, which is a stronger comparison in my opinion. His point wasn't that criticizing Israeli public policy is unwarranted, but that the singular focus on and calling for an end to its existence only happens to Israel, even when other nation-states have done worse things. This double standard he thinks is at the very least ""weird"" which is where his ""only Muslim country in the world"" test comes in. 

  
I disagreed with some things in the lecture as well, but not enough to say anything. It seems like you could have contributed a lot though, and Q&A would have been more interesting if you had :(
I remember going to the holocaust museum in high school, they had one room that stood out from the rest and was nothing but a little 10 minute version of exactly what you're describing. I remember being the only student to have an issue with it and our teacher who was with us wouldn't let me say anything as to offend our guide.
The PRC is, ironic to your point, younger than the state of Israel. 1948 vs 1949? Perhaps I’m wrong.

Talk to Mongolians, Tibetans, Taiwanese, and Indians; and they will all tell you the PRC is imperialist and colonial in nature, and very happy to ethnicly cleanse. This doesn’t condone Israel, I’m not fucking doing that whatsoever. But I am using my education and calling out a really ignorant, like honestly, objectively bad take.

It sounds like you went in with ignorance and left with nothing more. Sorry you wasted your time in his lecture.

> *Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.
Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring.
The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. ""It is overfull. No more will go in!""
""Like this cup,"" Nan-in said, ""you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?""*

You should go to a pro-Palestinian lecture to really see some inaccuracies, mental gymnastics and re-writing of history.
Ya I hadn’t read your comment but ALREADY knew what you were going to say. Not at all surprised.
As a Sephardi Jew, who was born over there. I just know the negatives that Zionism has done to my family and the people I care about. There will always be a difference between antizionism and antisemitism. I am proud to be Jewish, but will never accept Zionism and the supremacy it promotes
It’s hard sometimes.  15 million Jews in the world and only one country the size of New Jersey.  0.02% of the population of the world.  It’s a real minority.  
The more antisemitism around the world , the more I think Jews need a place they can feel safe.  We’ve learned in the past that other countries don’t always have our backs.
He’s never experienced life outside of the ivory tower
Can we please stop calling it a ‘blockade’ at Sather Gate? It’s literally just the middle section of the pathway that has the banner there. People easily and comfortably walk through on the sides… how on earth is it a blockade? It is not forcing people to take a different path to class or anything, or causing inconvenience to people in any way.
Think you're projecting here. pro Palestine protests have escalated to violence, it's a fact, one that is deeply supported by their literature.
Pro Palestine movements need to wake up and be pro releasing hostages
😂🔥
It’s not just the blocking of the gate. It’s 5 months of cheering the terrorists and r*pists, calling for global violence against Jews (intifada), calling for the annihilation of a legally established democratic state, spreading Hamas propaganda and demonizing Jews. It really kills the vibe for your Jewish classmates.
The banner states blood libel pure and Simple. That campus is tinged with terror support.
The food at Steve's isn't that great
Except with chicken nuggets and wine.
Im screaming lmao 

Such sacrifice! Such benevolence! 

This is all getting increasingly clownish. The victim hood of it all while there’s an actual genocide going on right now. 

Embarrassing.
Criticizing Israel is not antisemitism. Saying Israel doesn’t have the right to exist aka anti-Zionism -is antisemitism. The definition of Zionism is the right of Jews to self- determination and self-governance in their ancestral homeland - Israel. 
It’s not a theory, it’s a country that exists and btw has more human rights than any of its neighbors. It has 9million citizens including 2 million Arab citizens. The only Jewish state in the world. So supporting the annihilation of this country is antisemitic.
Do you think there have been 0 antisemitic incidents or instances of antisemitic speech since October 7, or before? I find this argument really lacking given that there has been a well documented rise in antisemitism in this country both in recent months and years. Why are you assuming what he is referring to? Why can you not hear Jewish people about the hate they are targets of? Is it because Palestinians are also being targeted? Because hate against one group doesn’t make hate against another irrelevant, and further we are talking about AMERICAN Jews. I’m uncomfortable with how people seem to think that because of Israel, no Jew can experience antisemitism or deserve protection from it globally.
For thirty years, I whole heartedly supported all Israeli action in the Middle East.

By 2010, I assessed that all the power was with Israel.

YET, the situation was similar to the eighties and nothing had changed.

Then this current action happened.  The current action is genocide.

That’s forty years for me to change my mind.  I’m Filipino American so this is not my fight. Just an outsiders opinion.

My assessment parallels that of the Irish government.  That. IRA-British conflict was one that I thought would never end. But it did in the nineties.

So I look at this situation and conclude that Israel does not want it to end.
There’s not millions of Jews criticizing Israel. There’s only 15.7 million Jews world wide. Roughly 80%+ of Jews identify strongly with the idea of having a Jewish country. So that’s roughly a million ish at most who’d criticize Israel. 

Finally criticizing Israel’s policy and government officials is fine. Criticizing the right of Jews to self determination and the right of the Jewish people to have a country of their own, is anti semitism
Palestinians are anti semetic
It very often is though.
They refuse to acknowledge it. The Hamasniks are the most extreme of gaslighted.
Antisemitism has no doubt increased a lot. 

But Is the 400% number from the ADL which counts pro-Palestinian protests as inherently antisemitic? Or where does it come from?
I’d rather be Jewish then black. At least I wouldn’t have to here how stupid my race is from everyone. That’s be a breath of fresh air
>GENOCIDAL BARBARISM

This shit is so tiresome. Losers simping for hamas on the basis of some wack anti western twisted ideology. 

Hamas will be destroyed and there is nothing you can do to stop that
However, it's not a genocide, so.....
Did you see the pictures? It was a paper banner saying children are starving during Ramadan in Gaza. It was ripped down by opposing students.
Did you see the pictures? It was a paper banner saying children are starving during Ramadan in Gaza. It was ripped down by opposing students.
Except here we are discussing it.
Antisemitism is not an appropriate response to what is happening in Gaza. Protesting the Israeli government is.
Yes, there are several taking place around the globe but none of them is in Gaza. Of course nobody cares about the others because they can't seem to find a way to blame them on the Jews.
You graduated
Shhhh go back to your squirrels
Wouldn’t be shocked to see that happen if trump gets elected. University is in violation of title vi
Students do not have the right to occupy a professors office. You have an issue with freedom of speech? Freedom just for you but for no one else? A bit fascist no?
It was a paper banner, that the opposing group ripped down. Clarify what you mean by “blocking the gate”
Italian police have arrested three Palestinians based in central Italy who they said were planning attacks in an unspecified country, a police statement said on Monday.

The three men living in l’Aquila, about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Rome, had set up a cell linked to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, it said.

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades is an armed group that is linked to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah movement and is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the European Union and the United States.

The course hasn't been very difficult, and I'm not really looking to confront him about him for any of these things, but I do imagine he would be receptive to having that conversation. 


I missed the doxxing, that's awful to hear. These conversations shouldn't be held in a culture of fear.
Yikes, even if I disagree with someone, doxxing is bad!!!
If he thinks people haven’t been calling to dismantle Russia he hasn’t seen the NAFO diehards.
Anti-semiticism does not equal anti-zionism.  The truth is when you try to say something against Israel's policy you are labeled antisemitic. This term has weaponized, you can't criticize anyone: Jewish people with fascist attitudes and israeli's policies that are racial or facist as Anti-semitic; I believe they need called out as zionism.  Semitic has racial roots whereby it applies to both  Arab and Jews.   It applies to all tribes that came from Yemen.
They very well may. Do you have a personal experience with this you'd like to share?
Which lecture?
Define Zionism.
I agree that antisemitism is an ever-present issue. I think the biggest question is one of priorities. I think the humanitarian crisis of palestine may warrant more concern than addressing sentiments of antisemitism at the moment. That doesn't mean myself or others believe the latter problem as insignificant, but simply see the former as more urgent.

As we all know, there are ten million proposed solutions to the problem. I'd hope we can all agree that the best solution is one that minimizes harm for all individuals.
>It’s hard sometimes. 15 million Jews in the world and only one country the size of New Jersey. 

Having a religion doesn't mean you ""get a country.""  Israel is attempting to carve a ""safe space"" out of a region where other people live.
Now how did you arrive to this point based on what OP said? 

These are the mental gymnastics we talk about.
I really hate it when people make assumptions like this. How do you know the entirety of this man’s life?
Haha thank you for explaining I stumbled upon this and thought they us an actual blockade
Bros mind is going to blow up when they find out about the Nakba
The problem is that the pro Palestinians want a release of Palestinian prisoners. They equate prisoners with hostages, which are not the same.
Ok, Im for releasing hostages, now what
Weenie
Yes and other middle easterners need to get tolerant of sharing the region with Jews or there will be endless suffering

you are fundamentally insane if you believe that garbage.
Exactly. 💯
Intifada means revolution
MLK Jr literally wrote about how the ""liberals"" who said not to protest were worse than the open racists because they hid it behind respectability.  

""You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city’s white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.""

“Legally established”? By who? A foreign imperialist nation with no right to give the land away to colonists, that’s who. Israel needs to be destroyed and the land given back to the Palestinians.
The pro hamas students are legitimately blocking main ways of entry with blood libel signs like wtf
The side dishes and kimchi are a joke, but the meat is decent and two piles of rice 🔥🔥🔥
This!!!!! I sat there yesterday watching as a grown woman ripped a blockade made of paper screaming never again…..as heightened performative protestors were crying. Look I’m not insensitive I get it….most of the people weren’t even students so I’m not even sure wtf is going on. But it’s all staring to be a hodge podge of embarrassment.
Anti-zionism isn't anti-semitism. I'm a proud Jew born and raised, and I have been staunchly anti-zionist for as long as I've understood what Israel is. Being anti-zionist doesn't mean you support destroying Israel, it means I don't support Israel being established in the first place and I don't support Israel's politics and attempt to create and maintain a military ethnostate that serves as an outpost for major western colonial powers. It means I believe in a two state solution focused on creating and equal balance of powers based on dignity and respect rather than displacement and settlers.
[deleted]
Wrong. As an Ashkenazi Jew myself Israel does not have a right to exist. No one should be allowed to have an ethnostate.

The only reason the area isn’t called Palestine is due to the British doing imperialism and claiming that Jews could just ethnically cleanse an area and claim it as their own.
Israel doesn't have the right to exist because no state has the right to exist.
Jews count.
You're paying US taxes so it is your fight. I'm emailing Biden, Harris, and my reps weekly to stop sending weapons to this shit show.

It was some woman who tore the banner. I saw the video she seemed too old to be a student honestly, but I saw her from the back. I doubt it’s a student though. Also there’s no shortage of aid going in Gaza. I saw videos of people throwing their aid away or complaining about the food the Americans dropped. The markets are also full of goods. However, Hamas is stealing aid. There are many testimonies from Gazans about that. The food they steal ends up in the markets when it’s supposed to be free because it was donated. So if you really cared about the Palestinians you’d be protesting against Hamas - so that they’d stop stealing aid, stop using civilians as human shields and most importantly for them to release the hostages and surrender - which would end the war. That’s what you’d do if you cared about the Palestinians instead of reciting the slogans Hamas gives you.
Maybe their government should care about those children and not engage in terrorism. Free the hostages, who are doubtlessly suffering more.
I acknowledge the tragedy and feel really sorry for them. I believe all Berkeley students and faculties do. But that doesn’t mean the they should be allowed to hang it there at the Gate everyday. We all feel very sorry for the war and all those tragedies, but we also have right to walk thru our Gate everyday going to school too. They could hang it elsewhere that’s also obvious. Hanging it at the gate everyday is too much. The marginal effect of that flag’s influence is declining to the point that it leads to rising compains than understanding.
What about what I just said is “antisemitism”. This is bullshit and you know it. Israel apologists just want to paint any criticism or support for Palestine as antisemitism so they can keep slaughtering civilians without pushback
Yeah, sure did. Doubt you’ll manage to.
Seems pretty weird to be pro-Zionism, Israel, etc., to the point that you're rationalizing the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.  

International law and common human decency say that Israeli settlers *don't have the right* to molotov Palestinians' homes or drop bunker-busting 500 lb bombs on apartment blocks.  The settlements *don't have the right* to exist.  

Yet *staging a peaceful sit-in in an office would cross the line.*   

Do you hear yourself?  Lol.
A bit ironic that you seem to care about “rights” and “freedom” when Palestinians are currently not granted human rights or freedom, as acknowledged by the UN.
If I can find you three Israelis who committed rape, will you claim that all Israelis are rapists?
Found the really shameless antisemite right here!
You are lying about being in the clsss if you think the course hasn’t been very difficult. 

Ain’t no way you made it into 124***B***. Here, how many pages a week does the syllabus say you are expected to read? While you’re at it, what was the grade cutoff for matriculation from 124A?
Not only was he doxxed, the person posted it outside of the classroom he was teaching in. 
He did say that he’s not afraid of doxxing—but afraid or not, the malice behind the effort is there, and should be noted.
Also, I must say you sound like that Tweet Hatem Bazian accidentally Tweeted saying “as a Jew” when he is obviously an antisemite trying to impersonate a Jew to create false credibility. I’ve never heard any Jew who lived in Israel use these words in a sentence. It doesn’t doesn’t check out.

Zionism means that Jews too can live in our ancestral homeland. 🇮🇱
You can define it yourself. I believe in you.
Broadly defined as not letting Gaza and the west bank be autonomous, and not allowing all of the settling that is going on in those two geographic areas.
Yeah.  30-35,000 Palestinians have been killed since October.  

Including the October 7th attack, around 1800 Israelis.  

Reports suggest that roughly half of the Israeli casualties were IDF, whereas estimates for the proportion of Palestinian casualties who were Hamas seem to range from 10-40%.  

Doesn't matter how you cut it, Palestinians are suffering more, and more Palestinian civilians are dying.
No terror - no humanitarian crisis.
Are you Jewish? I don't know you. Perhaps you are, but why do you get to decide what the current priorities are? The situation happening in Palestine is absolutely horrible. However, taking the Israeli-Palestinian conflict out of the question in my comment, there is significant anti-Jewish behavior that has been displayed on campus and nationally as of recent to both Jews and to people who haven't even taken a side in the conflict. Both that and the situation in Palestine are significant problems. But I hope you do understand taking the political situation out of things that your comment is hurtful to many students, and comparing other forms of violence, war, or discrimination is anti-semitism counts as anti-semitic behavior by many.
""I think the humanitarian crisis of palestine may warrant more concern than addressing sentiments of antisemitism at the moment. ""

Comparing things to anti-semitism is actually a textbook example of anti-semitism.
No, but Judaism is not just a religion. It’s an ethnicity and a people who are indigenous to the land of Israel. You support indigenous peoples rights but not when it comes to Jews?
This!!!!
What rules says they can't? How about you educate yourself by studying history and physics little man 😆
When you write “attempting,” you mean have been there since the beginning of time recorded.  And have been a country with self governance for 3 generations. The place in the Middle East where gays have open rights, where women don’t need to be surprised and covered if they don’t want to, where democracy is thriving including having a significant Arab population and portion of the government.  
What makes me mad is Israel is playing right into Hamas hands.  You don’t attack a sovern nation and rape its women to death and and murder and steal without knowing there will be consequences, and Hamas knew this and is willing to have as many martyrs as possible. Even its civilians.  Probably why they rejected the cease fire.  Israel is supposed to be a light among nations.  Which, I believe, it has been for 75 years.  But now this sucks.  Gaza was given to self governance for 20 years, look how great that turned out.
Jews are a people (ethno-religious group) not just a religion. By that logic there should be no Muslim states including Palestine.
Let me correct you, most hostages are prisoners of war while ALL Palestinians are more than political prisoners, they are occupation prisoners because they’ve are fighting for freedom of their homeland.
Okay a ceasefire is called with Hamas, then what?
So you agree that the gate blockers and protesters are glorifying terrorists and r\*pists calling for globalized violence against Jews, calling for the annihilation of a legally established democratic state, spreading Hamas propaganda and demonizing Jews? 

You know that 99.9% of things coming out of Gaza are controlled by Hamas, right? Do you know that \*gasp\* terrorists can lie? Insane, I know. 

The ""brown"" comment really exposes you. Not everything fits onto you ""western narrative,"" It is not a race issue. Most Israelis are ""brown.""
Are you a bot? Everything I stated is a fact.
😂😂
Intifada means uprising. During the Intifada of the early 2000s a thousand Israelies died in terror attacks. Suicide bombers would go stand next to children waiting for their parents to get pizza at a pizza parlor and blow themselves up, they blew up buses, restaurants, a passover seder in a hotel. That is what intifada looks like. So, yes extreme violence. Great thing to chant for on UC Berkeley campus.
The United Nations.
They aren't blocking it you can easily walk around and MLK Jr literally wrote about how the idiots who said not to protest were worse than the open racists because they hid it behind respectability.  


""You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city’s white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.""

Exactly
agreed
What is the difference between:

>I don’t support Israel being established in the first place 

>from the river to the sea Palestine will be free

>support Israel being destroyed

I’m *really* sure you have some cognitive dissonance here. Consider: could you be a proud Jew of any nationality in many Arab states and communities right now? You realize the Houthi slogan is 

God is the Greatest

Death to America

Death to Israel

A Curse Upon the Jews

Victory to Islam


Fuuuuuuck everyone with their religious colonialism, but don’t be silly. They’re calling Jews out for being Jews. Healthy, peaceful Muslims and Arab atheists will tell you that shit is not good *for Jews* right now. Just like traveling to Russia is stupid for Westerners.
Well said! Anti-zionism and anti-semitism is a false equivalency that's part of the colonist, apartheid IDF regime. Do NOT agree with Israel's tactics and state sponsored genocide, but also condemn violence and hatred towards ANY people, including Jews
Your comment makes no sense. You said you do not believe Israel should exist. That the mizrahi  Jews in the area should be left to programs and death. Yet you also state you support a two state solution…a solution involving the state of Israel. 

Would it not be Asian hate to say Han Chinese do not have the right to have a country of their own?
>It means I believe in a two state solution

""Real two-stateism hasn't been tried""
i’m not sure you know what zionism means 😿
You represent less than 5% of American Jewry and less than 3% of global Jewry. Stop trying to speak for Jews.
I have been there. I actually lived there. Do you know why the wall as built? After more than a thousand Israelis were killed in suicide bomber terror attacks over 5 years. The wall prevents the suicide bombers from coming in. You do realize that Israel and the West bank are two different things right? 

You are exposing yourself with the Ethiopian Jews comment. I think you are referring to a conspiracy theory? What about them?
Have you?  https://www.instagram.com/blackjewishmagic?igsh=ZWI2YzEzYmMxYg==
I like being able to kiss and fuck who I want.

Oh and I like being able to drink when I do it.

I don’t like the idea of being killed for it. 

Fuck any version of religious ethnocentrism.
Oh hello “as-a-Jew.” Do you realize that being Jewish does not give you the right to speak over other Jews? Your opinion is valid but it is just one opinion. Judaism encourages debate but starting a sentence with “as-a-Jew” does not make your opinion matter more. There were Jews who supported Hitler in the 1920s.

Israel is actually not an Ethnostate because it has 2 million Arabs living in it as citizens with equal rights.You are very concerned about the Jews having a country and being able to self-govern in their ancestral homeland. You must be furious about all the ethnostates that surround it then? Muslim/Arab countries are essentially all ethnostates. Do they allow non Muslims to live there with equal rights? Do they allow Jews to live there at all? My family was ethnically cleansed from Egypt - a testament for their “tolerance” to people of other ethnicities.You must also be protesting very loudly to annihilate all those states who don’t have any human rights, women’s right LGBTQ+ rights, civil rights?No? Just big feelings about the one democratic Jewish state? Interesting.

Have you heard of Arab imperialism? You know, the reason the whole Middle East and North Africa is Arab? Have you heard about all the indigenous cultures in the MENA region that Arab Imperialism erased? 

Do you know where the name “Palestine” is from? It is Hebrew for “invaders” referring to the Greek Phillistins who disappeared from the region around a thousand years before the first Muslim existed. So, the only reason the region was named Palestine to begin with was because of the Jews and the only reason it was called Palestine again was actually the British who wanted to name their mandate in a relatively neutral term at the time. The Arabs actually wanted to call it “Southern Syria.” They were not attached to the name “Palestine” because Palestine was never an independent region or a people. That is just a fact.

The only people who were ethnically cleaned in the region were the Jews. Some of the Arabs were displaced because they started a genocidal war against the Jews in 1948. 68% of them left without ever seeing an Israeli soldier. Hostile villages were displaced, but peaceful villages could stay and are now 20% of Israel’s popultion. Zero jews were allowed to stay alive in Arab controlled areas including Arab countries. 900,000 Jews were ethnically cleansed.

If you ask Israeli-Arabs they will invariably tell you that they prefer to live in Israel than in any Arab country and if Palestine is ever to exist as an independent country they would not want to live there. What do they know that you don’t?
Hah if you don't like ethno-states then you shouldn't be supporting the people whose very charter calls for establishing them. Israel is not an ethno-state. The ethnic cleansing of the ME has been done over and over by the Arabs. And it's Jews who have been ""cleansed."" 

Also please shut up with your ""as a Jew"" BS. That someone so ignorant of the history and the region thinks they have a right to speak for Jews and against Israel is really bizarre.
Ok, then. What are you doing to bring down the US then? Asking for UCPD.
YES. But to most of the people posting here, it seems they don't. Anti-semitism never dies and it's having a big fat resurgence now, all over, and very much so in beautiful Berkeley.
You sure? The only source I can find with the “400%” increase is the [ADL report](https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-records-dramatic-increase-us-antisemitic-incidents-following-oct-7) on “antisemitic incidents” that has been [quoted](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-antisemitic-incidents-up-about-400-since-israel-hamas-war-began-report-says-2023-10-25/) by some news outlets.

Per the ADL, “[Antisemitic Incidents](https://www.adl.org/stand-with-israel?utm_campaign=irshamatt2023&utm_medium=pr&utm_content=20231025)” include protests where “anti-Zionism expressions” are present. 

In fact, the FBI hasn’t released any data for 2023. The latest [data available](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics) is from 2022.
Arabs and Muslims are people, and you’re full of shit.
>nazis are just people bro

>the khmer rouge are just people bro!

Fuck off with that tired shit. Palestinians overwhelmingly support the war crimes committed on October 7th, and they openly support the terrorist organization that runs Gaza. 

They sowed the wind, and now they're reaping the whirlwind. Too bad. 

Terrorism is not a justified action because you've been taking mostly self inflicted L's for almost 100 years. Palestine has LOST. They lost 50 years ago. They need to get the fuck over it and accept peace.
Their government 🧐? If you are referring to Hamas, they tried to call for a ceasefire Netanyahu said nope. There are also over 478 children held in Israeli jails, without trial. Why not release those “prisoners.” You know Netanyahu doesn’t care about any hostages this is a land grab, clear as day.
“I fully knowledge the tragedy but those pieces of paper are so inconvenient 🥺 sometimes the side gates get a little crowded.”
I’m not arguing if it’s right or wrong but it was paper. Students opposing it just ripped into it. Point is it was being described as a blockade implying something more dramatic. At the end of the day it was paper. It’s annoying to some maybe, but it was really easy to just go around the side of the gate, on both sides.
The professor is protesting antisemitism on campus.
Many Jews in America are opposed to what is happening in Gaza, so how does attacking them for merely being Jewish make sense?
Enjoy the blood libel
I was talking about freedom of speech at UC Berkeley. The pro-Hamas crowd here can chant whatever violent heinous chant they want with impunity but a professor can't protest peacefully about that?

The Palestinians are in a war that their leaders started in the most atrocious way possible. Most Palestinians say they support these atrocities. You cannot expect to invade a country slaughter, torture and r\*pe without that country fighting back to dismantle the terrorists who did this and continue to be an existential threat to its civilians. The October 7th massacre was an optional activity, and definitely not a way they will ever get human rights. 

You do realize that Palestinians have very few human rights even without Israel? Gaza has been independent for almost 20 years. They have no women's rights, no LGBTQ+ rights. Is there any Arab country that offers human rights? I don't think so. 

But back to Israel/Palestine: everyone in the Middle East knows that if the Palestinians decide that they want to live peacefully beside Israel - it will happen. Most Israelis want that, and it almost happened in the 90s. However when the stated Palestinian goal is to wipe Israel off of the map, it's a bit of a problem and kind of a non-starter position of negotiations. Israel and its 9 million citizens including 2 million Arab citizens, don't want to be annihilated, you know?
I don't remember 124A ""War!"" being that difficult back when I took it, but that was nearly a decade ago (YMMV). There definitely was a lot of reading, but I don't remember it being such an inordinate lift for a Cal social science course. 

I also took Religion and Conflict with professor Hassner. He was one of my favorite political science professors at Cal.
Nobody does all the readings and you honestly don’t really need to because he provides all the exams in advance tho. Really you only need to stay up with the readings if you wanna be a Kahoot champion and get the  t-shirt.
Cool. Calling someone born there and having generations of family struggle due to his Judaism an antisemite merely because he doesn’t believe in your supremacist views. You can say whatever you want it doesn’t change generations of my family’s history nor their struggle in the homeland.
Theory and implementation can often be far apart.
That is definitely not the definition of Zionism. Brainwashed much? 

Zion is a different, also ancient name for Jerusalem, and Zionism is the belief that Jews have a right to self determine and self-govern in their ancestral homeland - Israel. That's it. It does not say that Arabs who lived in the region cannot live in the land or self-govern there, although historically they never did. They were offered multiple opportunities to self govern and do have autonomy since the Oslo accords, but they refused any offers for a state if it doesn't mean the annihilation of Israel, so here we are.
It is more than that. Hate towards not only the Palestinians, but other Jews, Christians, Somalis, Ethiopians. My parents tell me about times pre-Israel. They were in Iraq where a lot of the religions Muslim, Jew (not written as a mistake), and gentile would bond and commune. So much happened from the Baghdad bombings that my parents and grandparents said not in our names. I got the privilege of knowing (still do) and learning from Miko Peled and he has truly been a place of insight and support.
You are getting your numbers from Hamas. Not a reliable source. The October 7th attack was an unprovoked terror attack that targeted civilians, kids, women. Sexual atrocities were planned. 
About 900 civilians and 300 soldiers died. 
In contrast Israel is fighting a war against Hamas. It is not targeting civilians. Hamas stated just last week that it’s goal is to cause as many civilian casualties as possible because they benefit from the pressure on Israel. That’s why they are fighting from within urban areas, they don’t wear uniforms and they use civilians as human shields. So good job west - your protests are creating more casualties. 
The estimates are that 15,000 Hamas terrorists were killed. Hamas would have you believe that no one in Gaza is a male of fighting age. That’s obviously not true. 
You can’t really compare numbers. The Palestinians can stop the war at any moment by releasing the hostages and having Hamas surrender. Everyone would benefit if that happens.
i think what they mean is that free palestine its conflated to anti- semitism (though there are anti- zionist jews) , maybe we just don’t want there to be genocide and a whole population ignored… imperialism doesnt really care as long as the people in power can get what they want
There was no comparison. 
One group is actively getting massacred. The other isn't. Get a grip.
Palestinians are indigenous to the region, just as Ashkenzi Jews were.  [They're genetically identical](https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/2015-10-20/ty-article/palestinians-and-jews-share-genetic-roots/0000017f-dc0e-df9c-a17f-fe1e57730000).  

One subgroup converted to Judaism and left around 2,000 years ago, and one group stayed.  You're saying the people who left have the right to displace (or kill) the people who stayed, today, because they want to.  

It doesn't make sense.  Why do some people have the right to a home, while others don't?  Even more than that - why do some people have the right to actively steal others' homes?  

You're saying their ethnicity gives them that right.  

That's ethnic cleansing.
[deleted]
So should all 5,000+ ethnic groups on earth get their own country?

Should people in the Black diaspora go back to African nations and forcefully and violently displace the current inhabitants? FFS.

Should native Americans do the same to us? Are you familiar with the Land Back movement?

And Palestinians are just as native to that land as SOME of the current Israelis that inhabit it. You don’t get to erase them to make a claim over the land.
You're still advocating for ethnic cleansing based on the idea that a certain demographic ""deserves"" a country.  

If any other religio-ethnic group decided to try to take over a country or region and kill or displace all of its existing inhabitants, that would also be wrong.  

Which Muslim states are currently doing this?
End the occupation
You are sick. The amount of lies in your 2 posts above is sickening and I’m appalled to have people like you trying to represent the Jewish faith by throwing out false definitions, false statistics and now trying to claim the the images out of Gaza are being controlled by Hamas. Just stop. Simply say you believe in stoping antisemitism against Jews, why do you need to make up all these dramatic odd narratives. It’s actually embarrassing.
😂😂
Don’t waste your breath they just hate Jews
consider reading a history book, mishpucha
Keep lying and crying.. we all know Palestinians deserve their freedom back and an end to illegal colonizer settlements. All Israelis have a second home but Palestinians don’t. It’s their land, don’t forget 1917 when jewish refugees landed in Palestine and arabs literally shared their homes and food with them and not a single European country wanted them back then. Antisemitism is a European thing, it always has been like that.
You shouldn’t have to walk around it and deal with blood libel on campus.
The difference is that I accept that Israel now exists and that we can't go back to before it was built. Israel in its current form cannot continue but I don't see a future where it doesn't exist, albeit less nationalistic.
No, you made the assumption that Jews should be left to pogroms and death. No Jewish person like myself believes that. I believe that the name should once again be Palestine the illegal settlements be destroyed and a new one state be built, with a peacekeeping force in tow until the region can be built into one of most other countries.
Yeah I believe that Israel shouldn't have been established. But, news flash, it was, and destroying it isn't a solution that I will consider. I can not want something to happen and also acknowledge that it did and going forward has to address that.
Would you care to explain it to me and engage in discussion?
It's really interesting how you got ""and I speak for all Jews"" from me sharing my personal beliefs and experiences. It's almost like you're setting up a strawman argument because that's the best you can do.
The West Bank is controlled by Israeli, the wall does nothing to separate the illegal settlers and settlement expansion and violence that Israeli settlers commit on a daily basis in the West Bank. Stop spinning this compete BS. You know if you lived there there’s internal racism. I’m not exposing myself I’m half mizrahi and have Sephardic blood. I grew up in Haifa. I’m not brainwashed into not taking accountability to what our government allows to happen.
You’re ExPosIng YoUrSelf with ThE EthIoPian JeWs CommEnt.. 

Ffs… STOP. You’re so deep in hasbara BS it’s embarrassing that you got into Berkeley. Your critical thinking skills are nonexistent.
Yes--thank you for laying it all out there. Bravo.
It's a privilege, not a right. If you commit genocides then you lose that privilege.
FBI Director Christopher Wray in late October ‘23: “60% of all religious-based hate crimes targeted Jewish people”. 

That means more hate crimes against Jews than ALL other religious groups COMBINED. 

Jews make up 2.4% of the US population but 60% of these hate crimes (per FBI). If that alone isn’t reason to join together and fight antisemitism, I don’t know what is. 

And yes, the 400% stat comes from the ADL, but is reliable in this case and is backed up by the FBI.
[deleted]
Collectively labeling an entire ethnic group as inhuman to justify their extermination is straight out of the genocide playbook, little guy. With your casual “too bad” at the deaths of tens of thousands of human beings, you would have been right at home goose stepping through the streets of 1930s Berlin. Bro.
Of course, why should there be any ceasefire? There are still terrorists to eradicate, by whatever means necessary.
Those are not just pieces of papers. It blocked the whole gate. It’s not about how crowded the gate it. It’s every time u come to school, u have to have that emotional burden on you by attending this school cuz they accusing that we paid the tuition to UC who gave money to fund weapons. Why should we students pay for the sins that the politicians did?
What anti semitism is on campus?
What is it about this topic that makes so many people straight up delusional. Who are you talking about? Who’s attacking people for being Jewish?
If you'd read carefully what I said you'd see that I didn't call you an antisemite. I said Hatem Bazian is an antisemite, and he is.
[Incorrect](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68387864).  Those are international estimates.  

You're quoting a number 50% higher than even the IDF is claiming.  Not plausible.
What is happening in Palestine is horrible. I'm taking the Israeli-Palestinian conflict out of my opinion and comment. But that doesn't justify saying that anti-semitism is a lesser priority. it's now a bigger priority now than ever. Are you aware Jewish students have recently been attacked and called slurs on campus? Do you know anti-Jewish hate crimes nationally are at all-time highs?
So many inaccuracies in your comment. I actually read the original genetics research papers. First of all did you know that the Palestinian sample consists of 40 people? That’s a really small sample size. I could not find anywhere where these 40 were from and how that sample was selected. One study was retracted because it was insanely biased. So that is a huge red flag. 

People who identify as Palestinians today are mostly immigrants from Arab countries: Yemen, Egypt, Iraq, etc. most of them actually immigrated after 1882. That’s well documented in records, last names, and genetics. Of the Arabs who lived in the land of Israel before, some came with the Arab conquests of the 7th century and some families, especially in Hebron, were Jews who converted to Islam. If the researchers went to Hebron to those families specifically they’d find similarities with Jews. If they picked recent immigrants they would find less genetic overlap if at all. The Jews did not “convert to Judaism.” They are Judaism. There are Jews who stayed in Israel for thousands of years under very harsh conditions. They are still Jews. 
This is getting long but no land was stolen from Arabs. There was land lost in the war of 1948. A war the Arabs started. Name a village that was stolen before the war. 
Seven Arab countries started the war against Israel in 1948 and that’s when Arabs lost land. You really need to stop listening to the fairytales on Tik Tok.
The swearing really elevates your point.   

As stated before, the Jewish diaspora hasn’t always been treated well.  I think we all can agree to that.
If you call being second class citizens (dhimmis) and the occasional massacre peaceful, then sure it was great.

 Israel is the ancestral homeland of the Jews, there is Jewish archeology everywhere in Israel. It's even mentioned in the Quran that Israel is the land of the Jews.  Jews are indigenous to the land, and had continuous presence for thousands of years, despite all the hardships imposed by the various empires.  The Arab conquest was one of those invading forces and others followed. Jews have a legitimate claim to the land. You all love bringing up the Zionists from Europe, because it suits your current narrative of white vs. brown, but there were many Jews that came from middle eastern countries because of the whole ancestral homeland thing. The fact that Jews lived in Europe doesn't make them less indigenous. Even Ashkenazi Jews have middle eastern genes and many of them are quite dark skinned, if that matters to you. 

With the collapse of the Ottoman empire and the world wars that brought on many new nations and redrew borders in the middle east there was an opportunity for de-colonization of the land of Israel. The Jews had a claim, Arabs had a more recent claim - and so the land was divided. Seems fair given that the Arabs already had 22 states. But you have an issue with the one sliver of Jewish state? Not with any other country created during that time. Ask yourself why.
1) coexisting quite peacefully is provably false. 

2) you act like there was millions of inhabitants in the land when most of the country was barren. In 1920, the entire region was less than a million people. 

3) Between 1920-48 the population doubled to about 2 million people - much of this had to do with Jewish migrants escaping persecution in Europe or other parts of the Middle East and building cities, irrigation, etc. In that time the Arab population doubled due to immigration thanks to many of the new opportunities found in the land. It’s interesting that the Arab immigrants are never called “settlers” while the Jews who were escaping persecution in other countries (including Arab country’s where they were often treated as dhimis) are painted as some evil force.
uh oh white person with only instagram stories for information alert
if you cant see the difference in intent between Hamas and the IDF you're on some special crack
What about this comment was funny?
I am well versed in the topic, thank you.
You sound like a bot regurgitating the most absurd fairytales and inaccuracies. Does anyone believe this?? 
“Freedom back?” Arabs in Israel never had a state or a national identity. I’m not saying they shouldn’t have that, but they never did. They were living in villages under British control and before then under Ottoman control and never had a national identity until the 1960s. They never owned the land between their villages and most of them immigrated to the region after 1882. Of course there were Arabs living there for hundreds of years but about 800,000 Arab immigrants came after 1882 and their last names reveal where they are from. That’s 800,000 out of the 1.2 million who lived there in 1948. 

What’s that about 1917? Like way before the holocaust? Actually Jews have lived in the land of Israel continuously for thousands of years and Jews from the diaspora moved back continuously too. My great grandmother was born there in 1906, so. The modern Zionist movement started on the 19th century so you are very confused there. 
The beautiful story about Arabs taking in Jews is complete fiction. The Arabs had no control over who gets in. It wasn’t their land. The Ottomans did and the British did and they were reluctant to let Jews in. Still, Jews bought land and dried up swamps and sometimes lives peacefully with neighboring Arabs but there were frequent massacres that ethnically cleansed Jews from cities they lived in for thousands of years like the Hebron massacre in 1929 and many many more. 
Do you get your fairytales from Tik Tok?
It's not blood libel though it's just facts...
That’s a very convenient line of reasoning. No one is falling for this bs dude
Why should it be called Palestine when there was no “plaestine” prior. Do you mean the British mandate of Palestine, eretz Israel? If you mean the Ottoman Empire name of filistin, well that refers to the term Roman’s gave the land as an insult to Jews. It’d be like calling Africa “n-g—land”, why would such insulting things be allowed.

This peacekeeping force who staffs it. You are going back to British mandate period pre war of independence. That didn’t work either
The issue with a two state solution is that the Palestinians don’t want their own state. They want Israel to cease to exist. The majority of Palestinians reject the two state solution, which is why it’s never been accepted. A one state solution also isn’t tenable as the first thing that’ll happen is Palestinians voting to end the state of Israel, voting to expel all Jews, and make an end to state of israel
I misread. I think you do. I just think that it is understandable that many people interpret anti-zionism as supporting the destruction of israel. zionism means supporting the creation of a Jewish state. you may disagree with it being established in the first place. But now it exists. Then what does anti-zionism mean now, realistically? It would mean getting rid of the established Jewish state (aka Israel). 

I think this is a line of logic that some, if not many, anti-zionists believe. And even if they don't their rhetoric suggests this (I.e from the river to the sea). 

If you don't believe that, then I don't understand the purpose of the anti-zionist position. anti-zionism means nothing to you today then, as you disagree with the creation but you also don't think it should go away. what is the benefit of affirming your position on something that happened almost 100 years ago?

If you are anti-the-policies-of-Israel, which most people are (including Israelis), you don't have to do so as an anti-zionist. You can just critique the policies.
You're half right. I was picking up on something else. I figured it out. Good luck.
And yet profanity and no explanation from this Berkeley student ⬆️. Defensive much?
Under no definition is Israel committing a genocide, so. But also - that criteria was never used to determine the legitimacy of a country before.
“Yeah, but what did they do to piss off Hitler?” - your dumbass, circa 1940
Italian police have arrested three Palestinians based in central Italy who they said were planning attacks in an unspecified country, a police statement said on Monday.

The three men living in l’Aquila, about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Rome, had set up a cell linked to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, it said.

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades is an armed group that is linked to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah movement and is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the European Union and the United States.
\>huh I wonder if they have something to be angry about Nah must be just angry brown people problems

None of which gives them the right to kill and kidnap civilians. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you such a moral relativist that you are OK with war crimes because it's against what you perceive as whites?

\>you people are so transparent in your historically illiterate racist ass worldviews

nooooooooooooo you can refute my claims that violence is OK against people I don't like noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

\>Maybe you’d be an invertebrate who lays down and lets your opressor walk over you

shut up dude lol you sound fucking dumb

\>but being lucky enough to not be in that situation you have nothing of remote value to say about how they’re handling it

I'm not a moral relativist coward. I don't kill women and children and kidnap foreign nationals. I don't extort money from people for basic goods and services. I don't take water pipes and make crude fucking loser rockets out of them.

Most of all, I'm not so deluded to realize that after three failed wars, dozens of failed uprising, embracing terrorism, and creating a whole culture based on violence and revenge, that I've fucking LOST. 

It's over. Don't let anyone else get killed for your pathetic revenge culture.
Where did I say they were inhuman? Being alive doesn't give you a pass on terrorism and violence. 

I find it ironic you're comparing me to nazis, when I used a quote from Arthur Harris about justifying the use of strategic bombers on Germany. 

Palestine has chosen total war. It's not going to work. They're going to lose. 

Stop wasting everyone's time victim blaming and surrender.
Whatever means necessary….sure thing. Do you believe in eradicating the settlers in the West Bank who are also terrorists?
You haven’t noticed a rise in hate crimes against Jews?
LOL “you sound exactly like someone, but by all means dont think I’m comparing the two of you.”
The only source for these numbers are Hamas. The Hamas dead are actually IDF estimates. They could be higher now. 

https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-gaza-health-ministry-fakes-casualty-numbers
1. People can and do advocate for multiple things at once.

2. The rise in antisemitism deserves attention but unlike the current ongoing genocide in Palestine, it cannot be instantly stopped  by a decision made by a government. Addressing it takes work and time, and people are willing to do it. The same can be said about Islamophobia. 

3. Get a grip. Really.
This is absolutely inaccurate. Palestinians are descendants of the Cannanites and the Natufians. The art of Tatreez is a Palestinian artistic practice that began with the cannanites and it still practiced today. Head over to the ancestry thread and look at all the results Palestinians have been posting, the average Palestinian marks 60-80% Levant. Maybe stop listening to your Hasbara fairy tales, trying to make predominantly white Europeans native to a place they had an ancestor in 3 Millenia ago. As you know Historic Palestine was the a hub for trade and migration, the argument that there’s no such thing as Palestinians because ‘they’re all just Arab’ is so incredibly racist, Palestinians have their own distinct dialect, culture, and way of living. Palestinians were Arabized, most of their ancestors were converts from Judaism and Christianity pre 7th century. That’s why Palestinian Muslims and Palestinians Jews are more genetically related than Palestinian Jews to Ashkenazi Jews. 

Share your source on Palestinians being descended from Arab immigrants since you’ve said it’s sooo well documented.
Italian police arrest three Palestinians on terrorism charges

ROME, March 11 (Reuters) - Italian police have arrested three Palestinians based in central Italy who they said were planning attacks in an unspecified country, a police statement said on Monday.

The three men living in l'Aquila, about 120 km (75 miles)northeast of Rome, had set up a cell linked to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, it said.

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades is an armed group that is linked to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement and is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the European Union and the United States.

Police said the three Palestinians had been charged with criminal conspiracy for terrorism purposes or subversion of the democratic order, which carries jail terms of up to 15 years.

""The suspects engaged in proselytism and propaganda (...) and planned attacks, including suicide attacks, against civilian and military targets on foreign territory,"" police said.

One of the three men is wanted by Israel, which is at war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and an Italian court is examining an extradition request for him, the statement added.

In a separate statement, Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi hailed the arrest of ""three dangerous terrorists"" and said Italy was always on high alert against extremism and radicalisation.

There was no immediate comment by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.

So when are you going to get the fuck out of California?
I love how when arguments are dispelled methodically like this time and time again on this subreddit, everyone just disappears. It’s almost as if they don’t know how to respond to historical facts that severely weaken their false narrative
Are you white?
I don’t give a shit about intent, every single death since 10/7 on either side is a result of the occupation, end the occupation.
Don't try, UC Hamas students hate America and the west. Not surprising they're also antisemitic.
...you mean basic logic? And making points that I believe are true to support my overall conclusion. Wow very argue such intelligence.
Why are you making up origins about the word Palestine. It was given 2 millennia ago. Palestine is a much more accurate term as it refers to a specific area of land.
I mean. I don't know the statistics about that but that doesn't line up with my knowledge about the situation historically. After the past few months of murders and destruction I'd believe it though. But like. I'm allowed to want things that aren't necessarily going to happen you know. I'd like a two state or one state solution but that has to be predicated on a foundation of trust that has been systematically eroded by both sides of the conflict for decades, leading to the current tactic of Israel supporting Hamas' rise to power to then use their violent extremism as an excuse to eradicate Palestine. But that doesn't mean I don't hope for a better future ._.
Thanks for engaging in a substantive way, it's frustrating all the people who are just nitpicking seemingly to nitpick and not actually have a conversation. I genuinely appreciate the response. 

It's definitely understandable that people read anti-zionism as supporting the destruction of Israel. That doesn't mean that's a correct reading. I use it to mean a few things; 1, I don't support Israel. What I mean by that is that for me, Israel means no more to me than most other countries. Even though I'm Jewish, I don't want my identity tied to a country I've never been to that is committing violent acts against disempowered people based on religion and ethnicity. Second, it means I'm not in general in support of a Jewish state. I'm a strong proponent of a separation of church and state, and I dislike nationalism. Third, I don't think Israel should have been established in the first place, and I don't think that it's feasible or beneficial for it to continue existing in the state in which it necessarily oppresses Palestinians for its continuation.
Stfu, genocide supporter. Your ancestors would be embarrassed to know you exist.

A complete disgrace to humanity.
1. Tens of thousands of innocent people have been murdered and many more forced to leave their homes (for many, because they have been blown up). That is a genocide.

2. That's not what I'm saying. The US exists but doesn't have a right to exist. China exists and doesn't have a right to exist. Whatever country you live in exists but doesn't have a right to exist. No country has a right to exist. Existence is not a right a country gets. To clarify, I'm not talking about legal rights, but a sense of the word more in common with human rights (but not quite human rights as countries aren't humans)
So you admit that Israel is carrying out a genocide?

You’re right, I’m sorry. I didn’t commend your Arthur Harris-quoting. I’m undone by your erudition. I retract my statement. Kill em all.
Not a matter of MY belief. This is just reality - reap what you sow.
Uh no I haven’t what the fuck. What hate crimes are you talking about? I haven’t heard of a single hate crime on campus this year at all

What I have seen is a rise in support for Palestinians and protests against Israelis indiscriminate slaughter of children and efforts to starve the civilian population as well as a bunch of Zionists who are really mad people are criticizing Israel over their attempted genocide. Such as yesterday when a woman ripped down a sign calling for a ceasefire. 

Please give some specific examples of the antisemitism on campus that needs to be protested
There are ways to tell if a nation/people existed at any point in history. Especially in a region so rich with history and documentation like the Middle East.   
These are important questions to ask when evaluating if there was ever a people who identified as “Palestinians” before the 1960s:   
1. When did the Palestinians first start referring to themselves as “Palestinians?”  
2. What archeological artifacts exist that show their history in the land?   
3. Are they mentioned in the Quran? If they existed for 3000 years, as you say, then they should be mentioned in the Quran, no? In fact, the Quran never once mentioned the Palestinians, it does however say that the land of Israel belongs to the Jews.   
4. Are the Palestinians mentioned in any other ancient manuscripts? Even an old manuscripts? Any manuscripts before the 20th century? Exhibit A is the Google Book ngram which charts how often word is mentioned in books through the years. The word “Palestinians” gains traction after the 60s and is curiously missing around the time of the 1948 war. Exhibit B are MLK speeches. He never mentioned the Palestinians. He only mentions ""Arabs"" That's because he died in 1968, before the term “Palestinians” was popularized.   
5. Name a Palestinian leader prior to 1964. Every nation has a leader.   
6. What currency did they use?   
7. What was their flag prior to 1964?   
8. Why would they identify by a name that is Hebrew in origin, and not a name from their own culture? ""Palestine"" is the Hebrew name for ""invaders"" a term used to denote the ancient Philistines who were Greek and not related to modern Palestinians.   
9. Why do their genetic testing NOT show a ""Palestinian"" group and they show up as coming from Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc? 23 and me said that they cannot detect a “Palestinian” cluster, which is what you would expect to see in a nation that lived together for a long time. 

10 . Why do so many Palestinians have last names describing the places they came from? Al-Masri - from Egypt, Masarawah - also Egyptian,  Al-Khurani - from Horan is Syria, Al-Hijaz - from Saudi Arabia - and the list goes on and on.   
According to Ottoman census the number of non Jews (this includes Christians, Druze and others)  was 276,000 in the region.   
 In 1947 it was \~1.3 million that is more than 3 times than the natural growth of neighboring regions. Natural growth would have resulted in around 400,000 people. Arab immigration during those years was due to both work opportunities ironically because the Jews were building cities and their country and also for political reasons and because the Ottomans and the British didn’t really control the borders very well.

There is no “historic Palestine"" because Palestine was never a country it’s a Hebrew name given to a region by the Romans after the great revolt of the Jews in the second century.   
A dialect or a regional embroidery doesn’t make a nation. Jerusalem has their own dialect in Hebrew - they are not a different nation or a different country and it developed quickly over a few decades.   
Palestinians will tell you they are proud Arabs. They always identified as Arab so it's ridiculous to say that calling the Arab is racist.
I have participated in marches for African Americans , Muslims , women’s rights ….  However, this is not a discussion about those groups at this moment.  Currently, I’m participating in this discussion.  So, your “point” misses the mark.
Is there an expiration date to indignity? What is it? The Jews had a long diaspora but their religion, ethnicity and customs have all remained connected to the land of Israel and they had continuous presence there and continuous immigration to the land as well. Genetics studies show that even Ashkenazi Jews have middle eastern genes.   
You question the indignity of Jews but you do not question the indignity of people who came with the Arab conquests or the \~800,000 Arabs who immigrated to the land after 1882 from Yemen, Iraq, The Arabian Peninsula and Egypt? Do you think they are indigenous because they are “brown?” What about the Arabs who are blond with blue eyes? You’d exclude them? Just checking your logic here.   
Your Ohlone claim is funny because people on your side actually say the is absolutely what should happen. The US is obviously a colonial project and yet you all are perfectly happy living here whereas you claim Israel is a colonial project and needs to end.   
That said, not everything can be mapped to your western frame of reference. The last nation in Israel was the Jewish nation. Since then, the land was occupied by empires. There has never been another nation in Israel, independent or not, so the situation is different than the US which is an existing nation.   
Around WWI/WWII many new countries were created: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon. But you have only issues with the Jewish state.
So as I explained it’s your side that says America should fall. I don’t. The US exists, it’s a nation. There was no nation or country in the land of Israel. Look it up. There were Muslims and Jews and Christians and Druze and Baha’i and more. There was no Palestinian identity then. None of them owned the land between the villages. The Arabs wanted the land the Jews wanted the land so a partition plan was made. It was one of the most fair creations of a state. The Arabs refused the offer 7 Arab armies started a war against the Jews with clearly stated genocidal intent- and lost. So Israel was created both by international agreement and by war that it did not start. The Quran says that Israel is the land of the Jews. It also says that land that was once Muslim is forever Muslim. But since the land was also Jewish and they have 22 other states it seems a bit greedy no?
but they downvote 😂 and delete their comment
Ottoman Empire didn’t call it Palestine. So not sure I agree.

Also your entire premise is the destruction of state of Israel. Which will lead to the death of all Jews in the area. Especially given the surrounding Muslim countries HAVE ethnically cleansed their Jewish population. 

So in practical terms you are calling for the expulsion of Jews in the area, likely by mass slaughter.
likewise . 

the first two i understand . the third however , i feel is what i was talking about . what does it mean that you don’t think it’s feasible or beneficial for it to continue? what is the outcome that you are suggesting or implying there? or is it just a sentiment you hold that you don’t think should equate to any action? this last one seems unlikely. 
and the idea that it should not continue i think is what leads people to the conclusion that you want it gone.
You seem nice.
I've never read anything so aggressive that said absolutely nothing. You can typically tell who the pudding brains are by the way they use curse words to add validity to a ""statement"".
If you are smart enough to get into Berkeley you should be smart enough to know the difference between a war and a genocide. Things have definitions. 

This is a war. Wars are terrible, but a genocide requires an intent to erase a group of people. Israel went to extreme lengths to prevent civilian deaths: 

[https://www.newsweek.com/israel-implemented-more-measures-prevent-civilian-casualties-any-other-nation-history-opinion-1865613](https://www.newsweek.com/israel-implemented-more-measures-prevent-civilian-casualties-any-other-nation-history-opinion-1865613)

We do not actually know the number of victims because Hamas numbers cannot be trusted. [https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-gaza-health-ministry-fakes-casualty-numbers](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-gaza-health-ministry-fakes-casualty-numbers)

Notice how they never report any terrorists killed? about 15,000 Hamas terrorists were reportedly killed. The ratio of civilian to terrorist in modern urban warfare is usually around 12:1, in this war, if we believe Hamas numbers it's 2:1 - these are not genocide numbers. Despite Hamas extreme efforts to maximize Gaza civilian casualties. They admitted it. 

Have you ever heard of a genocide that can be ended by a terror organization releasing hostages and surrendering? Or a genocide where the genocider offers ceasefire after ceasefire and the victims refuse the ceasefire? Me neither.
It’s okay to admit you were wrong on this one
None of which justifies murdering civilians, taking babies hostage, using human shields, or mass killing foreign nationals at a music festival.

Fucking hamas sympathizers
No one but the most deluded wants anyone else to die. But it's so naive expecting Israel to just stop trying to kill Hamas when they launched a war of extermination against Israelis.

That's the whole point of the quote. You don't get to do that and then sit at the table as if it's just another skirmish.  Palestine needs to accept their new reality
lol that’s hypocritical
>1. When did the Palestinians first start referring to themselves as “Palestinians?”

Does not justify stealing peoples' homes and murdering them.  

>2. What archeological artifacts exist that show their history in the land?

Does not justify stealing peoples' homes and murdering them. 

>3. Are they mentioned in the Quran? If they existed for 3000 years, as you say, then they should be mentioned in the Quran, no? In fact, the Quran never once mentioned the Palestinians, it does however say that the land of Israel belongs to the Jews.

The Bible also says many other things, such as outlining ""good"" practices for keeping slaves, stating that adulterers and many other 'criminals' should be stoned to death, and it even mandates forced rape and marriage of underage girls in a number of situations, etc. 

Ultimately, quoting the Bible on a topic like this means you're a Biblical fundamentalist, which puts you at odds with ~any reasonable person in the modern world.  If you want to quote the Bible, I'll simply point out that if I beat you to death, I should, according to the Bible, also kill your male children and any deflowered girls in your household.  And I should take your virgin daughters as sex slaves.  

It's just not a good look.  The Bible is a religious text that should have ~no relevance in modern law or politics.  

If you still want to go that route, I'd also be obliged to point out that the Bible is no more ""legitimate"" of a religious text than the Quran.  If you want to go by religious texts, an Islamic holy war against the Jewish state of Israel is not only justified - it is commanded by God.  

...I really wouldn't invoke the Bible to support your argument here, if I were you.  

It doesn't surprise me that you're trying to use the Bible to justify genocide, though.  That makes perfect sense, given the content of the book.  

The history books also disagree with the Bible on this front, since even when ""Judea"" was a region, it was literally owned by other groups, such as [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt) and Rome.  ""Israel"" didn't exist.  It was a region of Egypt where a lot of people who followed the Old Testament lived.  Those tribal pseudo-religions eventually became the various Judeo-Christian religions, including Islam and Christianity, all of which address to the Old Testament in different ways.  

>4. Are the Palestinians mentioned in any other ancient manuscripts? Even an old manuscripts? Any manuscripts before the 20th century? Exhibit A is the Google Book ngram which charts how often word is mentioned in books through the years. The word “Palestinians” gains traction after the 60s and is curiously missing around the time of the 1948 war. Exhibit B are MLK speeches. He never mentioned the Palestinians. He only mentions ""Arabs"" That's because he died in 1968, before the term “Palestinians” was popularized.

Hardly.  

The region was initially called Canaan, and was occupied by Canaanites, descended from a mixture of earlier Levantine populations and migrants coming from the Caucasus region or modern-day Iran.  Judeans occupied and conquered Palestine, or Canaan, beginning in the late 2nd millennium BCE.  It was later called Judea by Greeks and Romans, until the Roman Emperor Hadrian changed its name to Syria Palaestina, ~125 CE.  Canaan -> Judea -> Syria Palaestina.  And I'm no historian, but it's safe to assume that the region was called something else before it was called Canaan.  I think it's enough to show that it had a different name and people with ties to other regions before Judeans arrived, though, since that renders your argument completely invalid.  

So, if you want to go the ""historic"" route, both indigenous Palestinians and Iran have a better claim to Palestine than Zionists.  Their people were there first.  

But that's honestly kind of miselading, since we know that there are ~no genetic differences between Palestinians and Ashkenazi Jews.  The real answer is that Judaism and the Old Testament didn't exist before ~2,000 BCE, and your superimposing of modern geopolitics and religious divisions onto a period when none of them existed just doesn't make sense.  

And, at the end of the day, that's the kind of argument you're trying to use to justify *ethnic cleansing.*  

It doesn't matter what happened 3,000 years ago.  Murdering people and stealing their homes today is wrong.  

>5. Name a Palestinian leader prior to 1964. Every nation has a leader.

Name an Israeli leader prior to 1940.  No leader?  I guess we can genocide them, then.  

And don't come back with some Biblical BS.  If you want to play that card, we can just look back in time to before the rulers of Canaan and Judea, [the Egyptian Pharoas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt).  So, [paleolithic times](https://www.britannica.com/place/Canaan-historical-region-Middle-East).  I guess we can run around conducting DNA tests on corresponding archaeological sites to try to find extant lineages of the ""earliest people who lived there"" as best we can tell, since that seems to be how you think ownership of the region should be implemented.  

But at the end of the day, you're still talking about murdering innocent people because of stupid, convoluted arguments like that, and I've had enough of this.  You are a morally bankrupt person, and if the Biblical concepts of God, Heaven, and Hell actually do exist in this universe, you'd better hope that Jesus' forgiveness applies to Jews, because, if it doesn't, you are going straight to Hell.  

Enough of this.

I agree that all imperialist, colonial, genocidal empires should fall. 


Even if there was no nation (which not true considering the fact that the Palestinian identity and culture have been recognized and in existence), no one is entitled to ethnic cleansing people from their land.

This is why Israel is a colonizer state. It’s giving manifest destiny — genocide.
Hmm. I don't think Israel can or should exist in the state in which it has to oppress Palestine. I don't really have a solution - if it was that simple it would have already happened I would hope. That said, I don't really have hope that a two-state solution will happen, or an integrated state where the rights of Palestinians are as enshrined as that of everyone else. But that's what I'd like. I know there are people who want to kick all the Jews out and while I understand that position, I don't agree with it. So I guess it's a sentiment that I hold. I would like action to be taken but I don't think any international organization is really interested in doing so, given the US's interest in Israel as a Western outpost and the stranglehold the Security Council has over any actual change via the United Nations.
[deleted]
But you justify it when Israel does equally and more barbaric acts of violence? Why?
But Israel is not just killing Hamas right? 70% of the people murdered have been children and women. Never the fact that there’s no way 100% of the men killed were Hamas members too. 

Stop this blood thirsty revenge nonsense. 

Israel is losing all support globallly and younger American generations will not support their BS moving forward. Tides are turning and Israel should be strategic about how it moves forward — but the thirst for revenge and land overshadows all rationale.
You’re so dumb you don’t know what “hypocritical” means? Why are you on this subreddit? Clearly you don’t belong at UCB
lol, oh stop it. Palestine has received billions of dollars from the U.S. Where do you think a lot of money goes?

So let me get this straight - if the U.S. lessened its funding to Israel, you wouldn’t care what Israel does?
 Ok so   
1. Where's the Jewish empire? Never heard of it. 

  
2. That is historically incorrect. The Palestinians people are not mentioned in texts up until the 1960s and into the 1970s. This is not to say Arabs did not live in villages there but they had no national identity. If you think otherwise then please find the proof. MLK did not mention the Palestinians. He talked about Arabs but not Palestinians because he died in 1968 before Palestinians became a used term. 

Newspapers of he time also talked about the Arabs. They had a pan-Arab identity and were not a nation. When the British mandate was created the Arabs actually petitioned for the mandate to be called “Southern Syria” and not ""Palestine."" The word Palestine is foreign to Arabs. It is a Hebrew word describing Greek invaders who disappeared from the land in 600BC. The word ironically means ""invaders"" in Hebrew. If you look at analysis of books and words mentioned in them, the word Palestinians starts showing up in any significant numbers in the 1960s. People can identify whichever way they want, but they can't change history. 

  
3. In its declaration of independence Israel called for peace. They said they will be the country of al its citizens no matter religion, sex, race etc. The only reason people were displaced was that 7 Arab countries started a war against Israel in 1948 clearly stating that their goal is to genocide the Jews. Still, 68% of Arabs who left did so without ever seeing an Israeli soldier. Peaceful Arab villages were allowed to stay and are now Israeli citizens who enjoy more rights than they would in any Arab state. The Jews however were ethnically cleansed from ALL Arab controlled areas including places where they lived continuously for thousands of years like Jerusalem and Hebron. They had an hour to leave before they shot them. Practically all Jews from Arab countries were also ethnically cleansed - 900,000 in total.   
 It’s really not the injustice you think it is, and was not a unique situation of war a displacement then or even now.   
Finally - you seem to have an issue with Imperialism. What about Arab Imperialism. That’s OK with you?
you said you think action should be taken but you don’t think it’ll happen. i am struggling to understand what action you’re referring to
There is a huge gulf between seeing nuance, and being a moral relativst coward who is incapable of acknowledging that Palestine does not have the moral high ground at all here. You don't get to declare a war of extermination for a fourth time and then claim ""it was just a prank bro"". 

>because for the IDF, the crimes of Oct 7 are an average weekend

Stupid ass hyperbole bothsidesism. Are you seriously deluded? Do you understand that the Palestinians primary strategy has been terrorism for 60 years?

>what is it going to take for you to understand why people are not okay with this???

You don't give a shit about people dying. About actual life. If you did, you'd be as just as mad about Sudan. 

You're here to flex your progressive cred and feel like you did something cool standing up for the *oppressed*. Yet you're simping for a what has basically become a death cult, run by mobsters.
Hypocritical Netanyahu supporter….you shut up you clearly don’t even go to school here. Probably some 50 year old right wing Bibi supporter trying to make sure he fills up the college Reddit with propaganda lies.  “Reap what you sow.” That’s very hypocritical self righteousness is oozing out of that comment.
[deleted]
I mean. I think that the UN should sanction Israel until they stop killing people and then moderate a peace treaty and enforce it (obviously this includes sanctioning Hamas as well but like they're terrorists, they're never not sanctioned). However, unfortunately for me I study international human rights organizations, politics, and law, so I know that there is essentially no possibility that is going to happen.
Oh the ranting, further proving your inadequacy. I’m an alum, not a Netanyahu supporter, not old, and not interested in propaganda. You don’t get to make up stories about people who disagree with you.
That’s a deflection. That’s not what I asked. 

Also, btw, Israel didn’t enjoy impunity because the U.S. didn’t materially support Israel in its first few decades after inception. It also doesn’t enjoy significant impunity today; fighting a war of self defense in an attempt to eradicate a terrorist organization is quite difficult.
No one is ranting. You said “by whatever means necessary” that is a very right wing Bibi government ideology. It was an assumption, based off your comments of what seem to extremist nature. Reap what you sow…..those kids did nothing. To deserve starvation, to die. That is cruel, and evil. It’s heartbreaking and you know it’s got nothing to do with releasing hostages.
Also keep insulting me, I speak 4 languages, English isn’t my strongest. Would you like to speak in Hebrew?
[deleted]
Nah, that’s just war. Maybe they shouldn’t have raped and murdered Israelis. Reap what you sow, mofos.
No thanks, you don’t have anything worthwhile to say. (And do you want a pat on the back for being multilingual? Really? Many of us are).
So you’re okay with money going to Palestine (which is likely funneled directly to Hamas) but not Israel?

What if Israel received less money - on par with other countries the U.S. funds. Then what?
Woah. You are definitely trolling now.
You can’t speak Hebrew huh? Awwww don’t worry a lot of Jewish Americans cant….I can teach you if you like 😉😉
A pat? I was explaining my English usage, dip shit

I 100% agree with you. However it becomes difficult when individuals take criticism of their ideology as criticism of that individual. In many environments, individuals are not able to critique ideologies because feelings get hurt. Individuals need to know how to separate their ideology from personal identity. I believe we should respect every individual and question every ideology. Academic communities (on both the left and right) have attached their personal identity to their ideology (Evangelicals, LGBTQ+) and we are unable to critique the extremist aspects of these ideologies without “disrespecting” individuals that subscribe to these ideologies which has disallowed critical discussion surrounding said ideologies at academic institutions.

**Two UC Berkeley professors have clashed on Israel-Palestine. War led them to a joint message**

*As tensions rise on campus, can one email make a difference?*

Ron Hassner sat in front of his computer last Wednesday feeling a combination of stress, pain and determination. The day prior, unsettling events had taken place on the campus of UC Berkeley, where Hassner, a professor of political science, directs the Helen Diller Institute for Jewish Law and Israel Studies.

A collection of primarily Jewish students had gathered on the steps of Sproul Plaza to read the names of the people who had been killed and kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel. But during the ceremony — which echoed a practice common to remember victims of the Holocaust — they were confronted by a group of anti-Israel peers.

“They jeered, laughed and even did a couple of Nazi salutes,” said Hassner, who learned about the event from colleagues who were present. Within seconds, students were getting into each other’s faces. A campus rabbi, Hassner said, physically stood between the two sides, even taking a few blows.

Compelled to do something to prevent further escalations to violence, Hassner’s mind went to his colleague, Hatem Bazian, a lecturer who teaches courses on Palestine, Islamophobia and post-colonial studies. When it comes to Israel and Palestine, the two scholars could not see things more differently.

In the past, the two have faced off in debates about campus involvement in the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, which this year saw a Berkeley student group adopt a resolution that banned speakers who support Israel and Zionism. While their disagreements are undergirded by mutual professional respect, they also see their roles on campus quite differently.

“I like to think that my students understand that I am a professional scholar and that I’m not a propagandist,” said Hassner, who strives to compartmentalize his Israel identity from his scholarly pursuits, especially in the classroom.

But for Bazian, personal connections to Palestine permeate his research, his teaching and his relationships with students. Having founded the pro-Palestinian campus organization Students for Justice in Palestine as a graduate student in 2001, being an activist is a core part of who he is.

“To only teach is a luxury I don’t have,” Bazian said.

Perhaps the two scholars could do something together to call for calm, Hassner thought — not in the Middle East, but on their Berkeley campus. So he fired off a quick email, asking Bazian if he would be open to drafting a joint statement condemning violence and advocating for civil disagreement. But as Hassner hit send, he felt nervous.

Prominent U.S. college campuses from Stanford to Columbia have struggled to navigate expressions of solidarity with Israelis or Palestinians. Gaffes and provocations have been abundant, including an incident at Harvard in which students were publicly shamed on billboards and websites for criticizing Israel. A Berkeley law professor publicly called for firms not to hire his students who expressed anti-Israel sentiments, labeling them antisemitic.

Even before the events of this month, moments in which two opposing sides meet with and listen to each other felt increasingly rare. At a polarized time at the beginning of a polarizing war, was it even possible to bridge what Hassner and Bazian both felt to be a widening gulf? And what could such a small gesture achieve anyway?

*Fractured pasts*

Hassner grew up in Israel and has friends who were shot and killed while protecting their teenage son from the Hamas attacks. He believes in a two-state solution, one in which Israel has a right to exist as a country, but in which its occupation of Palestinian land should end. But he is unequivocal in his condemnation of Hamas. To him, the group’s attacks on Israeli civilians were acts of terrorism, pure and simple.

Bazian, on the other hand, views Israel as an apartheid and colonial state. A Palestinian born in Nablus on the West Bank, he has friends and students who have lost loved ones in Gaza. Last week, his cousin who lives in the Israeli city of Haifa was jumped and badly beaten by a group of strangers. To him, the present conflict is a consequence of historic and continuing Israeli oppression of Palestinians, as well as an outcropping of Palestinians’ collective plight for justice and liberation.

In light of those differences, Hassner described reaching out to Bazian as the hardest thing he has done as a scholar.

“I respect him and I always have … (but) we are not friends, we are not chummy,” Hassner said. “I’m not even sure he likes me.”

Bazian was at home putting finishing touches on a midterm exam when he saw Hassner’s email pop into his inbox. The issue deserved his full attention, so he responded saying that he would think about it. Within a few hours, Bazian accepted. A message like that coming from two campus leaders, one Israeli and the other Palestinian, just might resonate, he thought.

When Hassner saw the reply, he said he burst into tears. “It just offers a little glimmer of humanity and respect and civility at a time you see photos from the Middle East that are just harrowing,” said Hassner, who studies religious terrorism and called the recent events in the region a “festival of death.”

Bazian likewise felt the weight of the moment. He was able to relate to the goals of someone with whom he is often vehemently at odds. Tensions and emotions are high on campus, and Bazian, like Hassner, said he feels it is his duty to prevent students from using the crisis to do further harm.

“Have your space to present your view, but don’t cross a line,” he said.

*An open wound*

Their joint message went out as an email from the chancellor’s office last Thursday afternoon. Written by Hassner and edited by Bazian, it acknowledged that “disagreement and different points of view are an essential part of life,” but asked readers to show each other “respect and dignity,” just as the colleagues were modeling not only by collaborating on a statement, but also in their years of civil, facts-bound debate.
yea but sometimes some ideologies are just violent and destructive and defense of them is just so apprenhensible that it’s inherent personal. for example, denying the holocaust or being racist is pretty much universally seen as not just an ideology but also a negative personal attribute. hard to separate those from a person
Shut up, lol.

Since the statement’s release, responses from students and colleagues have been widely positive, both scholars said. But Bazian and Hassner emphasize that they are promoting civil disagreement, not political compromise. “We’re not asking people to change their minds on the issue,” Bazian said. “We’re asking people to recognize that you don’t need to hurt or confront the other in an (aggressive) way to make your point of view land.”

When asked how their joint statement will shape future collaboration and dialogue, both scholars said it is too early to say. “The wound is still open and bleeding,” said Hassner, noting that tensions on campus may worsen yet as Israel prepares for a ground invasion and both sides point fingers over the destruction of a Gaza hospital. On Monday, dueling pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protests made their voices heard at the Sather Gate, but remained peaceful.

For his part, Bazian hopes the statement will make students think about who among their peers might be impacted by inflammatory rhetoric. “We fail to recognize who is walking on campus and the pain that is on their shoulders,” he said, citing a Palestinian student who is struggling to focus on midterm exams while unable to reach loved ones in Gaza.

They see their roles as leaders and educators as important tools in achieving change — which they say is only possible through informed debate. “Maybe we can teach our way out of this,” Hassner said. “But that requires campus to be a healthy, open-minded place of learning.”

On a campus known for embracing culture clashes and facilitating political dissent, that may sound inconsequential, Hassner continued. But it could also lead to new and fruitful dialogue.

“All we have is the respect that scholars owe to one another and the understanding that the campus is a sacred place,” he said. “That’s very little, but it’s something.”
