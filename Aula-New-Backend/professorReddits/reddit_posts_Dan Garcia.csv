Haha he does a Hamilton one for cs10 as well
I like how yokota is just sitting there but for 61b he was the one being super enthusiastic
Dan the Man back at it again 😤😤
dan the goat
👍👍🤩
he always does haha
The guy lost his mind ears ago
When was Yokota ever enthusiastic? I thought he was a really bad lecturer for 61b, I must’ve missed something

Where are you watching it?"
"Dan Garcia, CS10 instructor, featured in Code.org video: ""Why top universities teach drag and drop programming""",http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mwc1gc77dc,2014-09-17 02:12:10,,"The outrage in the comment section of that video is really something..
Fuck yes. Miss CS10--wish I could use drag and drop languages in my actual job.
A better title should have been ""Why Liberal Arts Majors should learn drag and drop programming"".

I fought that class so hard, it nearly killed me but I got through it well enough by the end. I knew it would be beneficial as an English major with plans of working at a tech company to know a little more than wikipedia level knowledge of programming.

Happy to report I now have a non technical position at a mark cuban backed start up and the knowledge from this class definitely helps me to not be completely lost when listening to our engineers daily reports. :)
20 year labview developer here... 

I'd prefer if you guys would all stick to emacs. More work available for me if programming stays hard. 
That seems pretty ridiculous.  Yes it's easier to learn, but how many companies will actually have a drag and drop interface you can use?  Seems like you should spend those extra two weeks learning the text based interface and how to identify errors.  (BTW, I had this guy back in 2000 when it was all text based.  It wasn't that hard even though Garcia was a complete dick.)
Essentially it's learning to crawl before learning to walk.


How do you not like Garcia. Damn man, controversial opinions

HOT TAKE : Zoom University CS classes not much different from pre-COVID CS classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jxelex/hot_take_zoom_university_cs_classes_not_much/,2020-11-19 16:11:59,"Sure, there's no more labs and discussion, but the quarantine hasn't fundamentally changed the formula. If anything, professors, especially Dan Garcia, are putting in more effort in the production quality of their classes.","as someone who never went to class, the only thing that’s changed for me academically are the exams lol.
Agreed. The problem isn't that the classes aren't being ran as well -- the problem of Zoom university lies in the underlying mental health issues (burnout, lack of motivation, depression, **harder to find study groups**, etc.) that online learning causes which *then* contributes to a poor learning environment.  

Online CS classes are still being ran like a well oiled machine. It's honestly extremely impressive.
I think it’s pretty hard to learn in the labs and discussions, also to mention the tutorials are only 25 mins every week.
Agree to a certain extent - with CS, personally I find in-person study groups to be really helpful for projects/labs, which arguably constitute a greater part of the CS learning experience than just straight lectures/discussions.
The online model works quite well, perhaps even better, for big lectures. Certainly not for labs and discussions.

It will be interesting to see which parts we keep once we are allowed to do anything in person.
Also, if your exams are not proctored and the grades in the class are curved. 

Massive cheating\~\~
Nothing really changed except for the fact that we can’t go to the libraries to study which was super helpful
agree!! i literally never attended lecture or discussion before anyway, so my attendance has actually gotten better since covid lol
I feel like group projects could suck twice as much. Especially mandatory group projects. You should have the option to do solo projects during remote learning.
I don't think this is a hot take
Yes.  Astute observation.  The students are still awkward and don't collaborate with anyone.
The overall structure is the same, but UC Zoom is lacking some key elements for learning.

1. In-person labs were an excellent place for students to interact with one another and the TAs.  By removing the human interactions, the labs become significantly more difficult - if you (and your partner) get stuck, you have to wait hours to get help.  This is really bad for classes like CS61C and EECS151 (and others), where the labs are very technical and a small mistake (such as a typo or mis-used pointer) can lead to odd modes of failure. A TA looking at the code might be able to spot the error in a few minutes due to seeing the error before, but it may take the student hours to discover cause of the error on their own.
2. Office hours are so much worse - overall wait time (for 61C) has spiked from \~10 minutes on a normal day to \~1 hour, and on project deadline days the OH queue forces students to wait upwards of 4-5 hours.  Students used to be able to interact with one another while waiting, and could listen in to the TA helping other students with similar issues.  CS61C attempted to encourage students to do this with discord, but nearly no one utilizes it (and discord's screen sharing is awful).
3. As many others mentioned, study groups are harder to organize and implement.  It's also significantly more difficult for isolated/antisocial students to interact with classmates.  Even if a student skipped live lecture and only briefly attended labs pre-covid, they still had many opportunities to meet others in the course.
4. Exams are awful.  Exams without proctoring result in a ton of cheating, giving honest students working alone a major disadvantage.  The current modes of proctoring used by EE/CS classes are very invasive and stressful, and put even more stress on students with less-than-optimal workspaces and those that lack required recording equipment.

These factors combined make the overall quality of instruction significantly worse, and lead to a decrease in morale for both students and staff.  While the release of lectures/labs/projects/etc runs smoothly, the knowledge imparted from each element is less than what it used to be.
would u say exams are easier or harder this semester? I'm a new student and I find most of my exams to either be hard or easy and graded harshly (like easy to lose points while still understanding concepts), and apparently, some say it's way easier this semester :'(
Agreed... Friends and study groups were the best.
what are tutorials?
jw, what CS/EECS classes aren't proctored? i was under the impression all were
When the takes just aren't hot enough. hahah
>wewladdy0

You mean collaborating on the exams? sure, lots of people who are not so awkward do
I mean I've never taken the classes I'm currently taking before, so hard to say. Based on past exams though they don't seem any easier?

Projects definitely got easier this semester though. Some requirements were taken out to make them shorter.
I am in zero study groups because its hard to find and I made like one friend in the cs course who is now dropping.
They are “online” version of group discussions with TA like small study groups 4-5 people
Only CS classes are all proctored.

Just name a few here:

EECS 127, EECS 126, EE 105, EE 12O., EECS 16B...

There are also many other Engineering classes (non-CS/EECS)
you are the first person ever to note my username.  I thought everyone here was so dense
In addition to discussion section?
ah thanks i had no idea
The discussions are the whole class looking at the live TA lecture whereas the tutorial is 4-5 people.
damn our discussion sections were basically one-on-one's and I knew almost everyone in my discussion section + my TA on a p personal basis but I guess that's how summer sessions are with the smaller class size"
EECS department releases new grading guidelines. Dan Garcia: Increasing inflation has leaked into the grading process; students have progressively performed at a higher rate. He explained students were hurt by old guidelines because inflation was prevalent among comparable departments nationwide.,http://www.dailycal.org/2017/06/02/eecs-department-releases-new-grading-guidelines/,2017-06-02 21:31:33,,"""I had been more harsh in the past, and this clarifies what I should do in the future,” wrote an anonymous Professor Hilfinger
> the old policy, which marked a “typical GPA” for a lower-division class as 2.5-2.9, has been redefined as “in the range (of) 2.8-3.3

Holy shit god is real
This doesn't change anything. The average grade in lower div classes was already in this range. They just updated the policy to actually reflect this trend. 
from what time period? you'll have to be specific. please,
atleast since I have been here. So, Fall 2014 to now but it could of have easily been earlier too. I know that none of my lower div CS classes were ever below a 2.8 and were closer to a 3.1 And within last year since the gpa req increased to 3.3. It seems like the average gpa is around a 3.2. 
I assumed the average was 2.7-2.9 for most CS classes and I started in 2012. I'm not sure where to find the stats but no worries

Incoming data science freshman schedule. Thoughts or Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xx9lv/incoming_data_science_freshman_schedule_thoughts/,2023-07-12 11:55:32,"1. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler (mixed reviews on RMP but seems like a hard professor), CS 61A with Prof. John Denero (not sure if I’ll enroll as a DS major and with 300 waitlist max), and EPS 7 Climate Change and Computer science mentors (not sure how to enroll in CSM)

2. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler, DATA C8 w/ Prof. Swupnil Sahai, EPS 50 Planet Earth w/ Michael Manga

3. Math 32 (Precalculus) w/ Prof. Rui Wang (bad reviews on RMP but not suer if I should enroll in precalculus since I want to do well in calculus at Cal), CS 10 w/ Dan Garcia (friendlier pace than CS 61A) and some other random GE course

4. Math 32 w/ Prof. Rui Wang (again, has bad reviews on RMP), Data C8, and some random GE.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like. 

Also, could anyone recommend any easy and fun 7-breadth courses? That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",I like the first one with Data 8 instead of EPS 7
What are the options for an outsider to access course materials for a single course (CS10 in my case) for self-study for free or by paying?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1454rps/what_are_the_options_for_an_outsider_to_access/,2023-06-09 06:05:49,"Context: I am not a student of Berkeley. I am from India, so attending anything in-person is not possible, nor can I afford it.

I am specifically interested in CS10: Beauty and Joy of Computing. I am looking for course materials from a semester:

1. Which is somewhat recent (within last 2-3 years), so that the material is not too outdated, as the overview covers what is currently happening in the world of CS

2. Where all course materials for self-study are included: lecture recordings, assignments, labs access (no login required), discussion recordings, reading materials, Project PDFs, and anything else that won’t require any Berkeley employee (professor or TA or others) to help me in-person

3. Preferably having Prof. Dan Garcia as the lecturer (as his lectures seemed to me the best/most coherent/exciting)

Some more context:

* I am primarily interested in the lecture videos, in case not all of it can be accessed. I am not interested in getting any person to help me out, be it a TA or Professor or even classmates

* If this were available for free, it would be absolutely great and would love it if anyone could point to the right link

* If there is any paid option to take this single course, I would love to know that

* This BJC course used to be available in Coursera and other MOOC websites, but now I can’t find it anywhere

* I don’t require any in-person guidance. I have some experience in programming and just want to make sure I know the fundamentals right.

What are my options?","The lecture recordings and slides for CS10 from Spring 2022 don't seem to require a berkeley.edu login to access: https://cs10.org/sp22/

However, the instructor is Michael Ball and not Dan Garcia.
Videos are not available to public because of lawsuit that claimed they violated some disability law. Professors are not supposed to make them public and old videos were taken down.

There is nothing special about Berkeley courses. Classes at Berkeley are often too theoretical and you might benefit from taking more practical classes. Consider taking introduction to programing on Coursera or Udemy.
I have actually tried those videos from Fall 2022. No offense intended to Michael, but I had a lot of difficulty following what he is saying. I am not a native speaker, so Dan's coherent way of speaking and his experience helps a LOT in understanding the material.
I don’t think Dan has ever / has recently taught CS 10 (or even 61A) so you’re probably out of luck if you’re looking for Dan specifically. You could try another university
Are you certain about that? I saw Dan Garcia listed as the Instructor in sp23, fa22, sp21, fa20, sp20, since 2020, besides many more older semesters.

Here's the link for the most recent ones:
https://cs10.org/sp23/staff/
https://cs10.org/fa22/staff/
Oh nevermind then! Sorry about that. I somehow always remembered Ball teaching CS 10. You can just access the Sp 23 course website then if you want to watch his videos
I checked back up to Spring 2018, and incidentally all of Dan's lectures are private, while the ones by others are public. Wonder if there is any reason to that... Maybe the accessibility lawsuit is the reason?"
looking for cs10 buddy :(,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cvg1hx/looking_for_cs10_buddy/,2024-05-18 21:33:00,"Hi all, I’m incredibly nervous about taking cs10(session c) over the upcoming Summer. This’ll be my first course at Berkeley. I was eligible to take this course through my cc’s TAP Summer Enrichment Program. 

I was hoping to get some clarity on how this class works as I may be misunderstanding a fair chunk. Namely how the lab dynamic + discussion aspect work, are they during class ? After ? Are they combined ? 

Im also looking for a partner as it seems we may need to find one for class, if you’re interested, please let me know, I just wanna pass the class :’( 

Any additional information would be beneficial, thank you. ","Don’t be scared it should be easy
CS 10 is a great class and they provide plenty of support for students. I really enjoyed it! Their goal is for everyone to get an A. I took it last year where discussion and lab were separate.
Congrats! I took cs10 spring 2023 and got an A+. The class is very easy, esp bc there's SO much extra support. Iirc, there is no discussion, just lab (if you have disc on your schedule it's just for formalities). You learn the concepts in lecture and apply them during lab. There's also lab check questions, and a total of 5 or 6 projects. The projects get 'harder' as you progress, obviously, but since you're working w a partner and you have TAs + student mentors to help, you should be able to get most, if not all, assignments done during lab. When I took the class, you could even attend lab virtually via discord.

Good luck and HAVE FUN!

ETA: Lab usually happens after lecture timewise, but sometimes they can happen before (i.e. lab 10am-12pm lec 2pm-4pm). However, you won't be working on new concepts in lab unless they were covered in lecture first, as stated above.
It's too bad you can't wait for the Fall. Dan Garcia is an awesome teacher.

I’ll run with your statement
Gotcha, this sounds like I should ease up on the anxiety then; it just sounds more time consuming than I expected, but I’m glad to have discovered this now than later. Otherwise, thank you for clearing my blurry misunderstandings. It does go a VERY long way and I really do appreciate your insight.
I heard he is one of the best !! I wish I could’ve as well. I’ve seen a few lectures of his and they were very gravitational.
I fixed it but you’ll get the credit, so here, credit: CoconutContest

Sorry to interject, but I took CS10 summer 2023 and there was in fact discussion that we had to attend for credit (not sure if this is still the case)...It was really fun though because it was just extra review! To OP: Don't be nervous--from my experience everyone is super open to helping you and supporting you as long as you reach out. Everyone is incredibly understanding!
Oh you're totally right- for me it was also extra review, but our class didn't have to attend for credit. Or maybe we did and I just said fuck all LOL. My bad op!"
Do people on UCB's wifi network have access to CS resources?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2cizgk/do_people_on_ucbs_wifi_network_have_access_to_cs/,2014-08-03 13:22:02,"I want to follow along/work through a CS61C course. I can't access any of the projects. I was a student in 2010 and remember Dan Garcia being pretty good about allowing people to access stuff. Maybe things changed.

Can people connected to AirBears access this?
http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su11/code/proj/","Looks like it's Forbidden now, that tends to happen with old code files.

Maybe try working through the projects for this summer (or another more recent semester)?  You should have access to it all:  http://inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~CS61c/su14/
I have access to project resources. I'll PM you. :P

Also, normally, you have to have an inst eecs (class) account in order to access the material because they tend to be hosted directly on the servers. If there are extra account login sheets, which there tend to be, I've heard some TAs/readers are nice enough to share them with whoever wants them within reason (don't quote me on that, though).
Thanks a lot. I just pulled all the summer projects. Are you in the class? I might ping you if somehow I find there's a file I need missing -- assuming you'd be okay with it.
edit: Spring 2014 seemed to not have the projects open
Most of the time the skeleton files and all class material is on a public facing website, no password. Class accounts are to login to machines and submit homework. If it weren't for turning in things, you probably wouldn't even need to login to the EECS machines if you had your own computer.
Sorry, I took 61C a couple years ago, so I don't have anything more than you do.  But CS project materials in all classes tend to be posted where anyone can access them.
While I guess that's true for a lot of homework and labs, it tends to not be as true for projects because of the sheer number of files.

I personally tend to copy files off the server for all three kinds of assignments rather than pulling it off the website (because cp -r is way easier than saving a bunch of links manually) but I guess pulling it directly often works too.
Hmm.. Okay, maybe I'll email a TA about the Sp. 14 material."

"MCB major, should I take CS 61A?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/173lmke/mcb_major_should_i_take_cs_61a/,2023-10-09 00:11:04,"I'm already declared for MCB, and I have no desire to switch out of it. I want to make myself a more appealing candidate for applying to labs since the field of biology I am interested in relies heavily on statistical modeling (I've had no luck in URAP and haven't tried cold-emailing).

I have no experience in CS, and my goal is to apply to medical school at the end of my senior year (currently a junior). I have a pretty good GPA thus far (like 3.8+). The only thing that's holding me back is the very likely chance that this class will bring down my GPA (I took Math 53 freshman year and it completely wrecked me; I scraped by with a C+—ever since then I have been running away from very math-heavy courses unless I had to take them).

If I do go this path, I will be taking MCB 100B, CS 61A, Data 8, and a breadth class in the spring semester. I was thinking of taking CS 61A as a P/NP but medical schools generally don't look favorably upon that. What do you guys think? ","CS61a is difficult.  The exams are murderous.  

Otherwise, not too bad.  But, grind out practice midterms because that is where it will destroy you.
I’d take Data 8 in Spring, then do CS88 the following fall. You learn all the practical stuff about programming in CS88 without Scheme (which is useless in your case) and is slower pace.

Edited: Going doing back on my word, I don’t think taking either CS88 or CS61a provides any benefits beyond learning how to program in general. I explained this a little bit more in my reply below, but I would honestly just take Data 8, to get a general big picture of statistics + programming. You can always self study CS61a or CS88 without taking the course, since its just introductory programming without much real immediate application (that way you’re not really risking your GPA or P/NP’ing).
Take it PNP. I may be biased as a CS major but I feel like the class is hard to do well but easy to pass. Ofc this is given that you attend lecture and go to discussion / lab as it is fast paced but I genuinely think it’s a worthwhile class. If you’d like more core CS concepts to understand it I’d recommend CS 10 w Garcia (my fav cal professor) or CS 88. 

Since yoy said you have no CS exoerience, I’d recommend CS 10. If you like it then take 61a or 88 PNP just to learn.
Why do you want to go to med school if you are interested in computational biology? Also, you should try cold emailing. It can be scary but the most case scenario is they say no or don’t respond. I have found cold emailing to be super effective so if you want to do research you might as well try.
I took CS61A PNP as a Microbial Biology major in CNR. I found the class fairly challenging class since I had little to no experience coding prior to the class, but it was manageable. 

I decided take that course to gain some foundational skills in coding in a more structured manner that I worked well for my learning style. However, you can learn many of  the skills independently if that better suits your style. I definitely found the knowledge and skills I gained useful in the other courses I took like Population Genetics and Microbial Genetics and Genomics. I still find my experience in that course useful today in my roles as an R&D scientist in a biotech startup, and would recommend anyone studying biology to have some experience in coding. The field has continued to become more computationally heavy and having a good foundation is extremely helpful. Even if it’s just knowing how to manipulate data tables. 

I graduated in 2019 so I can’t really speak about data8, cs88, or some of the other courses other folks are mentioning, but those courses could be better suited to your goals.
definitely do it, no regrets. Best class ever.
[deleted]
Dan Garcia W
That combination is completely doable, I did it last fall. The coding in data8 is pretty simple but, pair that along with 88c/61a and most of the work becomes just learning the stats concepts. For 88c, data8 doesn't help/overlap with any of the assignments/exams, since rather than using python to simulate stats, you'll be writing programs/algorithms.
Its not a bad combo, the first couple weeks in both courses somewhat overlap in topics because you’re mainly going over Python syntax. However, I’d say the difficulty ramps up exponentially once you reach the mathy parts of Data 8 and tree recursion in CS88. Can’t speak for how much you can handle, but since OP is just considering taking both these classes to be a more appealing candidate for labs while risking their GPA, I would say this can do more harm than good in their case."

I'd love to know what the best courses (or your favorite courses) are in discrete math, algorithms, and stats/ML that I might be able to audit.

Also happy to chat one-on-one!","Try CS 189
CS 182 is another great ML course I don’t see mentioned here. CS 189 is classic, CS 188 and Data 100 are related. Discrete math is covered in Math 55 and CS 70; I believe 70 is more interesting of the two but it’s also harder and covers probability theory. Algorithms course is CS 170. Parts of discrete math are covered in courses like CS 161, MATH 125A, Philosophy 140A (I think), Philosophy 12A, and CS 172.

There are also graduate level courses.
Discrete math:   Math 55 (or CS 70 if you want a more rigorous blend of discrete math and probability for ML)   
Algorithms: CS 170 (or CS 61B if you want a more practical, less theory/mathy course thats more applicable to industry work)  
Stats (which I'm assuming == probability for ML): Data 140 or EECS 126 if you're highly mathematically inclined   
Machine learning: CS 189    

opinion: Data 100 is a serves as a good intro ML class if you're low on the heavy prerequisite knowledge that the above courses demand.
CS 61C if Dan Garcia is teaching.
CS 61C if Dan Garcia is teaching.
Solid, thanks!
Oh thanks! That's quite, detailed, I've emailed some profs about auditing the courses.
Also basic algorithm coverage in 61B and arguably 61A, but I’m sure you’ve taken those already
And I forgot, but CS 174 is solid for algorithms and probability"

I need some advice about CS classes. Help please?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/srhlm/i_need_some_advice_about_cs_classes_help_please/,2012-04-25 01:20:42,"Freshman CS/CogSci double major here, but I'm more concerned about CS right now. I've taken Math 1A, Math 1B, CS 61A, and CS 61B. I need to take CS 61C, CS 70, Math 54, and EE 42 next year in order to be able to declare at the end of the spring semester. A few questions:  
  
  
**Math 54 & CS 70**  
I talked to Barbara Hightower, and she recommended taking Math 54 before CS 70 because of CS 70's ""mathematical maturity"" requirement. However, all of my friends who have taken CS 70 say that they don't think taking Math 54 beforehand would help all that much with CS 70. The main reason I'd like to take CS 70 before Math 54 is because of the professors – from what I've heard, Vazirani is good and the Math 54 professors (Grunbaum and Voiculescu) aren't great. Would I be at a disadvantage if I took CS 70 before Math 54?
  
**EE 42 & CS 61C**  
Barbara recommended taking EE 42 alongside Math 54 to balance out the workload, because according to her, Math 54 and CS 61C have lighter workloads than CS 70 and EE 42. I'd like to take CS 61C in the spring with Dan Garcia because I hear he's awesome, but if I do this, I'll end up taking CS 70 and EE 42 together in the fall. Would the combined workload of these classes be too heavy?
  
**Phase I/II**  
Any advice on which classes I should phase 1 / phase 2? My phase 1 appointment is on Thursday, which seems pretty late. The other classes I’m planning on taking are Linguistics 100 and Linguistics 106. (If anyone has anything to share about those classes, that'd be great too!)  
  
  
***TL;DR:***  
- My ideal situation: CS 70 & EE 42 in the fall, and Math 54 & CS 61C in the spring  
- Barbara's advice: Math 54 & EE 42 in the fall, and CS 70 & CS 61C in the spring  
1. Would I be at a disadvantage if I took CS 70 before Math 54?  
2. Would the combined workload of CS 70 and EE 42 be too heavy?  
3. Any advice on which classes I should phase 1 / phase 2?  
  

Thanks in advance, and sorry about the wall of text!","Math 54 and CS 70 are not really related. There's no need to take one before the other.
CS70 is a fairly light workload, and I have heard 61C is actually very heavy. I didn't take 54 before 70 and I didn't have any problems with it but YMMV. Don't Phase I 61C as it is a massive class and as long as you don't have last pick phase 2 you should be fine.
Take 61C with Garcia. I had him for 61C and he was an amazing lecturer.

I had 54 with Voiculescu as well and I'll honestly say that by the second week, hardly a single person was attending lecture because he just read straight from the textbook and it wasn't at all helpful.

Other than that, I agree with everything the other commenters said.
If you don't take EE43 (the lab class) with EE42, then I don't think it'll be that much work. You could potentially hate your schedule though as CS70/EE42 are very hit or miss. A lot of people just aren't interested in EE42, and CS70 has simple ideas but non-trivial assignments that can get kind of frustrating. I took 54 before CS70 but it wasn't really a purposeful decision; it just made sense for me to take 54 right after 53. 
I had Garcia for 61C. He was an amazing teacher, but I also thought the class was pretty tough and a ton of work (though I'm more of an EE guy so maybe that had something to do with it. 

I haven't taken EE42, but I've taken 40 and 42 is kind of the easier version for non-EECS majors, especially if you don't take the lab (which many CS people I know don't).

Honestly, I would say that 61C is a more difficult class (or at the very least is a ton of work, especially if you take it with Garcia), and 42 is probably a little easier and less work, maybe on par with CS 70.
So I've heard. Thanks!
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind!
Thanks! I'm looking forward to 61C :) Math 54, not so much. Haha
I'm definitely not planning on taking EE 43, haha. Thanks for the warning!
This was helpful, thanks!"
Help choosing freshman year classes (EECS) and electives!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tvjzx/help_choosing_freshman_year_classes_eecs_and/,2012-05-19 20:22:35,"I will be a freshman next year in EECS and I have to start planning my schedule before CalSO. I have some questions:

1. Who are the best teachers for CS 61A, CS 61B/CS 61BL, Math 1A, Math 1B, and Physics 7A?

2. I would like to take all of the above classes this year but they seem like a lot of work. So what would the easiest Science Elective be and who is the best Science Elective teacher?

3. What is the easiest Reading and Composition B course and who is the best R & C B teacher?

4. What is the easiest/best American Culture course? And who are the best teachers?

5. What are the easiest/best Humanities & Social Science courses? And who are the best teachers?

Thank you in advance!","Quick note about teachers: For EECS courses, there's generally one professor per class per semester. You can usually trust the draft schedules ([EE courses](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html), [CS courses](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html)) and of course, the school's [schedule](http://schedule.berkeley.edu/). None of that stuff is set in stone, but it probably won't change too much between now and the fall semester.

That being said, for EECS courses, it's not really a question of ""Who should I take (course) with this semester?"", but ""When should I take (course) so I can take it with (professor)?"". 


1)
It looks like you're on track to take CS 61A in the fall and CS 61B in the spring -- Shewchuk is set to teach 61B in the spring, and I can't recommend taking it with him enough. I had a blast in that class because of him. I can't speak for 61A in the fall, though. The draft schedule says it's being taught by ""THE STAFF"", and frankly, I'm not quite sure what that means. Rumor says the professor might be John DeNero, who is (from what I hear) an incredibly cool dude and great teacher. But, once again, you don't really have a choice in the matter. 

For Math 1A and Physics 7A, check out the professors' reviews on [Ninja Courses](http://www.ninjacourses.com) and the grade distributions on [Schedule Builder](http://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu). The professors I took those courses with aren't teaching next fall, so I can't help much.

2)
I can't offer much help because I haven't taken a science elective yet (planning on Physics 7C at some point...), but you should really consider taking a class on something you enjoy instead of the easy A. Just my two cents.

3)
Generally speaking, the R5B courses tend to be the easiest way to fill that requirement. I don't think they have established rosters in terms of teachers, though, so I suggest picking the one that interests you most. None of them sounded appealing to me, and I ended up taking Italian R5B. It was a total bore and I was pretty miserable in that class, but the workload was infinitesimally small and I got an A with damn near no effort.

4)
Once again, I can't help much because the course I took (ESPM 50AC) isn't being taught by the guy I took it with. Definitely my least favorite course thus far... So boring... So much reading... But it really depends on who's teaching it. Try to pick something you're interested, AC courses tend to be fairly easy across the board.

5)
I've only taken Music 27, but once again, it's not being taught by the guy I took it with this fall. Pretty cool class, in my opinion. It exposed me to a lot of ""important"" music that I wouldn't have listened to otherwise. 
Re #2 I wouldn't worry much about teachers for those classes. I'd just take 61a and math 1a your first semester. Probably 7a, too, since I don't think they offer it in the spring. 

Re #3 I'd recommend taking Rhetoric R1B, but it's not the easiest. It's interesting, though, and is an interesting topic to learn for a future engineer.

Re #5 Take something interesting. Don't worry too much about how hard it will be. IF you can't find something interesting, econ is always a good choice, IMO.
most eecs majors finish 61a-c, math 1b-53-54, ee 20n and 40, and physics 7a-b by the end of their sophomore year, along with a couple of humanities classes. That should be pretty comfortable with 3 classes a semester, which will keep you on fine track to graduate assuming you have some ap credit. take some seminars and self paceds and decals mixed in, those are always fun. 
I basically have a good idea about CS classes only, so I'll try to help you there (the numbering of my reply has nothing to do with the numbering of your questions):

1) Do you have any programming experience?

2) I am not sure who is teaching 61A in the fall. But rumor has it that Brian Harvey might teach it in the spring next year. I personally wasn't a huge fan of him, but he is regarded as one of the best professors for that class.

3) 61B usually has 2 professors - 1 is a great instructor (Jonathan Shewchuk); he teaches in the spring. I took the class with him. No complaints whatsoever. The other one is not such a great instructor, and he is really really strict (Paul Hilfinger); he teaches in the fall. He is inarguably one of the hardest professors in the department. And I don't mean oh-lets-take-a-class-with-him-to-challenge-myself hard; I mean omg-the-mean-on-the-midterm-was-5-out-of-20 hard. But the thing about Hilfinger is that he has a lot to teach you. As strict as he is, if you manage to survive his class and genuinely learn a lot, you will pass that class with IMMENSE amounts of invaluable coding expertise. I can't emphasize enough on how much of an expert he is when it comes to coding and programming, and the whole department respects him for it.

4) I will talk also about 61C. I know you didn't ask about it, but 61C and 61B aren't dependent on each other, so you can just switch them around. People don't do it usually, but you can take 61C before 61B (I did); it would hardly make a difference because one doesn't need the other. 61C is apparently being taught by Dan Garcia in the spring. TAKE IT WITH HIM. Trust me, he is by far the best instructor I have had at Berkeley yet. There aren't enough words to explain how thankful I was that I took the class with him. You really need to take that class with him, even if it means taking 61B the next year because, as tigerking said, the end purpose is to finish them by the end of sophomore year, so 61B can wait for sophomore year as well. The other professors that could teach the class in fall next year could possibly be David Patterson, Randy Katz, or Michael Franklin. All of these are great researches to say the least, and have been few of the strongest names in the EECS department when it comes to researches, studies, and academia. But I personally believe that Dan Garcia trumps them when it comes to instruction, because that's what his strong suit is and that's what he focusses most of his time and energy on.



EDIT: Formatting
For all of your electives, find something that sounds interesting, find someone to take it with, and charge.  I think an interesting course beats an easy course any day.  I would say if Garcia is still teaching, he is a great choice for 61A and 61C.
1.  Something to consider: Last semester (Fa11) 61A was revamped into a course that uses Python.  In the fall (when I took it) it was taught by a Google employee (who got his PhD in CS at Cal), John DeNero.  Then, this past Spring, Hilfinger (very hard professor) taught the new 61a course, the first of the regular Berkeley professors to do so.  My point being: although the abstract concepts of the course haven't changed, the course is at least partially (if not substantially) different, and not a whole lot of people have taught it.  Hilfinger has a widespread reputation for being an extremely difficult professor.
1. I don't have much to offer here but Math 1A is an okay course (not so difficult), Math 1B is hell no matter who is the teacher. Easily one of the most frustrating courses I've taken mainly because the Math department likes to confuse the hell out of you when the material itself is not so difficult. Physics 7A starts off very manageable but the material gets confusing fast. Pretty much the first 10 chapters could be self learned if you have some prior Physics learning but make sure you spend time studying the last five and keep up.. something I found hard to do.  

2. No clue. Chem 1A is easy as hell in the spring.. 

3. Look into the R4B and R5Bs. I'm not so familiar with them but they're language-related english courses. Most of them are considered to be easy however they fill up fast and make sure you read the description before you're stuck in some obscure course studying Nordic poems. 

4. ESPM 50AC is always supposed to be an easy ac. I've heard anthro 3ac is good as well.

5. As the other commenter, the intro econ classes are always easy and are fun to learn.

This is so helpful! Thank you so much :)
for what it's worth, they do usually offer 7A in the spring, or at least they did this year.
Thank you!!
Ok great. Thank you so much!!
Take Hilfinger, become a man. Also his tests are literally impossible.
1) I've only taken AP Comp Sci so I have some Java experience (I didn't take the AP exam though so no AP credit). I have a little Python and Flash experience from another programming class I took for fun. But I'm not very experienced at all.
2) I see.
3) Thanks for telling me that!
4) Thank you! I'll try to take 61C with him in the spring then.

Thank you for being so helpful :)

Edit: Also, have you heard of any rumors about who is teaching 61B in 2013-2014? I would love to take 61C this spring but not if I end up with Hilfinger the year after for 61B.
I agree with you. No one has mentioned Psychology, but that subject has always interested me. And great, I hope I get the chance to be in Garcia's class!
I would really rather not take it with Hilfinger then.
Thank you! This is really helpful.
So far there's NO evidence of this being true at all, but three people have told me that they somehow heard he was teaching it again. My roommate took it with DeNero and loved it, I wish I could've taken it with him T__T
Awesome!
Oh good
Sounds fun.
Well usually Hilfinger teaches 61B in the fall, and Shewchuk in the spring. And I would expect it to stay the same way next year too. So if you want to take it with Shewchuk, you can probably take CS 70 (4th and last CS lower-div you'll need to take) in Fall 2013 and then 61B in Spring 2014. I know it'll be your 4th sem, and no one takes it that late, but it's not that big a deal (I took it in my 4th sem too).
[deleted]
I hope I can take it with him
Oh ok cool. Do you know if Dan Garcia will be teaching 61C in 2013-2014?
Cool, good to know. Thank you
I can't be too sure. 61B usually jumps between 2 professors. 

But 61C doesn't show a particular pattern. Dan Garcia and Mike Franklin taught in Fall 2011, David Patterson in Spring 2012, Randy Katz in Fall 2012, and Dan Garcia is believed to be teaching again in Spring 2013. So I'm not too sure whether he'll be teaching in 2013-14. You can always go to his office hours and ask him in the middle of your first semester.
Oh I see. And you're right, thanks! That's a really good idea
I'd honestly suggest that for now finalize only your 1st semester. CS 61A, Math 1A, a Science elective if you wish, and/or an R&C if you wish, and/or an AC if you wish.
AC classes are usually pretty easy, so I'd suggest go with either 3 courses without AC, or 4 courses with AC.
Figure the rest out eventually in the middle of your 1st sem.
Sounds good, thank you so much."

They're getting really defensive about the implication that only CS teaches ""computational thinking"". I find it kind of funny, because the article explicitly includes how liberal arts majors found the classes interesting/useful after initially thinking they wouldn't.

No wonder there's a GPA cap for CS. Will it be hard for current CS majors to find software engineering jobs in three or four years with this kind of growth in majors?

Maybe it's validation? To feel good about their life choices and their areas of interest, while viewing the growing interest towards STEM as a ""threat"". 

Tech people are no longer people in their parent's basement. They are becoming more and more mainstream, and to some people, especially older people, this is strange. 
Doesn't help that the headline is a bit misleading: ""Learning to think like a computer"" sounds .... strange, to say the least.
It probably should've been titled ""Learning to think computationally/like a computer scientist.""
Many of those comments seem ""worried"" by the ""think like a computer"" phrase, as if we're all going to end up as robotic zombies who only read in 1s and 0s.
So after 61a and 61b, and you double Dr. Doolittle?
Perhaps. The bubble might burst at some point...
