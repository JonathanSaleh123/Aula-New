I am UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. Ask me anything!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jcb30i/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/,2020-10-16 07:45:01,"Hello, Reddit! /u/holmesp here from the campus office of public affairs. With the support of /u/lulzcakes we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything. This is the third year in a row that Chancellor Christ will be participating in an AMA.

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Tuesday, Oct. 20 at 4 p.m.**

As has been the case in the past, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it.

Ask away!

* **No questions are off-limits. But keep it respectful and formal.**

Christ does not want to limit any sort of questions *at all* for this AMA. Nothing is off-limits. However, you must stay respectful and formal. As long as you remain respectful, your question will not be removed. 

Jokes and joke questions *are* allowed, but make sure you don't get too carried away. 

Again, please be on your best behavior. We may have even more events in the future, and maybe the Chancellor would be open to coming to a subreddit meetup. This will only be possible if this AMA goes well.

Hi Chancellor, not a student but a Berkeley resident in District 3. I'm concerned about the dark tone on this subreddit, it seems like many students are struggling/having a rough time. I'm wondering what I can do as a community member to help support my neighbors. Also, what is the relationship between campus and the community it's located in? Thank you!
Hi Professor Christ, thanks for all you do 

Alum here in higher education. 

In this era of distance learning, I would like to bring up a pet cause of mine regarding open access learning at UCB

Back in the day, UCB used to put up free recordings of courses on ItunesU. I was a STEM major when I was on campus and never had the time to take all the amazing classes in humanities that UCB had to offer while I was there. However, with the open access MOOCs back in the early 2010s, I was able to listen/watch many amazing philosophy/history/economics courses that were incredibly enjoyable and allowed me to stay in touch and feel connected to campus

I've brought this up with Shawna Dark, who is  Chief Academic Technology Officer & Executive, and it seems there is too much red tape to create the CC required to make these recordings accessible to all (which is why they had to be taken down), even though the archives have thousands of hours of learning. 

I'm wondering if there is some way to consider open sourcing the closed captioning like has been done for other educational resources so UCB can rerelease all these amazing courses

Thanks
Thanks for doing this, Chancellor Christ:

I’m a freshman with COVID-19, and it has thrown what was shaping up to be a great semester (on an academic level) into complete disarray. How is the administration going to support students with COVID-19 who may fall behind on their work? Why is P/NP not an option?
Hello Chancellor,

My question is regarding whether the school will give a P/NP option for major requirements. Will Cal continue to consider changing the policy? I, along with many of my peers, are struggling with school during these special times. Our situation from Spring 2020 semester has not changed much and may have gotten worst. 

Yes, we were given time this past summer to plan and decide whether to enroll for classes. However, we did not plan for having to evacuate from wild fires, experiencing large earthquakes, having family members in the hospital, having to take over the home responsibility as the main care taker, experiencing more unexpected financial difficulties, having sudden computer and internet problems, etc. 

Additionally, I’ve personally found that classes have gotten harder in the virtual setting. For instance, some of my classes have assigned more work; classes go overtime, professors expect us to carve time to watch additional recorded lectures videos separate from the 5hr/week of live class, and more. Not only is it harder to perform well in class, it’s also become a mental health issue of immense stress and anxiety.

I urge you to please reconsider P/NP as an option for major requirements and to genuinely empathize with us struggling students.
Students have expressed the need for P/NP due to current circumstances. Why is there resistance to this?
Hi Chancellor Christ,

I found this particular response from the administration regarding the hesitancy of P/NP policies extremely disheartening: 

> while there may be additional constraints on major requirements, college-specific advisers can grant exceptions for students who have “compelling reasons for an exception.”

In a global pandemic situation like this, I'm not sure what is required for us to be acknowledged as having ""compelling reasons"" for struggling. Many students, including myself, are dealing with extreme mental stress, unaccommodating class policies, and family/household difficulties and responsibilities, among many other reasons, most of these cases undocumented and essentially unprovable to qualify as a ""compelling reason"" to advisers. 

Not to mention, it is simply unrealistic to ask thousands of these students to be individually making our cases to the advisers, and for the advisers to be taking the enormous responsibility of categorizing these thousands of students' struggles as ""compelling enough"" or not, in a global situation where everyone is struggling to some extent. 

In fact, I believe more students are like myself and simply don't have the time nor will (on top of our heightened workload due to the online instruction format) to be appealing to the advisers that our mental wellbeings are at an all-time low, only to go unnoticed or deemed ""not compelling enough"" of a reason. For me, personally, that would be a blow that is too heavy to take to even attempt. However, our silence in this regard does NOT mean that we're not struggling, but rather a form of silent suffering that goes unsupported due to the university's lack of response. 

I hope that the administration can give us the option to decide for ourselves whether we are in need of this support in the form of P/NP major requirements, and take a look at this in the perspective of a glass-half-full rather than half-empty: 40%, almost **half**, of the students **decided** to take all their courses P/NP for the Spring Semester two months into the pandemic, and things have only gotten worse, not better, since then.
Good Day Chancellor Christ,
hope you have been well in all aspects of life. We can only imagine the immense pressure you must be in. 
I too have witnessed a possibly unprecedented struggle with mental health issues this Fall (reflected through the Berkeley subreddit especially as of recent). As someone who has taken advantage of the 3 free counseling services offered in-person on campus in the past, I'm not sure how the usual 3-week wait time is supposed to help (I also saw some similar opinions voiced in this subreddit). Just wanted to relay our thoughts on this matter. Also, I'd like to voice my support for a P/NP for major/minor classes as well; I understand you probably don't have much control over this matter but I feel obligated to my community to sound out what's on thousands of students' minds, of course as well as in mine. Stay safe and healthy.
Hi Chancellor,

What is going on with spring break 2021? In the survey, it was suggested that you were considering getting rid of it almost completely. When can we expect any updates on that decision, and how seriously is that option actually being taken?!
It is clear with the pandemic, many students are facing additional financial distress. However, it appears the university intends to keep tuition and rates the same. While we are aware of emergency loan/assistance programs, many of these lead to suggesting more students take out loans. I think we can agree that this is not possible for many students and would put many of them in line for further financial distress in the future. I know for myself and many other students, despite working many hours a week and also having an EFC of 0, we are still struggling significantly.

Does the campus have any plans for adjusting fees, tuition, financial aid for students? Or providing any other programs or policies to help us?

Thank you Chancellor Christ for your hard work! It was so awesome to see Professor Doudna win the Nobel Prize for discovering what will surely be recognized as one of the most important technological advances of the 21st century. My question is, why did Berkeley not pay to expedite the patent application (like the Broad Institute did), and how are you holding the people responsible for this historic mistake accountable? What will Berkeley do going forward to prevent something like this from happening again? There has been a lot of celebration (rightfully so) of the discovery of CRISPR and its potential, but I really hope we make meaningful changes to patent support policies within the Legal department.
Hello Chancellor Christ,

I'm a Berkeley PhD student and my question has to do with the administration's policy towards P/NP. 

Students in undergraduate,  graduate, and professional schools are suffering. We are under constant stress -- rates of depression are up, as reported in the pulse survey. COVID, unemployment rates, and climate-change induced wildfires have increased our burdens. 

How can we convince you to enact pass / no pass (P/NP)? USC has already changed its policy, and other schools are responding similarly. 

Thank you and I hope the administration treats students with compassion and kindness in light of a worsening pandemic.
Is the administration seriously considering switching the semester to optional PNP? Last semester was not a normal semester, and neither is this one. Neither should be treated as such. Professors haven't altered expectations or coursework to accommodate for these circumstances -- I have more work and higher expectations when compared to in person semesters if anything. 

Berkeley is hard enough under normal circumstances, and the fact that the administration hasn't switched to PNP for this semester makes myself (and many other students) **feel like the university wants us to suffer and fail**. 

Are you considering student input on this matter? It does not feel like our pleas are being heard. Many other prestigious universities have taken this action to support their students in this time. Why can't Berkeley do the same?
Hi Chancellor Christ. Thanks again for doing this AMA. As I’m sure you know, about a month ago, it was found that Allison Mack, a former high-ranking leader in the infamous NXIVM sex cult currently awaiting sentencing for racketeering charges, was attending classes at UC Berkeley through Zoom. Specifically, Mack was attending a class on “Gender, Sex, & Power”. In addition to the racketeering charges, Mack was also initially arrested by the FBI on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. UC Berkeley has not released a statement on the matter. 

What does it say about the admissions process at UC Berkeley when they admitted a former sex cult leader currently awaiting sentencing over other applicants who were much more deserving of an acceptance letter?

Hi Chancellor Christ, thank you so much for doing this AMA! This is a nice way to really connect with the student body.

First, my question is: will Berkeley implement a P/NP option for major requirements? I understand that this is a common topic being brought up, but I’d also like to give a personal overview of my semester to highlight how implementing P/NP can benefit the lives and wellbeing of thousands of students in the community.

This semester has unequivocally been my most difficult term. Not just the fact that I can’t have any real social interactions with other people besides my mom and the need to come to terms with losing over two semesters of my college experience, but I also have to work extra weekly hours in order to financially support myself during the pandemic. Not to mention, I also have to deal with ineffective course policies that attempt to deter academic dishonesty, but end up hurting honest students, by simply making the material harder or through methods unrelated to learning (such as removing the back button during the test, which encourages lost points based on accidents). As an academically honest and low income student, I can’t help but feel like I’ve drawn the short end of the stick this year, and I’m sure I’m not the only one.

Many schools have already implemented a P/NP policy to make sure no financially disadvantaged and academically honest student can be disproportionately affected by remote learning (P/NP helps financially by allowing students time to work more / relieve stress from overworking, and helps academically by mitigating the extra pressure exerted by new course policies). 

I understand that you and the rest of the faculty have a lot to consider in terms of P/NP, but I hope that these concerns that I’ve deeply felt can give some insight into what many of us are experiencing and will continue to experience for the next semester and a half without P/NP. Again, thank you so much for taking the time to read and answer our questions - it really meant a lot to see you participate in this thread!
Hello Chancellor,

The administration has shown disinterest in allowing **optional** P/NP for major requirements for students this semester. I was just wondering, have you guys had discussions or thoughts of modifying the optional P/NP strategy to something more limited like allowing (1) major requirement to be P/NP, or something similar? It seems to me that the whole P/NP strategy is highly modifiable in a way that would give students who are strongly impacted by remote learning the breathing room that is **necessary**, while still tackling some of the adverse effects a regular non-limited optional P/NP policy would result in. The modified P/NP could also exclude major declaration courses, if that is one of the more significant concerns. In any case, I hope it’s clear that the P/NP policy students are advocating for is **very** modifiable, and could easily be implemented. This limited P/NP seems to me like the best approach for this semester’s grading policy considering many universities have some sort of policy in place already. In short, are you guys considering any limited or modified version of the P/NP policy for the semester, and if not, why?

Edit: I’m sure I don’t need to give reasons why students need some breathing room or support during these times, as I believe you’ve received countless testimonials already. I will say that it can get unimaginably hard for some people to do well (as they would otherwise) under remote learning.
The CS department announced that their teaching budget was cut for Spring 21, as a result many enrollment seats were reduced and fewer classes needed for graduation are offered. Eg, almost none of the 16x upper dives courses are offered next Spring.

Are there any plans to remedy this and increase teaching budget for CS in the future? As CS courses attract a sizeable portion of Cal students, these changes would negatively impart our graduation progress if we can't take required class on time.
Please make this semester pnp
Hi Chancellor, I have already signed the petition for optional p/np, but I want to make a direct appeal to you. I am currently living at home with my extended family. Due to unforeseen circumstances (both covid and personal), I find myself in charge of my other family members. I cook half the meals, take care of my grandparents, and my younger siblings. For instance, this week is the psat and it's my duty to bring my younger sibling to and from the testing site, as well as make sure they do practice tests, aren't stressed, etc. I have also started managing the budget to some degree. If something goes wrong I'm the first person my family asks. I am graduating this semester and cannot afford to drop any classes. Each of my classes are required technical courses and require literally 10+hrs a week. Suffice to say that the work from both Berkeley and home never ends, and I find it hard to keep up with either. If it weren't for covid-lockdown restrictions I would not be facing so much work from the home, and I'm not alone.

Not implementing optional p/np is unfair to students who *have* been affected by lockdown. I have no doubt that some students (hopefully the majority) find lockdown just an inconvenience, and can stay peacefully at home without worrying about food, electricity, internet connection (which is especially shoddy in rural areas), the welfare of elderly or immunocompromised family members, etc. But that definitely isn't every student. Students that live in ca's wildfire zones, have been financially weakened if not toppled by covid, or worse, students who have lost family members to covid will, to put it mildly, find it hard to focus on Berkeley courses. These students would not be facing these obstacles to learning if it weren't for covid, lockdown, the fires, really 2020 in general, and thus an optional p/np is both humane and needed.

I will admit that if I'm offered p/np I am likely to only p/np 1 of my many classes, but I can see how, due to the literally apocalyptic circumstances, why other students are clambering for a p/np. Please consider offering an optional p/np during these unprecedented times.
Please consider a P/NP option for students. I am in a campus career where I encounter many students, and have heard stories ranging from losing their homes due to the pandemic, dropping out, or even roommate suicide. It is not possible to carry out courses as normal with such circumstances.
Hi Chancellor Christ, thanks for doing this AMA! I'm sure you'd agree that international students are a valuable part of the Cal community, however I am concerned about a growing indifference on the part of the faculty and administration towards people in other countries and time zones. 

While online learning has been a massive adjustment and struggle for all, it is especially difficult for internationals (My school day is typically from 8:30pm to 4:30am, and some of my friends are awake throughout the night and hardly see their friends and family). This is compounded by many classes being extremely unaccommodating of international students, including failing to consider requests for alternate exam times and refusing to consider flexible deadlines that may fall in the middle of the night. I find it unfair that international students find themselves in classes with mandatory lecture attendance till 4:30am and then writing an exam at 7am, with little opportunity for sleep. This is highly inequitable when compared to people in the US, who are afforded the opportunity to get ample rest and preparation before exams and have a higher chance of doing better.

Another issue I would like to point out is the lack of mental health resources available to international students as the Tang center does not provide mental health services to new internationals, leaving them to find (often inadequate) resources in their own countries, if any. While I realize that this is not entirely under the university's control, maybe some steps could be taken to provide better mental health services for its international community?

I understand that the administration cannot do much when it comes to individual classes, however in light of BIO's announcement strongly discouraging new international students from coming to the US in Spring 2021, I wonder what steps the administration can take/has taken in order to incentivize classes to accommodate people in different time zones during another semester of zoom learning.

It is an unenviable problem to have, but I'm sure a significant part of the student community would benefit from clarity on this matter.

Thank you, and go bears!
What are the chances of having classes as P/NP this semester?
Hello Chancellor Christ, Hope you have been doing well. I'm just here to echo my peers' sentiments about having the option to P/NP major requirements. Thank you!
Chancellor Christ,

It is clear that the current COVID Pandemic has disproportionately affected the livelihood and the standard of education at UC Berkeley for both students and faculty. Because students are clearly unable to utilize resources available on our campus to its fullest extent, specifically buildings and campus infrastructure, why is it that your administration has yet to decrease the cost of tuition and enrollment at UC Berkeley for the current term?

Why is it that we are paying for costs and overhead for the campus while we are a term that is not given the opportunity to use these resources to the fullest extent that we pay?
Hello Chancellor, 

I would like to keep asking about the possibility of allowing P/NP for major requirements, and why your administration is siding against it when thousands of students have spoken on how it would help them. According to multiple sources, you cite issues regarding graduate school admissions and even social equity based on who P/NP for a major. Jennifer Johnson Hanks was quoted saying that last semester, ""the number of students who chose P/NP grading was unequally distributed by social advantage"". 

How would you say this observed trend invalidates the benefits that allowing P/NP would bring, especially to students who ARE struggling even more-so due to their socioeconomic background? And further, if the decision is coming from a social justice context and a want to ""keep the playing field level"", what have you done already to accommodate the discrepancies in virtual learning today based on socioeconomic factors (work schedule, internet speed, timezone, DSP status, etc.)? Lastly, what explicitly makes Berkeley different then universities like USC, Stanford, John Hopkins, and other UCs like UCLA or UC Davis, that have adopted P/NP grading?
Dear Chancellor Christ. I wanted to echo the sentiments of my peers and urge the administration to consider offering some form of P/NP for this semester.
What is the best way for students to convince UC Berkeley to change the P/NP policy for major requirements this semester. We want change.
Why are the lights at Moffitt always on even though nobody is studying there?
What are the chances of the option to pnp for major prerequisites like other top universities are doing this semester?
What's the campus plan to make mental health resources more accessible in the coming year? Many students I know are struggling with depression and are not able to get access to a therapist.
Can you elucidate the specific reasons as to why the University has not expressed interest in allowing for P/NP for major or minor requirements? You have cited how it has raised stress levels in the past, but where are you getting this information from?
Hello,

Can you please discuss the disinterest for a pass/no pass semester here at Cal? With wildfires that broke out all over the United States, a global pandemic, and an eventful election, it seems that a pass/no pass system should at least be considered. If you could please give us some information that would be great
Hi Chancellor Christ! Thanks for doing this. 

How do you plan on improving Cal’s Alumni outreach and ensuring we keep a connection to the university? What concrete steps have been taken? And how can we help as alums?

Having graduated a few years ago, I feel like the alumni connection to the university is very underwhelming compared to universities, both public and private (and I’m in the Bay!). And while lots of people *love* Cal, it feels like that love isn’t returned by the admin/alumni programs. For such a strong institution, I’d love to see us replicate what other elite universities of our caliber do. For example, the CAA is independent and I don’t get any tangible benefit nor find it useful. E.g., we don’t get Elibrary access unlike other universities. I would kill for small things like this!

This is problematic. From our perspective, we don’t get many network benefits post-Cal, and none of the cool perks from going to such an amazing school. And, as I’m sure you’re acutely aware, it almost definitely affects donations as well. It seems like a win-win situation to work on that affects both new and old bears. (but obviously with no easy solution).
Why isnt there optional P/F grading at Cal like there is at peer schools such as USC, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio State, etc.
Would you rather fight 1 Campinile sized Chancellor Christ, or 100 Chancellor Christ sized Campiniles?
I like many other students would love for to address the P/NP topic. I understand that the show must go on, but as a sophomore, it feels like not only is college worse than it should’ve been, but also so much more stressful. We can all pretend like it’s the same difficulty to balance your work and life balance, but it just isn’t.
Hi! I'm a chemistry student so I'm understandably concerned about the impact that lack of in-person labs will have on my education. Are there any plans to offer in-person labs to make up for what's missed, etc?
Dear Chancellor Christ,

Given the Covid-19 pandemic and the move to online classes, I would think that this is the best time to allow students to take classes with conflicting time slots, as long as one or multiple of these classes recorded lectures and posted them at a different date. I have been debating back and forth this week over what classes to choose for the upcoming spring semester, as multiple classes I need for my major and find interesting all occur in overlapping time slots. Is there any possibility of the enrollment rules changing in order to allow us to enroll in classes with conflicting time slots so long as the professors confirm that they will be recording the material posted during these overlapping periods?
Hi Chancellor,

Could you comment on the **sexual assault allegations** made this summer against Nicholas Zhao?
 
**Specifically, I am curious why no actions were taken, much less even a statement was issued, against him**. Given the sheer number of people (20+) who came forth with accounts of rape, sexual assault, and child pornography, it is apalling to me that nothing has come out of this incident. He has been banned from attending frats and clubs in addition to these claims, further emphasizing that he is not only a menace to individual victims but also to the safety of many.

It is a bit hard to believe that UC Berkeley is *committed to preventing and addressing sexual violence & sexual harassment* when situations like these occur. If such an egregious case can go unresolved, then:

1. What really is the policy that the university takes against sexual predators?  
2. Why wasn't that implemented for this incident?

A lot of times people say that there isn't enough concrete evidence a sexual assault actually occured, but if TWENTY cases doesn't mean anything, then there is a problem.

Thank you for the AMA!

What do you think about the petition:   
Petition for a PNP Option for all Classes and Major Requirements at Cal for Fall 2020  
[https://www.change.org/su/p/uc-berkeley-asuc-and-uc-berkeley-pnp-option-for-major-classes/f?source\_location=psf\_petitions](https://www.change.org/su/p/uc-berkeley-asuc-and-uc-berkeley-pnp-option-for-major-classes/f?source_location=psf_petitions)
Hi Chancellor!

I’ve always been interested in what’s separating the quality of Berkeley’s dining from other schools like UCLA or Virginia Tech. We’re keen on sustainable foods - is it the preparation that makes them subpar? Is the university working on fixing this issue or will it just be a fact of Berkeley for years to come?
I would like to start by saying that I am extremely disappointed in how the administration is handling the P/NP situation. I understand being hesitant in the decision, but now given many other major universities have given their students the option to P/NP their classes, I do not understand why Berkeley would not do the same at this point. There are many students facing extreme circumstances and we shouldn't have the same grading options as we would during a normal school year.

Additionally, even though you have decided not to change the grading options for all classes, the deadline to change grading options is October 30. I think the least you can do is give us more time to decide whether we want/need to P/NP our classes. We need change.
Dear Chancellor Christ,

Thank you for doing the AMA.

Why has the university reacted so poorly and apathetically to student tragedies this past year? This year, Seth Smith was murdered near campus- it took the university weeks to send an email about his tragic death. When you did send an email, the email was vague (listing only Seth's major, and, in fact, incorrectly missed one of his majors) and spent far more time on the death of George Floyd and police brutality. While Floyd's death was also tragic, the university had already emailed about Floyd several times, and to take just one or two sentences to just touch on a tragic death of *one of our own* and jump to other events was hurtful. Seth at least deserved his own email.

Similarly, why is there no attention on Sydney West, the Berkeley student who is missing and last seen in SF? Why hasn't the campus organize vigils for her? Why haven't we sent emails begging everyone to share and report if anyone has seen her? Why hasn't the university said anything at all? Her parents have said repeatedly that more awareness and an increase in the volume of search could save Sydney's life and bring her home- and the university has done nothing.

Chancellor Christ, this is *not* a small issue.  Not only do Sydney and Seth (and perhaps others whom I'm missing) deserve better, but this is a sign to every Berkeley student that UC Berkeley *does not care* about students as individuals. I know now that if anything were to happen to me, Berkeley wouldn't care.  It just further reinforces the fact that at Berkeley, students are numbers. Imagine that reaction from the university if it were your kids- if something happened to them, how would you feel if the university they attended couldn't even take 5 minutes to send an email out?

&#x200B;

And please, if you can now, send an email about Sydney.
Given the long lines, fewer polls, and other attempts at undermining this election—why hasn’t UC Berkeley canceled classes to protect students exercising their right to vote? What policies exist to protect students who may be late/miss classes given unexpected challenges and long lines?
Hello Chancellor Christ,

Thank you for all your efforts and hope you're doing well :)

What are your thoughts on allowing students to take one class on a P/NP basis (identical to the system UCLA is implementing)? I feel this is a good compromise to the problem and is easily implementable given that UCLA (a school of a similar caliber and size) has already chosen the option.
[deleted]
Hi Chancellor Christ, staff member here. The worst kept secret among staff right now is the pending proposal for furloughs/paycuts next year. When will the university share more details about this? It’s hard to save money in advance if we don’t know how much money is going to be missing from our paychecks in 2021.
Hi Carol, what are we doing to better support the CS/EECS department? Enrollment in this department is skyrocketing while central campus is cutting funding for classes, leading to people not getting into desired classes/classes not being offered, and multi-hour office hour queues in lower and upper div courses.
Hello Chancellor, thank you for doing this! One of my concerns with Berkeley is Cal Dining. I sincerely believe that improving the quality and variety of food will significantly lift the student mood on campus—it was literally my only point of concern with coming to Cal over UCLA. Is there a reason why Berkeley's dining trails behind other campuses despite us spending the same amount?
Will we have an option to take classes online from Fall 2021 even if it becomes inperson? I want to take classes online till I feel comfortable coming on campus. I have to make a decision of moving out of country based on this so if I could know if there might be an option to take Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 online?
Chancellor Christ,

I'm a member of staff and an alumnus. I'm as big of a Cal fan as they come, and have been attending Athletics events with my family for 35 years. And yet, I was surprised and upset to see the University allow the continuation of athletics while we are still in this pandemic. I have some questions regarding this:

1. Do we really think it is safe for the student athletes? Comparing to outbreaks in MLB and NFL, do we think we can do any better? Quantitatively, what level of risk do we consider appropriate?
2. Many hospitals and public health departments do not have access to the types of rapid tests we are providing our athletes. Additionally, essential workers at Cal aren't even given access to these types of tests. How do we justify prioritizing sports over patients, other students, and essential workers? Do we not see ourselves, as a public University, held to higher standards than private institutions in ensuring public health and wellbeing?

Thanks, and Go Bears!
Hi Chancellor Christ,

can you please admit that you engineered COVID-19 so that we could keep the Axe for another year?
Dear Chancellor Christ, 

What is it like to be responsible for such a large, complex organization? What are the most challenging aspects of heading UCB (perhaps especially those that we may not be aware of) and what is most rewarding? 

From your perspective, how are major universities across the board responding to and affected by shifts in expectations from this generation and the current COVID-19 situation we find ourselves in? Which responses do you see as the most successful so far?
Hi Chancellor Christ, 

Do you have updates on the new Data Science building with the $250 million gift we received in March ? 

Thank you for all that you do for the school.
Would you agree, in hindsight, that grossly overspending on a football stadium was as bad of an idea as everyone told you it was? Especially when you are now cutting so many upper division classes from so many programs such as  disability studies(for which the core classes aren't even offered) and innovative design(which has almost no upper divs). If even EECS, the largest and most renowned major on this campus, cannot be relied on to have an adequate selection of upper division courses next semester, how do you expect anyone to have faith in this institution? Either in its commitment to their education, or its ability to graduate them on time?
Hi Chancellor, 

Do you think we will be able to return to in-person classes by Fall 2021
Hi Carol, 

As a spring 2021 transfer I have felt very down about not being able to obtain the full Berkeley experience. I may only have one true semester on campus if Fall 2021 is in person. Do you have any suggestions on how I can make the most of my time here virtually? I feel like when I look back on my time in Berkeley I may not feel like I truly went here. 

Thank you for your time.
Hello Chancellor Christ,

Is there any plans for reduced tuition in future semesters if there will be no in person classes? Certainly Spring 2020 was understandable for no refunds since it was all so sudden, and even Fall 2020. However, if online instruction will last for multiple semesters, why are we continuing to pay full tuition for resources that are not even available for us? ie: why are we paying for the RSF that we are not allowed to access yet still get charged for? Why are we paying so much for student activities fees when we get a diminished social and networking opportunity, as well as not having access to free food from events (as many of of are food insecure)?
Please consider P/NP. Or at least some university wide effort? Right now, COE isn’t giving their kids an extra late drop like L&S. They say we can talk to our counselors and explain our circumstances, but frankly I am sick and tired of having to essentially use my fresh trauma to beg for leniency. Why can the university not understand that a significant portion of students have undergone huge life changes this semester? I’m sorry if this comes across as rude but I am angry. I knew Cal, especially engineering, was brutal, but I had no idea it was to this extent. I wish I chose a different university.
Hi Chancellor Christ! First off, thank you so much for taking the time to answer our questions and for all the work you do for Cal.

In the ""Silicon Valley echo chamber"" there is this notion that higher education is quickly becoming irrelevant in the COVID age. They base this on the fact that students can find higher quality, cheaper (free), and more accessible forms of learning online that they can  readily use to get employed or start a business.

What are some strategies you have to keep Berkeley's traditional university education model competitive in the arena of decentralized, rapidly-digitizing education?
Hello! 

If classes are hybrid, would the vaccinated students be allowed to take their classes in person if they have proof of immunization from COVID? 

If a large portion of the students and the course faculty are immune to corona, what would be the process of determining how to restart classes?

When do you, personally, think that public health conditions will allow actual hybrid or in person classes to start?

Will the COVID vaccine be mandatory for all Berkeley students when it is released?
Chancellor Christ: I'd love to hear some concrete plans for rehabilitating the admissions process so that underqualified students can't simply buy their way into this school. What are some tangible steps that are being taken?
Hi Chancellor Christ,

Thank you for taking the time to listen to student concerns. I would like to know what Berkeley is doing to strengthen support for students with dealing with mental health issues during the pandemic. Given the unprecedented challenges faced by students during the pandemic, it seems clear that CAPS is not adequately prepared to give students the help they need. It can take weeks to get an intake appointment, and the 8 session limit creates extra stress. I speak from experience. In the week before the pandemic started, my partner lost her job and I lost my father. I am in an immense amount of emotional pain still, but I am almost out of sessions with CAPS now because my mental health has suffered to the point of needing weekly therapy. It's incredibly painful and intimidating to have to part with a therapist I trust so abruptly and find another long-term option, which I will have to pay copays for. I would also like to note that for marginalized communities, finding culturally humble therapists is crucial, but the SHIP provider database has no filters other than binary gender. This places an extra burden on students who need help. I am disappointed that I had more consistent access to mental health services at my CCC during the spring semester than I do at Berkeley now. Will you advocate for students who are dealing with serious mental health concerns and work to make CAPS more robust?

Also, once campus is fully reopened, will the University extend free access to services we're paying fees for now like the RSF past graduation for students who could not use them due to the pandemic? I'm a new transfer student, and right now it looks like my access will be limited to the 2021-2022 academic year at best. I would like to be able to make up for benefits that I am losing out on now due to the pandemic in the future.
Chancellor Christ, what are your thoughts on designating Election Day as a non-mandatory or non-instructional day?
Hi Chancellor Christ. I am a student in the MPH program. Why do tuition costs still reflect pre-Covid tuition, including fees for services we cannot use? Maintenance is much less when no one is on campus, so I have a hard time fathoming why students must pay these high costs when most of us are going through financial hardships with the pandemic. The school’s response has mostly been to suggest taking out more loans. However, at least for the MPH, there is a comparable online MPH program, which is wildly less expensive, especially for nonresident students. Is there an ethical rationale for charging students these tuition costs?
Hi chancellor, last AMA, I asked about taking on the debt for the stadium renovations. As a follow-up, now that major disasters have hit and cuts are being made to academic departments, do you still have any hindsight thoughts on effectively subsidizing athletics? If so, what would you have done? I personally like the ""do more with less"" mindset that a lot of public universities adopt, but too much of anything is bad. Do you think we're getting close to a breaking point in terms of academic funding cuts? Thanks!
Hello Chancellor Christ! With everything going on and the pressure you must be under, how are YOU holding up? Take care 😇
Hello Chancellor Christ, do you have any recommendations on staying mentally sane in an environment where it feels like your professors don't really care about your mental health?
How will the university be handling grad admissions for this coming year? To what extent will programs that have decided to keep their grad admissions open have their cohorts curtailed?
Class of 2020 grad here. Are there any updates on commencement? I’ve received my diploma, is that it? Just feels like now that we’re out the door the university is wiping it’s hands of us and moving on to focusing on this year. At this point many of us have moved on as well (starting work, grad school, etc) and it just a little sad that both parties seem to have forgotten about each other. Go Bears tho.
Thank you for doing this. Berkeley is one of the world's premier academic institutions, yet it has placed more time and money in making sure that the football program can compete in person than that students can attend CLASS. This is an outrage. Can you please justify how Berkeley has put athletics above academics during this time, and why there is a different standard for the return of athletic practices (that involve close physical contact) than for the return of socially distanced classes and/or small gatherings?
Why are the lights at Moffitt always on even though nobody is studying there?
Dear Chancellor Christ,

do GSIs and professors make sure zoom proctoring recordings are secure and deleted after exam? think there would be protections for student data privacy. we are forced to record ourselves at home, show id, and screen share.. concerned about intrusiveness of this and gives weird vibes...
Thank you for doing this AMA! I’m a senior and will be graduating this spring. I have a genetics lab class that I need to take to graduate and have been struggling to find information on how it will be handled. I’m currently in India, so if the lab is synchronous I’ll have class from 2:30AM to 6:30AM which is very difficult to me so I was hoping that since there are seemingly no in-person labs that they would be recorded and delivered asynchronously. Would it be possible for you to tell us how lab classes will be handled in the spring and maybe talk about whether there will any effort to make things easier on students in other countries who have difficult time difference situations and have no choice but to take some classes this semester?
Hi Chancellor, I just want to let you know that some classes are using asynchronous class to add more materials for the class and for me its very overwhelming. Just because we can watch pre-recorded online, I feel that its not fair if class time are also used to talk about other materials. Yes, they are not mandatory, but they are extra information like coding demo that would be useful, but it's far and beyond the hours we need to put for a 3 credit class. I also heard from other students that many courses are doing this as well. Can situation like this (about instructors giving extra materials because of asynchronous lecture times) be addressed next semester? Thank you.
Hi Chancellor Christ, thank you for doing this. I have two questions for you:

First, on web lecture quality. My professors run into multiple technical issues every week while hosting lectures over zoom, and it should not be the professor’s job to worry about production quality while trying to teach. As such, students are not receiving the high quality education Berkeley is known for. 

Would you consider implementing policy changes to make higher quality educational resources available to students? Some ideas I had were hiring dedicated production staff (camera, audio specialists) to facilitate professors recording/streaming lectures from campus lecture halls or providing professors with better recording equipment or giving professors lessons on how to effectively teach on Zoom. Berkeley is uniquely positioned to set the precedent for high quality educational resources even during online instruction, all we need is administrative leadership. 

Second, on tuition. Many students feel we shouldn’t be paying the same base tuition for online instruction, as we aren’t able to access many of the college’s resources. For example, students still have to pay the campus fee despite not being on campus. Would you consider lowering tuition for the Spring 2021 semester, given that it will likely be online-only? 

Thank you in advance, I look forward to hearing from you. Stay safe!
What are a challenge and a joy (even in 2020) of being Chancellor that the average student/staff wouldn't know or think about?
Why are the lights at Moffitt always on even though nobody is studying there?
Would students be able to late drop without impacting their finantial aid status and eligibility this Fall? Some of us are relying on aid to stay in school during COVID, and we can't use the extra late drop L&S give us this Fall if it would penalize our finantial aid status.
What are you doing to prevent corruption in the admissions process especially in regards to staff and donors admitting friends, family, and other connections? Why did your office forward a recommendation letter from Regent Blum to the office office?
Thank you for doing this!

What’s your view on preferential treatment when it comes to admissions specifically the concept of legacy admissions (that happens at some private schools) in light of the UC’s recent finding of “improper admissions” based on connections to donor and staff?
What have you done or will you do to ensure that the quality of education and learning is improved or at the very least matches previous semesters? Some of my classes use old lecture videos taught by a GSI from this past summer rather than recording new ones for this semester. It doesn't seem fair to pay full tuition while professors put in less effort to teach students.

Will you make efforts to open outdoor libraries or outdoor classes with additional precautions? Many other universities have implemented such policies in significantly worse climates. The student body obviously understands the complications of in person, but it doesn't even seem like Berkeley is making an attempt at moving anything in person or outside. 

How do you justify maintaining the price of tuition and the campus fee while I'm not given original, quality content to learn from, and the university makes seemingly no effort to go in person?
Dear Chancellor Carol Christ,

My question is simple: What are the University's plan on making UC Berkeley a more safer campus for students? 

Context: I am so tired of walking home after studying all night worried if I am going to be the next crime report on email. Over the past summer, a student got shot while taking a break from his work late at night. Just this past few weeks, a student went missing. I have heard countless, horrible stories of students lives being in danger and it seems like it has not been getting any better. Too many of my friends have been mugged just for walking home. We need to create a safer environment for Berkeley students to study.
How much effort will be made to actually hold spring classes currently categorized as Tier 1, in person?  


I am a freshman who is living on campus and in the fall I made a great deal of effort to enroll in and align my schedule for classes that said they would be hybrid/flexible. My family also spent money to secure me a room on campus in the hopes I would have some in person engagement this year.
What is your strategy for reopening facilities for campus student organizations? While some clubs can operate virtually (though in a limited capacity), other organizations, like engineering competition teams, have been severely hindered or entirely shut down by the lack of access to labs, shops, and build spaces. Is socially-distanced access an option for the upcoming semester?
Why hasn't Berkeley taken any course of action against or even commented on the actions of **Nicholas Zhao** over the past summer when *20+ people* came out with sexual assault allegations? It is appalling that a university like Berkeley would continue to allow a sexual predator to continue to endanger students.
Are there any plans to open campus facilities anytime soon, like libraries?
Are there ways that we can work together to create new work-study jobs?  These could pay students to address some of our brand-new issues, such as, managing online education materials, managing inventory for the tech equity program, or helping Tang find mental health resources in other regions of the world.  Thanks for your thoughts!
Hi Chancellor Christ,

The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the lack of resources for undergraduates here compared to peer institutions. Hours long wait times to get 10 minutes of help make it impossible for students with jobs to get the help they need. GPA cutoffs for popular majors make it so kids who were exposed to the subject in high school (mostly economically advantaged families) have a huge advantage in studying what they want. Even in normal times students are routinely kicked out from review sessions because lecture halls because they are too full. The more crowded Berkeley's housing marked gets, the more unaffordable living here for disadvantaged student's get.

I think your effort to build more housing and add more faculty is a great step, but Berkeley's future plans state that we plan to enroll more students. Won't that make your initiatives just a temporary band-aid? 

Politicians and administrators love to talk about UC's master plan mandate to educate Californians, but they forget that the master plan limited UC campuses to 27,500 students total to protect educational quality and manage effects on the community. Berkeley stands as a light for public education, but I and other students fear its quality will decline and our light will be dimmed.
Dear Chancellor Christ, What is the construction cost of the ""Levine-Fricke Softball Improvement Project,"" and what is being built for that much money? My research shows construction cost for bidding was estimated as $26 million. Yet, this is only a ""field improvement? Isn't that an expensive field?
Hi Chancellor, do you think that Berkeley will ever get back to having affordable tuition rates? What can we do as students/alumni/Californians to get affordable tuition? I had a professor whose tuition was less than 1% of mine when he attended Cal.
Will you address the high risk that students who are suffering during this quarantine will turn to dropping out (or suicide for those of us who are cornered financially) if the difficulties aren’t properly addressed? Whether you allow optional P/NP or not, something’s got to give. You can’t just keep telling us to get iPads and charging full on-campus rent/tuition and tell us that we’re “supported in these unprecedented times”. How will UCB help us?
Hi Chancellor Christ! How do you spell the name of our arch nemesis: stanfurd, satanford, stanford, Berkeley #2, or something else entirely? 

Asking for all woke and loyal golden bears.
What did an average Saturday night look like for the Chancellor when she was at college?
President of the Cal Entomology club here, I want to you what your favorite insect is Chancellor. Thank you.
Hi Chancellor,

Now that phase 1 has started I am wondering as a spring student. Has any decision or plan been made for Spring 2021 given the current status of COVID and the proximity of January. It would be nice to have plenty of time to plan, thank you!
Hello! Thanks so much for doing this. I'm so grateful for this event!

Anyways, I was wondering how students can do to help. Personally, for me, there has been less classes offered during next semester and a lot of the research labs had their funding cut. How can students get involved to help make sure that this doesn't get any worse?
Hello Supreme Chancellor. Two questions: 1) Where do you get your hair done? And 2) Why would you allow the university to close a premier research organization devoted to addressing social problems and uplifting BIPOC graduate students by supporting their research and careers (the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues)? Especially during 2020, the year of unprecedented social unrest due to systemic racial violence and the failure of the modern state. To me it signals that the university does not care about diversity nor does it value social science research conducted by students of color.
Hi Chancellor Christ, thank you for hosting this AMA!

A few questions on a lighter note: what were your initial reactions to Cal's Nobel prize double win this year by university faculty? Did you expect it at all? And how's the search for more Nobel Laureate parking spaces going? 

Thanks and take care!
Dear Chancellor Christ, 
Is the University planning to stop our reliance on the Natural gas cogeneration plant? It would make sense to reduce costs associated with carbon offsets coming with the 2025 Carbon Neutrality Initiative.

Also how is the Upper Hill campus going to be managed to build wildfire resilience amidst worsening fires every year?
WHATS YOUR MAX BENCH SQUAT DEADLIFT?!!!
If diversity, equity, and inclusion is one of your primary goals for improvement this year, why are you allowing VCRO to close ISSI when they have a track record of being a significant boon for faculty and staff of color? How do you reconcile closing a space made by POC, and a space that greatly benefits POC, with improving campus climate?
Why are you letting VCRO close ISSI? It's such a terrible decision and it will have disastrous consequences for marginalized students, faculty, and other members of the Berkeley community, and on the University's research into the most important social issues of our time. ISSI's programming was a large part of my decision to come to UC Berkeley for professional school. If ISSI closes, I will probably transfer somewhere else that actually values & invests in scholars of color. You can't just cut programs that we need and expect to keep getting our tuition $$
Thanks for doing this AMA at such a critical time Chancellor Christ.  As a graduate student, I know that many labs and departments have been working to come up with ways to increase recruitment and retention of faculty and students from under-represented minorities (eg BIPOC).  However, I've heard much less about what policies or guidelines the university itself has implemented or been working on to ensure that Cal advances as a coordinated whole.  Could you share some highlights of what efforts have already been made and what initiatives are still ongoing to facilitate more equitable representation?

I also think that it is important to show what work has been and is still being done to increase equity, but it's very difficult to collate all that information for myself even though I'm sure the information is out there in some fragmented form.  Can a centralized initiative and progress tracker be placed somewhere easily accessible from the Cal front page?  It is vital to accountability and would likely be a useful recruitment tool for prospective faculty and students, particularly those who might have concerns about climate and representation.
Can you address the Safety protocol on campus. It seems to be getting out of control. The students safety should be top priority. Do the campus police roam surface streets surrounding dorms, apartments and dining halls 24/7? Is there any type of agreement with the local police to monitor student populated areas? Are students notified of all suspicious activity- so they are aware?
What is needed for the university to get back to in-person classes and activities?
Why are the lights at Moffitt always on even though nobody is studying there?
Hi Chancellor Christ,

A lot of your students, like myself, are really struggling with mental health and struggling to study in our homes. Could the school please think about opening the libraries/gyms in safe ways? Or setting up outdoor study spaces for students? Many students are finding it difficult to be in the right head space to be attending such a rigorous university and opening these facilities would benefit the student body immensely. Of course we would need safety measures such as checking for negative tests, masks and limited capacities but I believe this is something that the student body would be very grateful for. Also we are paying the campus fee. Please consider this. Thanks!
Can you PNP for the next few years until school back to normal, PNP can lower our stress and can help us get in our major easily
During the spring of 2002, your interview on Smith campus included an interview with members of the Student Grassroots Organization. After a series of racist, xenophobic, ageist, and homophobic events on campus that year, the new college President had to be approved by this organization as well as the normal hiring process.

While discussing your record on LGBT rights, you told them that you had led the push for equal benefits during your time on the board at Berkeley. A request for records from that board showed that not only had you not introduced the measure to provide benefits to same sex partners of faculty/staff, but that you had cast one of the only/few votes against it.

**Why do you believe it was OK to lie in a job interview and why was it OK for Smith College to keep you on after that lie was revealed?**

After entering office, you directed the college's legal counsel to issue letters to students who had been involved in leading those protests that if they were found to engage in any activism on or off campus during their time at smith, they would face expulsion from the Smith community or the termination of their financial aid.

**In light of such tactics, why should any student or college feel you have any respect for students' civil rights?**
Hello Chancellor Christ, I'm sure both class of 2020 and 2021 are concerned about graduation and what that's going to look like. As many things are reopening, I'm hoping the university will find a safe and cautious way to provide an in-person graduation for both class of 2020 and 2021. Please let us know if there is currently any information regarding graduation.
Hello Chancellor, I hope you’re doing well. Will you please explain the viewpoint of the administration regarding pass no pass. What are the concerns preventing the administration from enacting this policy? Is there evidence of these concerns from spring?
Why did they take the chairs and tables away at Think Cafe? That was one of the only decent places to work on campus.
I don’t want to read the whole thing. Can someone tell me what’s the verdict of this Q&A and how likely is P/NP?

Hey Chancellor,

Do you blame greek life for our current situation regarding hyrbid vs online only classes? That is all.
Would you please explain the symbolism of the tree in Yeats' poem ""Among School Children""?
Are there any plans to open up libraries or gyms in Spring 2021? I feel doing so would be very beneficial to students who are finding it difficult to study in apartments all alone. Social distancing would obviously be implemented. 

Please consider opening up libraries! Thank you!
If the university won't budge on p/np, then can we at least remove the -/+ of grades for this semester. I find that (-) on grades drops our GPA so much.
Chancellor you received complaints from members of the Cal women's soccer team regarding allegations of ongoing mental, emotional and physical **abuse**. What steps did you take to investigate the allegation against the women's soccer coach, his staff and the athletic dept?
Given the state of the pandemic and difficulties of zoom university. Can we consider some sense of leniency with the 3.3 GPA to declare CS in the College of Letters and Sciences. The instructors over the summer all admitted that the midterm was unfairly difficult as there was this concern with cheating amongst students. This transition has been hard for all of us, instructors included.
Why are we spending money to \*study\* the impacts of not having UCPD instead of actually…getting rid of them or significantly cutting their budget?
Carol remember that time you came outside of your house at Smith College in your bathrobe smelling like fresh Colgate toothpaste because a friend and I had just chalked “Carol Christ, as a rape” and I was about to write “survivor I demand services on campus” and you jaunted out to very crisply ask, “EXCUSE ME WHAT AM I RAPE OF?!” I explained what the rest of it would say. Then I said, “I want to have services on campus for people who have been raped.” And you said “instead of writing this terrible message on my driveway why wouldn’t you try to get an appointment with me? How would I know who you are if I hadn’t seen you?” So then I signed my name to the damn chalking and forwarded all the unreturned emails I had sent to you and your assistant. 

Then lots of other people signed their names under the chalking, too. Then you didn’t do anything until we scheduled a sit in and invited tv news crews and you hauled me (and my chalking friend) into your office and glared at us while Maureen Mahoney told us how unreasonable we were. That was so fun and just really demonstrated how you were in it for the students! Just wondering if you remember lol! Hope you’re having a great life.
Besides making a bunch of new committees and giving money to departments that have historically BENEFITED from racism, what is actively being done to improve life for junior faculty and students of color? And what people of color, and how many, are being consulted on these initiatives?
How many staff, faculty, and students of color are consulted when you and cabinet decide to make initiatives to improve DE&I? Are you actively listening to what URMs tell you would help us? As a poc what I see is a lot of decisions that are clearly made by a room primarily full of white people.
chancellor Christ,

as you know, right now, there is a devastating war happening between the Armenians in the unrecognized Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan with full Turkish military support. 

As you know, the Ottoman Empire carried out the Armenian genocide of 1915...Turkey has yet to even acknowledge its occurrence, let alone apologize for it. 

And i’m sure as you may know, there is overwhelming public evidence that Azerbaijan’s and Turkey’s war raged against the peaceful people of Artsakh has little to do with reclaiming any land that was “rightfully Azerbaijan’s”. It is a modern day genocide, and if freely given the reign, they will cleanse all ethnic Armenians in the region. 

My question to you is, what steps will UC Berkeley take to condemn Azerbaijani and Turkish aggressors, and how will it pressure the entire UC system and California in its entirety to recognize the Republic of Artsakh and prevent genocide?
Chancellor Christ, thank you for allowing us to ask you questions. I am concerned that the University has not adopted a land acknowledgement, given that we live, work and study on unceded Huichin Ohlone land. As I am sure you are aware, the University has a long and sordid history with the way we have treated Native Bay Area folks. You have the power to mandate that the University adopt a land acknowledgement. Why have you not yet? Please don't say it's a complicated issue. Natives on campus have already done the work for you.
Dear Chancellor,

Many  Berkeley students reached out to you with a request to send a campus-wide email of acknowledgment about the devastating war in the South Caucasus between the ethnic Armenian enclave of Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh) and Azerbaijan.  My question is why do you think a public educational institution with a legacy for Free Speech should not be involved to spread this urgent and very important message? Do we have to wait for another Genocide to happen or do we have to wait to historicize this tragedy to be thought of as a suitable case study of Peace and Conflict negotiations? Why should we not take action as a public institution? It is worthy to note that the University of Berkeley has an Armenian Studies department and the American-Armenian Student association who raised this urgent matter.

On September 27 of 2020, the Azerbaijani army forces, backed by the Turkish army, started a massive scale attack along the entire line of contact in Artsakh (former Nagorno Karabakh), beginning the second war of Nagorno Karabakh. It has been internationally proved that Azerbaijan and Turkey involved many Syrian terrorist mercenaries to destabilize the region. The Syrian government and France, Canadian intelligence agents, confirmed that the Azerbaijan used Syrian terrorist groups in this war. This is a massive threat for the South Caucasus region, which will impact Armenia and Artsakh and the entire region, including Central Asian and Eastern European countries. Turkey's military involvement in the region and as a NATO member is a significant threat to regional security. Currently, the Azerbaijani-Turkey Allay keeps under massive attack of Artsakh and Armenia's civilian settlements, targeting peaceful citizens, essential infrastructures like hospitals, schools, and emergency infrastructures. Today is the fourth week of the war, a new humanitarian catastrophe has not been addressed as such.  As an educational institution, I would like to urge you to spread the news to the world. This is a matter of freedom, self-determination, and a right of existence. Armenia was forcefully opposed to this war to protect their fundamental rights of existence. Armenia is fighting against terrorism in the region.

An attempt of ethnic cleansing is happening now to peaceful citizens of NK. Schools, kindergartens, public infrastructures are being shelled by ballistic missiles for three weeks. The US has to take action to stop selling armor to Turkey and Azerbaijan as they are used against the civilian population. And most importantly the US as a mediator of MInk Group has to recognize Artsakh as a sovereign state. 

 I understand that the United States has its own struggles with the upcoming presidential elections, COVID pandemic, systematic racism, and economic collapse, but this was the exact path in WWI when the world was busy again with their own problems and the Armenian Genocide occurred.  I completely understand that you are an art historian, yet this is a reality that can be prevented from becoming another humanitarian failure in human history. 

 I strongly believe in cultural diplomacy and education as a tool for the public reforms. I hope that my voice will be heard, and UCB will spread awareness about this humanitarian catastrophe in the middle of the pandemic. Azerbaijan admitted severe war crimes that have to be recognized, and immediate actions should be done by both the Minsk OSCE group and countries in power. 

&#x200B;

Thank you!
Hi Chancellor Christ,

Why has the university remained quiet with regards to the current humanitarian crisis in Artsakh? Artsakh's inhabitants face the threat of genocide at the hands of larger powers, yet, despite the demonstrations of the Armenian community throughout the world, in the Bay Area and in our school, U.C. Berkeley can't spare so much as university wide email about the issue?
When will you start listening to poc who tell you what we need instead of listening to a bunch of white nonsense that doesn’t actually help us at all?
Chancellor, there seems to be an overwhelming political bias in this university and as an independent critical thinking student, I do not feel the ""diversity and inclusivity"" that this campus preached during my orientation. UC has ""conversations"" (mostly about race which they are obsessed with) and everyone on the panel is very much on the left side of the spectrum and just regurgitates talking points coming from Democrats, ignoring many other perspectives with serious intellectual and factual credibility. Due to the leftist bias on campus and in the faculty, UC Berkeley has lost quite a bit of prestige and has become somewhat of a joke in the world because of the one sided leftist politics and the interest in creating so-called safe spaces while ignoring facts in favor of trying to make people feel not offended by anything. Shouldn't the university have a responsibility to educate its students on how to think? Can you please make an effort to bring in bipartisan conversations?
Would you take the Covid vaccine if it came out?
Chancellor Christ,

I am writing to you today overwhelmed with concern as an **ally of Armenia**, and the **descendant of the indigenous people of the nation**. Over a century ago, my ancestors battled a genocide, and I’m afraid another humanitarian crisis may be on the horizon. 

Nearly every Armenian student has sent emails to you and other faculty asking for support and recognition of the war in Armenia and the attacks from Azerbaijan on the independent region of Artsakh. UCLA's chancellor has made a statement in support of their students. USC has had various departments and faculty also make statements. As well and UCI and UCSD. UC Berkeley has remained SILENT (besides the public health department sending out an email written by a student to every SPH email). TWO ALUMNI from UC Berkeley have fought for the liberation of Artsakh in the war 3 decades ago. It is painfully disappointing that our school has remained silent on this issue.
Why hasn't the University officially adopted any formal acknowledgement that it occupies Huichin Ohlone land? After everything the University has done to Native peoples, a Land Acknowledgement is, literally, the least you can do.

Lately I’ve seen many official outlets of the university take strong political positions. In the past, people of all politics were respected. Who allowed the change for the university to be a wing of the Democratic Party and why don’t you see that as a problem?
What are you going to do about the fact that 2023 Global Management Program (Haas) students are being locked out of required major classes Spring semester? The classes are needed for GMP students to graduate in 4 years. For many GMP students, this makes it impossible to get a required 13 credits to be considered full time students next semester.
Hello Chancellor Christ, I hope all is well with you and your family in these challenging times. I and my student recently engaged with your staff in lengthy disputes with students rights and did not get a satisfactory response and wondering if you could help in some ways in resolving this once and for all. If yes, please respond and we could arrange for a communication forum. Thank you! Keep safe.
Moving UCPD from Sproul Hall is a nice gesture (a nicer gesture would be reducing their funding and weaponry). Sproul Hall is located in such a prominent location on campus and the choice of departments housed in Sproul Hall sends a loud message about the school's priorities and values. For that reason alone, you should replace UCPD in Sproul Hall with departments that do the exact opposite of the police: study, advocate, and fight for racial equity. May I suggest the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues? I understand that VCRO has decided to close ISSI, in large part because the Anna Head building needs repairs that the University can't/doesn't want to pay for. If ISSI were re-housed to Sproul Hall, its important research benefiting people of color could continue, for a tiny fraction of the current UCPD budget I'm sure. If you take a little money from UCPD to keep ISSI open, and move ISSI into Sproul Hall, it would make a powerful statement about the University's values and make all the ""Diversity, Equity & Inclusion"" talk look a little less like lip service. You can send as many nicely-worded emails as you want to, but nothing's actually going to change unless you make some bold decisions about what kind of community we want to be.
Hi Chancellor,

I know a lot of people are voicing their opinions about letting everyone do P/NP but I would like to provide opposition to that argument, I really think only people with specific hardships or extenuating circumstances should be given the option to P/NP. Copied from my other post:

I understand that some students are struggling in their home environment and those students should be able to talk to an adviser or something and be given the opportunity to do P/NP for all classes. However, given the frequency of demands for P/NP, it really seems like a lot of people are piggybacking on this cause just to boost their grades.

It's interesting how no one complained about having P/NP for the first 5 weeks or so of class, and then midterm season rolls around and suddenly everyone wants the ability to P/NP. Its almost as if they didn't do good on their midterms and instead of accepting that they could have done better they immediately blame the pandemic instead of their own study habits or time management (note: the grading curves this semester are the exact same if not more lenient compared to before). Letting all students P the course really undermines the efforts from students from previous semesters who worked extra hard in the course as well. Additionally, if P/NP is given this early in the semester its very likely people will just get lazy and learn next to nothing for the next half of the semester, skating by with a P, which is kind of alarming if they are for major requirements.

Plus, what will the university do if they are online for say 3 more semesters? Transfer students will have a transcript full of P's and maybe one A here and there, really shows nothing as to the academic ability of someone.

Dear Dr. Christ,

Thank you for providing me the opportunity to give feedback. A year or so ago, I attended a women's diving meet.  It was a great opportunity to view superior athleticism, but it also came with a view of bum-cheeks I was not expecting.  I wonder if these suits might be discouraging for some athletes who may not feel as comfortable being so bare back there.  And, even if one is comfortable with their body, as these women certainly are, those suits looked uncomfortable!  I would love to see more diversity in swimwear such as some of those Olympic suits with long shorts.  Can the University can make their swim uniforms in multiple styles?  It would give individuals a chance to represent the University in utmost comfort, thus encouraging even more athletes to participate!
Hello! When will freshman hear back about dorm offers for spring 2021? Thanks!
Which came first: the chicken or the egg?
Dear Chancellor, may I know what is the recovery rate for the weekly COVID 19 positive cases? Are they all good? I am an international mom from HK. My son is a freshman. We are planning to go back to campus in spring. I am very concern that just in very worse case the student gets COVID 19 positive, will the student receive appropriate medical treatment? Will parents get informed about the progress of medical  treatment? So far what is the recovery rate? Thanks a lot!
Dear Chancellor Christ,

I'm writing to ask about the campus' response to animal agriculture and UC Berkeley's current support of animal related products throughout campus. Does UC Berkeley plan to or have any comments about divesting from inhumane practices such as slaughterhouse suppliers for meat in campus eateries (Cal Dining, Bear Market, etc.), transfer to software based lab experiments instead of using live animals (rats, etc.) to test on, and so forth? Animal welfare concerns me greatly, and I know it does to many other students too, so I'm hoping to hear how UC Berkeley addresses this growing issue inside our campus.

Thank you
Why doesn’t the university emphasize sports more? 38 NCAA titles compared to Stanford’s 126 is disgusting.
Hello Chancellor Christ - For students wanting to come back to campus for the Spring semester, what metrics or progress would you suggest be used as an indicator for returning safely to campus?  Many students want to return to normal, and many Berkeley businesses are in deep financial trouble, so a sensible return to campus is desirable.

Sitting thousands of miles from campus for many students leads to a lack of understanding of the realities on the ground, leading to a lack of information for decision making about returning.  While you cannot give definitive answers, can you help parents and students make a sensible, informed decision based on data?

Thank you
Greetings Chancellor Christ.

First off, I want to ask when are you gonna teach classes that are not designed for Freshman - I saw you are teaching ENGLISH 24 this and next semester, but as a sophomore (;-;) I don't know when you will teach courses that are not exclusively for freshman.

&#x200B;

Then, some serious questions: as an international student who, as you can imagine, is not in the US currently and paying out-of-state tuition, I have three questions to ask: one for your stance on the funding of departments, one for DPN this semester and one for UC's support towards international students.

&#x200B;

As for department funding, I've seen discussions on EECS 101 piazza that UC Berkeley is cutting the budget for EECS department, and a post by professor Anant Sahai seems to indicate that the campus did not give sufficient support to EECS community. While I am not sure if that is a justified claim, I do feel the same thing happening in other departments, such as upper-div classes ESPM and Legal Studies, where there are only one or two uGSI/GSI and considerably large amount of students.

I wonder if you want to comment on these budget cuts - especially why it happens and how it could be solved - as we see more and more freshman getting into UC Berkeley, but fewer and fewer academic staff and student instructors were hired.

I do understand that California Governor Gavin Newsom and California legislature has decided to cut the fund to UC. However, the UC budget handbook seem to show that State/Federal funding is having less portion in total budget. I'm not a Californian so I'm certain Gov. Newsom wouldn't value my word as yours, so I wonder what measures were taken.

Finally, some statistics and an article written by Professor Satish Rao in EECS department seem to indicate UC Berkeley has used much of its budget hiring administrative staff, whereas other UC campuses, namely UCLA and UC San Diego, does not seem to have such issues. I wonder if you want to comment on these findings.

&#x200B;

For DPN this semester, I am wondering what is your stance as the chancellor on changing this semester's grading option to DPN and if any step was taken. Some Junior University in the Bay Area took similar measurements to avoid students being too frustrated.

&#x200B;

Finally, for the UC go-local programme. As an international student who is not in California and taking some classes that require attendance in Pacific Time is truly killing me. I know UC Berkeley has a lot of academic cooperative programmes with some Chinese universities, such as TBSI and RISC-V lab with Tsinghua University. Cornell University established a go-local programme with Tsinghua this semester, and I wonder why don't we have one, especially considering there's no DPN policy this semester at all as of now, as an international student I have to face more issues academically, not to say that I can't just take a gap year like Americans, as my visa will be invalidated - and UC does not have a shelter for documents nonimmigrants like me to protect me from ICE deportation (joking, of course).

I want to know if there are any issues on why there isn't such programme, and if it could be established next semester. Given the current political circumstance of the US, I wonder if there are any measurements the UC Berkeley has taken to support the international student community - apart from some BIO e-mail, which are nice and helpful.
Hi Chancellor Christ, thank you so much for doing this AMA. I was just wondering whether there are any plans to open any of the Campus facilities like the Libraries and/or Sports facilities. I think it'd be nice if we could maybe reserve a time slot with our bubbles and it would definitely help alleviate some stress. I was really excited to hear the swimming pools opening back up, it'd be great if other facilities followed suit as well!
""It looks like the biggest reason why admin doesn't want to enact PNP is because it would cause an overflow of students into impacted majors. I think this is a better compromise (in favor of the students):

Allow students to optionally PNP all classes to count for their major **except** those that are required for major declaration.

This way, those who are already in their major (upperclassmen) can PNP all their classes, whereas underclassmen only have to worry about the classes that count towards declaring their major.""
Why was student input ignored in the acceptance of a gift from Robert Rausser and the subsequent renaming of the College of Natural Resources? 

Will the unnaming/renaming process open up to all schools?
Hi Chancellor,

Is there any possibility for P/NP this semester for all classes? I along with many others are really struggling right now and would appreciate it a lot. Thank you.
Hello Chancellor Christ,
I am parent of one of the International students and being my daughter there in Berkeley in this trying time, try to track the developments closely.

Currently the economic situation is bleak and there are fewer and fewer jobs available. Students also might have to delay their graduating due to this reason. This delay costs International supplement in fee really hard to bear. Can you please advise if any support is provided to international students for CPT or relief in fee, should they have to extend their graduation due to this pandemic
Dear chancellor. You should be ashamed of yourself for the way you handles smiths death and I pray that you receive the relative justice.
this melted my heart, from a Cal student, thank you!
We work very closely with the Berkeley community in many ways.  It is true that many students--and not just students but people in general--are having a very hard time.  Thank you for your generosity in wanting to support your neighbors.  Smile behind your mask!
I would like to add to this. Growing up in a poor immigrant household I didn’t have much guidance about what college is and and I had no idea Berkeley even existed but the iTunesU lectures were the only way I heard about Berkeley. Back then I had a dream of learning physics but I graduated with a less than 2.0 gpa from high school and felt they I could never reach such a goal. But the iTunesU lectures and recordings allowed me to learn from Richard Muller and I instantly fell in love with the subject and the school. If we could do this again I know it can change someone’s life like it did mine. Hope you read this chancellor.
I’m a strong believer in open access to learning and I’m sorry to hear we’re no longer able to provide access to the materials that we once did. The cost to accurately and systematically transcribe thousands of hours of audio and video is prohibitive for the campus. I’m told that even if transcriptions were done in an open- or crowd-sourced way, managing and controlling the quality of the work would mean additional personnel. Given the financial challenges the campus faces due to COVID-19, we are unable to prioritize this work at this time. My hope is that we can look at this again after we emerge from the pandemic. However, you might check out University Extension, where thousands of courses are available, some campus courses through concurrent enrollment.
Many universities across the country have decided to forego spring break to avoid a surge of cases due to travel. No decisions have been made yet but we are considering the possibility of restructuring spring break this year.
We know that the pandemic has been hugely disruptive to students and their families, and we want to accommodate students as best we can. Berkeley has refunded housing and dining fees for those who left university housing this past spring. We are working to support all students, regardless of where they choose to live, including through financial aid and student services to meet both in-person and remote learning and living needs. Emergency funding and cost of attendance adjustments (through our Financial Aid and Scholarships Office) is available to assist individual students facing financial hardship. And if a students’ families’ financial circumstances have substantially changed in the last few months, they should contact our financial aid office and we will make sure they are receiving all aid for which they are eligible.

Because each individual’s situation is unique, we encourage students who are facing significant challenges to talk to their advisor to learn more about resources and options available to them.
No reply? Awkward....
We have recently created a new position--an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Officer, Rich Lyons, the former Dean of the Business School--who has been charged with making our intellectual property policies and operation even more effective.  The CRISPR patent story is very complex--a 21st century equivalent to Charles Dickens’ novel Bleak House.  However, Berkeley has been prevailing on some of the legal challenges.
I know this won’t appease the community, but we generally cannot provide information about matters involving a specific student (or someone believed to be a student here) due to federal privacy laws regarding student records. What we can and have done is respond to specific questions about our process. 

I can tell you that the UC systemwide application does not ask about any criminal convictions or conduct. The university represents opportunity, not punishment, and we would not want to deter potentially well-qualified applicants from applying and enrolling. 

If the campus becomes aware of the criminal history of a student, any threat to the community is addressed on a case-by-case basis.
Thank you for your question. I know this is a very hot topic for our students, so I’m not surprised that this is the most popular topic of this AMA.  

First off, we recognize that students are facing unprecedented challenges in this extraordinary time and want to do anything we can to help ease the burden. That said, P/NP requirements are not a straightforward issue, nor something I can regulate by fiat. 

The University of California has a long-standing tradition of shared governance that many would argue has contributed to its extraordinary success. As such, the authority to make changes to P/NP requirements are delegated throughout the university and the campus. Some aspects of the P/NP policy are set by the systemwide academic senate. Others are within the scope of the Berkeley division of the Academic Senate. Others are set by the faculty of the schools and colleges. 

There are four basic aspects to our P/NP policy--the limitation on the number of total units that can be taken P/NP, the restriction that major requirements cannot be taken P/NP, the restriction that prerequisites for majors cannot be taken P/NP, and the deadline by which a course can be switched from graded status to P/NP.  The first of these elements of the policy is under the control of the systemwide Senate.  The other three rest within the authority of the schools and colleges.  L&S has already made the deadline for switching to P/NP much later--moved it til December; we’re encouraging other colleges to consider such a change.  

Keep in mind that you have a wide range of ways to reduce your academic stress. You can already take up to 33% of your graduation requirements P/NP (and last semester’s courses don’t count against this total).   Most UC Berkeley students are taking more units than they need to; you may want to consider reducing your courseload. And your department and college advisors are there to help you: they have considerable latitude to grant exemptions to P/NP limits--for major requirements, for example.  

I know this is a very stressful time; I encourage you to use the latitude you have in moving classes to P/NP or asking your advisor for an exception.
I’m pleased to share that the budget cut you mentioned has been restored and that the reduction in enrollment has been reversed. You should see this reflected in the posted enrollment limits for these classes in the next few days.
I answered another question about P/NP, so I won’t repeat my answer here. But I do want to acknowledge the hardship that you and many other students face. Many students, like you, have stepped up to help their families and communities manage through this crisis. It has been remarkable to witness the resilience of our students throughout this pandemic. That said, I don’t want you to bear this burden alone. I encourage you to speak with your advisor to take the one class P/NP that you would like to change to that option.
I absolutely agree that international students are an invaluable part of the Berkeley community. The situation you describe is not what we envisioned for our international students when we moved to remote instruction. We continue to encourage faculty to make accommodations for international students and other students in different time zones. If you haven’t done so already, I encourage you to reach out to the Berkeley International Office. I understand they’ve been working to advocate on behalf of students in these situations.  You can also contact your instructor, or, if that fails, the department chair in which the course is being taught.

Regarding mental health services, it’s very important to me that international students get the help they need. I’m told that while the Tang Center counselors are doing virtual telehealth counseling appointments, since they are California-licensed clinicians they are limited to practicing telemental health with clients who are physically in California. However, students who are outside of California or who are abroad can use their SHIP insurance to see a local therapist. We’re also looking at other online tools to support international students.
That’s a good question. I don’t know the answer but will have Patrick follow up.
This. I've been struggling with attention-related issues and my therapist and I have agreed that trying out ADD medication may be worthwhile. The Tang center told me that they intentionally did not prescribe and that I would need to find my own psychiatrist. Well, I'm a busy as hell grad student, and guess who hasn't yet contacted any psychiatrists, over a month later? Can't even imagine being someone really struggling with depression and being told to go figure it out yourself. That's not how you support your students. My therapist (out of state) was alarmed when I told him this—apparently most student health centers have in-house psychiatrists. Telling students to seek out their own care signals to them that mental health issues are not Berkeley's problem.
University Health Services has made their mental health counseling, workshops, groups and Let’s talk drop-in counseling services all virtual either through phone or zoom access. Unfortunately, there are some limitations to counseling virtually with students outside of California and abroad. As such, the counseling teams have provided additional ways for those students outside of California to get connected to a therapist where they are located.  Many of the free workshops and group session topics are specifically focused around supporting students through these challenging times. In addition, more online mental health resources have been launched including Therapy Assistance Online.

Thank you for your question and I agree that alumni bring great vibrancy to our Cal community. Enhancing the university’s ability to foster alumni connections with one another, with current students, and with the campus is a priority of my administration. We recently invested in creating a new Office of Alumni Relations charged with coordinating alumni strategy and activities across Berkeley’s 14 schools and colleges and in partnership with CAA. My hope is that through this initiative, we can begin to return the love graduates feel for Cal back into the alumni community by offering comprehensive support for alumni and their needs. For example, starting just last year we began offering continued and [complimentary access to our wonderful Career Center](https://career.berkeley.edu/Alumni/AlumniServ/) and its services to all alumni for the first five years post-graduation.

You can help by continuing to support the campus in ways that are most meaningful to you. I welcome your ideas and invite you to connect with our new executive director of alumni relations, Jay Dillon. He invited me to share his number. Feel free to send him a text at 510-685-6757.
I would rather not fight myself at all.
I'm upvoting all the P/NP questions. In fact that's basically all I'm doing.

But I took the time to reply to your comment because I genuinely believe this is a great question and I want to see it answered.
While I’m not aware of any plans to offer make up labs, I can assure you that we’re doing everything possible to get back in the lab as soon as possible. Labs are in Tier 1 of our plans for in-person instruction. I’m hopeful that we'll be able to offer some in-person lab instruction as early as the spring semester.

In the meantime, we’ll continue to offer lab courses remotely. I’ve been amazed by how well our instructors and GSIs have adapted to this new way of teaching. In fact, the College of Chemistry was one of the first units on campus to embrace the idea of remote delivery of lab instruction. I continue to be amazed by the creativity and ingenuity of our faculty, students and staff.

As I shared in another answer, the reduction in enrollment has been reversed, so we do not anticipate a bottleneck in future semesters.
First off, my heart goes out to the West family and everyone who knows Sydney. We’re all praying for her safe return. We stand ready to assist the San Francisco police in their investigation in any way we can. 

When a student dies, or a student is missing, we must respect the privacy and wishes of the family, and we are also prohibited from disclosing some kinds of information.  That hardly means we don’t care or are not heartsick at the loss.

One of the most somber duties of a university chancellor is acknowledging the loss of life within the campus community. Seth Smith was among the 10 students that we remembered at the annual campuswide memorial this year. 

As I noted during this year’s ceremony, the deaths of students are the ones that hit us the hardest. When a young person dies, it reverses the order of nature. We mourn not only their loss but the loss of so much life left unlived.

The annual memorial service is one of the ways we acknowledge the loss of life within our campus community. We have protocols in place to ensure that our response to each tragic death is compassionate and consistent and supports those most closely impacted by the loss. In many cases, we’re limited in what we can say by federal privacy laws and by the wishes of the family. 

Please know that we care about each and every student and mourn every loss of life as the tragedy that it is.
since everyone replying to you is saying ""what are you talking about the food's great,"" I just wanted to voice my support for your question haha. cal dining is pretty garbage a lot of the time and I don't think the chancellor's response was a good enough answer.
Literally the food is great I don’t get the complaint
I'm on campus rn and I have no problem with the food, in fact I look forward to meals and use all my swipes every week! But I agree, there are lots of things that are mediocre. However, everything's edible, and there are some things that are quite good!
While taste is subjective, I’m proud to say that Cal Dining has received many awards and recognitions. BestColleges.com ranked us as the #2 [Best Dining Hall](https://www.bestcolleges.com/features/best-college-dining-halls/) and Delish, a well-known food blog, listed us as one of [The 30 Colleges With The Best Campus Food You’ve Ever Seen](https://www.delish.com/food/g22467505/best-college-dining-halls/?slide=5). We’ve also received recognition and honors (including from[ US News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/articles/2017-10-25/global-universities-adapt-menus-for-international-students)) for our having the UC system’s first kosher/halal dining station to provide more options for our diverse student community.

Cal Dining is constantly innovating and developing new menu items. For example, the chefs have developed a vegan meatloaf that even carnivores love. This year they launched the new [Pizzeria 1868](https://caldining.berkeley.edu/locations/campus-restaurants/pizzeria-1868/), offering traditional and specialty pizzas made on vegan dough with a variety of sustainable ingredients. They also have a new menu at the Golden Bear Cafe located at Sproul Plaza featuring classics like Philly cheesesteak and fried chicken sandwiches to new favorites like Mapo tofu bowls and buffalo chicken salads. I encourage you to check out the menus at caldining.berkeley.edu/menus/ which features nutritional information and filtering capability for dietary preferences and allergens. You can also see the carbon footprint calculated based on carbon emission estimates during the production of ingredients.
Can someone find an answer to this question PLEASE
We feel that the presence of rapid antigen testing (daily testing in high contact sports) and weekly PCR testing will enable us to catch positive results quickly and do the appropriate isolation and contact tracing.  Of course, we will change course if we have an outbreak.  The antigen testing was purchased by the PAC-12, not the campus; however, we are working on trying to purchase antigen testing for the general campus for the spring semester.
There are few silver linings to this pandemic but holding on to the Axe just a little bit longer may be one of them.
I feel humbled by my responsibility for such a large, complex organization.  I depend a great deal on my team--my Cabinet; they are fantastic.  The most challenging thing about leading UCB at the current moment is the necessity of making decisions when facts on the ground change so quickly and there are so many things we can’t foresee.  What is rewarding is working with an extraordinarily talented team of people who are deeply dedicated to their work.

I think that universities are learning a great deal about how to deliver instruction remotely during the pandemic; what hasn’t worked so well from my perspective is the social, the community aspect of things that we all value so highly.
First, and foremost, I’ve been told that the reduction in EECS course enrollment has been reversed. While decisions about course offerings are not made by the campus’s central administration, we have worked closely with the College of Engineering, as we have with other schools and colleges, to protect our academic core despite our ongoing budgetary crisis. 

I was not at Berkeley when the decision was made about the stadium.  That said, today, the campus’s share of the interest payments on the debt incurred to finance the stadium project amounts to about $10 million a year…or about half of the total interest costs. This debt covers the seismic reinforcement portion of the project,  The remainder, which funded improvements to the stadium, is funded not from the campus budget, but from revenues generated by the purchase of seat subscriptions in the stadium. We assumed responsibility for the interest payments associated only with the cost of the seismic retrofit and life-safety improvements because that is what we have done---and will continue to do---for other university operating units. When we decided on that 50/50 split in 2017, I assured the campus that we would not, “use academic program funds for servicing the stadium’s debt”, and not would we, “divert money from philanthropic contributions made in the support of academic programs.” We continue to abide by that promise.
I think there’s a chance we’ll be able to return to in-person instruction by Fall 2021. I wish I had a crystal ball and could say so with more certainty.
As someone who has spent the majority of their adult life on the UC Berkeley campus, it saddens me that your experience is being cut short. But it’s the people who make this campus truly great. Fortunately, technology is enabling us to experience community in the virtual world. I encourage you to get involved with the many amazing student orgs meeting virtually, to get to know your professors through remote office hours and to engage with your fellow students through your courses and extracurricular activities. We may not be able to be physically on campus but that doesn’t mean that we can’t experience many of the great things that Berkeley has to offer.
I don’t think I agree that higher education is becoming irrelevant in the COVID age; more than 60% of jobs require higher education.  The quality of that education also matters, as does its certification.  The only silver lining of the pandemic is our rapid development of remote instruction.  This will enormously extend Berkeley’s reach, and students’ access to Berkeley, as well as make students less place dependent.
Our admissions process is based on a holistic review of every applicant, looking not only at test grades and scores, but also at students’ achievements in the context of their opportunities, challenges, and socioeconomic status. Our current admissions process is sound and reflects a number of significant improvements made in recent years. In the last admissions cycle, we admitted a much more ethnically diverse class and admitted more lower-income students. Admitting an excellent class that is also diverse, reflecting a cross-section of California's communities, is a key aspect of our mission as a university.
Thank you.  I walk every day (before dawn), and I play music a lot.  Even though I’m living, like all of us, in a virtual world, I try to keep in touch with friends and family.
I get to meet a lot of incredible students!
We’re making every effort to resume in-person instruction as soon as possible. With the recent positive trends in Alameda County, we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to resume some in-person instruction in the spring semester. This will all depend on public health conditions continuing to improve.
Yes, we [announced plans for the spring semester](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/09/29/uc-berkeley-announces-plans-for-the-spring-2021-semester/) a few weeks ago.
We received an email from the Chancellor saying Spring 2021 will be remote a month ago. [https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/09/29/uc-berkeley-announces-plans-for-the-spring-2021-semester/](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/09/29/uc-berkeley-announces-plans-for-the-spring-2021-semester/)
I was really surprised--and exhilarated--by our double Nobel.  Thank goodness, one of our Nobelists now lives in Germany, so we only need to find one parking space!
Please answer this question, Chancellor!
\^
A central tracker is a good suggestion.  There is a great deal going on to increase the campus’s diversity, equity, and inclusion.  In and of itself, it is evidence of how seriously people are taking these values and goals.  Since you are a graduate student, you might go to the graduate division website, and look specifically at the report and recommendations on graduate student diversity.
The answer to both your questions is yes.  The police are on duty 24/7, and we do notify the community of crimes.
It's not likely. See this: https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jcb30i/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/g9hjaul/

Ok I understand. Let me know if the campus rever gets interested again as I'd be very interested in doing whatever I can to find a way forward. We should remember our connections/ proximity to silicon valley as well. We can do amazing these with speech recognition and natural language processing these days, and it seems a Shame to waste all that R&D just to increase ad revenue when it could be used to facilitate open access to education
Multiple universities across the country have decided to implement optional P/NP as well. Why does Berkeley pick and choose what policies to follow our peers on?
Nobody is traveling ANYWHERE. We just want a break in the midst of midterms and such. It’s a pandemic. A majority of us don’t even want to go out. Taking away our break will simply hurt our mental health. It will actually deteriorate my mental and physical health.
Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

Hello, thank you for your thorough response.  
Some universities are allowing 1 class (major req or not) to be taken P/NP would something like this be doable? This is similar to reducing one’s workload without having to drop the class entirely. Taking a reduced courseload can imply extra semesters which for many (out-of-state and international students notably) is out of the question.

Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions directly.
Why should we “take less classes” and minimize our education quality while paying for the same amount of tuition? Isn’t it the university’s job to ACTIVELY care for its students and actually do something abt our mental health and struggles? Really don’t think this is a valid response with any bit of sincerity in it.
Thank your for your informative response, Chancellor. At the heart of so many inquires regarding PNP however, is the question - what are you as our Chancellor doing to help students make our case? 

We acknowledge and understand that you are not in direct control of PNP, but we would like to know if and how you’re helping students advocate for it.
as Nicki Minaj once said, “just answer the question, don’t play with me right now...”
Will you say that you support us though? Even if you don’t have control over most of it, can’t you try to help us?
so no? or its still going through the senate? Can we have straightforward yes or no please?
What about the budget cuts to all the other academic departments? Have they also been restored?
Wait advisors have the authority to let us P/NP major requirements? This seems like a terrible system to try, as advisors are going to be bombarded with requests and basically have to decide who’s situations are valid :/
Hi Carol, thanks for the response, but I am unable to change any of my classes to p/np because they all satisfy major requirements. 

Quick edit: I found the lengthy comment that explains p/np, and since I'm in my last semester I may qualify. I'll focus on my own academic situation and see what can be done, but I would urge you to still please reconsider pushing for optional p/np for this semester, as not every student has the luxury of being in their last semester. Again, thanks again for responding to my comment
✨diy therapy✨ 😭😭😭 nah but fr I had to go find a therapist and a psychiatrist bc this semester brought my underlying depression to a head
I would just like to say that from experience in CHEM 3AL, instructors and GSIs have NOT adapted well to the online format. Most other online labs, from what I've heard from other students, have also not been going well as grading criteria and expectations are very unclear
yeah I see that now. 

At the very least I would hope she would be able to reveal the actions they have taken as I think many people are unaware if any was even taken.
why did you even mention george floyd then? what did he have anything to do with seth being murdered??
Chancellor’s response was: “Apparently everywhere else it’s even worse so y’all are lucky”
yeah lol same here I loved croads. I'm starting to come to the realization that my parents weren't very good cooks if everyone's hating on croads :(
Perhaps avoiding the word positive in terms of COVID-19 trends may be advisable 🙃

Thank you for taking the time to do this Chancellor!
Great point! If your interested check out MIT Open Courseware. They offer amazing resources online. Of course, I too, would prefer to learn from Berkeley, but this is a close second.  [https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
I mean, speak for yourself. And me. And probably most people here, but there are plenty of folks who have stopped caring, and are likely gonna go out and contribute to spread.
Because they want you to stay in school longer so that you can give them more money.
I have been having many discussions with the Academic Senate and the deans.
The response suggests the Chancellor doesn't get to decide, and seems to suggest that those who can have not yet decided. It seems the best course of action for students would be to start contacting individual college administrators (L&S, CNR, etc).
[deleted]
Probably a no sadly
The root of the real problem right here tbh
But people are kicked out after a number of units and semesters
""It looks like the biggest reason why admin doesn't want to enact PNP is because it would cause an overflow of students into impacted majors. I think this is a better compromise (in favor of the students):

Allow students to optionally PNP all classes to count for their major **except** those that are required for major declaration.

This way, those who are already in their major (upperclassmen) can PNP all their classes, whereas underclassmen only have to worry about the classes that count towards declaring their major.""
Senate said no. Its over
im sending you to the center of student conduct for plagiarism
Lol"
"I'm UC Berkeley's chancellor, Carol Christ. Ask me anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q5yyy1/im_uc_berkeleys_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/,2021-10-11 08:57:35,"Hello, Reddit! /u/holmesp here from the campus office of public affairs. With the support of /u/lulzcakes we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session. This is the fourth year in a row that Chancellor Christ will be participating in an AMA.

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley over fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on Wednesday, Oct. 13 at 4:30 p.m.

As has been the case in the past, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it.

Thanks so much and ask away!

**EDIT 4:30 p.m.:** We're live with the chancellor. She will be answering questions for the next hour.

**EDIT 5:34 p.m.:** The chancellor had to take off. Thank you to everyone who participated in this year's AMA!

Are there plans in the future about how to expand exercising/fitness facilities for students? 

Are there strategies to improve the conditions of the public bathrooms on campus? Those are actually in terrible quality and our tuition needs to be better spent on communal resources.
Are there any plans to make the dining halls a bit better? I think the food really effects the moral of the students and seeing the food here is just saddening. UCLA is top rated in food and we don’t even rank because of how bad the food here s
Berkeley currently offers stipends to Graduate students that have a substantially lower living-wage-ratio than our academic peers. Given the world-leading cost of living in the bay area and our status as a public institution + reliance on graduate students to fulfill many roles critical to continuing both our research and teaching productivity, what are the plans to address these issues?

When can we expect libraries to return to regular hours, including those that were previously open 24/7 for students
As a GSI, I feel that the students are paying way too much to be receiving my very mediocre teaching, but also that I'm being paid way too little for the work I do. (~26k fyi. Take away rent and...) 

What's going on here?
Hello Chancellor Christ! I’m a freshman, and I’m loving it here. 

One issue I and several of my peers have been facing is the low quality of dining hall food. While many of my friends in other public universities such as UCLA enjoy healthy food of great quality, the dining halls at Berkeley have been serving food of deteriorating quality. 

Furthermore, the menu is often limited and repetitive, especially for vegetarians, and hygiene conditions in the dining halls are also not too great.

What steps might you consider to improve this food situation?
What do the contingency plans look like if COVID cases are too high for fully in-person classes next semester? Specifically wondering about the odds of going back to a hybrid model like this semester vs. fully remote instruction, as far as it's possible to predict that given the info you have.
Given the conflicting mandate from the state (accept and educate more students) and the city (resistance to additional housing and land acquisitions) what is the plan going forward to ensure the student experience includes adequate support for basic needs and that town and gown relationships are maintained?
When will uGSIs get full tuition remission? Or will it stay at 29% payment for 8 hr TAs forever?
Does the University have any plans to address the imminent shortage of parking spaces for Nobel prize winners?
Have their been any disciplinary actions against a certain ASUC senator?

Is it true that you keep a wardrobe of blue suits so that you will only be seen wearing blue suits?
As a Cal grad, I came from a time when tuition was affordable, even when I had a parent laid off from work and was able to pay for my education on a single parent income.  Now I have a son who really wants to go to Cal and if he does get in, what are your plans for making it more affordable for the average California family to pay for Cal?
Because of labor shortages, rising land costs, and a host of other factors, the student experience will look dramatically different without some previously guaranteed amenities for freshman due to budget cuts. How do you plan on addressing some of the budget concerns plaguing UC institutions, specifically Berkeley? Is the budget situation something you think you can manage, and even reverse in the long run?
Can we still do some online classes especially for large lectures in spring?

When will library hours extend?
Something I've noticed this year is the decline in mental health for many students, especially with statistics demonstrating the struggle many students have been facing with the transition from COVID. Just this week, UNC took steps to address the mental health situation on campus. What are your plans to ensure the mental health of students, especially given the harsh transition immediately back to mostly in-person classes and student-life?
parking permits are very expensive and there are not that many lots provided for students, for example, foothill lot spaces are taken away from students when there is an event happening. why the student are not priorities for spaces that are closer to campus? after all we are paying more for permits.
Why did you go against your tenured staff recommendations and decide to remove SAT and ACT scores as part of the admission process?  Their review indicated that these tests correlate more strongly with collegiate academic success than other metrics available to admission staff such as GPA or class rank.  Their study also showed that the SAT was effective in occasionally identifying gifted individuals from low income areas for which other admission components did not.
UC Berkeley spends over $770,000,000/year on research. What percentage of this goes as take-home pay to graduate student researchers? What was that figure 10 years ago?

Even a $250/month increase to our stipends would be extraordinarily meaningful to us. Is there really no room in the hundreds of millions awarded to the university through research grants to pay us slightly more?

**Will you advocate for a complimentary in-person GBO in Spring 2022 for students that entered UC Berkeley when campus closed (Fall 2020/Spring 2021) and everything was online?**

Due to COVID-19 and the subsequent campus closure in mid-2020, students that entered UC Berkeley in Fall 2020/Spring 2021 began their undergraduate career at UC Berkeley in a fully virtual environment - which simply doesn’t compare to the in-person college experience. Our entire orientation was completed online through Zoom and online modules on bCourses. Most of the peers I spoke to who also had “Zoom University” orientation also agree that it was a very lonely and isolating experience. 

By the time UC Berkeley opened up (Fall 2021), many of us (now sophomores & senior transfers) came to Berkeley for the very first time in addition to the traditional first-year students. Despite our circumstances, New Student Services coldly refused to accommodate us and allow us to experience an integral part of the “college experience” by rejecting the idea of a complementary in-person GBO. This is especially cruel considering our “experience” began without any human interaction. 

Experiences like icebreakers, having lunch/dinners with our GBO group, going on hikes to the Big C, walking around Berkeley, and playing fun carnival games create very meaningful memories for many UC Berkeley students and alumni. These are memories that we will never have the opportunity to make, and the amount of hurt I feel because of that is insurmountable. The pandemic was a very isolating period of our lives, and all I wanted to feel when I came here was some sense of welcome. Although I've made a few friends this semester through two clubs and my classes, the memories I’ve been deprived of by the administration hurts me. 

Compounded with the fact that many of us were refused on-campus housing, thus also deprived of the “dorming experience,” it has been very difficult to strongly connect to the school. Clearly, more should be done to welcome us, and the future actions of NSS will influence how I view UC Berkeley in the future. 

Decades in the future, I probably won’t exactly remember how New Student Services unashamedly announced that we were not welcome to participate in this Fall’s in-person GBO. I probably also won’t remember what exactly I missed out on in GBO, but what I will remember is the coldness from this administration and the hurt that I felt arriving at UC Berkeley. 

If New Student Services does not change their dismissive tone and behavior towards our classes (sophomore and transfer seniors), it should come as no surprise if the alumni donation rates for our classes reach a record low years into the future. 

Chancellor Christ, please advocate for better treatment and opportunities for sophomores and senior transfers to create integral memories of our college experience. The pandemic already took a full year of memories away from us. Please help us salvage whatever we can.
What time of year do you think is the best time to visit the UC Botanical Garden?
Hello, what is being done to review the Sharp ASUC situation. It seems this campus does not stand united against hate speech. Seems surprising to ignore those who are engaging in hateful and extremely bigoted statements in the public eye.
How has diversity of economic background in the PhD student population changed over the last 5 years? 

I know of a number of really talented students who chose to go to other institutions for their PhD because they just couldn’t justify paying 75% of their their take-home pay on rent to live in a city that, frankly, is a shambles of its former self. 

A decent single room in a shared house here is now well over $1000/month. Many can only afford to live here comfortably if they are getting outside support. 

We are adults and deserve to have some semblance of a normal life while providing research/teaching services to the university.
What are your thoughts on Oski being ranked the most unsexiest college mascot?
The perimeter/reverse perimeter busses kind of suck because they pull into Evans 02/32 and 08/38 respectively, every hour. Since most people have class on the hour, that’s too late for people trying to get to class, but too early for people leaving class. Shouldn’t the busses arrive at Evans at 15/45 instead? Hope this made sense.
Is there a plan to address the wifi situation on campus? Some classes require we take tests in person, but through a laptop which has led to a host of technical issues.
Does it make sense for UCB to purchase an off-campus home for future Chancellors, and re-use the building and/or land of [University House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_House,_Berkeley) for other purposes?
Is there a reason that the RSF hasn’t opened basketball courts? Or any other courts? It would help a lot of us stay active and healthy, and thousands of students were funneled through the gym for caltopia , so it should be fine to let’s 30 more in to play basketball. What are the plans for this?
Will there be a remote option for classes in summer 2022?

For the summer, a remote option is god-send for many people. 
Many continuing students were able to do internships, research, etc in different cities and still finish a class. 

Also, a remote option is great for incoming students that take part in the transfer-/freshmen- edge program.
I’ve spoken to a decent amount of recent incoming students and majority of the them said they used their summer to prep for the move to Berkeley. A remote option helped them to prepare while knocking out a class or two. 
Some students, transfer or freshmen, have their school finish quite close to when summer session starts; they are left with finals, graduation, and stressing about move-in.
will all in-person lectures in spring still be recorded? I feel recording helps me learn better (by going back to what I might have missed in lectures), and many people around me feel the same way.
Chancellor,

**Will you commit to supporting ""Unit 18"", non-senate faculty Lecturers?**  
Nearly 50% of the teaching faculty on this campus are Lecturers who have very few job protections and a median salary of less than $15,000. We have gone nearly 3 years without a contract between the University.   


Could we *please* get a CalMessage, a PR, something which unequivocally states the Administration's support for Lecturers? That would be a fine start. 

But quite honestly: We simply need a living wage. We need to be compensated for teaching courses with hundreds of students and dozens of GSIs -- it's not the same work as a course of 50, even though the campus budget formulas make it seem that way. We participate in Campus-wide committees, but it's also a volunteer basis. These problems are solvable. And they are highly asymmetric. What is vastly meaningful to lecturers is minute with respect to the size of this institution.   


Over the next decade the UC system is now expected to do the equivalent of adding 1 entire campus worth of enrollments. In order to be a successful educational institution we need to pay faculty their worth. It is wholly unsustainable to rely on previous savings, spouses, roommates, and multiple jobs while also being dedicated to the University.   


Long term, we need serious reform of how we budget for teaching faculty. Departments need faculty lines for LSOE hires, and they must not compete with research faculty allocation! We need to pay Lecturers from a budget which is distinct from that of our GSI pool. It is unacceptable that me asking for a raise simultaneously makes we wonder whether than same raise comes out of my own GSI funds for my courses.   


The lecturers on campus need a new contract, but there is nothing that stops the University from doing more than the minimum required by the contract.   


Thanks very much!
What can the university do to ensure student safety? There have been some unfortunate situations between students and the homeless already this year as there have been in prior years as well.
Thank you for doing this AMA Chancellor!

The threat of climate change is imminent and, as we continue to miss key milestones in cutting CO2 emissions globally, it is apparent that we will likely exceed the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celcius in warming. Past this point, we face existential risk as a species and our only hope lies in technological innovation via geoengineering to offset and reverse the effects of climate change.

The free market is ill-equipped to address these issues, as solving them is not profitable: the solution will need to come from academic research. Unfortunately, very few institutions are giving serious research dollars to geoengineering at the moment, despite the preeminent risk. Notably, [Harvard is one of the few](https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/geoengineering). This is an area of research I would love to see Berkeley focus more on.

I noticed on the [ECRN](https://www.ecrn.berkeley.edu/) site that we have a program called the Berkeley Carbon Removal Network, but it seems to be rather small and is not platformed well at all. What can be done to drive more money towards this area of research specifically?

As an alum, is there something I can do to kick off an initiative within the university? Could I volunteer my time to fundraise specifically for a program such as this? Can I work for the university in some capacity to this end?
What is a fun fact about you that most students wouldn't know?
What’s your favorite food spots near campus?
Even before COVID there were completely online offerings during summer that were very successful and I believe that after these semester of remote trial and error, replicating what we have done for Fall 2021 would open more avenues for students. 

Will you consider making summers permanently hybrid for some cases? What are your thoughts?

Hi Chancellor Christ. First off, thank you for hosting another AMA. I love seeing your replies and I love you’re taking this initiative. This is fun!

My question concerns Gabbi Sharp. I’m just wondering why the university isn’t taking steps to remove Sharp. Can the university even take steps to remove Sharp? What would these steps be? 

Best,

What do you think the coolest spot on campus is?
What is your opinion of Guy Fieri?
What's your go-to coffee spot?
UC has been steadily increasing enrollment and building housing at a frenzied pace. When are you planning on building more dining? Waiting at least an HOUR for a dining hall that is over capacity is completely unacceptable. And plans for peoples park only accounts for a small retail area. This will fix nothing. How has UC Berkeley gone from 4th best food just a few years ago to around 50th. How do you respond?
Why isn’t there an option to do remote classes for spring 2022? I feel that those who are remote for fall 2021 are now in a bad situation in terms of housing because they may not be living near Berkeley and thought Spring 2022 would have remote classes and not fully in person.
How do you pronounce your last name? Like Chris-t or like Jesus?
Hey Chancellor Christ,

How will you be addressing the rampant sexual assault present in greek life systems.

Too add on, what are the steps you are taking to ensure the safety and security of SA victims at Berkeley.

There are still so many buildings that have wifi connectivity issues. Are there any plans to address these issues soon?
Would it be possible to enable the Canvas feature that allows for confetti to fall across your screen when you submit an assignment on time? Even that little bit of serotonin is motivating and a lot of colleges have that feature activated on their Canvas already.
First of all, thank you for finally securing the development of affordable housing at People's Park; the current shortage has severely impacted students and we sincerely appreciate your efforts in spite of opposition.

However, many of my peers and I feel that the Unit 3 Residence Halls are decrepit compared to Blackwell and the proposed Anchor House. Our restroom showers require serious overhaul, the washing machines are often out of order, and the few study lounges we have are occupied by overflow housing—all while the other residence halls enjoy relative luxury in their amenities and plentiful shared spaces.

What plans does the university have to renovate Unit 3 to provide more equitable accomodations to students who, quite frankly, got the short end of the stick in the housing lottery?
When do you think the indoor mask mandate will be lifted? Is the school going to lift the mandate at the same time as the city? Or are we going to play it safer and continue with the mandate for a little longer? I understand masks are helpful, but like many others I also find them a little irritating at times
[deleted]
Do you think that’s the discrepancy in dining hall food quality is acceptable? I have eaten plain, tasteless, noodles with salad that sometimes contains hair and bugs at Cafe 3 every night for the past week because it’s the only edible vegetarian option. At Clark Kerr, they have pizza and Hawaiian rolls and just more variety, something we here in Unit 3 are not offered. The walk there is not one I can make consistently, especially at night being the 5 foot 4 young woman I am. It is beginning to become frustrating, I am paying a lot of money for my meal plan and it consistently disappoints.
What steps are being made to ensure safety in and around campus? I have unfortunately had a few concerning encounters with homeless people coming into the Unit 2 courtyard and there have been many times where I have felt unsafe with the homeless population surrounding campus restaurants and coffee shops.
What’s the problem with the football and basketball teams and what’s the plan to fix them?  I work with a lot of Pac 12 alums and the situation is unbearable.
Are we going to increase pool access any time soon? There seems to be fairly low demand for pool space, so it seems as if open lap swim times would make more sense than the current limited 45 minute time slots
I actually love Berkeley, honestly, but I’ve found myself losing motivation to do work and it’s kinda sad:( do you have any tips
Have you ever visited The Cal Forestry Camp, near Quincy, CA?
how many digits of pi can you recall by memory? putting you on the spot hehe.
Hi Chancellor Christ! A lot of students are not super happy with all the animal welfare/environmental justice/workers’ rights problems surrounding Berkeley’s relationship with Tyson and Hormel (the factory farm companies). Obviously Cal has a progressive reputation and the use of the companies as food suppliers isn’t really in line with that. Do you have a plan to move away from those companies or transition towards more ethical/modern ways of supplying the dining halls?
Why did you give Jim Knowlton a ten year extension? Ever since he took over, Cal has only won 1 national championship, and will not win another one in any sport for awhile. The recruiting has been god awful for every sport. I have to cheer for other schools like Michigan because Cal is so garbage. Jim Knowlton will not fix this athletics department. 

Another question: why is Berkeley associated with slow progress? 2 years and the endowment increases from 4.9 billion to 5 billion? People's Park taking 5 years for an inch to be built? 

Also, Berkeley hasn't won a Turing Award ever since you took over, meanwhile Stanford wins one every year. How will you fix that?
Will you add more red meat to our dining menu?
Who is the best UC chancellor?

Are we able to open up another COVID testing site closer to memorial? This was a great, easy way for students in greek life to get tested quickly near their homes and with RSF being the only current location, students in greek life are less inclined to travel there.
On the press releases they say no more GRE for all but 13 of the programs. What are these programs ?
Are there any plans for at least a temporary remote option for a few weeks for the beginning of the Spring 2022 semester? I’m very concerned about a potential large COVID-19 outbreak occurring when people return to the UC Berkeley campus post-holiday travel. I understand that the majority of students are vaccinated, however on the news recently there’s also been some report of effectiveness waning after eight months, which could result in certain students being more vulnerable post-holiday travel as well. Thank you so much for being able to answer questions.

Thank you for doing this AMA.  What is your goal for on campus housing?  Are you aiming to be able to guarantee 3 years of on campus housing or is it to reach on campus housing for 50% of students for example.  Also how do you see the university's role in housing faculty and other staff?
RemindMe! 5pm October 13
Hello Chancellor!

I have a question. Do you believe that the new criteria for declaring a Computer Science major will be in place before 2023? Or are the Board possibly rethinking/modifying it?

Thank you!

When can we expect the fitness centers in Unit 1/2 to be open to residents? Students were promised these amenities when we paid for housing and given the reopening of the RSF and study lounges on dorm floors, I am wondering what is keeping the Unit 2 fitness center from opening to Unit 2 residents.

Whose job is it to hold campus management responsible?
Considering the expansion of the EECS department and L&S CS in terms of the number of enrollment, why is that the budget dedicated to supporting classes in the department has not increased correspondingly (specifically the TA budget)? 

Some of the classes have more than 700 students but a  course staff of around 30 people. In case a high-demand course is not offered in one semester, the pipeline for training the TA's (reader -> TA -> head TA) breaks down to the point that the class might get crushed in the next offerings. With this demand, it makes sense to increase the financial support.
Hello Chancellor Christ,

Are there opportunities for alumna to interact with students in student activities?
Are you Jesus' sister?
Hi Chancellor Christ - Thank you for addressing the high crime rate at UC Berkeley in your email to students last week. With armed robberies occurring at least several times a week recently, what else can be done to ensure student safety on and off campus? It is one thing to walk around the campus and surroundings without your headsets on but another in its entirety for the university to allocate resources on campus and the surrounding areas so there is more of a police and security presence so students are not victimized so frequently. Its a terrible feeling to think you cannot walk around your community without feeling that your security is constantly threatened. Please help make Berkeley a safer place.
Hi carol! I had a question so I am a prospective cal student however, when I committed to cal they counted me as a resident and now all of a sudden I am counted as a non resident because I did two years at the Philippines and my parents are not california residents neither US citizens, however, I am a US citizen. I came to the States at the beginning of my junior year in high school. Thus, I talked to someone from the residency office and they said that the best way would be to appeal it through the UC’s “two year care and control” since I live with my aunt but I do not know what documents to submit. It would mean a lot if you would be able to provide some guidance!

We are trying to extend Moffett’s hours til midnight.  I’m very sorry to say that we do not foresee increasing all library hours to pre-pandemic levels this semester. The reasons are two: we are still struggling from the financial impacts of the pandemic, so lack the funding to do so, and we are also having trouble hiring.
As you noted, there are many constraints placed on our campus in terms of the number of students we need to serve and what percentage can be from out of state. We are constantly advocating for the resources needed to provide for the needs of our students and looking for new and innovative ways to make up for losses in traditional revenue streams.

We have a plan to double the number of beds in our housing system within the decade, and we have been adding resources for more sections and advisors.
Rec Sports is still continuing to transition out of a year of pandemic-related operations. They are currently exploring ways to further expand their current operations, including court access, and will be expanding pool access very soon. Regarding restrooms, we’ve increased funding for custodial services but will keep looking for ways to improve.
Yeah I had a terrible & TERRIFYING experience in the Doe Bathroom but I would give you something Sweet & Sour there : )
We are working to enhance our dining offerings and services, and to hire additional staff for that work. We're challenging our chefs to use their creativity to make new recipes so we can keep offering students tasty new options. Cal Dining welcomes feedback and is eager to meet with students about improving their services. I encourage you to use their Text and Tell service to provide feedback.

See my comment on Carol Christ's post at the top. Love you
We offer teaching workshops to all of our newly hired faculty members; we also carefully review teaching evaluations of all faculty and give them counsel about how to improve (and poor teaching does affect salary). My experience is that some of our top scientists are gifted at explaining their work as well.
*cough, cough* Doudna teaching Bio1a *cough, cough*
We do meet the full financial need of our undergraduates, and tuition for instate students is much lower than the tuition at most private institutions. 

In regard to graduate students, we are committed to working toward increasing graduate student funding.

While our students do have real and urgent needs, their financial situation is quite different from the other UC campuses. We have more funding and fewer students living on GSI salary alone (e.g., GSI appointments are only one component of larger funding packages that include fellowship awards and GSR appointments as well, such that a doctoral GSI’s total funding is often greater than the GSI salary alone).
Melissa? This Amp
One of the things we have learned is that pandemic developments are hard to anticipate so we have focused on being operationally flexible, not on writing criteria that could quickly become outdated or irrelevant. However, we expect to be fully face-to-face in the spring.
We have recently reached a long-term agreement with the city about enrollment and about Berkeley’s contributions to city services; in general relationships with the city government are quite good. We are working to provide adequate resources to students for basic needs.
Thankfully our newest winner rides his bike to campus.
Hey lady see my post to Carol Christ above and give me a text, call or email. : )
Due to federal student privacy laws, I can't comment on any specifics but I can assure you that we take these types of allegations seriously and our Dean of Students office is engaged to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.
I would Discipline you babe! See my post to Carol Christ at the top of the thread.  
I live in Oakland, CA, near Lake Merritt.

Send me your name and number.
The issue you are raising is real and important. L&S is currently reviewing how best to organize and support their advising program in order to better support students. I encourage you to reach out to L&S executive dean Jenna Johnson-Hanks to share your thoughts on how we could make this process better.  
We are also working to create more internship programs; they are a priority of mine.  
The experience you describe--of taking five years or so to find your way after college--is a common one, even for students in more vocationally oriented majors or in liberal arts colleges  (I heard stories very similar to yours from alumnae of Smith College when I was president there).  Life often is not a straight line, even when we might hope it is.
I do what I can to show my love for Cal!
The UC Regents recently approved a cohort tuition plan that freezes a student's tuition for six years so there are no surprise increases making it easier for families to plan.

We offer the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan to help cover tuition and fees if you are a California resident with an annual family income of less than $80,000 a year. We also offer Middle Class Scholarships for families with incomes and household assets up to $191,000 for 2021-22 academic year. The scholarships are offered on a sliding scale and in 2021-22, the maximum award for UC students is $4,398. These are in addition to a variety of other scholarships, grants and other innovative aid programs.
We are working to multiply and diversify revenue sources to address our budget concerns.  We’ve had some good financial news recently, with the restoration of the state cut in its support for UC, an increase in that budget of 5%, and generous funding from the CARES and HEERF acts. We are actively working on managing the budget and expect we can create significant improvement in the short and the long run.
We anticipate that some larger classes will be offered with course capture and may have some remote discussion sessions. The campus is also exploring avenues to increase online course offerings to accommodate student demand. However, this is a work in progress.
The plan is for Summer Sessions to be offered in person. However, as always, there will also be online course offerings. We anticipate that the number of online offerings will increase.
We recognize that the ongoing pandemic and shifts in student life can be stressful. The university places the utmost importance on the health and safety of our students, including mental health. We also offer a variety of [direct support services](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/mental-health) to students experiencing distress, such as counselors at University Health Services at the Tang Center, who are available for same-day counseling appointments.
Please note we offer student permit parking at a number of locations around campus. While our parking lots need to support many activities on campus, including events, we do our best to not allow events to disrupt parking availability before 5 p.m. on weekdays. The cost for student permits is less than the cost paid by faculty and staff.
It’s first important to clarify that eliminating the SAT or ACT as a requirement for application for admission was not my decision; it was the Regents’ decision. However, I support that decision. The strongest correlation with SAT/ACT scores is family income, and in the research I’ve reviewed, they are effective only in predicting first-year grades. High school GPA is a better indicator for overall performance in college and for graduation rates.
Completely wrong lmao.
The SAT is actually a great experience. The score you get is not a ranking that reflects your Strong-or-weak mental intelligence, but rather a Number that has meaning specific to your Personality.
Research grants are awarded for a very specific budget plan; neither faculty members nor the institution has the discretion to simply decide to pay higher stipends; stipend levels are set systemwide by employment category.
As the semester progresses, I encourage you to explore all that Berkeley has to offer. There are a lot of fun events around campus and students are eligible for discounted tickets to some of our most popular sporting and performing arts events.  I will certainly be alert to opportunities we can offer our sophomores and 2nd-year transfer students.
>What time of year do you think is the best time to visit the UC Botanical Garden?

Every time of year is wonderful.  The garden changes with the seasons, so there’s no bad time to visit--and no best time.
We have just admitted the most diverse graduate student class (beginning masters and doctoral students) in the history of the university. Housing is indeed a challenge. We will soon announce a gift of a new graduate student apartment building, and we are developing construction plans for more graduate student housing.
Personally, I'm an Oski stan.
Are we truly less sexy than a tree?
Thank you for the feedback. We will take this into consideration the next time we take a look at our route schedules. Please note that our shuttles serve many locations around campus, not just Evans Hall and the class schedules vary depending on the day. A bus schedule may seem inconvenient for one person while being very convenient for another person at another stop around campus.
Our IS&T team has been devoting a lot of time and effort on campus wi-fi issues and they will continue to do so. You can email your request to sts-help@berkeley.edu or call 510-642-HELP (4357).
Now, as in the past, University House is providing an important service as a place to hold events and gatherings for students, faculty, and staff. An equivalent space on the open market would cost many millions of dollars. And, when it comes to infrastructure needs in and on the campus park, what we need most is not land, but the resources necessary to address deferred maintenance issues, as well as facility modernization and seismic retrofitting.
I'm pretty sure RSF courts are used for COVID testing
We are working to reform public safety in accordance with the recommendations of the IAB, the systemwide recommendations on public safety, and my own commitments.  We’re developing a plan for a team of mental health professionals to intervene in situations where there is a mental health emergency, and we are talking with the city about coordination of public safety efforts on the south side.
I would suggest getting in touch with David Ackerly, the Dean of the Rausser College of Natural Resources, who is in charge of our campus’s climate initiative.

On Monday we sent a message to campus acknowledging Indigenous People's Day.  
Read the [UC Berkeley Land Acknowledgment](https://cejce.berkeley.edu/ohloneland) developed in partnership with Native communities and learn more about how and why we use [land acknowledgments](https://nativegov.org/a-guide-to-indigenous-land-acknowledgment/).

We take allegations of sexual violence and sexual assualt extremely seriously and have many resources on campus to support survivors, namely the Path to Care Center and the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination. I believe we have one of the strongest SVSH prevention programs in higher education.
The Wi-Fi issues have a number of underlying causes, making resolving the problem complex. The good news is we have seen positive progress with several improvements installed last week, and campus IT officials believe we are on track for a permanent solution planned for this week.
Pancakes!
While our recent records are not what any of us had envisioned, I continue to be very optimistic for our football and basketball programs under Director of Athletics Jim Knowlton’s leadership. We are building solid foundations to put us on an upward trajectory. Since Coach Wilcox has been here, for example, we have won the Axe back after nine years, participated in two bowl games and seen the team’s highest graduation rates. Overall, our athletics program continues to shine with nearly 60 athletes and coaches at the Tokyo Olympics who brought home 16 medals.
If you are losing motivation, I recommend reconnecting with the [fun side of Berkeley](https://life.berkeley.edu/fun-at-uc-berkeley-part-1/). If you are stressed out, we have ideas to [help you find your balance](https://life.berkeley.edu/find-your-balance/). And if you need academic help to get back on track, take advantage of the [resources we offer](https://life.berkeley.edu/academic-help/).
No, I haven’t.
Chancellor Christ! The one and only UC Berkeley chancellor to participate in a Reddit AMA!!
Out-of-state and international students will also benefit from the cohort tuition model. While many of our scholarships and grants are tailored for California residents, we have a variety of innovative programs open to all students, such as our [Prizes](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/prizes-and-honors/competitive-prize-contests/) which reward creative expression and scholarly achievement. We also strongly encourage those who might not be in-state students to research and apply for outside scholarships.
Get a booster if you're so concerned.

Every time we have an AMA, this question is asked. And nothing has improved. There's your answer folks.
It was a handful of years back but I loved Doudna for 1a
Is there somewhere I can see the details of that agreement? As a student and year-round resident, I am very curious.
*screenshots provided*

""allegations""

Alright.
YES! Income absolutely correlates most definitively with SAT/ACT scores. Those who may not have been up-to-speed with SAT and ACT testing standards tend to approach such with enrollment in more rigorous, college-level classes, provided that they're motivated to do so. Motivation is better represented by GPA and other documentation such as the UC personal insight questions and teacher recommendations.
I hope law schools think the same and waive lsat then...
With all due respect Chancellor Christ, you seem to be intentionally avoiding the question. There are 10 steps on the GSR appointment scale that we could be on but the vast majority of us are not at the top step. ""Departments and hiring units are free to appoint students starting at any step level, but step assignments should be consistent and equitable according to departmental criteria."" [Source](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/2021/2020-21-academic-salary-program/t22.pdf)

I'm asking why are departments preparing grant proposals with GSRs at lower step levels and why is the university not encouraging them to increase the step level of their GSRs?
""Stan"" is a term derived from the iconic Eminem song of the same name, in which a sycophant who is unable to get the artist's attention commits a grief-stricken murder-suicide.

I would say ""big fan"" might be more appropriate language.

Thank you, chancellor!!
I can guarantee you I will not donate another cent to the school until you address the poor performance of the football and basketball teams and the ridiculous contract extensions that Knowlton and Wilcox received, given the poor performance of those teams. Add to that your tepid response to UCLA leaving the PAC-12, it just shows that you lack the qualities needed to lead the University of California.
It’s not that easy https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html
Well, I'm glad you did. I took it in Spring of 2016 with her and all she did was read off the pre-made slides. 

The most memorable part out of all of this was that she missed our first two lectures because she was at the World Economic Forum. On one of the lectures that she missed they showed us a picture of her on a panel with Biden.

I will say, I went to her office hours once and she was very kind. I'm by no means a Doudna hater.

How is this respectful? An allegation as something alleged until formally proven. Get off your high horse and show some respect.
Man, I get these arguments, but it makes me a little sad to see that I wouldn't have gotten in if I was born a few years later.  You'd think Berkeley, of all schools, would be conscious of the fact that GPA can't be compared 1:1 due to the wildly varying levels of rigor at different schools.
Devon?!

""Age 18+ who live in high-risk settings"" They even specify that the list they give isnt exhaustive. Why can you not just say you're at high risk and get one? Also, booster aside, wear an N95 mask.
Thanks for posting the link!
This is true in the legal sense but the evidence is self-explanatory and the person in question has taken \*brazen\* credit for the views expressed in said evidence. What exactly is there left to prove?
I'm sure Berkeley is well aware of the difference between a 4.0 from a highly ranked HS vs. a poorly ranked one.  My guess is that this is in line with other educational reforms best seen at the High School level where efforts are being made to include race as a factor in admissions.  See reforms in San Francisco, NY and Fairfax which have had top tier STEM magnet schools admissions policy drastically changed.  Or for that matter, just look at the Ivy's like Harvard and Yale, where race (not economics) is an overt factor.
This not be Devon
I *wish* I got the Pfizer vaccine when I was initially vaccinated now. Unfortunately, certain Pfizer recipients are the only people who the booster is available for right now (this is according to the CDC website I linked).

Many articles have been released saying that being vaccinated reduces the amount someone spreads COVID-19 if infected. That’s great! But since it’s still spreadable, it’s clear that being vaccinated won’t solve every problem with spreading the virus so other preventative measures need to take place as well (for example, the University requires indoor-mask-wearing). More info: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1280583

Thanks for being concerned about me by suggesting I get a booster or wear a N95. I explained above about the booster issue, and I already wear a N95 on campus. In addition, I wash my hands every time I leave a school building, never touch handheld food in public unless through a napkin, sit in a courtyard instead of a library whenever I can figure out how to do it, take the majority of my classes remotely, among a whole bunch of other protocols. It might be too much for a healthy adult like myself to you, and tbh it feels that way to me at times as well. But I do it because I live with an immunocompromised family member, and I would NEVER forgive myself if I got COVID-19 at school and spread the virus to that person. I understand that since I’m vaccinated, since I’m also a healthy/young adult I might not get the worst of Covid if *I* got sick, but if I spread it to my family member they have a very increased risk of dying even though they’re also vaccinated. Since this post was never about *me,* I won’t elaborate on my own safety measures or health risks further.

With the data we have, we know that after holiday travel a lot of people spread COVID-19 to other people. More recently, last summer (a time of year a lot of people travel) a lot of people spread COVID-19 as well. More information: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html?referringSource=articleShare

Personally, I hope we don’t have a similar surge post-holiday travel after the upcoming holiday season. But as a place where a lot of people from various places gather, I think the University should take steps to reduce virus transmission other than mandating vaccines for the foreseeable future. I don’t think it’s too much to ask for having remote classes for a few weeks before a full in-person return, which is why I asked my question to the Chancellor."
I am UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. Ask me anything!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/,2019-09-23 14:03:31,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the campus public affairs office here. With /u/lulzcakes‘s support we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus.

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She says she’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it.

Thanks so much and ask away!

**EDIT 4PM: We're live! Chancellor Christ will be answering questions until at least 5 PM.**

**EDIT 5:30PM: We've signed off but will be back at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. Thanks again for the questions!**

**EDIT 9/26 9:30AM: We're live again! Taking questions until 10:30 or so.**

**EDIT 9/26 10:30AM: Ok, signing off - thanks again for all of the questions. If you want to learn more about the chancellor's priorities, take a look here:** [https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/09/10/a-balanced-budget-but-chancellors-fall-backpack-is-heavy/](https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/09/10/a-balanced-budget-but-chancellors-fall-backpack-is-heavy/)","Chancellor, do you believe that with respect to our current enrollment numbers, that the campus is accommodating more students than it can actually handle? It is very often that resources like counseling and health care and getting into classes has a long delay, yet our enrolment number increased in 2019.
More and more of your students who live on campus experience ongoing frustrations with the lack of timely maintenance around campus. For example, Foothill experiences 2 fires last year, and failed to replace laundry machines in one of the laundry machine rooms where it happened. Multiple other times, people complained of rats and mice and other pests and yet facilities refused to come out to the units to take care of them. What role can you have in making university living spaces, that cost exorbitant amounts of money, safe for living without pests?
Thanks for doing this AMA! Two years ago, Prof. Satish Rao wrote 

> In light of the rise of UCLA to the No. 1 public university club, it is worth noting that UCLA’s administration appears to consume a significantly smaller slice of their pie, according to federal data. If UC Berkeley were as efficient as UCLA, we could easily add 100 faculty to campus today … several times over.

Do you agree with his assessment? Has anything changed on this front in the past two years?
Chancellor Christ, what are your views towards how Berkeley will keep up with its enrollment size over the next 10 years? As a public school, of course, Berkeley has a mission to educate as many students as possible allowed under the resources given. However, as it is obvious to us students, it’s led to an overcrowding issue that can be seen in many, many aspects of student life, from the difficulty of getting classes to how in our dorm building, all but one of our study lounges have been sacrificed for temporary housing. I understand that Berkeley is doing the best it can, but it worries me that our student experience and the image of our school will be affected negatively if Berkeley continues to get larger without meaningfully combating the overcrowding problem. Already, coming from the Bay Area many of my classmates had negative connotations of Berkeley, seeing it as a school where you will have to fight for everything, leading to a growing trend of choosing lower-ranked privates or even mid-tier UCs over Berkeley and seeing Berkeley as a backup school that you should only go to if you don’t have any better options. So, I guess my question is, what’s your view on this issue and how do you expect to relieve many of the overcrowding issues that the ever-growing student body will inevitably face?
Can more work be done to improve student safety? Many students live off campus, and there has been an alarming increase in nixle alerts of robberies in areas only a few blocks from campus.
Can we get an update on the progress of the renovations making campus buildings more earthquake-proof?

Thanks so much for taking questions Chancellor Christ. Both my wife and I are non-represented staffers on campus. We're concerned about the lack of adequate leave available when we have a new baby. Right now my wife would only get six weeks on state disability with 60% pay, while I, as the dad, would get no paid leave beyond any sick and vacation time I have saved up. 

This makes staffers choose between family and financial stability and upholds antiquated notions about which parent is responsible for child care. Plus we're behind many other public schools (not to mention the private sector) that offer many weeks of paid baby bonding leave.

Being a staffer on campus is already hard. Why not offer benefits that cost the campus little but improve the work/life balance for staff? If these policies are decided at the UC level, will you advocate for better staff benefits at the Board of Regents?
 My question concerns the position of Lecturers (non-tenure line faculty) on campus and in the UC system. A substantial and growing amount of undergraduate teaching is performed by Lecturers on campus and systemwide, yet according to the university's own Academic Senate report on Lecturers, many experience poor working conditions, insecurity and low pay that directly affects their ability to serve students. Lecturers are currently bargaining a new systemwide contract that attempts to improve working conditions, job security and pay. What are your thoughts on the position and role of Lecturers on campus and the current contract negotiations? 
Thank you so much for organizing this, Chancellor!


 I am someone potentially interested in higher ed leadership and am curious what your experience has been like. As a Professor to administrator, how have you transformed your role into making a substantial difference in academic settings where the belief is nothing gets done? 


What encouraged you to step beyond your research and take on additional responsibilities? Also, as Chancellor, what is your “typical” work day like?


These are certainly packed questions so I hope you answer how you best feel comfortable. 


Thank you so much for contributing here :)

> Hello, I want to suggest that classes have mandatory sick days. Many people at this college are undergoing incredibly stressful and important times of their lives. Chances are inevitably one person will get sick, and for classes with mandatory attendance it encourages the spread of sickness. Classes having allowances for illness is necessary for the public health of the students. I don't want to catch a flu before finals again.

As a person who is on immunosuppressants, I strongly support this comment. I understand that, in order to succeed in the class, a student must attend the class, but an illness can incredibly hinder a student's learning process and might make them fail instead of succeed, like taking an exam while sick. Also, Students here are still trying to understand how to properly care for themselves while managing the workloads from their classes. I know friends who have had the flu but won't see a doctor until after a test or something else important because they are too stressed about their grades. I feel this is a simple process that could be put into place to prevent an unwelcome spread of disease and harm to a student's health.
Hi Chancellor Christ, what are some things about you think UC Berkeley does exceptionally well, and what are some areas that you believe the school is lagging behind in?
The 1927 Hearst Gymnasium is ""[exploding from the inside](https://www.sfchronicle.com/education/article/Cal-s-Hearst-Gym-crumbling-without-partner-to-6711789.php),"" and  is a real danger to students and faculty when there is an earthquake  (""[Serious risk to life](https://capitalstrategies.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/appendix_a_-_uc-cr-17-0324_seismicsafetypolicy_accessible-5.19.2017_-_copy.pdf)""). How are **you** going to address this dilapidated facility that doesn't have outside donors - that needs YOU and the University to make the space safe?
What are you doing to address the campus's unhappiness crisis? It certainly seems to me like the impersonal, strenuous experience is partially to blame
UC Berkeley has a reputation of being a very, and some say unusually, difficult school for undergraduates: the combination of very high expectations, grade deflation, high GPA cutoffs for majors (especially for CS, but also for statistics, economics, etc, and applications for Haas),  and limited resources for a public school with a very high number of undergrads. For that reason, many students turn down Berkeley, believing it to be a place of extremely high competition and stress, in favor of a school that, is at least perceived to be, more ""balanced.""

As a freshman at Berkeley, I have not spent enough time here to make a conclusion on academic rigor and stress myself, but I heard that stereotype constantly when I told people I chose Berkeley.

Why do you think this stereotype came about and to what extent do you believe this perception is valid?

If you agree with this perception, how do you plan to combat student stress and ensure that workloads and expectations are reasonable for all classes so that students can focus on learning and enjoy their college experience?
How would you describe UCB’s relationship with the City of Berkeley (COB)?  

From my perspective, COB is at best, apathetic to UCB’s needs.  COB does little to prevent crime or to apprehend the perpetuators.  COB wants UCB to help with this homeless problem, but they do not hesitate to throw roadblocks to UCBs need for housing students/staff.
Chancellor Christ, would you rather fight one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?
How does it feel to be the chancellor of the only undefeated team in the PAC-12?


Also, are you going to the game on Friday?

Go bears!
Hello Chancellor Christ, As a  commuter to UC Berkeley I am heavily concerned about the removal of the Upper Hearst Parking Structure to create luxury apartments. When I first heard about the project as I thought the apartments were intended to be for students, and as we know student housing is desperately needed then I find out that at minimum the cost of this housing is $3000 for a studio, which is unaffordable to undergraduates, graduates, Post-Docs and low wage workers such as myself. So my question is did you have any say in this vote? I believe it was among the regents and I am unsure what input the Chancellor has. What would have been your vote?  Why will the builder retain the profits of rent for 31 years and not UC Berkeley? Why do the profits indicate that they will only benefit one Department, the GSPP and not every department?  Does UC Berkeley plan on challenging the EIQ lawsuits filed by the city? and long term does UC Berkeley plan on addressing larger student enrollment and greater housing needs by creating affordable housing?
-	CS classes have thousands of students and still popular upper divs suffer from waitlists of hundreds of students, with the most popular ones having to constantly turn away students due to capacity constraints. I've had to sit on the floor on several occasions because despite knowing how many students would show up, the department couldn't reserve a big enough room.
-	We've been talking about the housing crisis for years and years, yet enrolment has continued to massively increase. Similarly ranked colleges guarantee, and sometimes require, four years of on-campus housing. Meanwhile, Cal Housing has lied to sophomores saying they were virtually guaranteed housing and struggled even providing housing to all freshman. Notably, this year, we had to deal with dorms without study spaces because they were converted to temporary quads and continuing students received a series of emails encouraging them to cancel their existing housing offer so that their beds could be given to freshman.
-	Lines at dining halls are way too long, especially given how bad the food is. I know the food can be better if fewer students are being served because the food gets significantly better during breaks where many students return home.

We pay a lot of tuition and sometimes it seems like the money is going to things that make student life worse (more students) instead of better (spending more per student). Knowing that decreasing enrolment would immediately alleviate many of the most pressing issues for students, **why do we keep admitting more students?**
Affordable Housing? I know in many other colleges, students live in on-campus housing for all 4 years. However, we at Cal seem to have a culture where it is more common that not to move out after 1st year simply because the cost of on-campus housing was not worth the quality. I can attest to Unit 3's living conditions at least: when I was there last year half the laundry machines did not work, the bathrooms where often overcrowded, and there were bugs.

What is your favorite place to eat in Berkeley (that's affordable for students)?
A couple of months ago a Berkeley student wrote a facebook post detailing sexual harassment by Cal football coaches and players she experienced while working in Cal Athletics. 

Daily Cal Article: https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/21/former-uc-berkeley-student-accuses-cal-football-coaches-players-of-sexual-harassment/

Mercury News Article: https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/28/woman-at-center-of-cal-football-sex-harassment-allegations-speaks-out-on-today-show/

The accusation came out in March of this year. At the time the University's statement was something along the lines of that they were looking into it, but since then there has been no public update on its status. 

* Was the situation investigated thoroughly? Did anyone get held responsible? What changes have occurred to the football program and athletic department so this type of situation will not take place in the future.
* Was there not enough evidence to hold up her side of the story? Why was there no update or press release of some sort regarding that. 
* Is this matter still under investigation? If so, why is it taking so long? Five and a half months seems like it should be enough time to come to some sort of conclusion.
* Was this a case of the university settled out the matter of court so there would be limited press?
* Is this a matter that's currently being dealt with in court and that's why there is very little in the form of an update? 

The fact that there has been no real update on the status of this situation troubles me greatly. I am a huge fan of Cal Football, but while watching every game this season I've been worried that I am supporting a school and program that push sexual harassment under the rug. It makes me think we value a spotless image, football and money more than the truth, victims and justice.

I understand that everything Cal does is magnified in the media. I understand that even if the investigation revealed a lack of evidence about her accusations it could become bad press for the school. That said, to not give any sort of update to this situation, makes me a fan of you as our Chancellor and our athletic program worried and disappointed.

Hello, I want to suggest that classes have mandatory sick days. Many people at this college are undergoing incredibly stressful and important times of their lives. Chances are inevitably one person will get sick, and for classes with mandatory attendance it encourages the spread of sickness. Classes having allowances for illness is necessary for the public health of the students. I don't want to catch a flu before finals again.
Chancellor, last year during your previous AMA here, you talked about building more housing for students. A full year later, how is the progress on turning People's Park into student housing? Is everything going smoothly? What other major overhauls do you have in mind for the student housing issue? 

How do you feel about making *literal* on-campus housing? By that I mean housing that is quite actually right in the middle of campus. This is something I have thought a lot about. Many Universities around the world offer this feature for students (such as Mills College in Oakland), and I think it would be very much welcome here as well. We could charge a large premium for a dorm room right next to Doe, for example, and then use that revenue to pay for added student services for low income students.
Pay for staff at UCB is very low and far below a living wage. I am struggling to survive. Do you have plans to address this?
What's your favorite performance group on campus?
When is the ski lift getting built?

EDIT: but on a serious note, why is it that every single building on campus is blisteringly hot? It's as if no one is able to turn the AC on in any building. I've had classes end early because no one wants to sit in a 90+ degree room with 0 airflow
Hello Chancellor Christ,

Despite the Pac-12 being the ""Conference of Champions,"" the Pac-12 has been notably underperforming in the two largest revenue-generating sports, football and basketball. Under Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott's leadership, the Pac-12 member schools are generating a fraction of the revenue of its competitors (e.g. [$54M per Big Ten school, $43.7M per SEC school, and $29.5M per Pac-12 school](https://tvrev.com/college-sports-success-continues-to-be-decided-by-tv-revenues/)), while Larry Scott has spent lavishly on himself and greatly raised the conference's expenses: moving the conference headquarters to San Francisco at a cost of [$7 million annually to rent](https://awfulannouncing.com/ncaa/the-pac-12-network-is-still-a-beautiful-disaster-blowing-way-too-much-money-on-rent-and-larry-scott.html) (in comparison to the $318K the SEC spends on their headquarters, or $1.5M the Big Ten spends on their Chicago and NYC offices), paying himself over [$5 million annually](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/20/pac-12-releases-financial-data-full-breakdown-of-larry-scotts-salary-campus-distributions-and-conference-expenses/) ($3 million more than Greg Sankey of the SEC, and on par with Jim Delaney of the Big Ten, both of whom are generating far more revenue for their respective conferences), and hell, [even staying at a $7500/night hotel room with a private butler](https://sports.yahoo.com/report-pac-12-commissioner-larry-scott-staying-7500-per-night-suite-private-butler-vegas-235617548.html) on the company dime. His failure to secure media-distribution deals (e.g. good luck watching the Pac-12 Network if you have DirecTV) is costing the conference national prominence and tons of lost revenue.

You are one of the few Chancellors to speak out against Larry Scott. My question to you is this: is Larry Scott the right person to lead the Pac-12 Conference, and what should be done to address these obvious shortcomings?
Transfer students are an incredibly important part of this university, but it’s more difficult to find housing as a transfer, especially because many transfers are non-traditional students with families or don’t want to room with 20 year old’s. This makes the decision to come to Berkeley even harder. Transfers are also statistically more likely to be students of color as well as students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 

How do you plan to expand housing for transfer students?
I recently took a trip to the Haas side of the campus and was wowed by everything they have there. How is it that the College of Chemistry, our most renowned college which houses 2 of our top programs have facilities that are nowhere close to that of Haas?
Hi Chancellor Christ! I'm very interested to know the university's rationale behind the continued employment of Dr. Peter Duesberg. For those who don't know, Duesberg is a tenured professor in the MCB department whose research focuses on cancer; however, he is better known as a ""dissident scientist"" who asserts the notion that AIDS is not caused by the HIV virus (which he says is a harmless ""passenger virus""), but rather that it is caused by long-term recreational drug use. This belief, as well as the advice Duesberg provided to the Mbeki administration in South Africa beginning in 2000, has led to South Africa having the largest HIV/AIDS epidemic in the world today, as well as over 330,000 AIDS deaths that may have been prevented, had the administration not rolled back antiretroviral treatment under Duesberg's recommendation. Today Duesberg insists that there is no AIDS epidemic in Africa, but rather that this is ""propaganda"".

Why does UC Berkeley continue to employ Duesberg and provide him an environment in which to propagate his deeply harmful beliefs -- not just his own lab, but also the classes he teaches? Especially in the near vicinity of San Francisco, which contains one of the largest communities of people living with AIDS in the United States?
Hi Chancellor, big fan of your university. Just had a quick question about financing - the university is doing a TON of building right now, from Blackwell last year to the seismic retrofits of buildings like Giannini to the destruction of that other multi-story big building on Northside close to Morgan and GPB.

What’s going to be paying for all this, especially as we continue to service the debt on the additions to Memorial Stadium from a couple years back? Have you been in contact with CA lawmakers about altering statewide tax structure so that (even without raising taxes themselves) a greater percentage of the relevant tax goes towards maintaining and improving Berkeley and the other UC’s?
Hello Chancellor Christ, at the upcoming ASU game on the 27th can you personally come out and be a guest mic-man for part or all of the game?
Why is it so hard to build more student housing?
Chancellor, are there plans to address UC Berkeley's steady decline in ranking across the board on all major ranking lists. I think that the decline in ranking does have a negative impact on the caliber of the students UC Berkeley is able to attract. Thank you for your time.
Hi Chancellor! One of the most pressing issues in academia today is the state of academic publishing, and the exploitative industries built around it. What is the current situation with regards to negotiations with Elsevier, and what is the administration doing to support and contribute to open access to research literature, both in this specific case and in general?
So one of your former Haas Professors, Jose Plehn Dujowich, swindled over 300 students out of more than half a million dollars during his time at UC Berkeley. He did so by creating the Global Financial Data Project brandishing the UC Berkeley and UCLA logo and affiliating it with the school. The project was posted on both UCLA and UC Berkeley business school websites. Essentially, to participate in the program researchers would pay the research data partner, Bizqualify, \~$2500 to be a participant. (What he did not disclose was that he was Bizqualify's CEO). He then asked students to analyze his data for the benefit of the company. Although the concerns of many students were brought up, it felt like UC Berkeley brushed this under the rug. What safeguards are there in place to prevent something like this from happening again? Despite the 2 years since this has happened, how has UC Berkeley provided indemnity for the victims and rectified this situation? Many students were cheated out of their labor, funds, and opportunity cost and many of the international victims have not found recompense.
Fun question: What's your favorite restaurant in Berkeley?

What role, if any, do you believe the University should have in determining norms and ""rules of the road"" for research involving data harvested by companies such as Google and Facebook who are engaged in surveillance capitalism?  What about in educating young scientists of the ethical implications of such data gathering?
In all seriousness, have you ever smoked weed?
Chancellor,

Cal is home to the [Greater Good Science Center](https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/) which among other things studies workplace happiness and productivity. As a Berkeley Staff member I read their materials and attend their lectures, then turn around and see that our management structures come straight from 80es corporate America understandings of feudal-like structures of management. Things like flattening hierarchies, encouraging remote work, loosening schedules, union representation, etc all have proven benefits to staff morale, productivity, and retention, yet many of our managers seem to constantly fight improvements in these areas. 

What can you do to change the Cal bureaucracy to reflect 21st century understanding of what makes a good and productive workplace?
How do plan to accommodate for the ever-increasing classes sizes especially in the CS department? The wait time to get help in the last 61b project reached over 1300 minutes at some points. I know there are resources such as CSM but even those get filled up very quickly so many students can't even get in. For a logistical perspective, if this trend continues it seems students won't be able to get help even if they actively seek it.
Hi Chancellor Christ! Thank you for your thoughtful answers to questions that've been asked so far. I'd like to ask you about Stern Hall and what's being done to improve living conditions in it. I lived there last year (it was not on my list for housing options; I was given the ""any size/any location"" option that is suggested for your fifth choice), and encountered *many* mice in my room, cold showers multiple times a week, and a concerning lack of security at night, especially for an all-women's dorm. My concerns mostly arise from how much it costs to live there (equivalent to the other units but for substantially worse conditions), and how women who want an all-women's environment are forced to endure with such substandard conditions in order to live where they were supposed to feel most comfortable. I'm wondering what is being done to improve Stern (or, if there anything was done over the summer that I'm unaware of). Thank you!

What is your plan to improve the [dismal graduation rates and general material climate for black students](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Worst-public-California-schools-black-students-Cal-13264172.php)? As a black graduate, I feel that Berkeley claimed to be race-conscious but in reality, due to the intense resource scarcity, it was actually one of the worst places because those that lacked  cultural and financial resources (URM, low-income) were the ones that suffered the most. 

For example, while others were starting to work with professors to do research, I was going to yet another open house hoping to get an affordable place. While I, having been taught to be very deferential to authority due to ingrained notions of, for example, police brutality, bit my nails worrying about asking profs too aggressively for help, others felt entitled to badger them incessantly after every class.
 What do you think of the social tenor of Berkeley now in 2019 ?  How does it compare to when you arrived on campus?  And how do you feel it's changed over the decades?  

As an  alum, I feel what I hear is that much of the ""flavor' from 1960's through 1980's has now changed.  What do you think?
Bed Bugs is a very common theme on the Cal Parents discussion board. Two years ago one of the Units had to move all of the students out for a semester to get rid of bed bugs. This year they seem to be in Unit 3 but nobody in housing/maintenance is responding to emails or phone calls. My student is not in the Units but I think it would be wise of you to address this situation. Yes, all mattresses are now plastic in the dorms but bed bugs live in the wood furniture. This is a health crisis and unsanitary. My son is immunosuppressed and bed bugs would be worse than you can imagine for his health. Thank you.
Hi Chancellor Christ,

I feel like I have many questions to ask about, but I also recognize that it is quite folly to assume that you yourself would be both responsible for every problem on campus, as well as able to offer answers to all these questions.

So instead, I have a more focused question - what are the right avenues for students to provide feedback on problems on campus in such a way that it reaches administrative staff that are responsible for certain areas - and have a direct way to do something about it?

A personal anecdote for me was a very long multi-month process through the mental health support process at the Tang and DSP center. Having experienced this process and many of it's deficiencies, I wanted to find out how to provide feedback to help fix these problem, so that the school can more effectively help it's students in line with the promised commitment to mental health services we see everywhere (including this thread).

The answer across all the staff members I asked was ""I don't know."" And I have never found the answer since, nor do I have the time or incentive to, as a student where education needs to take priority #1.

And I'm sure others have similar concerns stemming from their experiences. The chaos of career fairs. Club application competitiveness and high rejection rates. Disproportionate problems with coursework structure.

I think people want to express frustration and demand solutions for stuff like this, but don't know how, besides writing a comment in this AMA hoping that these problems are acknowledged by you, as a surrogate for the entire administration. 

**TL;DR - Chancellor Christ cannot solve all our problems. So outside this AMA, how are students expected to provide feedback and help find solutions in coordination with the administration?**
What are some of your favorite places to visit on and around campus and the city of Berkeley?
Hello! Given your position of leadership at the university, what role do you feel responsible for in regards to addressing climate change?
Chancellor - what are your views on percentage of school income coming increasingly from foreign students?  How do you feel about this moving into the future?
Chancellor Christ, over the past few years state funding for Cal has gone down by an extreme percentage. If I'm correct, then currently, tuition makes up more of the University's funding than state support. Former Chancellor Birgeneau was particularly concerned with federal support for public higher education and its alarming decrease in the past decade. Do you have any plans or ideas as to how the University could secure more money and relieve the growing tuition on students? Would you be open to working with student groups to lobby the California legislature?
Chancleor Christ, is there anything that can be done about the caterpillar infestation? (It's now a moth infestation)
Do you follow the Overheard, Confessions, or meme pages on Facebook? 

If so, you've probably seen the outrage over the incomprehensibility of CS61B with Hilfinger. How is it that one of the most vital intro courses for CS, which Cal is known for, can be administrated without regard for the students? 

We'd been thrust into an exceedingly hard project with documentation which hasn't been gone over in class, office hour queues go up to 23 hours long, and instructors don't or aren't able to respond to questions on Piazza. Many people I know in the CS community recognize that this is unreasonable. The class isn't just hard, I would be okay with that. It's unreasonable and set up against the students. I believe this stems partly from the size of CS classes and the limited about of staff. How could the school possibly address this issue?
Can you accept less students so lounges don’t get turned into quads?
With respect to taking over some of the fees of renovating the football stadium, is there anything in the process you wish had gone differently?
In my experience at Berkeley, the high school preparation students arrive with seems to have a very large effect on college academic performance. This is exacerbated when early classes are critical to declaring a major, getting other opportunities, understanding future material, and building confidence. Due to it's size, rigor, and the variation in student backgrounds, Berkeley's preparedness gap seems to be especially wide and difficult to overcome, with many students falling through cracks. Additionally, many departments don't seem to put much effort into education and support for newer students. 

Is the administration measuring this or doing anything to help? What can the administration, departments and professors, and other students do to help level the playing field?
I just want to say thank you for your (and your team's!) work on turning UC Berkeley into a modern powerhouse of education. Yes, historically we have been one of the best schools in the world but as time goes on, rival and peer institutions have been upping their game to fight to be the best university. Thank you for keeping us in this fight and thank you for making Berkeley a school I can say I am proud to attend. Go bears!
Hmm hi. The world has become more and more nationalistic recently. As higher education institute goes, most recent case was Chinese students have become more problematic (eg U of Queensland, Vancouver). 
Will the school do anything to protect its integrity on this (eg, screening for incoming students, protect the students info from being upload on the internet and potentially targeted maybe back in their home country)? where is the line standing between free speech, hate speech and support a fascist organization?

What’s taking the elevators in Evans so long?
Chancellor Christ,

Thank you for taking the time to work with students, staff and alumni and allowing me this opportunity to vent. As a proud member of CAA and a former OUA staff member for over twenty years, I'm concerned with I what called ""The Stanfordization of Cal"" over ten years ago. I saw a great university heading down the wrong path by appealing to the private sectors and the elites to gain money when our state funding dried up. While Stanford is a great university it is also private and can appeal to the aforementioned. Cal was built by and for the people of the state, the nation, and the world. Everyone should have the opportunity to attend. As admissions trends have shifted, especially under the regime of the prior director of OUA (and what appears to be the same under the current director) how can we return to the prominence that we once held? UCLA has supplanted us as the top public university in the country (and world) due to our shift from calling ourselves Cal to Berkeley just to attract world wide applicants who can afford the out of state prices. A former colleague argued that people in China don't know Cal but they know Berkeley. I countered that we, as educators have a duty to educate everyone on every level. When referring to other public institutions one will call them by their state, not their town; Michigan, Texas, North Carolina. Not Ann Arbor, Austin and Chapel Hill. How can we return to prominence as the very best public university and return to our true identity as California Golden Bears, not Berkeley Bears and, once again, be the university for the state, nation and world?  Thank you and Go Bears!
What is your preferred dining hall (if any) and why?
Will the replacement for Evans Hall have more windows?
Hi Chancellor Christ, what are you thoughts on the football season so far?
Last time you said that you are more concerned about our quality of education than getting back to #1. However, many prospective students factor school ranking when deciding where to attend. Additionally, many employers use this as a metric for recruiting.

Do you think that our ranking impacts what we can offer as a campus and if so do you have a plan to get us back to #1?
To what extent do you change your speeches to new students from year to year?

Chancellor Christ, if you reply to a question about caldining please address this issue! I’ve run into problems being a vegan and using the meal plan, such as lacking nutritional options, running out of the only vegan option being offered (especially at crossroads, when many people without dietary restrictions choose to eat the vegan option because it’s good but then vegans/vegetarians have nothing), and just plain bad quality food. I think all the cafes need to offer a more balanced menu of options for vegetarians and vegans, or a single cafe needs to be made all vegetarian/vegan like cafe 3 used to be.
  
Reposting [ratswill](https://www.reddit.com/user/ratswill/)

Thanks so much for taking questions Chancellor Christ. Both my wife and I are non-represented staffers on campus. We're concerned about the lack of adequate leave available when we have a new baby. Right now my wife would only get six weeks on state disability with 60% pay, while I, as the dad, would get no paid leave beyond any sick and vacation time I have saved up.

This makes staffers choose between family and financial stability and upholds antiquated notions about which parent is responsible for child care. Plus we're behind many other public schools (not to mention the private sector) that offer many weeks of paid baby bonding leave.

Being a staffer on campus is already hard. Why not offer benefits that cost the campus little but improve the work/life balance for staff? If these policies are decided at the UC level, will you advocate for better staff benefits at the Board of Regents?

**My comments:** 

In fact, there are solutions to this problem that would SAVE the university money.

Chancellor Christ: Please read the report recently submitted to you by the Working Group on Equitable and Inclusive Paid Family Leave and pledge to support our proposal to the UC Regents! We have national advocacy groups that are eager to help us if the university will not.
Chancellor, I’m in the Units and my roommate is very messy. I’ve told him too many times to clean up, but he always straight up refuses. What should I do?
Can you institute a policy that makes course captures available to the public? As a public university, I think Cal has an obligation to make educational resources as available as possible. We already record these lectures and post them to youtube, why not allow everybody access to them?
I have been both an undergraduate and graduate student at Cal starting from 2011 until today. In that time I have seen the cost of housing rise dramatically to truly unsustainable levels. As a result, there is now an unacceptably high number of talented graduate students who turn down their offers from our programs in favor of departments at institutions located in cities where rents are lower. 

My question is this: When are graduate students at Berkeley going to be able to find a room in a shared apartment or university housing within 1 mile of campus that doesn’t cost more than 50% of our entire income?

Thank you.
Chancellor Christ,

What is your favorite cereal? This is beyond important to me.
Hi Chancellor, what is a decision you dread having to make in the coming years that could be averted if the Berkeley community (town & gown) steps up?
California has recently woken up to the fact that its forests are dangerously undermanaged and is now throwing vast sums of money at the problem. Meanwhile, groups like the U.S. Forest Service, CAL FIRE, and forestry companies cannot fill open positions due to lack of candidates. Despite this, the UC's premier (of just two) forestry program - Berkeley's - cannot get additional or replacement faculty slots approved, is not well promoted, and is threatened with losing its Master of Forestry degree. Why?
How can you make a commitment to protect undocumented students and simultaneously allow Palantir to recruit on our campus?
Earlier this year, you committed to ""welcoming, supporting, and building community with undocumented students and staff,"" but UC Berkeley still has a $20,000 contract with Palantir, the tech company that builds tech for ICE, that allows them to continue to be able to recruit on campus. How can you say you care about the safety and wellbeing of undocumented students while ICE collaborators are welcomed on campus?
Instead of starting class 10mins later, why not end class 10mins earlier?
What % of single-family houses in Berkeley have old garages that are just being used for storage?  What could UCBerkeley do to ease their conversion into grad student or faculty housing (and more income for the homeowner)?

Could you open up campus parking lots at night so they would have a safe place to stay?  The housing plans are all in the future. What are you doing for homeless students NOW?
Chancellor, as an alumni, I am extremely concerned by the fact that the university continues to employ John Yoo as a professor in the School of Law. Yoo was the author of the so-called Torture Memos, written to legitimize the practices of torture committed by the Bush Administration. His actions and beliefs are not compatible with the human rights and freedom this university is supposed to represent.
Hi Chancellor Christ, L&S CS or EECS?
Chancellor, I am concerned about the imminent **demolition** of the ***Upper Hearst Parking Structure****.* This will cost the campus at least **200 parking spaces**. This will not only make more difficult for UC Berkeley faculty and staff to find a parking spot, bit will **create a parking crisis** for the student as well. As today, it is very difficult to find parking spots for students past 9am. As a commuter myself, I feel that the current parking situation need to be addressed before the project can be approved. I understand that the new housing project will serve future graduate students, and faculty members, but let's not forget about the current users. Regards.
Chancellor Christ - I am inspired by your grace in the face of all the stress you face every single day.

How do you do it? What is your secret to staying calm and positive in the face of all the pressure, anger, demands?
In the past, faculty and staff were given free football tickets a few times a year. Can that make a comeback? It was a really nice perk of working here. It also helped us feel more connected to the campus community. Thanks for considering.

Thank you!
I just wanted to thank you for making hard choices around the budget deficit, student housing, and stadium debt that set the university success in the future.
Hello Chancellor Christ:

Many students are required to take CS61A/B for their major as general programming classes. However, the needs of CS students are usually different from what, say, a biologist or mathematician might need; most CS students will go on to get more practical programming experience in upper-division courses, while for non-CS students, 61A/B may be all the programming they take.

Has the administration considered creating an equivalent to 16A/B for non-CS majors that covers most of the same material, but forgoes some of the Big Ideas^TM in favor of more practical experience? Such a series could help both CS and non-CS students, as it could also reduce some of the load on those two classes, which tend to be (among) the largest at Cal.
Do you plan on backing up your commitment to ""remain steadfast in welcoming, supporting, and building community with our undocumented students and staff""?
Hello Chancellor Christ! So I have a two-pronged question: 
First, I see that you’ve been working tenaciously towards a 10 year strategy to address student houselessness and the housing crisis. While I have heard that this plan includes building more housing, what plans are in place to ensure that the housing is in fact affordable? 
This is particularly concerning since, at the moment, the on-campus housing is far more expensive (from what I’ve seen as a senior here) than the apartments around campus or co-op housing. 
My second question; why has there been a closed-door decision made to develop on the Oxford Tract? I find it very concerning as that is where faculty and students currently do research and learn. The Tract is also a student farm and a hub for the campus farms and gardens which collectively grew 19,500 lbs of produce last year (Basic Needs Committee Report, Data), with potential to grow far more. 
So, why isn’t that land being considered as a serious solution to alleviating student food insecurity (affecting 40% of Berkeley Students!) and if it were to be destroyed, how can we trust that the University housing will be affordable?
Has anything been done to address facilities?

For example:

* there's an open electrical junction box in 275 Soda
* CS labs have few working markers; last Friday two academic interns and a TA had to share one marker between them during a section I was assisting for. AIs are bringing markers they bought with their personal money to make up the shortfall.
* Pest problems, e.g. Bechtel 120 (Mice Caught by BEAM: 16)
* Pressing down on the handles of many faucets causes water to spray out
* Women's bathroom in 1st floor Cory has been removed
* A pipe burst in my dorm room, flooding much of the unit
* Unusable internet access in some buildings, such as Dwinelle

Another question: currently, the ASUC controls money even for student organizations that do not receive funding from it. This is out of line with other universities such as University of Maryland College Park and Caltech, according to my discussions with current students there, where student organizations can apparently spend third-party money without student council control. Reimbursements from the ASUC take a very long time; I have one that has gone for over six hundred days since the date of purchase without approval or rejection. Is there any plan to reduce or eliminate the ASUC's role in handling money they did not provide, or to speed up the waiting time for ASUC reimbursement requests? Long delays in reimbursements are a significant hardship for students who are expecting to be able to purchase items for their organization with organizational money, but instead have to use their own funds.
Hello Chancellor Christ, and thank you for being so thorough and transparent with your answers thus far. 

I had a question regarding the 30% administrative tax/fee that was placed on all funds supporting independent research across campus. I was not personally affected, but I have heard from several others that this fee will severely constrain the already tight budgets of some of the best work being done around campus. 

What led to this policy, and where is the money going?
Are you going to get the crazy situation with Title IX under control? Any many who even looks at a woman is guilty of rape in the eyes of OPHD.
This school his incredibly hostile to anyone who is not a very far left liberal. What happened to free speech and tolerance?
Two months late to the party with this here comment, and it's not asking Dr. C a question, but, I just read her [address to incoming students](https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/08/21/carol-christ-to-new-students-shape-berkeley-even-as-it-shapes-you/) and found it extremely good.  

(Another piece in much the same vein is this new essay - [the bus ticket theory of genius](http://paulgraham.com/genius.html) -  from Paul Graham.)
Where do I find drugs ?
just a quick question, if I have a cold and get over it I can catch another one, can Somebody catch Corona virus more than once??
What is the possibility of cancelling the semester?
Chancellor Christ, is there a plan to add a data science graduation requirement?
4 questions.

* Last week, UC president Janet Napolitano [gave notice](https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/09/18/uc-president-janet-napolitano-to-step-down-next-year/) that she would be stepping down next year.  This week, UC Berkeley [announced](https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/09/23/uc-berkeley-former-gov-jerry-brown-partner-with-china-to-spur-climate-action/) this new U.S.-China climate institute co-headed by Jerry Brown.  Coincidence, or is there something we should know?

* What plans do you have for ensuring that students who graduate from UC Berkeley have 1, an understanding of the basics of climate change (the science, the scale, and the policies to address it), and 2, critical thinking skills (and basics like understanding [how science works](https://www.ted.com/talks/naomi_oreskes_why_we_should_believe_in_science/transcript))?  
* Do you know what % of UC Berkeley alumni do understand the basics of climate change&policy?
* If you think UCBerkeley's educational mission doesn't stop at the graduation ceremony, how about doing something (beyond the alumni mag.) like livestreaming campus public seminars for remote UCB alumni club members?  (or, do something that's a better idea...)

Bonus questions:

* What can a univ. do to (help) ensure that outside money (e.g. to fund profs. and for-credit courses) doesn't skew the university's educational efforts, particularly in ways that don't steer us well into the future?

* Does UCBerkeley have a contest or other call to its people for proposals for a low budget high impact way that UC Berkeley could contribute, substantially, to public understanding about climate disruption?
From my friend in Unit 2: Can we get our lounges back?

From my friend in Unit 1: I'm curious of your opinion regarding Berkeley being one of the 20 least safest cities in California.
Will Oski always stay as our mascot? Is there some way we can publicly vote for or suggest a new mascot?
With the planned closure of the Oxford Tract, and closure of People's Park, would you consider allowing the College of Natural Resources and community members to use the Clark Kerr Open Space for as an agricultural area?

There are 2 parcels of land at Hillside and Dwight, and up Fernwald Road and Smyth Road which could serve CNR and community volunteers. The land is already open and clear, and could serve as a space for ecological and agricultural community-based education.

It seems like the program at Oxford could be moved and modified for this location, with a community volunteer component added.
What are your plans to improve the wireless coverage and reliability on campus and in the residence halls?
1. Are there any plan to reduce administrative costs, so that money can better be put toward students, professors, and infrastructure?

2. What kind of commitment to free speech will Cal have going forward, even Conservative free speech? Will the hecklers’/hooligans’/harassers’ vetos continue to be tolerated?

Hey Chancellor Christ! I have two questions for you!

1) What are your thoughts on the sociopolitical implications of existing?

2) What's it like knowing that you allowed students to reach the point of puking blood when any other rational school would have preferred human health over profit during the fires last year?
Hello Chancellor. I wanted to ask what happened to all of the chairs on the roof of MLK? I miss being able to sit at the tables up there.
Are there any plans to reintroduce institutional aid for Out of State students, and what is your personal opinion on the University System's decision on this matter? (BTW thank you for everything you've done for the campus so far :))

Go Bears!
I am a proud mom of 2 Golden Bears.  I am constantly hearing that they can’t find a place to do their work on campus.  The libraries are completely packed always and so are the near by coffee shops.  They often end up sitting on the floor trying to get their work done which is not very effective.   It upsets me very much that one of the leading university in the world can’t accommodate decent work/study space for the students.   They want to do the work, please allow them to do so on campus without having to fight over a work space.
It’s been awhile Carol! How are Jonathan and Elizabeth doing?
Chancellor, why select People’s Park as the location of new student housing? I can only presume you knew about the PR fiasco that this decision would cause, and it isn’t particularly convenient to campus as far as I’m aware.
Are you aware that UC Berkeley manipulates the educational level so that many high achieving double majors, transfers, or students with AP credits are rendered ineligible for the middle class scholarship? We are talking about undergraduates who would otherwise qualify for middle class scholarship yet your process has devised a system that labels these 4-year students as beyond 4-years, simply because they have accrued units for two majors? When did Cal become a for profit school in the sense that they are taxing students for earning two degrees?
I am a cal alum, and I was an international student at the time of my enrollment. As you are aware, the non-resident tuition fee for graduate students is approximately 30% more than their 'resident' classmates. 

My question is, what additional amenities do the non-resident students receive for their surged up fee structure? During my time in school, I didn't find any additional benefits for paying more than my 'resident' batchmates. However, what annoyed me was that I was never made to feel part of the community may be because of my nationality, ethnicity, language or cultural differences. So in a way, I was treated like a stepchild by the very people I was helping out (refer to the first line), by taking loans and working 20hr/week jobs alongside school.

I don't expect UC Berkeley to provide us with extra amenities because we are non-residents, and neither do I expect UCOP to reduce the surged up fees - I was part of a UCOP discussion where this topic was raised but to no avail. However, the least you as the chancellor can do is impress upon the resident students - that they less for their tuition, because the non-resident students coming from other countries and who look different from them pay more. And there has to be an additional effort by people from residents to make the non-residents feel at home.
Earlier this year, you committed to ""welcoming, supporting, and building community with undocumented students and staff,"" but UC Berkeley still has a $20,000 contract with Palantir, the tech company that builds tech for ICE, that allows them to continue to be able to recruit on campus. How can you say you care about the safety and wellbeing of undocumented students while ICE collaborators are welcomed on campus? Why do we harbor companies that do business with ICE like Palantir and Amazon on campus?
In the face of Islamophobic sentiments and events occurring locally and on a national scale, have you and your administration taken any direct and tangible steps towards better serving the Muslim community of the university? Specifically, what steps, if any, are being taken to create more opportunities and support for black Muslims, who face the challenge of discrimination based on their faith as well as their race?
Dear Chancellor, 
I am an international student applying to UC Berkeley to start in the fall 2020 semester. I was wondering, how many international students get admitted to UC Berkeley on average?
How can you advocate for the erasure of an integral part of UC Berkeley’s legacy... People’s Park. Decades ago, a multitude of students and people of diverse backgrounds came together around community and set of shared values. Today, the university is abandoning those students and their ideals. The housing crisis is dire, but it was caused by over-enrollment, gentrification, and a refusal for the campus to build on numerous sites... it should not be used as a smokescreen to destroy the park!
No question, just happy cake day!
Chancellor Christ, does it smell like updog in your office?
Hi Chancellor Christ and thanks for the AMA! As a former UCB insider whom still has scope into the university operations, what are you doing to improve the sustainability of business on campus? I always saw major issues within supply chain management for campus as being a huge hindrance to progress (for example, the practical monopoly on water service that Nestle Waters has or the fact that the internal purchasing system still vends incandescent lights).

My daughter, a high school senior, is applying to study environmental science at multiple universities including several UCs. What do you believe distinguishes the undergraduate experience in environmental science at Berkeley from that at the other UCs? What do you believe distinguishes the undergraduate experience in general at Berkeley from that at the other UCs?
Do you have plans to decrease delays at the IRB? I've heard they are very understaffed. Same with SPO...
Over the past few years our freshman enrollment has been down, mainly because of an over-enrollment in years prior to that. But I generally believe our campus is at or above capacity, yes.

Strange as it may sound, enrollment targets are not actually determined by me or my administration. Through negotiations, the state legislature, UC Regents, and UC Office of the President arrive at a total enrollment number, and then work with the campuses to divide it up. Pressure has come from the state legislature for all UC campuses to take more undergraduate students. We have taken our share, and then some. The last major jump in enrollment was the result of negotiations between UC President Napolitano and then-Governor Jerry Brown, who believed that the Berkeley needed to enroll more Californians if it was to earn its state funding allocation.

All this said, I can and do offer guidance during this process. I joined with other UC chancellors last year to make clear that there are some campuses, like ours, that do not have the space or resources to take in more undergraduates, while there are other campuses that do have that room. I have asserted that Berkeley must be a “no growth” campus until we have met some of my other priorities to make sure we can provide a positive experience for the students we have and for any others we may take. We will stand firm on that position of no growth, while trying to alleviate the stresses in other ways - by hiring 100 new faculty so that we can offer more space in classes and a better faculty-to-student ratio, by building more housing close to campus.
I am not familiar with the data Professor Rao cites, so I can’t comment directly on that portion of the question. I can say that senior administrative headcount at Berkeley has been decreasing steadily for the last five years and - to pre-empt a common red herring in university finances - senior leadership salaries take up less than 2% of our campus salary pool. Staff increases have occurred, for various reasons: to help us remain competitive with what private colleges offer; to provide better student support services like counseling, advising, a robust career center, basic needs resources, etc; to remain compliant with unfunded mandates from the UC system, state, or federal government; and to help us implement a major IT program. UCLA is in much the same boat as we are in these regards.
To an extent, our campus’s location means that we can’t entirely separate the campus from the city. We’re an open campus in an urban neighborhood. 

Still, student safety is a top priority and we do have services designed to keep you informed and safe. One major new development is that we are doubling the number of CSOs. I also encourage you to sign up for Nixle alerts if you have not, to use night safety services, and to follow UCPD’s general guidelines - walk in groups at night, keep electronics out of sight.
Thank you for asking this. There is simply nothing more important than ensuring the basic safety of our campus community and guests. The initial round of seismic assessments looked at just over one hundred of our more than 600 buildings and found that 62 of them are likely to need retrofitting or replacement. The remaining buildings are now being examined and that work will be completed in June 2020. Once the initial assessments are done, the next phase of the project will determine the exact remedies needed to strengthen or replace deficient buildings. We do already know that Evans Hall, used by several thousand students and others every day, will need to be replaced at an estimated cost of $340 million.

I want to emphasize that UC Berkeley has, over the years, spent more than $1 billion to address seismic deficiencies, and work continues to this day across the campus (The work being done on Giannini, for example, is a seismic remediation project). Remediating seismic deficiencies is a process of continuous improvement driven by advancements in technology and scientific understanding. We are committed to keeping our campus as seismically safe as possible.
I am sure Cal Dining does everything they can to provide healthy food at a reasonable cost, but I can pass your and others’ concerns about campus food to those who run the dining services. I’ve never eaten dining hall food at UCLA, but the dining hall food I’ve eaten here has been pretty good. And I was once in a fancy New York restaurant where I found a caterpillar in my salad!
I’ve answered this in part on the enrollment question, but additionally I’ll note that we are trying to be strategic about putting new faculty positions in areas where there is a great deal of enrollment pressure. Also, the overcrowding problem is most evident in CS courses, and on that front the creation of Data Science courses, including the Data 8 class as an entry point through the Data Science major, is in part meant to provide a similar path for students. I want to extend my thanks to everyone in CS who has been smart, creative, and entrepreneurial in helping us maintain academic quality despite the not-ideal class sizes. 

It's important to remember that while some majors are oversubscribed there are others that are undersubscribed. Because we do not admit students into majors for a majority of our programs, and we encourage academic discovery and exploration, a simple reduction or increase in class size will not necessarily solve the problem. 

However, just to end with what I said in my previous answer on enrollment, we are now a no-growth campus.
In fact, there are solutions to this problem that would SAVE the university money. 

Chancellor Christ: Please read the report recently submitted to you by the Working Group on Equitable and Inclusive Paid Family Leave and pledge to support our proposal to the UC Regents! We have national advocacy groups that are eager to help us if the university will not.
Lecturers are essential to our instructional program at Berkeley, and do valuable teaching. I know the Provost is particularly interested in improving working conditions for lecturers.
I was first motivated to try my hand at administration because of my commitment to women’s issues; in the 1980’s I accepted a position as Chancellor’s Assistant for the Status of Women and Title IX Compliance Coordinator. I discovered from that experience how much I enjoyed administration and higher education leadership. My career has developed very organically from that job; I never had a grand plan, but I took the opportunities that were offered to me.  

In regard to a typical work day: Once, long ago, my daughter decided to dress up as me, and holding a briefcase loudly proclaimed, “I’m mommy, and I’m going to meetings!” She was not far off. Today I had a meeting on the implications for our campus of a new state law, I spoke at and attended a workshop about unconscious bias, I spoke at a Section Club meeting, I had a meeting with a donor, I had a meeting with a dean, I had a meeting to prepare for a meeting with another donor,, and I had internal meetings on a variety of topics. All of these were important in their own ways. I always look for opportunities to attend student, faculty, and staff events when I can - it keeps me connected and reinforces my love for this place.
Thank you for sharing this. As I mentioned this is controlled at the faculty level but I appreciate your feedback.
I think Berkeley has extraordinary strength in research across a broad range of disciplines. It has a powerful sense of excitement...that new things are happening here - historic things - whether they are discoveries in the laboratory or social movements on Sproul Plaza. Berkeley has a strong sense of activism.  

Berkeley does less well in providing affordable housing for its students, meeting their basic needs, and creating what I call equity of opportunity for all students.
Students report that their number one health concern is stress and mental health. The campus offers a variety of services to support those who are stressed or distressed - counseling through the Tang Center and in satellite locations around campus, a student ombudsperson, the Center for Support and Intervention, the Basic Needs Center, and more.

I don’t think that this stress is unique to Berkeley; whenever I talk with other university chancellors and presidents, they share their concern with the amount of stress that students carry. When I was president of Smith, students there complained about how stressful it was. I think the best way of addressing this issue is really twofold: on the one hand, it’s important to remind faculty not to impose unrealistic work expectations on students; on the other hand, it’s important to give students the resources to handle stress and create balance in their lives.
I’m told that this question is a Reddit AMA rite of passage. 100 duck-sized horses, any day, particularly if they’re pretty ponies.
It feels pretty great to be the only undefeated team in the PAC-12--almost as if you’re looking at the world through rose-colored glasses.  Yes, of course, I’m going to the game on Friday, and Go Bears!
Thank you for your question - there is a lot to it but I will try to be comprehensive. First, please respectfully allow me to correct and update some of the information you’ve presented. The primary target population for the residential portion of the Upper Hearst project - which I do support - is junior faculty who have struggled to find affordable housing close to campus. I don’t think the units would by any means be considered luxurious and rents would be in line with or below market rates. As I’m sure you know, rents in any building are largely a function of construction costs, which are extraordinarily high in the Bay Area. However, the campus has also committed to subsidizing the rental costs in order to ensure these units would be as affordable as possible.

I also want to make clear that GSPP does not stand to benefit financially from the rental income this building might produce.  In fact, any income the building produces in excess of the cost of the long-term debt through which we will finance it (the mortgage, so to speak) goes to the campus.

As far as the City of Berkeley’s lawsuit against the campus is concerned, we continue to hope and believe the lawsuit can be settled out of court, which will help us avoid unnecessary delay in our goal to meet the need for more housing. For those without the background, the city has sued our campus over our project on the Upper Hearst site, and as a condition of dropping the lawsuit is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars to fund general city services that they believe the campus is responsible for. Given our financial state, the university must rely on public-private partnerships to construct new residential facilities, and those partnerships are much more difficult to finance when there is pending litigation. Ironically, the city leaders who have repeatedly asked the campus to build more housing are now hindering our efforts to do exactly that - unless we bow to unrelated financial demands.

Should settlement talks fail, we will be prepared to defend our position in court, and I am confident that we will be successful. I hope it does not come to that.

This is one of the top priorities for our campus IT department, and they are aware of the issues in dorms especially - we're in the middle of a push to double the number of wifi access points on campus, and to incorproate more advanced technology as well.

One reason for the issues is that the amount of traffic on our network has simply exploded in the last few years. At the end of 2015 the traffic for Berkeley’s entire network amounted to about 15 terabytes per day. In the middle of 2017 it had grown to 45 terabytes per day - a three-fold increase. This is by no means an excuse - we must do better to accommodate student, staff, and faculty needs - I just thought it was a fascinating trend.
Fat Apple's! With my grandkids.
I am aware of these allegations. When this was posted, Athletics, as per its policy, referred the matter to the campus Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination to investigate the incidents. I apologize that this is not something I can comment much further on. Allegations of sexual violence and sexual harassment by campus employees are confidential unless officials determine policy is violated and disciplinary action has been decided. Allegations against students remain private regardless of the outcome under UC policy as well as federal law regarding student records.

Sharon Inkelas, who I appointed as Special Faculty Advisor to the Chancellor on Sexual Violence/Sexual Harassment two years ago, has done a great deal of work to improve our sexual violence and sexual harassment prevention and response efforts. All university staff and all students are now required to complete sexual harassment and sexual violence prevention training. The athletic department also sponsors supplementary formal training for coaches, staff and student-athletes in sexual violence awareness and prevention, bystander intervention, and campus reporting procedures. This issue is very important to me.
As chancellor my decisions must be driven by what I believe to be the needs of the campus as a whole. I believe that our fastest-growing graduate school is in dire need of additional academic space, and that our academic excellence requires us to help the best young faculty in the world want to work at Berkeley by providing subsidized housing close to the campus.

I am also well aware that there exists a wide range of opinions about the underlying environmental studies connected to the Upper Hearst project. I would strongly contest the notion that the data was skewed, inaccurate, or incomplete. We rely on some of the best professionals in the business for our environmental impact analyses. As I mentioned previously, should settlement talks with the City fail, we are very confident that those analyses will withstand any level of scrutiny in court.

I assure you that President Napolitano’s appointment at GSPP is entirely unrelated to this. The sole drivers of our decisions about land use, construction, and - for that matter - every other action, policy, or practice on this campus are a commitment to our mission and our assessments of what best supports the needs and interests of our community.
First I will say that if you have an illness, please get the help you need. If it is not serious, call the Tang Center nurse-on-call and stay home to rest. If it is serious, please seek help at the Tang center itself. 

Berkeley delegates to faculty the design and delivery of courses - and this includes determining how and when to excuse absences, excuse missed work, extend deadlines, or offer alternative assignments when a student is sick. Very often, professors build flexibility into their syllabi, allowing 1-3 unexcused absences, to be used for just these very situations

If you are sick with a minor illness, I would encourage you to simply talk to faculty and GSIs - they are humans too and understand that people become ill. Developing a trusting relationship with them can help you in this and many other regards.
Everything is moving ahead as hoped in regard to the People’s Park development. We just hired an architecture firm for the student housing portion of the project, and have selected a non-profit developer - Resources for Community Development - to lead the work on the supportive housing for homeless members of the community. We are about to launch a public comment and engagement process that will last nearly a year and offer members of the campus and community the chance to hear about the project and give feedback. The start of construction is probably two years away.

Beyond People’s Park, we are at this moment completing an agreement with a generous donor who will construct and donate a new student residential building at the Gateway site on the corner of University and Oxford. Next in line is likely to be the development of the Oxford Tract. We have committed to maintaining the students’ organic garden on that site, and to finding a new location for the academic facilities and fields currently located there.

A committee I chaired a few years ago looked at dozens of parcels of campus land for potential development a few years back; we try to keep all housing on the periphery of the main campus, reserving the main campus for academic and administrative buildings.  Our campus is actually relatively small in size, and we want to preserve its open spaces.
We do try to provide competitive salaries and especially benefits given our own financial constraints and public responsibility. Part of the problem is of course broader economic trends in our region.

Pay scales are largely set by the Office of the President, but we do have some control. In the last few years, Berkeley has been separating out the notions of “merit” and “equity” when determining salary increases,, urging units to set aside an additional pool of funds (beyond the 3% merit pool) to make equity adjustments that bring salaries up to market rate. We've shared data about where employee pay is vs the market rate for the role, which encourages units to allocate additional funds to close the gap between actual and market pay for staff.

The Cal Band!
I had a great discussion during my office hours last spring with the students who came up with the idea. They had done their research - looking into cost, placement on campus, potential liabilities, and more - and I thought it was a wonderful concept. I put them in touch with Marc Fisher, our vice chancellor for administration, who also met with them and offered them support to determine necessary cost, planning, and land use impacts. The idea started here on Reddit...perhaps the students who proposed it can weigh in??

I empathize; my office is over 90 degrees.  Seriously, this is a sign of global warming.  It never felt as if we needed air conditioning in the Bay Area, but now, with more hot days, it feels as if we might.

FIRE LARRY SCOTT! oh wait I'm not on r/cfb ... the point still stands though!
I believe we are in a housing crisis, and we are planning to expand housing for all students: Our Housing Master Plan calls for providing two years of student housing for entering freshmen, one year for entering transfer students, and one year for incoming graduate students. To get there, we are going to be doubling the number of student beds by 2028 using much of the land available to our campus. 

The very first housing project that we will complete in our housing plan will be for transfer students  - about 750 beds (apartment style) on the Gateway site - at Oxford and University.
Chemistry is raising the money right now for a new building - an addition to Lewis Hall - and has been developing a facilities renewal plan.
Haas also has a lot more donors, and wealthier ones at that.
 [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/06/berkeley-drops-probe-duesberg-after-finding-insufficient-evidence](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/06/berkeley-drops-probe-duesberg-after-finding-insufficient-evidence)
The issue of financing for our capital needs, including seismic remediation and new housing, is a pressing and urgent challenge. I should note though that the campus’s portion of the stadium debt amounts to about $10 million a year - a significant amount to be sure, but a number that needs to be contextualized: Berkeley’s annual operating budget is $2.6 billion, and the estimated, combined price tag for the seismic work we’ll need to do is well in excess of $2 billion. 

During the spring elections, California voters will have the opportunity to approve a General Obligation bond meant in part to fund the University of California’s systemwide capital needs. However, approval of the bond will likely provide Berkeley with about $200 million. Tthe price tag for the replacement of Evans Hall alone will be about $340 million. So we must adopt an “all of the above” financing strategy that will include working with the UC Regents and UC Office of the President, working with elected officials in Sacramento, and lobbying our donor community.

Financing for our various housing projects is a somewhat different and more complicated story. We intend to enter the debt market to fund the student housing project at People’s Park, with debt service to be supported by rental revenue. A generous donor plans to build and donate a new student residential building at the Gateway site on the corner of University and Oxford. We will also rely on public-private partnerships for the funding and construction of other dormitories, as we did for Blackwell.  In general, we must rely on philanthropy to meet our ambitious building goals, both in housing and on the main campus.
Actually, Berkeley hasn’t declined in the rankings. But since you raise the question of rankings, I have to share my view of them. I do not think you can create an ordinal ranking of colleges and universities as if they were football teams. Colleges and universities are enormously complex institutions, and they are slow to change, as anyone who has tried to change them knows. Rating organizations - like U.S. News, for example - create an algorithm that combines a number of factors, and uses that as a proxy for ranking. These factors are mostly admissions selectivity and wealth measures. Private universities therefore do better than publics because they spend more per student (When UCLA pulled ahead of Berkeley when we were in deficit, it was largely the wealth measure that had this effect). The rating organizations change the algorithm every year - they say to improve it - but I believe to create an artificial volatility in the data. Who would buy magazines every year if the ratings never changed?
This is a very complex but important issue in higher education. UC’s position is that taxpayers in the state of California and people around the world should have access to the research generated by scholars on our campuses. So we’ve made open access a priority - we’ve invested in support for authors who publish in open access journals or produce open access books, and our library helps guide authors looking to transition to open access publishing. The commitment to open access is also something we prioritize when negotiating contracts with some of the world’s largest academic publishers, including Elsevier. Earlier this year UC took a stand when it became clear that we did not see eye to eye with Elsevier, and we walked away from our contract. Negotiations have not yet restarted. 

I am hopeful that our leadership can transform the publishing landscape for the better. We recently made an open access agreement with Cambridge University Press and are exploring other ways to make certain our research is freely available to everyone. We’re open to re-entering talks with Elsevier if they’re willing to help us achieve those goals.
I think you raise a very important question, and one that I know is of concern to many faculty and administrators on campus. The new data science major, I understand, has an ethics module in which students look at the many issues associated with surveillance, the data economy, respect for the personal origins of data, regulation, ethical research, and how data is changing society. The I School also looks at ethical issues in regard to data.

On the research side - we take the ethical use of sensitive data very seriously and have many controls for its management, storage, and treatment.
We have a new HR Director, Eugene Whitlock, who I hope will pay attention to the issues that you raise.  I agree with the direction you describe of how work should evolve.
Bechtel 120 has had mice and ants for over two years, so don't hold your breath. Good luck...
Chancellor Christ, Thank You for making the thoughtful and very difficult decision of moving classes to online. After all the health and well-being of our Cal community is of outmost importance. But what about the Athletic Dept? student athletes are not being released and they are asked to stay in their dormitories and continue with their training as if the virus will somehow discriminate against the athletes? The virus is in the city, perhaps even on campus although no confirmed cases yet?! How many students have actually been tested? This is a highly contagious virus with a long incubation period. The last thing we want is to keep the students in their dormitories until they become sick enough to need to get tested! Then they have to get quarantined or unable to travel home and worse, get hospitalized here locally?! Specially now that 2000 passengers from the cruise ship will be disembarking, many of whom may need medical care locally? Keeping students on campus un-necessarily at a time like this is ill advised. Someone needs to take charge. Thank You for being a thoughtful commander in chief.
I agree that these are important points that should be addressed directly.
I’m really sorry to hear that you had these experiences as a student.

Our graduation rates for new freshman have been improving, but this and the climate for black students more broadly remain issues for the campus. Improving the black student experience is part of a major push that we began last year to make the campus more welcoming towards and supportive of those traditionally underrepresented in higher education. I’m not sure when you graduated, but the student-led effort to create the Fannie Lou Hamer Resource Center in 2017 was a very important step - the center provides a home base as well as academic and social support for black students. Takiyah Jackson, who joined our campus last year as Director of African American Student Development, is a terrific leader and advocate for black students on the campus. 

On the financial resources front, as you might’ve heard, the African American Initiative was launched two years ago and includes scholarship funds for an incoming group of black undergraduates. We also just received a $7 million gift to help build a program for underrepresented students in STEM that is modeled on the very effective Meyerhoff Scholars Program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

The point you mention about not approaching a professor shows that cultural awareness training for faculty and staff is also important. YEsteray I attended a workshop on unconscious bias - these things are necessary for the campus.
The Botanic Garden is beautiful, if you haven’t been there. The Art Museum and the Pacific Film Archive are great. And the whole campus is really so wonderful -  its sometimes hard to step back and realize that when we associate it so strongly with work or study, but it is!
I think that anyone in a leadership position today has an obligation to think about how their organization contributes to climate change.We’ve tried to model sustainability in our operations: We met our first carbon reduction target ahead of schedule in 2012, we are focused on becoming carbon neutral by 2025 in our building energy use, and we aim to be carbon neutral in other sources like transportation by 2050 or sooner.

Advocacy beyond campus is also important. All ten UC chancellors just signed a climate emergency declaration letter that includes a commitment to carbon neutrality in our operations. Our researchers obviously play a major role in studying climate change and proposing policy solutions (in addition to developing more sustainable technology in any number of areas). I also want to acknowledge the leadership of our students here: CALPIRG encouraged my administration to commit the campus to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050; this past Friday, students organized a climate change teach-in and rally that drew hundreds.
u/datbromo, were you satisfied with Dr. Christ's answer?

Something I did not realize, is that the Lawrence Hall of Science (museum) is also under her (ultimate) direction.  I'd be interested to know what visitors think of how it educates about the science of climate change.  (If it does, it's not very prominent.)
I have been working with students to lobby the California legislature to increase funding for UC, and am certainly open to continuing that work. In regard to the point about growing tuition - UC has increased in-state tuition only once in the last nine years, and tuition actually decreased last year!
We get less money per student from CA than UMD College Park gets from MD, last I checked (2017 numbers, I believe). That's pretty sad. I don't know how the state of California can pretend to have a public university when it provides a relative trickle of funding.
In lieu of answering this myself, here are some notes from a much more qualified source: Peter Oboyski, our entomologist expert from the Essig Museum at VLSB.

What are these bugs? ""California oak moth"" Phryganidia californica

Why have they appeared on campus? Oak moths are native to the Bay Area and usually persist at modest population levels. Outbreaks happen sporadically along the central and northern California coast up through Marin. No one knows why they explode in specific locations and they do not seem to attack the same place twice. Last year there was a big outbreak in Oakland. It appears that the moths move on after their late summer attacks.

What are they doing? The caterpillars of the California oak moth specialize on the the leaves of coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia). In normal years, small numbers of caterpillars chew on oak leaves without anyone noticing. But when the populations are high the loss of leaves is extreme. And once they finish the leaves of one tree, the caterpillars descend by the thousands on their silk drag lines either to find a place to pupate (if they are finished feeding) or get blown by the wind to another tree for feeding. Only some trees are attacked. Another nearby tree of the same species may look completely untouched. The adult moths deposit their eggs on just a few trees, which is probably based on the individual tree's chemistry that either attracts or deters the moths.    

How long will they stick around? There could be a second round of moths and caterpillars if the weather conditions are favorable. But we can expect to see them start to disappear over the next few weeks.  

What can we, as a community, do about them? There is not much that can be done at this point. Most of the feeding has happened and the trees will recover with fresh leaves next spring. I recommend that we resist the urge to spray pesticides. This is a native species that is part of the local food web. The defoliation has already occurred and chemical sprays will kill other native arthropods, including the natural predators of these insects. While the naked trees do appear unsightly, and the bungee jumping caterpillars are a nuisance, it is all cosmetic and a small price to pay to work and study on a campus that hosts native ecosystems including streams, redwoods, peregrine falcons, monarchs, and yes, oak moths.
I wish that the financial planning for the seismic strengthening and renovation of the football stadium had been better, but I don’t have any regrets about taking the seismic portion of this debt onto the campus’s books when I became chancellor.
We have some programs to level the playing field - Summer Bridge is a good one, and we have developed a Summer Bridge program for transfer students.  The Student Learning Center provides excellent resources; it is also important to make best use of your advisor to plan your course of study well.  This is all part of what I call equity of experience - providing the resources to students to levelling the playing field.
It would be nice if the state of California funded us at a world-class level. In 2017, we got less funding per student from the state than University of Maryland, College Park got from the state of Maryland...and UMCP has a significantly lower cost of living.

Re the shelter for UCLA students - Here's a [Q&A with a founder](https://newsletter.alumni.ucla.edu/connect/2016/may/bruin-shelter/default.htm) of the shelter taking in UCLA students.  It does make the point that it's easier if it's organized and run independently from the university, due to univ. liability&red tape concerns.

I do wish that that [building on Southside](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/10/29/former-berkeley-school-to-become-50000-square-foot-home-artist-colony) that's going to become an artists' colony could become a homeless students' shelter instead.
We don’t apply a political litmus test to faculty, and, indeed, diversity of thought on the faculty is critical to the robust marketplace of ideas that is the goal of the Academy.
I guess you aren't a fan of academic freedom
no
Have an initiative so we can have more Native American traditional dancers on campus
Oscar Dubon and Chris Gutierrez are co-chairing a task force that will provide a blueprint for achieving this goal; they are scheduled to report by the end of the semester. Becoming an HSI serving institution is not just about the numbers, but also about how well you serve the students you have, so their recommendations will help us achieve the goal we have of making Berkeley a supportive and welcoming place for all students.
How does being a HSI not serve latino students? I don't understand this question.
No, they didn't pay California taxes
[removed]
Great question! I'm looking forward to her answer!
Who says it has to?
Berkeley students are in charge! Specifically, the group The Californians. I imagine they table on Sproul and can be found fairly easily.

Potential speakers are initially nominated by members of the senior class - I think this is done via an email seniors receive early in the semester - and then the list is refined by The Californians and approved by the ASUC. My office extends the invitations themselves.

I just received the list of potential speakers for the winter commencement. There are some exciting names on it.
If we don't know the fool obv shouldn't have him
Maybe your adult child should grow up and stop calling mommy to fix his problems
There's E 7 and Data 8, both of which are programming courses for non-CS majors.
How can you claim to support undocumented students while taking money from Palantir, Amazon, and other ICE collaborators?
Lol your kids cry to mommy about their adult problems. Maybe you should have a parent-teacher conference too.
Personally, I've found working in one's own home to be more effective.

Thank you for the considered and thoughtful response!
With all due respect to Chancellor Christ, this answer feels generic to me both as a Cal parent and as someone who oversees security for a large public entity. Many college campuses and public services are located in urban neighborhoods, and all must be accountable for the security systems they put (or fail to put) into place. My son attends Cal and last December was assaulted on his way back to his dorm - he's six foot two with an athletic build and was walking with two other young men at the time (he's fine, by the way, but this was alarming to him and his friends). 

Violence near the campus is too prevalent, and seemingly on the rise, to brush off with a shrug and a comment like ""well, we live in a big city, so just walk in groups and subscribe to Nixle.""
What I got out of this is that Evans is definitely going. Nice.
> a fancy New York restaurant where I found a caterpillar

I think this response was very poor. Caterpillars in a salad are unacceptable anywhere, and just because a New York restaurant had one in their salad doesn't make it excusable for Cal Dining either. Food hygiene is important here. It is important in New York. It would be like getting accused of sexual harassment and pointing out Donald Trump did it too.
I am generally supportive of family leave; I know the report to which you refer, and will take an active role in its consideration.
Wow! Thank you for such a detailed answer :)
>rose-colored glasses.  


Pray to the Berkeley gods for Rose Bowl
This gave me chills. Thank you and I doubt the city lawyers will survive the paws of a great bear like you.
It's so upsetting. I live paycheck to paycheck.
Is the staff unionized? It's so easy for University staff to become invisible but the UC doesn't exist without them - maybe there's potential for some student solidarity.

Thanks for the response!
Thank you for the response! That’s a hefty price tag. The calling center has a helluva task ahead of them.
This is a very good answer, Chancellor! Thank you for your input.
What do you think is typically a prominent university's ""biggest lever"" in the effort to tackle global climate change?
That’s great to hear! Thank you for all your hard work!
You haven’t been in an Evans classroom have you?
[removed]
Hi Chancellor, thank you for the reply, I was thinking this one was going to get ignored. I agree that universities, especially one as prestigious as Berkeley, should have a wide variety of viewpoints to encourage critical thinking and discussions. That being said, the use of torture is a dark spot in our history of as a nation, not to mention a potential war crime. If the university is concerned with having conservative academics to counterbalance liberal and left viewpoints in it's law school and beyond, there are plenty of conservative minds that did not contribute to human rights violations.
Having a conservative viewpoint is one thing. Actively contributing to gross violations of human rights is an entirely different matter. Go back to the\_donald.

If it was just one caterpillar maybe you'd be right. This has been going on since before the caterpillar epidemic though, to the point where a common joke has become that cafe 3 and foothill salads have more protein, so it's a systemic problem.

"I am Carol Christ, chancellor of UC Berkeley. Ask me anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/,2018-10-08 11:58:12,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the UC Berkeley public affairs office here. /u/lulzcakes and I have been talking about bringing the chancellor onto Reddit to take your questions for quite a while, and we’re excited to finally do it. I’m hoping this will be the first of many such sessions.

Chancellor Christ is a very humble person, but before we begin I’ll quickly brag for her: In addition to having been appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, she is a celebrated scholar of Victorian literature who has written two books and edited several others, including *The Norton Anthology of English Literature*. She served as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013, and before that was a professor of English and an administrator at Berkeley for more than three decades. She first arrived on campus in 1970. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I'm just here to facilitate; the chancellor will be responding to all questions herself. No one will be responding on her behalf. She’ll be happy to talk about whatever is on your mind - her vision for the university, your concerns about campus, questions about life in academia, what have you. I should caveat that she isn’t “in the weeds” on every development at Berkeley, so she may ask me to circle back with more information if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer a question.

She'll begin answering questions at **3 p.m. on Wednesday, October 10th**. Ask away!

Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/naI0An6](https://imgur.com/a/naI0An6)

**EDIT 10/11 4:30 p.m.:** Mike again - the chancellor needed to head to a meeting, but loved doing this and wanted to thank you all for the thoughtful questions. She tried to answer as many as she could, and I will follow up (on my Reddit account) on some of the ones that she didn't feel she had enough information to adequately respond to. She also hopes to come back tomorrow and answer a handful of new questions.

**EDIT 10/12 10:50 a.m.:** Ok, signing off for good. Thanks so much for tuning in, and the chancellor absolutely hopes to do this again.","Hi Chancellor Christ,

&#x200B;

I am curious about your views on how the growing financial divide between private and public schools will affect the future of higher education. This year we saw Berkeley lose the CRISPR patent case to the Broad Institute, which is jointly supported by Harvard and MIT. Many people have commented that this was a result of the enormous financial resources backing the Broad which enabled it to hire better legal representation. This loss will further the financial divide between the Broad and Berkeley, as Berkeley will lose out on licensing fees associated with the technology. It seems as though there is significant momentum against public schools with schools such as Berkeley losing out against private schools due to lack of resources and scarcity in public funding. Additionally Berkeley has had to consistently increase tuition year over year to continue operating. What specific actions are you taking, besides increasing tuition, to keep Berkeley competitive with private institutions that are operating with significantly more resources? What cost cutting measures are you considering to keep tuition affordable for everyone, and not just in-state students?

&#x200B;

One position commonly taken by past UC leadership has been to increase administrative positions such as Vice Chancellors, with the argument that such roles will help the UC compete with private institutions. However, those employees incur large financial costs with little impact on student experience. [From 2000 to 2015 the UC's administrative ranks increased by over 60%](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-uc-spending-20151011-story.html) while academic faculty remained relatively flat. As a student the largest issue I faced was outrageous class sizes, and I saw little direct impact from the Vice Chancellors. Have you considered reducing the size of the university administration to reduce costs?
Dear Chancellor Christ, 

First, thank you for doing this AMA. 

I'm a Berkeley alum that came out of L&S in 2011 and am now a professor elsewhere in the country. As a STEM undergraduate at Berkeley, I remember being frustrated by some of my professors that seemed to care more about their graduate students and research programs than the undergraduates they were lecturing. As a professor now, I understand why that was - at Berkeley, getting tenure has a much higher focus on the quality of your research output (papers and highly competitive grants) than your teaching - i.e, it wasn't that my professors were 'bad professors', it's just that their chance at job security was focused outside of teaching. 

I can't help but think that the undergraduate experience at Berkeley would be improved by having full-time, tenure-track faculty that are held to a 'teaching-focused' track. I emphasize 'full-time, tenure-track' because I think these faculty, devoted to the teaching and mentorship of undergraduates, deserve as much a chance of job-security (tenure) and full-time benefits as research-focused faculty. 

I've seen other large universities do this and have two types of tenure-track faculty: Teaching and Research-focused. It seems to be exceptionally helpful to their undergraduate population by having faculty that are more focused on learning outcomes and self-assessment acting as course coordinators. 

Is this something you think Berkeley might ever be interested in doing?  Or is there currently something like this there/in the works? 
Hi Chancellor Christ, thanks so much for doing this AMA. First off, thank you for everything you've done so far as our Chancellor—although we still have a ways to go with regards to housing, quality of student life, and safety, your efforts have not gone unnoticed. 

However, in the past few years it seems like growing class sizes and a lack of resources have worked against our quality of student life and overall reputation. How can Berkeley balance its role as a public university that by definition caters to a large student body with its role as a top-tier institution historically at the forefront of research and significant current events? 
Hello Chancellor Christ,

&nbsp;

We are three second-year students who recently moved to a house about a mile away from our classes and we have come to a realization over the past few months…

&nbsp;

**UC Berkeley needs a ski lift: BearLift™.**

&nbsp;


We have spent the past few months interested in solving Berkeley’s transportation problems and no matter what implementations we try, we always come back to ski lifts. Being built on a hill complicates this problem, as UC Berkeley’s campus isn’t friendly to active means of transportation. Even current attempts at mitigating these problems (buses / golf carts), though certainly well-intentioned, are impossible to scale to Berkeley’s ever-growing student population, not to mention environmentally detrimental.

&nbsp;


Our envisioned chair lift would be a quad-seater, going east to west, running both uphill and downhill during daylight hours. It would stop at various points along the route. (E.g. Crescent Lawn - Moffitt Library - Hearst Mining Circle - Memorial Stadium). Allow us to summarize some of the ways in which ski lifts would be an improvement to the status quo:

&nbsp;


* **Speed** - A detachable quad ski lift moves at about 1000 ft./minute, meaning it could clear the distance across campus (west to east) in only 4 minutes. In comparison, this same 4000-foot distance takes at least 15 minutes by foot, and is totally inaccessible on bike. The time required to cross campus means that Berkeley time (10 minutes) is insufficient for back-to-back classes, resulting in lost student and instructor productivity due to students leaving early and arriving late.

* **Reliability** - Ski lifts would be continuously running during operation hours, and there is virtually no waiting time before a chair arrives. A standard, detachable quad ski lift has a capacity of 40 people per minute. Our buses (BearTransit: Perimeter Line) can barely service 40 people per *half hour*, and run on such unpredictable schedules that push actual waiting times into impractical ranges.

* **Accessibility** - Our ski lift would reduce foot and bike traffic on campus, making it easier for *everyone* to get to their classes. As it stands, some DSP students have a hard time getting to their classes due to the response time and limitations of golf cart assistance. The chair lift would provide a convenient, judgment-free solution that simultaneously aids students with mobility challenges and clears Berkeley’s already congested walkways for all.

* **Productivity** - Taking passive transport allows for cognitive focus on activities that would not be possible with other forms of transport. For example, it is much safer to check your phone on the lift, rather than while walking where you endanger yourself and others around you (especially on an open campus where cars roam freely!). Not to mention, students and instructors alike would be more available to engage in more activities beneficial to the university if their time is not spent walking.

* **Energy Efficiency** - Our lift uses a surprisingly low amount of energy (200 kWh a day at most), certainly more clean than buses (especially if considering solar solutions). The moral benefit to the planet aside, this would allow Berkeley to be seen as a more green campus.

* **Campus Culture** - We see numerous intangible benefits for the University given our plan:
 * **Prestige** - The ski lift would dramatically increase our campus’ perceived uniqueness and appeal. It proves that we are a school willing to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems. The presence of the lift would certainly increase applicant numbers and yield rate.
 * **Campus Unity** - A visible, large-scale project so distinctly “Berkeley” in its innovative spirit would give students something to be proud of and generally increase campus morale.
 * **Residential Hall Camaraderie** - Due to the isolated nature of halls such as Foothill and Stern, potential and current residents are turned off by the perceived lack of student interaction and heightened inconvenience. This chair lift would help unify residential halls by removing the single biggest disadvantage to these halls.
 * **Dialogue** - While riding on a ski lift together, students from diverse backgrounds and interests have an unparalleled option to interact and converse in situations they otherwise may never have. By sharing a lift, we can increase rhetorical decency on campus (something currently misconstrued and needing repair).
 * **Donations** - In light of Berkeley’s controversial headlines in recent years, some alumni may be somewhat less motivated to go out of their way to donate to the university. Adding the lift as an initiative may reinvigorate these, and other, alumni to be excited about donating to a tangible cause.
 * **Listening to Students** - Taking on a project of this scale that was proposed by students to solve a unique Berkeley problem would also show to the world that UC Berkeley is an institution that will listen to students’ concerns and facilitate innovative solutions.

&nbsp;


We are excited about our idea, but are also keenly aware of some potential concerns. Given our backgrounds as engineering & business students, we have attempted to address most of these:

&nbsp;


* **Costs** - 
 * Given the secretive nature of the ski lift industry (anyone’s guess), please understand that the data provided in this section is empirical in nature with citations to ski lifts of similar size and design.
 * BearLift would cost anywhere between **$1 million - 3 million** in construction, based on the real costs of lifts of comparable size (almost completely mitigated by alumni donations)  
 * BearLift would consume approximately 100 kWH - 200 kWH running from 8 AM - 8 PM every day.
 * This translates to approximately **100-200 dollars per day** in electricity, based on our own PG&E statements
 * Compared to estimated daily costs of Bear Transit, the chair lift would be approximately similar in cost (not even accounting for the fact that the lift would require less employees)
* **Risks** - 
 * **General Liability** - The first thing an immature person would want to do on a ski lift would be to throw something off of it. This is easily solved by lowering the elevation of the lift to approximately 20 feet off the ground. This removes the anonymity that a higher lift would provide, essentially rendering the social relationship between rider and walker to that of two normal walkers.
 * **Safety** - While ski lifts are perceived as generally dangerous, this is actually a gross mischaracterization. You are more likely to die at each street crossing on the way to the ski lift than on the ski lift itself.

&nbsp;


We feel strongly that a chair lift across campus is the best solution to Berkeley’s current transportation woes. Any and all costs and risks are easily mitigated or outweighed by the benefits. We hope you would offer us the opportunity to present this to you in more detail at a later date, and because this is an AMA, our question to you is: 

&nbsp;


***When is Berkeley getting BearLift™?***

What's your view on recent enrollment increases imposed by the UC system?  I think it's an admirable mission to increase the number of students receiving a UC education, but it's clear that accomplishing that goal by increasing enrollment at Cal degrades our student experience by putting further strain on housing and course/major selection.
Do you have a plan to reverse the trend of declining state funding for the UCs? We've tried raising tuition and fees. We've tried taking more out-of-state and international students that pay more. We've turned away California residents that years ago would have had no problem gaining admission to a UC. I don't see any of the solutions we've tried as sustainable. It seems instead that the state has to once again prioritize funding a first-class education for its residents. But how will you persuade the state to do this and where exactly will the money come from?
Is the administration worried about the massive class sizes in CS courses, and whether it could impact the quality of education? Are there any plans to hire more professors in the department to decrease the sizes? I’d imagine it’s a logistical nightmare for a professor to deal with classes that have a over a thousand students. 
Referring to /u/StripedObservance, Underhill, Witter, and Maxwell Fields all have been prioritized towards athletic use over recreational students in the past decade, and there are courts in the RSF, built for general student use with student body money, which have been taken over by Athletics without paying for them for use by the basketball teams as practice facilities. I too would echo the question: how is the campus considering making sure that the general student body has enough space for recreation and exercise, and how is Athletics compensating Rec Sports for the facilities that it has taken control of?
Chancellor Christ,

I have three questions:

Are their any hints and sneak peeks we can have on the Long Term Development Plan for the campus that you can give us?  The next one should be coming out in 2020, and it would be interesting to hear about the capital projects, aside from the already announced housing, that the campus is interested in developing.

The excellence of the Berkeley campus has been built upon its independent faculty, many of whom are willing to take pay cuts to get a chance to have the academic and research freedom that the campus has traditionally offered.  However at present the campus is relying upon adjunct faculty as a cheap alternative to hiring professors who focus on teaching undergraduates.  This means that many undergraduates do not get to engage with the high calibre of faculty that Berkeley boasts, and simultaneously disenfranchises the majority of the instructors of undergraduates from department discussions and the Academic Senate.  What solutions to these inequities for adjunct faculty and undergraduates has the campus considered?

The campus has a wide disparity in the funding that each department has at its disposal.  Where many departments in the social sciences and humanities are scrambling for funding, other departments, such as those in the College of Engineering and the Business School, are well endowed by donations.  What is the campus doing to address these funding inequalities so that all educational experiences at the University of California are top notch and we have a unified campus instead of a silo-ed and balkanized community?

Thank you for taking your time with this medium to reach out to members of the University community.
Do you feel as though the UC system is too big to truly be effective in all departments? I've noticed throughout my attendance at UCB that the regular bureaucracy everyone is used to in any state system has been bolstered by underfunding, budget cuts, undertrained staff, restricted hours, etc. The financial aid office is a primary example of this. Is that something you see being corrected in the future?

&#x200B;

As someone who has fallen victim to the absolute circus that is the financial aid office, I am very curious if you see that as something that will see improvement in the future. 
Hi, Thank you so much for doing this AMA. 

&#x200B;

I think the most concerning questions like security or administrative questions are already asked by other people. So I am going to skip those. But here is one for you about personhood.

&#x200B;

I am currently a senior, applied math. I was transferred here a year ago from a community college in LA. I can't help but to notice how many people simply feel depressed and burnt out because of stress and low self-esteem. And it's not that they don't enjoy being in this school. They are just surrounded by people who they feel are so much better than them that they lost the motivation to try. And to be honest, I felt that way too. I understand how they feel because till now I still feel the same sometimes. What would you recommend to help people like me? Do you feel the same sometimes, where stress just worn you out and make you feel there is no point in trying? An existential crisis that makes you wonder why trying to make the world a better place is necessary, despite it being a choice? What motivates you to move forward every day?

&#x200B;

I am really grateful for you doing AMA. Thank you again. I feel like you are connecting to people at Berkeley. I am very glad. Hope you all the best.  
Hi Chancellor Christ, does the university have any plans for mitigating the threat from fraternities on campus? I am in greek life, but frankly it's appalling what they get away with. Last semester, Sigma Chi had 12 drugging/sexual assault accusations and they have not been at all penalized aside from social probation over the summer. In my time here alone, 2 different people have died at frats on campus and both still are active on campus, with Zete gaining their letters back this year although still unaffiliated with the university. Why is more not being done about this?

How do you plan to address faculty recruitment issues?  Specifically Berkeley cannot even match the salaries of top public schools like Michigan, and of course even if Berkeley matches dollar for dollar those other schools those other schools have the advantage of lower COLA.  When a top private wants the same candidate or wants to poach a professor, Berkeley often struggles to put out a counter that comes within 60% of the private.  Compounding this you have previously affordable faculty neighborhoods like Montclair now taking part in the housing boom and FRA and MOP aren't increasing fast enough to cover it.

We're at the point where I am hearing folks from the provost's office talking about no longer running national searches but instead targeting people who value public education, because Berkeley is just that uncompetitive with professor salaries.  So now we need to rely on willingness of the professor to be underpaid, the professor having a spouse in tech, etc fo recruit.
Now that Alta Bates hospital is closing, has the administration evaluated the possibility of building our own medical school? It can make money financially and help us to keep the premed talents at Berkeley.
Hi Chancellor,

How do you plan to address the ongoing issue with homeless people around campus? They're usually pretty harmless but I've been hearing increasing reports of assault and robbery, and I've definitely seen some weird incidents involving homeless exposing themselves in front of students. 
Housing costs in Berkeley have reached crisis levels. At the rate we're going, housing costs are going to climb higher than in-state tuition costs within a few years (current in-state tuition breaks down to \~$1200 per month, many students already spend this much or more on rent).

What is the university's plan to address this? I know multiple people who chose other UCs over Berkeley who specifically cite the housing issue as one of the reasons they went elsewhere. There's an increasing perception among both students and applicants that rent is going to continue to increase indefinitely, and this crisis has the potential to scare off a lot of talented students who would be an asset to our campus.
Thanks for the AMA, Chancellor. In recent years, our ranking and reputation has taken a slight hit, while UCLA has improved tremendously to the point where they are heralded as the best public school by several ranking systems(and I don't really care about rankings honestly; good for them). My questions is: given that we are very, very similar schools that face similar issues ( resources, class sizes, etc), what do you identify as their strengths, why have they been doing so well, and what can we learn from them, administratively and otherwise? Is it their better approach to mental health, housing, student life, etc?  Do sister UC campuses collaborate and meet with each other to discuss these things? Lastly, does it bother you that we don't have the undisputed title as no:1 public university and that California's brightest students who would be an asset to our campus, might more strongly consider ucla?

Thanks!

Does Berkeley have any plans to open a medical school? Every other large UC school has a large and profitable medical school. For example, Stanford's medical school last year made 300 million dollars in profit alone. I would also say that in Los Angeles and San Diego for example, different hospitals are sometimes literally across the street from each other and are still very successful. 

With health research funding the single largest type of federalreasearch funding, Berkeley is missing out on a lot of research money, and a lot of wealthy alumni who would directly get medical degrees here. In addition, the hospital three blocks from UC Berkeley is scheduled to close within ten years, which may allow the school to take it over if there is a desire to make it happen.

Hi big fan, why does the Korean American student association get 19k a year from ASUC to party? Thx
Chancellor Christ, thank you for doing this AMA. I'm now an alumnus of UC Berkeley and a current graduate student at Cornell. Is there anything you're doing to help alum feel more connected to and part of the campus? It just seems like Cornell does so much compared to what I saw at Berkeley. I think this is separate from fundraising and resources from/for alum, which both have been asked about and are good questions, too.

Miss my time at Berkeley :). Go Bears!
Berkeley granted both myself and my husband our PhDs. So why is it that fundraising solicitations with your name on them, from your office, address his to Dr. and mine to Ms.? This is infuriating and not the best approach to asking us to donate. Please (have your admin) fix your algorithms. 
How is the University planning to build housing in People’s Park? Also, what is the University doing about cleaning up south Berkeley. It is quite dangerous, and it appears that little funds go towards making it better.
Why did we spend almost half a billion dollars on a football stadium, paying like 18 million year in interest, when tuition costs and cost of living in the Berkeley area continues to rise? What are the plans to get out of this bad deal? Cal football isn’t even good and now other men’s teams are getting cut completely to try and salvage the difference.
Hi Chancellor Christ, thanks for doing this AMA.

One way Berkeley appears to be well behind many top private schools is in fund raising from our alumni and other sources. For instance, from a quick Google search it looks like we raised about half of what Stanford raised from their alumni last year, despite having *a lot* more alumni. Obviously more money is a good thing for Berkeley, especially given the school's financial woes. 

In the last couple years I've noticed the school has appeared to put more effort into raising from alumni. What steps have you taken to improve our fundraising ability, and what steps are you planning to take in the future to close the gap with comparable private schools? What is it exactly that makes private school fundraising so much more lucrative than it is at Berkeley, and how can we fix it? 
It is the perception of many of my peers that the administration has focused less on improving student instruction and facilities and more on initiatives that do not affect the lives of the majority of students, such as the creation of diversity and inclusion administrative positions, gender neutral restrooms, athletics, etc. While I do believe these are things that should be addressed, I also think that an emphasis on decreasing the student to professor ratio, especially in undergraduate lower division classes (how can over a thousand students be enrolled in one CS class for example?), as well as increasing the number of UGSIs and other student learning resources would be much more helpful. After all, no matter what race you are or where you're from, all students face common problems within the academic system. Where do you see the balance between spending large sums of money on political issues/ otherwise non-learning activities vs academic ones? 
Hello Chancellor,

What is your weekly workload? What are the main things you spend time on(on/off campus) I ask this question because I heard that even senators have hard time meeting and talking with you. As a student organization, we were planning to invite you to an event later on november but one of the senators told us that you are packed, you literally have no free time(she didn't even look at your calendar, how can she know?)
UC Berkeley has a reputation for grade deflation, especially in stem. Seeing that a significant amount of students want to go to graduate school, many of which admit based on GPA, is there anything being done to reduce Berkeley's grade deflation to make grading policies similar to other institutions? 
Considering [the fact that UCB was recently named the worst CA public school for black students,](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Worst-public-California-schools-black-students-Cal-13264172.php) what does the administration currently have planned in order to support the black community at Cal? Have there been any developments on the demands brought up during the protests a few years back? 

It seems kind of pitiful that UCB prides itself on being the #1 public university in the world, yet it continues to fail to meet the needs of ALL students. 
With the millions of dollars you give new PI's to start a new lab, why don't you have mandatory training/certification in how to run a lab?   
Not talking about the science aspect, but rather a PI is essentially running a business. When they mismanage their funding, they still have a job, but their postdocs are screwed, and may have their careers and lives ruined when they are let go.  
Since Berkeley has a business school, wouldn't developing a mandatory ""Business of running a science lab"" course pay off in the long term?

When tuition costs so much as well as regularly recieving large ammounts of funding from donations and other sources. Why do situations like people's park and the housing crisis exist? Wouldn't it benefit the university to prioritize cleaning up south side? If so when will this happen? South side in my opion taints Berkeley's image. Does Berkeley use part of the budget to better the community other than just on campus?

Hi Chancellor,

How are you planning to balance the needs of the public with the constraints of the resources we have? Specifically, I am referring to the skyrocketing rates of applications to the UCs, in tandem with our limited teaching resources and housing availability. Many freshman are taking classes where there is a 500-1000:1 student:faculty ratio (Bio, CS, Econ), creating a disconnect between professors and students that can be very important for some students. I've heard freshman housing isn't even guaranteed anymore (maybe Blackwell hall has changed this). 

Is there a direction you plan on moving Berkeley toward? Being more selective? Attempting to scale in face of NIMBYism? Another direction?

Thank you for speaking with the /r/berkeley community.
Hi Chancellor, 

How will you deal with a rising number of applicants to this school and a decreasing amount of land to create new housing on? At the same time, how will you also balance this with the upgrading of current dorms that break down consistently and otherwise do not compare to the newer housing? 
Hi Chancellor Christ, in your Campus Conversations speech in April you said that relations between employee unions and the university have been ""unnecessarily antagonistic"" in recent years. I am a union employee on campus. I appreciate that comment, and I agree. What can we do to change this?

Chancellor Christ,

At the [Berkeley Faculty Free Speech Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QVcYpuLrXg) about a year ago, you sat alongside Professor of Law, African American studies, and Ethnic Studies john a. powell [sic] as he compared physical violence to the kind of psychological injury caused by hateful speech. He went on to suggest that certain legal limitations on this type of speech are therefore necessary in order to protect people from injury. Dean Erwin Chemerinsky challenged powell's argument at that same event. 

What do you make of powell's outward opposition to the principles of legal free speech that you have championed as chancellor, particularly as they relate to college campuses?

And related to that question, if Milo Yiannopoulos or some other right-wring provocateur were to come speak on campus next week, what (if anything) would go differently? How would you address the campus community prior to the event knowing what you know now about how the February 1st, 2017 event transpired? 
As is plainly obvious, there is a large population of sqirrels on campus, the vast majority of which are non-native fox squirrels.  While seemingly cute and fluffy, they are still invasive rodents capable of doing serious damage.  Unfortunately, eradicating them is probably impossible, but it really seems to me that nothing is being done to control their population, especially given the rampant feeding of them that goes on.

What are your plans to deal with this furry menace?
Hello Chancellor Christ, I started Berkeley  this year as a freshman. Do you think the new goal to be a hispanic serving school will have impact on the admission of other ethnicities, specifically with Asian students? How  do you plan on doing so?

Based on your experiences at both a small private liberal arts college and a large public research university -- What can UCB staff and administration be doing better? What can we learn from how a smaller university is managed?
Hello Chancellor Christ,

Unlike other universities, UC Berkeley is known by so many aliases from (UC) Berkeley, California, Cal, to University of California. When our alumni travel overseas wearing Cal apparel, unfortunately no one in those countries knows what Cal means. Cal has very little meaning to people outside the Berkeley community. 

Do you think it would be better if UC Berkeley decided on a single name and stick with it?

Dear Chancellor Christ,

I am a relatively new librarian and moved to the Bay Area for my dream job at Berkeley. As you may be aware, the UC librarians' union (UC-AFT) is currently in contract negotiations, which are documented in [our union's blog](https://ucaftlibrarians.org). I have a couple of questions about issues that matter a lot not just to UC librarians, but staff across the university.

First, what role do you see for Berkeley in supporting living wages for librarians and other staff members across the university? Recruitment and retention are becoming increasingly difficult as librarian salaries have fallen far behind what they were 20 or 30 years ago, adjusted for inflation. Combined with the dramatic increase in the cost of living in the Bay Area, this has made it virtually impossible for newer librarians to imagine a stable financial life while working at Berkeley (see [this Daily Cal op-ed](http://www.dailycal.org/2018/08/28/hardly-living-uc-librarian-salary-berkeley/) from August 28 of this year for more details of what campus librarians are experiencing). What is your view on supporting the people who work to make the university work? How are you committed to showing that the university values its staff?

Second, do you believe that is important for academic workers to have academic freedom in their work? Librarians at UC Berkeley are academic staff. In addition to the important and complex work we do managing the library collections, supporting research, and working with students, we also are evaluated in part on our scholarly contributions. How is academic freedom ""not a good fit"" for us and other academic workers, as was stated by the UC Bargaining Team during our contract negotiations? What is your response [to the letter jointly issued in Support of Librarian Academic Freedom](https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/petition-in-support-of-uc-librarians-and-academic-freedom.html) by the California Conference of the American Association of University Professors (CA-AAUP) and the Council of University of California Faculty Associations (CUCFA), which has been signed to-date by nearly 2,000 petitioners, including many members of the Cal community?

What does the future of undergraduate housing look like at Berkeley?
Hi Chancellor Christ!

What hidden spot on campus is your favorite?
Hey Chancellor Christ,

Have you had boba? If so, what’s your favorite place?
Hi Chancellor, can we switch the lampost banners placement around campus? I like seeing new ones but at this point I've seen all the ones in the places I regularly walk.
Thanks for the AMA, Chancellor. My questions is regarding Berkeley's 10 year progress plan released last semester. One of the major issues at Cal is the large student population that makes everything overcrowded and/or inaccessible. This includes classes, professor office hours, gyms, student housing and many other things. Given, this, shouldn't there be a focus on decreasing student enrollment and class sizes, at least little by little? University of Virginia, for example, despite being a top notch public school has drastically smaller student body that makes the student experience so much more friendly and accessible. Obviously California is a much more populous state so we cant lower enrollment too much, but even small reductions, one incoming year at a time, would be beneficial?

Instead, the 10 year progress plan recommended \*accepting and enrolling more students\* as one of its goals. To me, this is utterly ridiculous and indefensible. This would make Berkeley less accessible, by reducing access to the opportunities, education and housing we deserve. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks, and have a great day!
Hi Chancellor!

As a Berkeley student, I can't think of anyone more qualified than Guy Fieri to give the commencement speech for the Spring graduation ceremony. It would be an honor to have the culinary genius step foot on our campus. Please, do you think you could ask him?
Hello Chancellor Christ,

As a Cal alum, I'm extremely proud of our institution (Go Bears!!). But one issue that pains me is that we used to be the bastion of free speech. We started the free speech movement. And last couple of years we have become hostile towards the idea of any speech that we don't like is hate speech hence we shouldn't entertain it on our campus.  It was recently on display in 2017 during lot of alt-righters tried to come to Berkeley (in my opinion deliberately to provoke). I know that you have taken strong stand over free speech legacy of Berkeley. Two questions - 

&#x200B;

How do you feel our current climate of university campuses getting extremely sensitive towards certain type of speech? We have trigger warnings, safe spaces and all sorts of things that prevents students from exposing to different ideas. 

&#x200B;

Why can't we (I mean Cal) take a lead on **""campus free speech movement""** again where students are expected to expose to different ideas and ideologies and choose what is the most rational/logical for them? 

&#x200B;

As one of our favorite Physics professors at Cal [Prof. Richard Muller beautifully argued, we should revert back to the policy](http://qr.ae/TUGWcb) of 1960s of "" *attend-listen-embarrass"",* which is effective and avoids the danger of a small group of extremists leveraging your disagreement with the speaker for their own violent ends. 

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on this?

I have heard that Upper Hearst parking garage will be closing and no new parking is intended to replace it. In the past, campus has suggested lifestyle changes in response to parking shortages. Is this sufficient? How will faculty, students, and staff be affected?
Chancellor Christ,

Thank you for taking time out of your life to come answer our questions. I am aware that this is not a concern for the immediate future and that there are bigger things on this university's plate, but are there any medium-to-long-term plans to replace Evans Hall? That place is seriously soul-sucking. I don't want students in 2040 to have to trudge into that building feeling about as excited as the building looks.

Is there going to be better resources for alumni?
Hi Chancellor Christ, 

I would like to first thank you for taking the time for this AMA. Many alums have concerns but do not have the time available to take up the opportunity to speak with you personally. I believe that you've done a great job getting the school fiscally responsible again.

Cal has been a hot bed for controversy in the past few years, becoming a wrestling ring for both sides of the political aisle. Alums from fresh grads to industry titans and billionaires have been fiercely defending Cal in the shadows. The prestigious schools/majors at Cal are typically apolitical and I believe I can speak for me and my peers that we do not enjoy the publicity of being caught in the cross fire with students and their college experiences/education to be collateral damage as a result. For all the top ranked programs helping the school hang on by a thread to be even considered for being the best university in the country, all this press coverage has been nothing but a nuisance.

While things have quiet down, I found that the PR dept of the school seemed to welcome any attention it can garner. Such behavior is of huge concern to many of us who have invested in the well being of the school. It has systematically shot itself in the foot using any controversy it can find as ammo. When free speech was FOTM, the efforts and attempts to stay relevant reminded me of a sad loveless child. When the current admin in the oval supported the investigation on college admission processes, your Aug 20th address stated your intentions for Cal to become a HSI. Many articles published by Cal are rooted in research and of great importance but are cheapened by being presented in politically motivated/agenda driven ways. These all have resulted in a broad brush labeling anything associated with the school as being anything but credible and unbiased. The briefest hesitation by apolitical firms during the hiring process turns a Cal degree from asset to liability. Im not convinced that the school fully grasps the severity of its dire public image. A high school sophomore wannabe public image consultant in his grandpa's suit couldn't have done much worse. (if the ""sex on tuesday"" column on dailycal was sent to space with the falcon 9 launch yesterday, no alien life in the right mind would consider colonizing earth)

I read the article you wrote about Chang-Lin Tien and I urge you to take note of the mistakes the school has made over the past decades in terms of settings goals since that era, leaving the school in the sad state it is in both financially and prestige. Its always less complicated and more feasible to be a master of one than a master of none. It is not unfathomable for Trump to serve a second term. What I would like to know on behalf of many alums is how would the school maneuver moving forward in this political climate to prevent a target from being painted on our backs, while focusing on its commitments as a world class education/research facility, so we would feel less reserved in our continued financial support for the school?

&#x200B;

P.S  Cal has probably the most polarized rankings. It has a lengthy list of programs ranked top 5 nationally but the school is #22 overall and #2 public school? Any licensed doctor would prescribe polyethylene glycol 3350.  

&#x200B;
UC has recently master-leased 4 new residential buildings for student housing.  Under this arrangement, as a sovereign, UC pays no ad valorem property taxes or business license fees, depriving the City of the revenue. 

In announcing the master-lease on 2711 Shattuck, UC stated the rent would be  $2,180 for the 300 SF ($7.26 per month) micro units where the occupant sleeps on the dining table.   

I conclude that the UC created our local housing crisis to generate funds for UC pensions, and are now trying to take advantage of the situation by gouging students for rent.  Is that correct?

Hello Chancellor, I have a question about sports. A lot of students and Bay Area natives feel like Cal is a tier below other California schools when it comes to sports, which makes us look inferior in many ways. And with Stanford’s recent success we can no longer claim the academic crutch.  
  
What if anything is being done to address this problem? In most major sports Cal has been embarrassed by Stanford (who has a historic long winning streak against Cal right now), USC, and UCLA for most of the last decade. 
Dear Chancellor, thank you for doing AMA.

I'm very impressed with the work you've been doing in your short time as Chancellor to promote equal opportunity for all applicants and students. The primary question I had was one that's bothered me since I was an undergraduate many years ago. I was wondering whether you'd considered the infestation of slawbunnies on campus, and whether there'd be any action taken to ensure that they no longer affect student life. Feel free to ask any follow up questions, and I'm very excited about where this university is headed!
Dear Chancellor, 

Berkeley has a long tradition of cultivating skilled, avant-garde artists. For example, we have the Sex on Tuesday columnists who provide great material to all the men of this school – weekly too! With the recent emphasis on STEM not only culturally but through government funding, and Berkeley’s history and prestige as a research institution, I’d like to inquire into the role you believe the arts play at Berkeley and schooling in general, and what specific actions you are taking to support art programs. btw are you single?

How do you feel about the current political climate? Is our President doing anything wrong or right? Do you agree with anything he says or has done? 
Any reaction to the negative coverage on Real Sports this week?
Will Berkeley change the current EE-CS Dept policy of enrolling 1,700 students in there required intro course sequence when the Dept can only graduate~500?

Other schools have addressed the problem of capacity constraints in a more up-front manner. Ex: Carnegie Mellon only admits the number of freshmen into their CS program that they can graduate. U.W-Seattle limits initial admission into their engineering school to allow guaranteed choice of major to those who get in initially....those wishing to transfer in as sophmores must then meet a high GPA filter.

Capacity constraints applied AFTER admission is a growing problem. What is Berkeley's plan to address this issue?
Are your aware of the USC study that found UC Berkeley among the worse college in California for black students and the absolute worse UC for black students? What are your thoughts? What are your plans to increase the 1.9% of black students on campus? (Not including athletic recruitment) 
Chancellor, my question is plain and simple: Why can’t average Californians get into Berkeley and what is your plan to increase that demographics enrollment count in the future?

Edit: What I meant was people with 4.0s now can’t even get into a good UC anymore. That to me, is pathetic. I understand standards needing to go up, but the UC system is supposed to be a public institution, not an Ivy League. I just think the system needs to reassess itself and try to find a way not to be so exclusive when it is, in the end, a public institution.
Hello chancellor,

As you are aware, a new major called Data Science just got introduced to L&S. This is a hinderance for a lot of people in CoE who want to double major in it, since they have to take complete the college requirements of L&S as well. Is there a chance it'll get introduced in CoE before current sophomores graduate?
Thank you for the question. I feel the need to quickly correct some information in it – UC has increased in-state tuition only once in the last eight years.  In fact, tuition actually decreased this year!  Also, as you may or may not know, Berkeley does not control our tuition - it is determined at the UC system level (and, increasingly, through negotiation with the state).

Second, senior leadership salaries - even broadly defined - still take up less than 2% of our campus salary pool.  Beyond that, administrative headcount has been decreasing steadily since 2014.  Staff increases have occurred, though, and for many reasons - only some having to do with helping us compete with what private colleges are offering.  We’ve seen increased demand for staff services within financial aid, career services, admissions/recruitment, academic counseling, UCPD - all of which require staff growth at lower levels and at managerial levels.  Other growth has had to do with issues like compliance with new federal regulations.  The campus also had a hiring bump for the implementation of recent major IT programs.

But the thrust of your question has to do with whether there is a widening gap between public and private institutions, and what we can do about it.  First, it’s important to understand that enormous stratification in the private college/university market.  There are some very wealthy private schools--Harvard, Stanford--, but others that struggle far more than Berkeley.  As many of you know, there has been a huge shift in the responsibility for funding the University of California over the past several decades--from the state, which funded UC so well that tuition and fees were very low to individual students and their families.  What we need to do is continue to lobby the state energetically for more money (students were an enormous help last spring) as well as multiply and diversify our sources of revenue.  We’re working on six--non-degree enrollment (summer session and University Extension), self-supporting degree programs, monetization of intellectual property, monetization of real estate, increased contract and grant activity, and, of course, philanthropy.
Actually, a plan like that is in the works, and a number of departments are hiring more lecturers with security of employment, focused principally on teaching.  However, I believe we should expect excellent teaching from all faculty on both the undergraduate and graduate level.
Simply put, we have to raise more money.  We have to grow philanthropy very significantly, and use it for things like faculty positions and programs that enhance student experience.  We’re about to launch a comprehensive fund-raising campaign in a little more than a year that will have the student experience at its core.
A very well thought out proposal!  However, I am concerned some might see it as the lazy river at LSU - an amenity that college students don't really need.

And those taking the ski lift won't get their steps in!
If I ever found a unicorn startup, I'll make this happen.
Hurrah! Hurrah! 
omg I've actually wished for a campus ski lift multiple times (& am a dsp student, but like you mentioned, so many access barriers surrounding the golf carts including plain old social judgment or anxiety). glad I'm not the only one lmao.

too bad carol doesn't give a shit about us. Old thread but I came to the sub to see what people are saying about the smoke.
I believe that we shouldn’t agree to increase the size of our student body unless we get adequate funding to pay for the increased resources necessary to provide an excellent education and educational experience for those students.
We did have some success this year - in lieu of a tuition increase, the legislature decided to increase UC’s funding by nearly $347 million this year. Berkeley also received 25 million in one-time funding as recognition of our work to reduce our deficit. This was largely the result of an incredible effort on behalf of students, staff, faculty, and alumni who lobbied Gov. Brown and legislators for additional funding for UC.

It’s important to recognize that reversing this trend has to be a partnership--between the legislature, the governor, and the campuses.  I hope that, with a new governor, and with our work with the legislature, the foundation for such a partnership will be built.
This is an issue the campus is well aware of.  Computer science as a whole has far too few faculty to meet student demand.  Classes are too large, departmental teaching load is high, and too many students are turned away from the CS major each year. 

The creation of Data Science courses, including the very successful Data 8 class as an entry point all the way through the Data Science major, is meant in part to provide a parallel path for students.  Many will still want the CS path, but some will prefer the connections to problems found in the Data Science sequence.  

I know it is not ideal, but I am so thankful for the those in CS (and now, for Data 8 the Statistics and Data Sciences units) who are putting effort into doing it well.  GSIs and undergrad tutors work together to reach all the students.  The very largest courses - CS 61A, CS 61B, and Data 8 - have 1200+ students in them per semester and receive higher teaching ratings now than ever.  The faculty who teach them regularly love to do so.  So as we work on this issue we have determined it is better to make these large intro courses available than to arbitrarily limit them and keep students who want to take them out.
Hi - the chancellor asked me to pull together some information for you on this:

There is absolutely the goal of a partnership here between Athletics, club sports, and the student body at large. The vast majority of fields managed by Athletics (all except one) are multi-use and shared with Rec Sports and the student body.  Goldman Field is a competition grass field, so it’s necessary to keep it more exclusive in order to meet NCAA requirements - while the track is open for Rec Sports and public use, the field is not.

Golden Bear Soccer Field is maintained by Athletics, but is shared with Rec Sports programming, most notably the entire summer for youth camps. Maxwell Family Field, Memorial Stadium, Witter Rugby Field and Underhill Field are used every day by Athletics programs, intramurals and club sports. Each field is booked through Rec Sports from 6-10 pm six nights per week during the fall and spring semesters for non-Athletics programming. Over the last year and a half, Athletics has also provided at least four hours per day five days a week of additional open rec time on Maxwell Field.

The annual cost to properly maintain each of these facilities is $4-5 million, all covered by Athletics although the fields are shared among many users. The total does not include the cost to replace turf on an escalated time frame due to the constant use each of these fields receives.

Regarding the Gold Gym in the RSF, men's and women's basketball use the space for limited hours in the afternoon for practice. At all other times, the Gold Gym is available for open rec use. Athletics also recently spent $10,000 to refinish the floor, and it has additionally branded and updated the walls and padding in the last few years.
I don’t think there will be any big surprises in the update to our long range development plan.  Our guiding principle is to maximize space for student housing on all available land.

We have plans to raise funds for 100 new faculty positions so that we can reduce the student/faculty ratio and give more students access to the high caliber of faculty for which Berkeley is famous (but I want to add that many of our lecturers are equally outstanding.

In regard to your third question, we are currently working on an ambitious financial reform project that would make funding proportional to workload.  
Size certainly creates some challenges, but I believe the state of California has benefitted from the size of the UC system and its foundational belief that there is not one flagship campus and other lesser campuses but ten campuses that uniformly aspire to excellence.
I think you’ve raised one of the toughest problems at Berkeley.  Students come here having competed hard and successfully in high school, or community college, and when they get here, they can’t stop looking over their shoulders at the student next to them, or behind them, and feeling they need to compete.  It creates incredible stress.  I think you have to always keep in your mind that this place exists for you, that you should take what you want from it.  One of the most valuable strengths in life is resilience--being able to bounce back from stress.  And I try to cultivate the capacity of being easily pleased and to find a moment of Zen every day.  

I am not familiar with the specifics of the cases you raise, but I can say that the safety and wellness of our students are absolute priorities.  I will discuss this with Sharon Inkelas, my faculty advisor on SVSH issues.

Our LEAD Center does provide trainings to all recognized chapters on subjects like alcohol and sexual assault.  The PATH to Care office is building curriculum to ensure these educational sessions take place and are effective.  In addition, GASA, Greek Against Sexual Assault — a student organization — has taken a lead role in educating the community.
That’s not my sense of how faculty recruitment and retention are going.  If we don’t get our first choice in a search, we repeat the search.  In most searches we are successful because people really want to be at Berkeley.  And we retain about 80% of our faculty who get outside offers from other universities.  We effectively match salaries, but the cost of housing is a challeng
No, a medical school for Berkeley is not in the cards.  We are trying to build an even closer relationship with UCSF, and improve our pre-med program.
Homeless people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, just as all people are.  They also must be accountable to our laws; our campus police stand ready to act appropriately in any case of assault, robbery, or indecent exposure.
I’ve made a commitment to double the number of beds in our housing system in the next ten years.  I agree that the expense and scarcity of housing is the most significant long term threat to Berkeley’s excellence.  We will use every available piece of land we have for housing.
You’ve hit upon a soap box issue for me.  In order to market themselves, ratings organizations (like US News and World Report) change their algorithm every year to create artificial volatility in the rankings.  (Anyone who works in colleges and universities know how long change takes in these large, complex institutions.)  So rankings always depend on what you measure, what the formula is.  Furthermore, it is really an illusion to imagine you can create an accurate ordinal ranking of universities, rather like sports teams.  So my advice is not to pay any attention to the rankings.

The UC campuses spend a great deal of time talking to each other, and learning from each other.
>Why does the administration keep defending the new meal plans? Only 12 meals/week and we don't even get to keep them after the week ends? If I even want 2 meals/day I have to eat somewhere else twice a week because I don't have enough swipes for 2 meals/day in the dining halls. If we want to use ""flex dollars"", we'll be all out pretty quickly because meals are so expensive with flex. The fact that we aren't allowed to take food out of the dining halls is a mess, too. Some of us cannot afford the time to eat in the dining halls. Why on earth was this considered to be an ""upgrade"" from the old meal plans? I find myself worrying about food even more than before because of these new plans.

Not to mention how bad the food is at late night compared to previous semesters. Late nights used to be full of people and be lively places to hang out and eat with friends. Now they're mostly empty and feel like a library. The food isn't made fresh for you anymore but its just taken out of a heating shelf now.
Hey there - the chancellor asked me to get in touch with folks from  student affairs/Cal Dining and to respond to you. Here are their notes. I hope this helps.

>Why does the administration keep defending the new meal plans? Only 12 meals/week and we don't even get to keep them after the week ends? If I even want 2 meals/day I have to eat somewhere else twice a week because I don't have enough swipes for 2 meals/day in the dining halls. If we want to use ""flex dollars"", we'll be all out pretty quickly because meals are so expensive with flex. 

We made adjustments to our meal plan in part due to evidence that these changes will help alleviate food insecurity on campus. The decision was also made to be more aligned with the food services other UC campuses offer. 

The plan now allows for 12 meals whereas the old plan was about 10. Our hope in Cal Dining is to improve access to nutritional food options and increase the number of meals within the base plan. 12 meals was the target in order to increase the accessibility of food from the previous base plan while still keeping associated operating costs of the increase manageable.

Once a student buys a Meal Plan, they can add flex dollars anytime. Flex dollars roll over from Fall to Spring (or year to year). This is in contrast to the previous “meal points” system that would only permit up to 100 points to roll over. 

Swipes are intended to be used by students on a daily basis, and to ideally be used to completion, ensuring they have nutritious meals every day. For the Blue Meal Plan (that is included in housing contracts) our system of “swipes per week” encourages students to utilize our all-you-care-to-eat operations that provide the most value in terms of food options and nutrition. This is part of our campus efforts to support students and reduce food insecurity, as students will have food available on a weekly basis. (For historical background: in the past, some students would use all of their points very quickly at the beginning of a semester, and thus face food insecurity later in the academic year.) 

>The fact that we aren't allowed to take food out of the dining halls is a mess, too. Some of us cannot afford the time to eat in the dining halls. 

It is true that all dining commons (Cafe 3, Crossroads, Clark Kerr, Foothill) are now eat-in only. We have discontinued the take-out options for these locations, as the new model allows students to come and go as they please. Note that our new Meal Plan system reduces food and solid waste, while encouraging our residents to build connections and communities with their fellow students. Also, as noted, the plan now allows for 12 meals (whereas the old plan was about 10) - this help alleviate food insecurity on campus. 

Students who need quick/to-go options are encouraged to check out the options available at other Cal Dining’s facilities. Each resident dining common offers to-go options in their convenience stores (Bear Market, Cub Market, The Den, and CKCub). We also offer restaurants on campus including The Golden Bear Café, brown’s, Common Grounds, The Terrace, and The Pro Shop.

>Why on earth was this considered to be an ""upgrade"" from the old meal plans? I find myself worrying about food even more than before because of these new plans.

Again, our hope in Cal Dining is to improve access to nutritional food options and increase the number of meals within the base plan.

If you’re concerned about food security, please be aware the University offers several resources specific to food security, including: financial aid and counseling; financial literacy workshops; the Food Assistance Program; and emergency food resources like the UC Berkeley Food Pantry and the Bear Pantry. If you need assistance, we encourage you to contact Cal Student Central as soon as possible to discuss additional funding options - we work with students to help find them as many solutions as possible. 
The Chancellor answered this question in response to another user. Please [click on this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/e7jh0i5/?context=3) for the answer. 
At Smith, I saw what truly excellent, student-centered undergraduate education looked like.  I also experienced and learned from a very successful fund raising program, and came to understand many of the ways in which private colleges and universities work.
A lot of my job is about narratives--telling the story of Cal in particular contexts.  My training as a literature professor has really helped me do that.  In addition, my job involves a lot of writing, and critical reading of texts--the foundation of a life in English!
We have a plan to raise money to add 100 faculty positions; we’ve already reduced the administrative staff by 500 positions, and are working particularly in reducing assistant and associate vice chancellor titles.
You’ll have to ask the ASUC.  Berkeley’s student government is almost entirely independent of the university – they are a separate nonprofit 501(c)(3).  While the administration of course partners with them and offers counsel and guidance, ASUC priorities or funding allocations are their purview.

We’ve just decided to build an in-house alumni engagement program.  Essentially, in the past, we’ve left this to the California Alumni Association.  We will take lots of lessons from privates like Cornell in building our own program.
I am sorry that this is happening. I will refer the concern to our development office.
You should update your information in CADS.  This is where the information comes from.
The University wants to use about a quarter of People’s Park to build long-term housing for the homeless (about 100-125 beds) with services located in the building, a quarter of the site for a park and a memorial, and half the site for student housing (600-1000 beds).  I believe that we have a responsibility to work with the city in helping find and provide housing for the homeless.  It is my hope that changing the use of People’s Park will help improve safety in south Berkeley.
The decision about the football stadium was made before my watch; it was driven largely by seismic issues (the football stadium is on the Hayward fault, and its seismic condition was very poor), but it’s true that the campus built a more elaborate structure than simple seismic safety would have required.  However, it’s not possible to get out of this deal, whatever your views are about it.  There’s not much of a market for football stadiums.  We don’t contemplate cutting any men’s teams at this point.
Men’s football makes the school tons of money every year and they probably expect to end up with a return on their investment in the long term.  That’s how I understand it, at least.
Berkeley is actually a bit of a Johnny-come-lately to the fund-raising business.  Our first comprehensive fund-raising campaign for the campus was not until the late 1980’s.  That said, we’ve ramped up our fund-raising significantly.  Last year we have a record year; we raised $569 million dollars, more than $90 million more than our past record.  We’ve increased our campus investment in development, and we are creating greater integration in our fund-raising program
I think the investments that we’ve made in increasing GIS and lecturer funding (which we’ve increased every year) is less visible than some of the investments we’ve made in issues with higher political profiles.  That said, my highest priority for our up-coming fund raising campaign is to increase the size of the faculty by 100 positions, thereby decreasing the student/faculty ratio.  
> I work every day, all day, and have events most evenings.  I spend time off campus meeting with alums and donors, and with various meetings connected to the University of California system (Regents meetings, Counsel of Chancellors meetings).  On campus, I spend time in meetings--with members of my senior administration, with faculty, with students.  My schedule is planned very far in advance, so one of the the frustrating parts of my job is that I can’t be as spontaneous as I would like.  However, I love getting student invitations, so you should send it--the earlier the better.
This is an issue that the registrar’s office and ASUC have jointly been looking into.  The campus recently made an effort to make more information available so that students could demonstrate to prospective employers and graduate admissions committees where their GPA stands with respect to campus averages.  The ASUC AAVP and our registrar are exploring adding this context to official transcripts.
It's important to note that Berkeley doesn't practice grade deflation; it's more that Berkeley hasn't practiced grade inflation nearly as much as other schools. Average grades are still way higher here than they used to be, just the increase isn't as much here as everywehere else
This report brings up a concern that is very important to me and will continue to be a priority of my administration.  As you may know, we began the African American Initiative to address the under-representation and the experiences of the black community on campus.  This entails a scholarship for black students and other efforts including increasing the number of black faculty and staff members.  In 2017 the Fannie Lou Hamer Resource Center was set up to provide support to help ensure the success of black students.  The initiative is in the emerging stages but is already beginning to show progress.  And, our graduation rates for freshman entrants have been improving. 

Also, I should say that Berkeley scored the lowest of the UCs on the overall equity score - not the lowest of any California public school. We also had some issues with the methodology - the category for black students does not count black-Latinx students, nor does it count multiracial students who are of African descent. Graduation rates only show that of 4-year students, not transfers, where we do much better.

That all said, we can and must do better.  It’s a very high priority for me.
Berkeley exists in an urban area in which there are large differences in wealth.  There is also a housing crisis that affects the whole Bay area.  I’ve committed to doubling the capacity of our housing system over the next ten years, and to developing People’s Park.  When the Park changes, I believe safety on the south side will improve.  We do invest in the community and in the park presently.  For example, we have hired a social worker whose job is to work with the homeless in the park.
There are so many great restaurants in Berkeley, that’s a hard question to answer!  I love LaLime’s for an elegant meal, and Kamodo Sushi for, well, sushi.
I would suggest spending more time talking respectfully with each other, getting to know each other.  Of course, we can’t bargain contract issues on the campuses (or even discuss them, really), but we can create stronger and friendlier relationships.
Cheeseboard.
I think john powell argued, on that panel, that he wanted to see the law change, which is, of course, not in Berkeley’s power.  I myself have a more libertarian view of free speech than John does, although I certainly respect (and have thought hard about) his opinion.

Things did go differently when Milo Yiannopoulos came back to campus about a year ago.  We learned from the February 2017 event, and did things very differently.  The event fizzled, and there was no riot.  Milo himself was on campus for about 15 minutes, observed by a crowd of 50. 
We know this is a major issue.  Students report that their number one health concern is stress and mental health.  Counseling and Psychological Services reported an 18% increase in students seeking services in the fall of 2017 (compared to fall of 2016) and something like a 40% increase in counseling utilization over the past five years.

University Health Services recently increased resources related to student mental health, introducing more Behavioral Health Providers and establishing ten satellite locations throughout campus, including in the residence halls. There is also a web site in the works to help students understand and access available resources.

Students have taken this upon themselves as well through the Wellness Fee and the many initiatives that it funds.
Smaller places are MUCH less bureaucratic, and, in my experience, more efficient.  We can learn to simplify our work flows and become more decisive and strategic.
Berkeley is the proper academic branding and Cal and California come up primarily in athletic contexts. There's already been a lot of thought put into this, and you might enjoy checking out the following link to branding resources, it's fascinating in my opinion.[https://brand.berkeley.edu/brand/](https://brand.berkeley.edu/brand/)

In the brand guidelines, starting in around page 38, the rules become pretty clear.

>Berkeley is the academic expression of our brand and is used by colleges, schools and departments in official communications. Cal is the social expression and pet name for Berkeley. It is used by Cal Athletics, Cal Alumni Association and by development, student organizations and licensed products. We know that Cal is a cherished symbol of Berkeley. Our recommendation is to use Berkeley in academic contexts and Cal in athletic contexts. It should remain clear that the preferred name of the university is Berkeley

My favorite author is George Eliot (Virginia Woolf is a close second).  The best book I’ve read lately is Go, Went, Gone by Jenny Erpenbeck--a really moving novel about refugees in Berlin.
Soft, always.
LAMP
The fact that we are a very complex, decentralized, bureaucratic institution.  It’s like herding cats!
The campus is aware of the group and its presentation of the experience of students, and how it reflects on the campus, that much I can tell you with certainty.

I've seen some issues that have surfaced from that group before (housing, grade deflation, and quality of undergraduate life, student mental health, and alumni relations/donations) that have been given attention in this thread by people with questions and have been given answers. 
I’ve known Henry Yang for decades; he was chancellor at Santa Barbara when I was provost at Berkeley in the 1990’s.  I have a very good relationship with him.
There was a part of the plan at 2000 to knock it down and replace it with two lower pavilion buildings, but that was in the works before the dot com boom busted and the great recession hit, leading to much less funding being available.  So in theory the University would like to see it go, but its on the backburner- as Chancellor Christ has said, student housing is the priority at present (and rightly so, given the current housing crisis they are facing). 
Money?
I often ask audiences how many come from “mixed” political families (both Republicans and Democrats).  I come from such a family, and think it is essential to be able to speak civilly across difference, treating others’ opinions with respect.
Garden Village (2201 Dwight Way) paid almost half a million dollars in property taxes last year.  Their property tax bill for the coming year is  $454,360.02 .

How can you choose just one quirky thing about Berkeley, the place where people always ask, “How Berkeley can you be?”  I suppose the quirkiest perk of attending Cal is its location in Berkeley.

I first would like to push back against your implication that all the UC’s aren’t good universities.  They are, and if you meet the eligibility standards, you are guaranteed admission to a UC.  That said, there is a simple issue of capacity at Berkeley.  We’ve grown 10,000 students since 2002 (we used to be about 30,000 students, and now are 41,000 students).  There’s a real question of whether Berkeley could get much bigger and maintain its quality.  Finally, we have about 100,000 applications.  Even if we grew, say, by 10,000 students, there would still be a lot of disappointed applicants.

Hello,

As a follow-up on this even though it's an old thread. I am a self-learner who is utilizing Berkeley's course materials that have been made available online for free. I am *incredibly* thankful to have these available and am wondering what can I do to show my appreciation?

I not only want to make sure current efforts are supported but would love to see them enhanced even further.

It makes sense that certain CS programs are available over web, such as what are so far great courses 61A and 61B, but I would love to study other programs and courses eventually as well *to the same extent* that 61A and 61B have been made available.

There are many lectures available online but it is remarkable to see certain courses entirely available (lectures, reading assignments, auto-grading, notes, homework, labs, etc.) and not just dated lectures.

At the same time, I realize I'm pulling from resources the UC system is (and other top universities are) making available to me even though I'm a thousand miles away. Is there anything I can do to show my support?
Has it been considered to move Computer Science to the Engineering school and change EECS requirements so it actually requires EE (as it stands CS and EECS students take the same number of EE classes). That way the University could control the number of people in the CS program.
Thank you for this information, but it in many ways helps to describe the current state of affairs, but does not speak to whether anything will be done to make things better.  Since Maxwell Field was taken for the single use of one Athletic sport (football), it has led to a displacement of students who used to regularly use the field.  Intramural and club use are pushed later and later into the evenings, impacting the ability of students to participate and use the fields and keep their academic commitments.  The loss of access to these fields, and the fact that North Field (purview of ROTC) and the forever in limbo West Field (forever an Annex of temporary buildings now) are not available for student use concerns me.  

There used to be many more fields and many more hours of scheduling available when the campus population was smaller.  Seeing that there was not enough supply for the ever increasing demand for weight rooms, the campus expanded use of the gym at Memorial Stadium to student use as our campus had grown past even the capacities of the (relatively) recent addition of the RSF to campus.  What is the campus doing to alleviate the already impacted fields we have, and to restore fields (Maxwell, West, and North Fields) for student use?
> they can’t stop looking over their shoulders at the student next to them, or behind them, and feeling they need to compete

Does administration view this as a problem they can fix? In many majors classes are graded on a preset curve where your standing in the class and final letter grade isn't determined by the percentage you earn on exams and assignments but rather by the # of standard deviations you are above or below the mean. How could a student be expected to not compare themselves to other students in their class when those other students are defining the grade they get in a class as much as the individual student.
Sexual assault training doesn’t do anything for assaults that have already happened, and they obviously don’t prevent those types of frat guys from doing it. 
So you will address housing how?

> my advice is not to pay any attention to the rankings

Hi Chancellor Christ, I know this would be difficult to simulate, but I would encourage you to try to replicate the experience of a senior in high school (or transfer student) applying to our University, researching online, taking campus tours, et cetera. There are so many promotional materials a prospective student is barraged with about being the number one public university to the point where the over saturation is become a meme. 

I'm curious if you weren't aware of this or if you actually believe we shouldn't pay attention to rankings how you plan to change the University from a advertising perspective.

How often _are_ swipes ""used to completion""? The new plan wouldn't be an upgrade of people don't actually use more than 10 swipes per week and the swipes disappear. It seems to me like it's just more inflexible.
I want to expand on this answer by Christ. Our UC is almost completely independent from the ASUC and cannot control it very significantly -- if at all. This is a byproduct of the Free Speech Movement (FSM) and how UC Berkeley decided to handle the issue of student clubs following the FSM. Changing this now, at this point in time and with the University's history, might be impossible. Certainly it would lead to a lot of protests. 

I am personally not a fan of how the ASUC, a group of students with *zero* meaningful political or financial experience, are allowed to control millions of dollars. I think it leads itself to far too many inefficiencies and, undoubtedly, corruption.

The only way to regulate the ASUC and/or reduce their budget is by voting for students who run on such a platform. 
No it doesn’t. They give free alcohol at parties like it’s wine in Nero’s palace, but ironically, their cultural shows are one of the very few things in which they actually charge admission. 

No to mention using ASUC funds to have some random singer come. That’s utterly ridiculous, and undoubtedly cost an exhort it’s the amount of money compared to what more reasonable  (and useful) club events would cost.

Can you set aside room for a basketball court? There is a real scarcity of outdoor basketball courts on southside. I have always enjoyed shooting around at Peoples Park as the RSF courts are often far too packed and competitive, not to mention out of the way.
Men's football makes a lot of $, but due to title 9 compliance, the school would have to offer 85 female scholarship positions (or whatever the male/female ratio student ratio is).

With that said, we could theoretically pare down to mens football/basketball and however many female scholarship to maintain title 9 compliance.

Tldr it's complicated
Except the Stats department
One consideration may be decline in student performance. Every Berkeley professor and graduate instructor with whom I've spoken about this topic has noticed a significant decline in academic performance over the past 5-10 years. Students arrive with weaker preparation, complete a smaller proportion of assigned work, and do not exercise as creative critical thinking as their predecessors. 
Amen, Kamado is an underappreciated gem around here. 
I would tend to agree that training does not always work (Alcohol EDU as I can recall, was generally lampooned by the student body when I was a freshman), however at a certain point there is little that the University can do about individuals who choose to live in private houses off campus besides providing information (training) as well as dealing with reports after the fact.  I don't think you're going to see UCPD officers walking through fraternity houses any time soon every Friday night.
Christ is doubling the amount of beds on-campus, which is the most ambitious housing goal undertaken by any chancellor. It requires building upon all possible land holdings, and securing a single contractor to work with.
Starting a medical school would be extraordinarily expensive, beginning with acquiring the necessary land.  In addition, the trend in medical schools, with their attendant health services operations, is greater consolidation.  Starting a stand-alone medical school, with a big one just across the Bay (which is moving some operations into the East Bay) just wouldn’t make sense.
If they are separate from the school then why can't we opt out of paying into them with our tuition money?
When is Berkeley going to stop being bullied by mobs threatening to protest? 
I don't think having ""some random singer come"" is at all ridiculous, schools bring artists for concerts all the time. I'd argue that these free shows boost morale, especially if it's an artist that a good amount of people like (which is usually true).
Updating CADS is the most reliable way to make sure the University and the CAA have accurate information for you.  There are many who make sure to keep their CADS information up to date, and I am one of them, having moved 4 times in the past 3 years.  It means that the University and the CAA can keep in touch with me and the thousands of other alumni who still try to support and do business with the campus.

The grade distributions of stats classes are cruel and definitely intentional irony
If you find this answer please let PM me, I would really like to know.

My hypothesis is that the reason the student government is independent is to protect the university. Some bad media comes up about some club and the University can claim they are independent of that. It certainly creates a worse experience for student orgs because the 20 ASUC senators have nowhere near the time or expertise to help us get the resources we need.
[Edit: not OP but I didn't know what CADS is so I have further questions.]

[This website](https://hr.berkeley.edu/hr-network/central-guide-managing-hr/campus-business-systems/cads) says, ""Access to CADS is granted only to UC Berkeley employees or affiliates who require the data to complete tasks related to fundraising, alumni relations, or external relations.""

So is there a way for alumni not involved in organizing fundraising efforts to update their contact info? Would sending the information to the Cal Alumni Association through [this webform](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/membership/update-your-contact-info) work?
If it's a normal distribution, the mean should be 50%, right?
You are misinterpreting what you have quoted.  It is saying that only UC employees and affiliates (read CAA) have the ability *access/search* CADS.  You don't need to apply to change your CADS info, you only need to apply to be allowed to use the database (which you won't be allowed to use, since you're not a UC employee or a CAA fundraising person).

The second link you have there, hosted by the CAA is a way to have your CADS updated.  As it says: 
>""We will add these updates to the main UC Berkeley database for you.""

The main UC Berkeley database *is* CADS.
It feels like they go for a uniform(0, 1)

As interviews like this doesn't happen often, I was wondering if any of you had something you wanted me to ask her.

Any and all suggestions (especially the funny ones) are much appreciated! Thanks!

Well you gotta pivot with the situation and follow up by firing off that question from a certain Ugandan interview.
I looked at HKN, his reviews were far from subpar. For some courses he is around the average, there are worse instructors/professors (61c). His reviews for 161 are excellent and he is known for teaching that course extremely well. His overall ranking for undergrad courses is around 5.5/7 (well in the green) not sure how he is considered a subpar instructor

My question is: how is that illegal?
We all know that the birds are the ones with the camera's.
This IS ""escalating tension."" It's just the side you like doing the escalating.
Having security watching an encampment (that breaks campus guidelines) from a distance is escalating tension?

Touch grass
Somehow I imagine if me and a bunch of my buddies (some armed) just came and conspicuously watched you while you went about whatever you do in a day, you'd perceive it as a threat. Quit playing dumb
You’re acting like these security guards went to these protestors’ private homes. They’re on a public campus. Keeping watch — from a distance — over an encampment which the protestors chose to erect (despite being against campus policy).

This is absolutely not an escalation. Please be serious.
The entire purpose of them being there is to serve as a reminder of the violent force readily available if protestors do anything the powers that be don't like too much. Perhaps even just overstaying their ""welcome."" You being deliberately obtuse or maybe just oblivious doesn't change that fact. You be serious.
Why do you think your comment was downvoted into oblivion? You’re obviously in the minority here. Perhaps you’re the one being a bit hysterical?
Because this subreddit is a conservative liberal, technocraticlly minded, critically illiterate circle jerk? And even if it wasn't, since when does popularity determine what is or isn't correct? You're grasping now.
If you think the Berkeley sub is “conservative liberal” you truly do need to touch grass.
It's dominated by corporate liberals who virtue signal about their good values as long as it doesn't interfere with the prime value of protecting the natural correctness of the profit motive. If you don't see that then YOU need to touch grass."

Very weird story. I copy and pasted the beginning below but it's even longer than this.

\---

Ivonne del Valle said she was considering Joshua Clover as a participant in a forthcoming conference when she sat in on his panel presentation at the University of California at Berkeley in the spring of 2018.

Clover, a professor of English and comparative literature at UC’s Davis campus, studied class struggles and had written a book about riots and worker revolts. Del Valle’s colleague thought he’d be a good fit for an event they were planning on the student and worker uprisings of 1968 in Mexico and elsewhere around the world.

After the presentation, del Valle, a tenured associate professor of colonial studies in Berkeley’s department of Spanish and Portuguese, approached him and suggested they get together to talk about the conference. Clover agreed, and two weeks later, they met at the Prizefighter Bar at the northwest tip of Oakland. She had beer; he had wine.

Clover would later tell investigators he felt “uncomfortable with the interaction” with del Valle and ended the conversation early. She began talking as though the meeting were a date, he said, and became “visibly flustered” when he mentioned his partner. Del Valle remembered it differently. She considered it a social meeting with a colleague, she said, and she’d suggested wrapping it up because Clover had said he had a reading group to join afterward.

From there, things went rapidly downhill.

Del Valle, who had been following Clover for a few months on Twitter before they met, thought afterward that he was obliquely insulting a few of her colleagues on the platform without naming them. He was becoming irritated with what he described as “confusing” messages she was sending him privately about how someone was bothering her.

In May, according to investigative reports Clover shared with The Chronicle, del Valle messaged him that he was making her “uncomfortable as hell” — a reference, she said, to how she felt he was disparaging her colleagues. The next day, Clover wrote back: “I will not respond to further communication — Please do not write to me any further.”

Neither could have predicted that five years later, they’d be embroiled in a messy and complicated case, with del Valle banished from campus after being found responsible for stalking and harassment, and Clover reportedly fearing for his safety and moving to a different home. Nor could they envision that Berkeley would find itself facing pressure to reverse its decision from dozens of students, alumni, and faculty members who have rallied in the banished professor’s defense, in protests, marches, and an online campaign.

Ivonne del Valle’s supporters have vowed to “shut down” UC-Berkeley’s football game on Saturday unless the chancellor agrees to reinstate her. SITES.GOOGLE.COM/VIEW/JUSTICE4IVONNE Ivonne del Valle’s supporters plan on “shutting down” Berkeley’s football game on Saturday unless the chancellor agrees to reinstate her. The dispute, which has jolted the lives and careers of two scholars highly respected in their fields, began where so many of higher-education’s fiercest fights have been waged, on the platform formerly known as Twitter. There, del Valle became convinced that tweets from Clover’s account, and another one she felt was associated with the professor, were delivering a series of coded — and deeply personal — taunts. By the time the dispute spiraled off the computer screen, del Valle was delivering messages instead in silver spray paint and mashed pineapple.

The events that followed raise difficult questions. Among them: At a time when much of academic culture is lived on social media, where identities can be masked and threats veiled, how does a university respond to a professor’s seemingly far-fetched allegations about what happens there?

The Chronicle has pieced together the following account based on extensive interviews with del Valle, hundreds of pages of documents, including letters, correspondences, and screenshots she shared, along with reports Clover provided from three Title IX investigations. Del Valle’s supporters have also offered testimonies from 48 current and former students, many of whom spoke with The Chronicle, about the professor’s contributions as a mentor and scholar. Efforts to reach Clover’s supporters were less successful, since he hasn’t been speaking publicly about the dispute. The Chronicle reached out to several of his colleagues in the English department at Davis, as well as to a few supporters who weighed in on social media. The only one who responded referred the email to the university’s public-relations office.

When del Valle first approached The Chronicle in late August to urge a reporter to look into her case, she declined to identify the person she accused of hacking her phone and laptop and electronically stalking her. She identified him only as a professor at another University of California campus. The Chronicle later identified him as Joshua Clover.

A tenured professor with appointments in English and comparative literature, Clover is well known in literary circles as a poet, columnist, and political theorist who directs the university’s Marxist Institute for Research. Del Valle is also well known in her field, as an expert in colonial Latin American studies and as a mentor to students who, like herself, are immigrants and the first in their families to attend college.

UC-Berkeley’s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination conducted three separate Title IX investigations on the case — in 2019, 2021, and 2022. All found that she had either harassed Clover or violated orders not to contact him. Del Valle is on paid administrative leave, banned from teaching, advising, and entering nonpublic parts of the campus. Clover told The Chronicle that Berkeley’s interim Title IX officer has said Clover is not prohibited from sharing the reports from those investigations. He confirmed that he was the complainant but declined to comment further for this article.

In an email to a handful of del Valle’s supporters, he wrote that the charges included “multiple instances of stalking, sexual harassment, retaliation, and violation of no-contact directives directed against me, my family, and my students; many many charges across many many years.”

Del Valle said that, to the contrary, she’s the victim of sexual harassment by Clover. None of the investigations found evidence that Clover had stalked or harassed del Valle. She contends that’s because the university never gave her complaints the attention they did Clover’s, or fulfilled her request to perform a forensic evaluation of her phone and laptop to see if they’d been hacked.

That her university is punishing her as a harasser is “an ironic reversal of the reasons for which Title IX regulations were created,” she wrote in notes she prepared to explain her side of what would become a tangled, yearslong dispute. “Not a single thing I have done or supposedly done is romantic or sexual in nature. The opposite is true. They have all been defense against humiliating abuse and sexual harassment.”

Janet Gilmore, a campus spokeswoman, said privacy policies prevent her from discussing the specific complaints. As a campus, she added, Berkeley is “committed to ensuring that individuals are treated fairly.”

But both Clover and del Valle have accused UC-Berkeley of mishandling the investigations by not responding promptly and consequentially to their complaints.

In the weeks and months after Clover told del Valle to stop contacting him, she said, she became unsettled by what she felt were similarities between what she was communicating on her cellphone and laptop and tweets she attributed to Clover. She would message a friend, she said, and within hours, a post would pop up on Clover’s Twitter feed — or another she was convinced he had access to — that seemed to be indirectly referencing it. She wrote about planning to see a friend named Isis and he posted about a restaurant with the same name, she said. She was searching on the web for a good place for French lessons, and he tweeted “Moving on to daily vous, daily ils elles”. She had a cellphone conversation with her son about Kendrick Lamar’s song “Humble” and over the next two days, the word “humble” appeared on the two Twitter feeds where she accused Clover of stalking her.

Where many would see coincidences, del Valle saw a pattern of harassment.

WTF
I swear some shit just goes down every other week, and I’m just out of the loop because I’m too lazy to get to class.
Students are protesting in DEFENSE of this nut job? Do they understand what's happening, or is this another case of ""protest!? Let's go join!""
Huh??? Have no idea!!
I’ve been trying to tell y’all. There’s a dark side to Berkeley. They have a lot of unchecked power and their administrative processes are heavily bureaucratic. The Berkeley institution itself, (like the professors and GSI’s) is fantastic, but once you get caught up in some kind of problem like this case, the case involving the swimmers, my own case, and you have to start dealing with campus entities like OPHD, Deans, etc. it’s nothing but garbage. 

Berkeley has some major problems. I feel terrible for this person in this case. Knowing what I’ve had to go through I can only imagine what they went through and continue to go through. This kind of stuff is brutal. Really brutal. I wouldn’t wish it on any golden bear. We have to do something about this to change it for the better. This stuff simply cannot happen. Sometimes I wish people would just listen to me. My own case is peanuts compared to this one and I would rather put drops of siracha hot sauce in my eyes, then have to continue dealing with the elite bureaucratic side of Berkeley. If you guys only knew how bad it truly is.
y’all gotta let that shit go. Israel Palestine is the current topic
I obviously haven’t seen the evidence first hand, but she sounds guilty as hell. Students protesting in favor of a crazy stalker.
She definitely sexually harassed him and is definitely a stalker. It's crazy that in society abuse and sexual harassment of men is never taken as seriously as it is for women, as this seems like a clear example of a predator exploiting that fact.
I ain’t reading allat
Yeah she deserved, that lady is unhinged.
What is she accused of? The article just says she is suspended.
I absolutely agree with you. I personally went through a title IX investigation and currently suspended after 1 year of investigation/other process. Brutal. OPHD has too many cases to deal with.
TLDR. She’s a crazy stalker
There's a long article about it in today's Chronicle of Higher Education, available online through the UC-Berkeley library.

""The university, she said, recently rejected her lawyer’s “counteroffer” of a six-month suspension. As she waits for her status to be resolved, del Valle said she’s in a better place emotionally than she was when she sat outside Clover’s door and dumped tepache on his mother’s doorstep. The professor’s mental health has come under scrutiny throughout the protracted saga. The Albany police officer, she said, treated her as “delusional”; Joshua and Carol Clover have told Berkeley authorities del Valle was unwell and needed help; a friend of Clover’s posted on X that del Valle had formed “a deeply parasocial obsessive twitter fixation ‘relationship’ with him” and needed to be stopped. Del Valle said she’s tired of being diagnosed as mentally ill. She’s been seeing a therapist once a week. She still insists that the online intrusions she described were very real.""
I’m so sorry to hear that. And yes! You’re absolutely correct. It’s my understanding that OPHD shares investigators with DAC (disability access and compliance) so basically, they’ve got one or two people maybe doing all the investigations for title IX and for disability discrimination access and compliance. They are also ridiculously horrible at it. Then, even if they rule in the students favor, they literally don’t have the power to do anything about it. It’s egregious. We have seriously got to do something about this. Right now is the perfect timing to. If only we could organize a mass protest with people who care in a weeks time because this is carol Christ’s last year, her legacy is at stake. If students press now on major issues that affect all of us, it might be prime time for actual change.
I will PM you.  It seems to be difficult because I feel like there are other issues going on on campus.  I am suspended for 2 years and will come back in 2025. Currently out of the states.
Yes. Please PM me."

To do this she has taken on the millionaire landowning class that prior Chancellors were unwilling to challenge.  The Berkeley city council also deserves credit for shifting priorities towards housing people over preserving existing buildings.
Let’s fucking go Carol Christ is going out with a bang 🙏

This needed to be done for a while happy she’s finally doing it. Honestly sad she’s leaving, hope our next chancellor will be like her
What can we do to convince her to stay on until death? Best thing to happen to Cal in a while.  Dirks, her predecessor, was a certifiable chode breath. I’m terrified, especially given the current climate of American campus weirdness, that we will select some woefully incompetent clown to fill her shoes.

Fuck DiFi and especially fuck her husband.
No matter who did the recommending, Carol Christ still could have improperly instructed the admissions office to take this into account. I would give her the benefit of the doubt though. If you have ever interacted with her you can tell that she really cares about both the students and the idea of an excellent and open Berkeley.

If there's anything we should take from this is that the government is really a bunch of corrupt idiots who are weighing Berkeley and the rest of UC down.

>Blum said he never thought the letters “ever had much influence.”

Them why the hell would you keep writing them? What a bald-faced lie.
Oh, Carol did it alright. 

""One case from these 14 admissions decisions is particularly problematic. UC Berkeley appears to have admitted this student because of an inappropriate letter of support from a university Regent. University policy states that members of the Board of Regents should not seek to influence inappropriately the outcome of admissions decisions beyond sending letters of recommendation, when appropriate, through the regular admissions process. However, the Regent did not submit this letter through the regular admissions process. Rather, after the campus placed this applicant on its waitlist, the Regent wrote a letter to UC Berkeley’s chancellor advocating for the applicant, and the chancellor’s staff sent the letter to UC Berkeley’s development office, which in turn forwarded the letter to the admissions office.""
She’s gonna be like 91 by the end of her term. Do you think she’ll retire before then?
I don't think she ever has. Reminder that she flew (and replaced several times) the Confederate flag in front of SF City Hall when she was mayor.
I voted for her in 2018 bc I didn’t think De Leon would’ve brought a lot of change :/ Now we gotta wait for 2024. Sorry y’all.
Her husband even went to Berkeley! Fuck that guy, we should rescind his diploma
Agreed, fellow member of the UC Berkeley community!

\-From NotCarolChrist
Without having read too much about this issue, I would wager this has been happening prior to Carol Christ becoming chancellor.

I interviewed her before. This was not the conclusion that I nor the people who were watching came to. She talked like any other politician.
You can be personable and care about the students on one level but be fully willing to fill your pockets with money. Gray area exists. ...Even if those actions pretty much undermine the level of care you might carry.
Who
Did you read the article? Or your own quote? ""...the chancellors staff sent the letter to UC Berkeley's development office..."" 😐 You really think the chancellor has time to read every letter of recommendation?? 😐
She's already said she plans to run again.  She want's to be the oldest and longest serving senator.
Welllll that doesn’t tell the whole story https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dianne-feinstein-confederate-flag/
well at least you learned from your mistakes lol
Same. LMAO. Sorry ya'll too.
Disgrace to all Golden Bears who struggled in the trenches to earn our place
For all we know he got in the same way. Greasing people ain't a knew practice.
Don't know why you're being downvoted -- this is completely true. All the talk without any of the walk.
Both of them
The chancellor is responsible for the actions of her own office.
It's incredible how it becomes such a self-congratulating and vain toast to their longevity and more likely further accumulation of wealth. How her husband handled this is just how her politics operate. She accepts bribes regularly and so she and her ilk know how to grease the wheels of the system up in all other matters if they need to. It's disgusting.
Do people really need to see the Confederate Flag amongst an entire repetoire, as if it isn't already widely known and brandished? It's an anti-progressive symbol of racism and hatred and subjugation, and pretty much went against against the wishes of San Franciscans. 

Let them fly that shit down South if they must. We have no business flying it.

>The flag is part of an 18-flag display in front of City Hall that is designed to depict flags that played important roles in the history of the United States, according to Tom Malloy, director of the city’s Recreation and Parks Department. Malloy said he will continue to fly the Confederate flag until or unless the Board of Supervisors orders it down.
Beautifully put.
Yes and no...office functions are usually autonomous to free up time for the person in charge to focus on leadership. This is how it works all over from legislators, to companies, to universities. To assume that the Chancellor of the #1 public university in the world would be appraised of every single little thing that happens in her office would show a gross misunderstanding of the realities of even basic office work from the part of the assumer. And it was a ""little thing"" to the office, as referenced by them literally shoving the paper out of their office for another department to work on it.
It doesn’t matter if the chancellor looked at the letter or not. And obviously she doesn’t look at everything single thing her office does. When you are the leader of a department or an office you bear the responsibilities of that office. Leaders are held accountable (or should be!) for things like this. That’s one of the difficult parts of leadership.
So then it wouldn’t really be correct to say *she* did it, but that she does yield the responsibility for the actions of her office"
"Despite the memes regarding Carol Christ, let's take a moment to review some of our chancellor's notable accomplishments",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14aqczh/despite_the_memes_regarding_carol_christ_lets/,2023-06-16 00:38:19,"* Successfully rebounded from the pitful financial situation left over by Dirk.
   * Helped  during COVID-19
* Overachieved with the Light the Way fundraising campaign, which started in Feb 2020 and has raised 6.5 Billion since. 
* Created an action plan for much-needed student housing. Albany Student Housing and Anchor Housing are being constructed at this moment. The people's park housing and upper hearst housing were supposed to also be in construction, but the NIMBYs are forcing us to rely on the California Supreme Court. 
* Facilitated key campus development with the current construction of the Gateway (DS/CS) and renovation of Bechtel (Eng). In addition, a new Evans replacement, Heathcock Hall (Chem), and Moffitt floors 1-3 renovation are going to break ground very soon. 
   * Something notable is a Berkeley/Nasa joint campus in the works located in the south bay. 
* Helped establish the College of data science
* Secured state funding for the campus transition to clean energy, where phase will reduce carbon emissions by 70%. Construction on the central electric plant under north field will being in early 2024 and include a central electric thermal plant coupled with a community center with study spaces. 
* Finalized an updated (2022) campus master plan that holistically improves campus infrastructure and lays out a plan to utilize our limited space more efficiently. 

Considering the circumstances, I believe Carol Christ did a solid job in maintaining and developing Cal. Hopefully, our next chancellor can build upon the impactful groundwork that has been put forth. Go bears!","* Appeared on most memes in UCBFET and on the Berkeley Reddit

Come on dude. Most of the people here are attempting to have a civil discussion. Hyperbolic inflammatory (and hypothetical) statements are not necessary.
Protection of free speech is precious because you can't always guarantee what other people consider ""fascist.""
what you think is fascist may not actually be fascist... bc ur truth isn't a universal truth. Food for thought <3
how is this hyperbolic or hypothetical when there are alt-right people demonstrating freely on campus every year and stuff like that truck last fall that was like “all in favor of banning jews, raise your right hand.” with a picture of hitler that was driving around campus. we shouldn’t give these people a platform
i’m not saying that we should abolish the first amendment. i greatly value free speech. however, if there’s neo-nazis on campus, then i feel like as a community, we have the obligation to make sure they don’t feel welcome in any way. again, probably not legal action because that could set a dangerous precedent, but something like telling them gtfo of campus and such.
i consider people who are openly neo-nazis to be fascists and i will die on that hill thank you very much. again, not against free speech. i don’t think the government should be jailing these people unless they commit a crime. i think we should, as a community, make sure these people don’t feel welcome on campus since we aren’t bound like the administration is by being a public entity
I read the rest of your comments. You’re trying to get reactions. As much as if love to give you the attention you’re lacking elsewhere, I believe I have a better use of my time than arguing semantics with people on the internet
> something like telling them gtfo of campus and such

This is legal and in-line with free speech principles.

> i’ll gladly advocate for threatening fascists with death or bodily harm any day of the week.

This is not.
Those terms are used so loosely nowadays and u know it 💀
thats your freedom of speech no shit. Not feeling welcome isnt saying death threats

yeah they are by liberals, but i’m not using them lightly.

you have to follow the law you dumbfuck.  that includes not threathing people with bodily harm. You are worse than the fascist .stop playing games.

well then what is it
Yeah but if you see the whole scene, Gandalf, AKA Christ, forces Saruman's spell out of King Theoden. So he does in fact win against him. Meaning, Christ wins over PG&E for her request to get power on Monday. But we didn't have power on monday, which contradicts the scene. Am I missing something?

they're also in the creek on the north side of vlsb

Considering already over half a dozen people (Damore, Mac Donald, Murray, Peterson, Malice, I think at least one more I'm forgetting) have all come out and said they were never actually invited or just aren't going anymore, it seems like the truth is apparent: **Milo boasted to the world that a bunch of conservative and alt-right figures are going to his party when he actually never invited them and they want nothing to do with him**. His brand is *that* toxic and he's *that* desperate. I am almost certain that another half of the people of this updated-updated-updated-list will not come, and likely barely know they're on it, or are just ignoring Milo like the embarassing cringelord he is. Ann Coulter tweets 20 times a day, isn't it weird that she hasn't tweeted that she'll be here in less than a week? Steve Bannon has basically never done an event like this, and we're supposed to believe that he's going to come speak on Sproul steps because Milo says he will? LOL after the embarassment of next week I hope dailycal, berkeleyside, SF Gate expose this ridiculous fraud for what it is: the most pathetic, disgusting loser in school boasting about all of the cool people who will totally come to his party, when most of them refuse to even acknowledge him. Sad!

Edit: note that Erik Prince is off the list now too after his PR people said he had no intention of going. Free speech week speakers dropping at a rate of 2-3 per day...

Edit 2: SABO is off too. God they're almost half gone...
She's honestly just in a shitty position to represent the University. Stop Milo from coming and you get bad press regarding the university's commitment to free speech. Let him come, and you have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in security to protect the students from Antifa.
Relevant survey results in the news:

I'm trying to figure out how many undergrad scholarships [$600,000](http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/15/berkeley-spent-600000-for-security-at-ben-shapiro-event/) could buy. Let alone what Bay Area communities have had to shell out for these recurring circuses.

It's not a stretch to think they're doing this on purpose – draining dollars from Cal's real mission.

I'd like to see Patriot Prayer, Milo, BCR and all their fraudulent scammers be sued and the proceeds going to something – anything – more constructive than their masturbatory ego-crusade.
Even Peterson dropped out now? Who actually are the rest of these people? Why are they even coming to a university? 

Edit: and that toxic British woman too! This is a bloody letdown.
Free speech does not condone hate speech.  Why are they allowing these hate-spewing imbeciles to have this public stage?
Out of curiosity: how many students have been hurt by antifa?
She's just a shitty person who's drunk on liberalism. 
Everyone's fine limiting hate speech until what you say is considered hate speech. What a fine line we're crossing here. 
Or, you know, anytime BCR invites a shitty person, us and the community can stop throwing a hissy fit so that $600,000 can actually go to students.

Awesome lesson you're trying to teach kids these days dude. Threaten violence and you actually might get your way.
Sued for what?
It could house some of us homeless students. Or at least begin to help us out. According to the Homeless Student Union, 10% of Berkeley students are affected by homelessness. If the university actually cared about us, if BCR actually cared about doing some good in this world, all this money, all this time, all this effort, could be used on people who are actually in this world suffering right now. Instead, a bunch of privileged fucks spend their money and the university's money (read: the money WE pay to the university) on their little circlejerk oppression sessions. There are countless suffering here. They're ignored.
u need grounds to sue. firing blanks is just more money down the drain.
Approximately 7 four year scholarships
They should have enforced the laws early on instead of emboldening Antifa.  
Jordan Peterson was gonna speak? That would've been tight.
> Why are they even coming to a university?

I encourage you to show, listen, and have an open, sincere, honest discussion with them. If you can behave maybe each side will walk away more enlightened about the thoughts and interests of their fellow man.

> This is a bloody letdown.

Pretty sure you won't let it remain a bloodless letdown
Legally, it does.
Think about the consequences of not letting someone speak.
The problem with labeling ""hate speech"" is that the term is so loose you can essentially classify it for anything, to a point that a group can even silence you if you say anything remotely contrary to theirs.

And plus, hate speech is protected under court of law.
Hate speech isn't even a real thing, it exists only in your mind.

Sucks to be her but then again, she lives with That Thing, so we'll turn a blind eye to her swiping our vodka from the community club house wet bar. There's always one in every neighborhood, right? 

Not OK. Third, fourth & fifth times. We suggest It stop crapping in our pool every couple of weeks and she be a freaken' parent and while she's at it, buy her own damned vodka. The attention-seeking, glue-eating, six-time crapping child and her awful drinking-all-our-booze harridan reacts poorly: ""Show me where in the bylaws it says you're not allowed to crap in the pool more than six times. Besides, you don't *have* to open your mouth or eyes or nose while swimming. So really, YOU'RE the Cholera-spreader!"" Then she swipes your drink, downs it, hits on the poolboy (poor poolboy!) and collapses into a drooling stupor.

Question: if she announces she and her spawn will be at the pool this Sunday, at what point is it her and His Poopiness' responsibility to clean the damn pool they crap in every few weeks, and stop being ours?
Considering their proposed list of speakers (supposedly justifying a three-day fiesta) consists 80% of people who not only aren't attending, but were never asked to attend? Fraud.

They should have gone with, ""We have six local nobodies who desperately need to goose sales at their online stores before they start serving time for all the assault charges they've racked up in the past year, so we're doing a televised (*cough* smartphone count, right? *cough*) marathon. C'mon down!"" 

But their telling the truth is like asking the Wicked Witch of the West to take a lengthy shower. The only thing left at the end is endless wailing and green viscous slime.
If you actually cared about devoting this money to homeless students, you wouldn't have advocated for violence against BCR in the first place, thus necessitating these exorbitant security expenditures.
*sigh* 

You're going to *make* me pencil it out? Monster!

1 school year, undergrad: [$14K.](http://financialaid.berkeley.edu/cost-attendance)

$600K wasted at *one* event by UCB that these Neo-Nazis hope will goose sales at their shoddy WordPress stores or earn an extra $0.0005 per YouTube viewer.

That's about 43 academic years. Assuming UCB costs are the same as what Reg Fees are (remember what they say about ""assume""?). 

So those are 4 years of Reg Fees covered for 11 students. That's life-changing. 

But it could just as easily be 1 year for 43 students. Or half-fee stipends for 86 students. Not life-changing, but still amazing.

Room & Board is a whole different vase of roses. So are grads or out-of-state students, but we're penciling in here. 

That's only **one** Neo-Nazi self-love fest. Not counting the six already dribbled out the sphincter of BCR & their Mercer/Koch daddies. Not counting the ones they're planning.

So… If these jackasses are so concerned with UCB's undergrads, why aren't they giving out half-year stipends for 100 randomly selected students? Or Hell, why aren't their sponsors paying the full freight for this year's class? They earn more just off their interest.

Oh yeah. They don't give a damn about students. Or Berkeley. Or California. Or the United States. It's all about them. Not us. *That's* why.
It would've been funny, I'll give you that.
yeah, bucko
these aren't discussions, they're just gonna be speeches.
There's no need to talk to Milo, to Horowitz, to Gellar, to Bannon, to Coulter. They're all professional bigots, and it's a fools game to talk with that.

And wow, got me. You really struck deep to the core of the problems of political hate speech by calling me violent. Bravo
The consequences of not letting someone speak is that they don't end up speaking. 
So the answer's exactly what I thought it'd be: no idea. Good to know.

And you're terrible at covering up your biases, my man. You can't include the ID of a single attacker, and just happen to also mention that this attacker is 'Antifa', without mentioning all the other attackers. Yeah, 31 people may have been injured. That says nothing about the culprits, and nothing about the supposed danger to students (students specifically) presented by antifa.
>you can't be against the spread of fascism AND for supporting homeless students!!
Sam Hyde would've been funny, JBP would've been awoken master status
i hope you entertain my genuine curiosity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHPfAtPiXXs
what is your opinion on the speaker and the content of his talk?
What is your opinion regarding 

+ punching nazis
+ punching out of that one nazi wearing dude in Seattle two days ago
+ antifa riots to stop speakers at Berkeley
+ antifa
+ charges against Yvette Felarca for assault and inciting a riot
+ charges against Eric Clanton for assault with a deadly weapon

Have you ever donated to antifa or bamn?
The chancellor and several faculty members discuss free speech and answer the question of why those ""hate-spewing imbeciles"" are being given a public stage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QVcYpuLrXg
Yes, that's an obvious immediate consequence. And then what? Do you think the speaker and their supporters will be happy? What do you think other people who aren't supporters will think? Would society as a whole believe that their right to open speech is strengthened or weakened after seeing that some people aren't being allowed to speak?
[deleted]
So when you choose to support violence against BCR, which forces the administration to spend money to protect them, this supposedly doesn't contradict your support for funding homeless student services.

But when BCR benefits from this protection, protection that would not be necessary if people like you didn't threaten them with violence, you absolve yourself of any involvement and accuse BCR of being the source of the expenditure.

The lack of self-awareness is appalling.
I don't get the fascination with Hyde. I swear I've never seen a funny thing he's done, but everyone swears up and down the block he's funny. What gives?
It's inoffensively bland imo. Yeah, it's true that the dominant strain of Islam in the ME has a lot of problems. But he's not really providing any new idea for why that is, no material analysis of why that cleric said that about numbers. And he's, more or less, describing scientific advancement as quantifiable by Nobel Prizes-- which is just silly. It's what I expected: a physicist speaking out of field. Nothing more, nothing less.
What NDG is saying can't be compared to Milo or Ann Coulter.  NDG brought attention to the scientific contributions Islam contributed in the past, and expresses a hope that Islam will do so in the future.   NDG isn't expressing hate at Muslims.  He isn't saying Islam is fundamentally evil and will bring down western civilization.  NDG isn't conflating ISIS with the average Muslim.  
1) Great!

2) Great! He also was reported by the police to have been threatening others.

3) Sometimes justifiable.

4) Great when they're stopping fascists!

5) Inciting a riot is a BS charge, but she was caught committing assault. Dunno if it was self-defense or not. Do know it was a Nazi, but that doesn't necessarily invalidate the charge.

6) Sounds like he may have committed it. Glad nobody died, assuming the guy he hit was indeed not a Nazi.

7) lol that's not how those groups operate. And no, but I was arrested for protesting, and antifascists who I'd never met before offered me help, picked me up, brought me tea, and were the nicest ones involved at any stage in the process. They're just normal people.
Their supporters can make a fuss, but this campus should be a safe space for its students. Trans people should *not* have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate, undocumented immigrants should have to face the threat of being uprooted and sent back across the border in their own community just as Jewish people should not have to watch a person stand up on a stage and tell them they should be gassed for who they are. People don't become xenophobes just because xenophobes are denied a platform to spread their views. Rather, existing people on the far-right become more vocal. This is a matter of protecting members of our community against hate-speech.
[deleted]
there's no accountin for taste I guess
in terms of the list you wrote, milo horowitz gellar bannon and coulter, could you rate worst to the least worst?
i understand what you mean and agree with you. i was just trying to pick his brains and understand his perspective on things thats all, thus as i mentioned, my genuine curiosity.
It cracks me up every time. Conservatives are shocked and amazed when people show up to protest and demonstrate, with no bribes involved. Just passion and ethics.

I guess they're so used to that easy Mercer, Koch & YAF moolah subsidizing their ""protests"" that they assume everyone else has to be on the take.
So you're fine with

+ punching people
+ riots

You say you'd be glad had Clanton killed a Nazi.

You've seen the video of Felarca assaulting people and are claiming it may have been self-defense.

Lulz, okay, you're not violent, no not at all, I've got you completely wrong on that.
There's several points in your comment I want to address:
1) ""Campus should be a safe space for its students""

Yes, true. That is why during such events, the school has been spending tons of money in order to ensure that it is safe for students. Students are told well in advance the dates and times of these events and know very well of the possibility of violence. They can easily avoid getting hurt by staying indoors.

2) ""Trans people should not have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate, undocumented immigrants should have to face the threat of being uprooted and sent back across the border in their own community just as Jewish people should not have to watch a person stand up on a stage and tell them they should be gassed for who they are.""

True; in an ideal society, everyone would always be happy 100% of the time. There would be no conflict between people, implying that no one would have differing ideas. Then, everyone would be exactly the same. This is not the world we live in. Everyone is different, and everyone has different ideas. This is why we require freedom of speech: to give everyone the opportunity to express different ideas. Therefore, you cannot stop someone from organizing an event to give a speech, because you don't know what they're going to say. You can take action AFTER something harmful happens, but beforehand people have the right to plan to give speeches. 
This is exactly what the problem is -- people are trying to silence the speakers before they are even given opportunity to speak. This is censorship and a clear violation of freedom of speech, which is not allowed in our democracy. This is why Berkeley and the issue of free speech is all over the media and why those who do not understand the details of what's happening think that the left is becoming intolerant of freedom of speech and differing ideas.

Trans people SHOULD confront the idea that their sense of identity may be illegitimate, because then they can critically analyze why they do not agree with that idea, form a strong argument for why they believe in a different view, and then educate others on why they hold this view.
Undocumented immigrants SHOULD have to face the threat of being uprooted and sent back across the border in their own community; without ever realizing this threat, what would motivate them to fight for equal rights and fight to be recognized as capable humans deserving to stay in the country?
Jewish people should not have to watch a person stand up on a stage and tell them they should be gassed for who they are; obviously, and they have a choice not to attend such an event. Fortunately, the majority of people aren't terrible people and now realize what a tragedy the Holocaust was. Such an event would not attract supporters today.

3) ""This is a matter of protecting members of our community against hate-speech.""

Again, this is where the problem is. Open discussion of ideas is absolutely vital in a democracy. If some ideas are not even given the opportunity to be expressed, then what makes your ideas allowed? Just because you believe they're right and ""good""?

The way to address ""hate speech"" and the likes is to 1) ALLOW it, 2) DISAGREE with it, and 3) EDUCATE others on why you believe it is wrong. If the speech turns out to be more than just speech and is affecting things like your ability to succeed in your job and workplace, take legal action. Otherwise, remember that the majority of people aren't heartless trolls and actually have basic morals and empathy. Therefore, letting people express shitty ideas that most people don't even agree with to begin with and won't actually affect anyone's lives outside of their speech is the best (and only) solution. It is also the one required by law. Otherwise, our democracy will turn into an authoritarian dictatorship.
Also a notorious spree killer. He can't keep getting away with it!!!
I honestly don't judge in negatives. Bannon's the only one with any value, since he's actually been in power. But the rest are just laughable nobodies, only with a big following.
It seems like most of their talking points are projection. Racists have a hard time believing leftists could be against racism; people who are bribed have a hard time imagining altruism; etc. It's pretty pathetic
I support people stopping Nazis, yes. It's more concerning that you don't...

And I didn't say that.

And yes, like a good American, I do believe that evidence contrary to the current evidence may preserve one's innocence. Again. More concerning that you don't...
>Yes, true. That is why during such events, the school has been spending tons of money in order to ensure that it is safe for students. Students are told well in advance the dates and times of these events and know very well of the possibility of violence. They can easily avoid getting hurt by staying indoors.

You're deliberately misinterpreting what I'm trying to say. Violence according to the WHO is ""the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation."" Violence can be institutional in nature and not restricted to the direct use of force. Hate-speech is threatening speech that can lead to mental health issues and trauma. Mental health is just as important as physical health and mental health issues can be life threatening in nature.

>This is not the world we live in.

But we can and should make it so. We have power as a collective. The power to stamp out hate and we should start at home.

>This is censorship and a clear violation of freedom of speech, which is not allowed in our democracy.

First of all, the law does not dictate what is ethical nor what is right for a community. The law is outdated and myopic.

Secondly, Creating a threatening environment drowns out other voices. Certain forms of speech can infringe upon other forms of speech. For example holocaust denial drowns out Jewish voices. Imagine you're a Jew and you have a coworker who constantly engages in holocaust denial, what kind of environment does this create for you? Now imagine you appeal to your boss, who responds that your coworker has an inalienable right to free-speech and that a hostile work environment is an unfortunate consequence of this. In such a situation you would either react emotionally, come to work with a persistent sense of fear and anxiety or quit your job. Normalizing hate-speech has a silencing effect on its victims. We have to pick sides, do we defend the speech of the oppressed, or the oppressor?

Thirdly, hate speech isn't free speech. It is threatening and almost always leads to mental trauma for those it is directed against. It falls under the WHO definition of violence. When we confront speech-speech we are merely acting in self defense.

>without ever realizing this threat, what would motivate them to fight for equal rights and fight to be recognized as capable humans deserving to stay in the country

Wow, okay. I'll have you know that trans people face discrimination and judgement in their everyday lives. They have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate all the time. The same can be said for undocumented folks who live in fear of being deported. They should *not* have to face a speaker in their own university deriding them from an elevated platform. It isn't a discussion, it isn't a learning experience. Anti-trans ideas have been scientifically and logically debunked. Tearing apart undocumented families is ethically repugnant. In the same vein Muslims should not be told that they're all savages and that their families deserve to be bombed in the Middle East. How is this so different from the persecution Jews once faced? Why is holocaust denial not okay, but xenophobia against other minorities perfectly fine?

> Open discussion of ideas is absolutely vital in a democracy. 

Open discussion of hateful ideas that have been debunked is not conducive social progress. If a student group invited a Jihadist to speak, should we let them spread their ideology?

>If some ideas are not even given the opportunity to be expressed, then what makes your ideas allowed?

The fact that my ideas don't discriminate against minorities over factors that they have **no control** over. Hate-speech has a very specific definition. ""Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.""

>Otherwise, remember that the majority of people aren't heartless trolls and actually have basic morals and empathy. 

You don't seen to have any morals or empathy given what you just wrote. Nice diatribe on how trans people should have to confront the issues that drive many of them to suicide on a daily basis (spoken from a platform of blind hatred, context matters). You seem like a great human being. 

cant disagree with you there. thanks for your time
>And I didn't say that.

>>  Glad nobody died, assuming the guy he hit was indeed not a Nazi.

That's explicitly what you said.

I believe in stopping Nazis, but I don't believe in thought crime or speech crime.

You believe bad words justify mob violence and vigilantism.

You believe you can watch a video taken from start to end showing an unwarranted assault on a person holding a flag and say ""maybe there is a context that justifies that"" and then turn around and say to others ""you don't believe in evidence!""

You believe in violence.   
You believe in mob violence.  
You believe in vigilantism.  
You don't believe in due process.  

You believe you are not violent and that you are a good person.


>You're deliberately misinterpreting what I'm trying to say. Violence according to the WHO is ""the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation."" Violence can be institutional in nature and not restricted to the direct use of force. Hate-speech is threatening speech that can lead to mental health issues and traumas. Mental health is just as important as physical health and mental health issues can be life threatening in nature.

I was not ""deliberately misinterpreting"" what you said; your phrase ""safe space"" was vague and I understood it as physical safety. However, if we also take into account mental safety, the university has also been spending tons of money to provide counseling and other forms of psychological help for anyone who needs it. And let's be honest: how much mental harm can a troll (who again I will emphasize that most people think is ridiculous, especially at an openly liberal university where liberal thought dominates) have on a person after speaking at a university for a few hours? No one is forcing anyone to attend the speech. If the speaker says something ridiculous, this will actually HARM their reputation and hurt their cause more than help it. However, again I want to say (because you didn't address this point at all) that if you can stop one person from speaking, then NO ONE has the right to speak. This is the critical point. It does not matter whether you agree with the speech or not, but the right to express ideas is the fundamental basis of a democracy. Without this right, it would NOT be a democracy. Our society would NOT value equal rights for ALL people.

>>This is not the world we live in.
>But we can and should make it so. We have power as a collective. The power to stamp out hate and we should start at home.

When I said that ""this is not the world we live in,"" I mean it literally. Everyone is different. It is IMPOSSIBLE for everyone to be exactly the same. Because of this 100% guaranteed fact, there will ALWAYS be conflict of interest between different people, because everyone's needs and values are different.

And back to your comment, that is definitely true. But, stamping out hate DOES NOT equal silencing people. Refer to all of my previous comments for why.

>First of all, the law does not dictate what is ethical nor what is right for a community. The law is outdated and myopic.

Yes, it does. That is the exact purpose of the law--to determine what is right and wrong, specifically because of the point I mentioned earlier: everyone is different, and there always is conflict of interest, so the law is there to regulate this conflict. The law is NOT outdated or myopic; the law is constantly changing to fit the needs of a constantly changing society. If you find fault with the law, you should work to change it.

>Secondly, Creating a threatening environment drowns out other voices. Certain forms of speech can infringe upon other forms of speech. For example holocaust denial drowns out Jewish voices. Imagine you're a Jew and you have a coworker who constantly engages in holocaust denial, what kind of environment does this create for you? Now imagine you appeal to your boss, who responds that your coworker has an inalienable right to free-speech and that a hostile work environment is an unfortunate consequence of this. In such a situation you would either react emotionally, come to work with a persistent sense of fear and anxiety or quit your job. Normalizing hate-speech has a silencing effect on its victims. We have to pick sides, do we defend the speech of the oppressed, or the oppressor?

Creating a threatening environment does NOT drown out other voices. 1) Letting a speaker talk to a crowd of people who voluntarily show up to hear the speech is not ""creating a threatening environment"" for anyone who is not at the speech. 2) Because of 1), your example about workplace harassment is NOT equivalent to an event with voluntary participation (which again is frowned upon by the majority of people). 3) No one is normalizing hate speech. Allowing someone to talk is NOT normalizing hate speech: it is allowing someone to exercise their freedom of speech. The actions taken after the speech would determine whether anyone is normalizing the speech. 4) Stopping people from giving speeches is by far the easiest way to ""drown out"" voices.

>Thirdly, hate speech isn't free speech. It is threatening and almost always leads to mental trauma for those it is directed against. It falls under the WHO definition of violence. When we confront speech-speech we are merely acting in self defense.

Of course. But are the speakers who are invited to talk saying ""I will give a talk on why I hate ____ people and why these people should not exist""? Or are they saying that they'd like to facilitate open discussion of conservative ideas?

>Wow, okay. I'll have you know that trans people face discrimination and judgement in their everyday lives. They have to confront the idea that their sense of identity is illegitimate all the time. The same can be said for undocumented folks who live in fear of being deported. They should not have to face a speaker in their own university deriding them from an elevated platform.

They do not have to face the speaker. They have a choice to intentionally ignore people who aren't government officials and have no true power over them, and fight back if they choose. No one is forcing them to listen. The university is not telling them that they are illegitimate by allowing people with other opinions speak. And the university cannot stop people from speaking, because again, we have something called freedom of speech in our society that is powerful and necessary.

>Tearing apart undocumented families is ethically repugnant. In the same vein Muslims should not be told that they're all savages and that their families deserve to be bombed in the Middle East. How is this so different from the persecution Jews once faced? Why is holocaust denial not okay, but xenophobia against other minorities perfectly fine?

Please...allowing someone who can be actively ignored speak at a college does not tear apart families.

>Why is holocaust denial not okay, but xenophobia against other minorities perfectly fine?

Neither are okay. Now, you're ""deliberately misinterpreting"" what I'm saying...

>""Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.""

Ben Shapiro's last speech was ""Say No to Campus Thuggery."" Have the other speakers explicitly stated that they will be promoting ""hate speech"" at the university? If not, then the university must allow them to speak.

>You don't seen to have any morals or empathy given what you just wrote. Nice diatribe on how trans people should have to confront the issues that drive many of them to suicide on a daily basis (spoken from a platform of blind hatred, context matters). You seem like a great human being.

Attacking my character I see...very mature of you. I just wanted to educate everyone on Reddit and help my fellow bears. And twisting my words out of context...exactly what you were accusing me of doing to you (even though I did not). 

It's a FACT that trans people need to address their identity in our society today, and a FACT that any other minority needs to do the same, because they have no other choice. Because at any given time, a society values certain things over other things, meaning no matter what, some people are going to feel worse than others. This is a fact that has always been true and will always be true because of the point I mentioned earlier that everyone is different. However, people can fight back and need to fight back for what they stand for.

If we're going to compare empathy levels, I'd say I have more than you... have you deeply analyzed what's going on, or are you just following the crowd of mass hysteria, labelling certain people as ""good"" and ""bad,"" and taking the radical stance to completely stop people from exercising their rights just because you believe they're ""bad""? Are you being empathetic to everyone or only to select people you personally agree with? Have you even listened to some of the speakers before? Are you actually thinking about the consequences of stopping people from speaking?

And actually, I'm a minority in every sense of the word, if we're going to be personal about this. I have my own struggles that I face on a daily basis. But I don't have to go to events that I don't agree with. I don't have to listen to people who don't have power over me and my life. I don't have to let trolls weaken me. I let them play their games and watch them lose because they won't get far with such actions. Not because it's the easy thing to do, but because it's the smart thing to do.
What are the pros of letting someone talk? 1) It's the law 2) Media doesn't portray the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals as intolerant of other ideas 3) The reputation of the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals improves 4) Because the reputation is good, other people may actually consider adopting liberal views 5) More people have liberal views, leading to a better country 

Cons: 1) Some people may temporarily feel offended; however, the university is going above and beyond in direct emails to students and staff about support services to address this 2) We spend a lot of money on protection of speaker and students against Antifa

What happens if we do not let someone talk? 1) Media portrays the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals as intolerant of other ideas 3) The reputation of the university, its students, the city, California, and liberals suffers 4) Because the reputation is worse, other people avoid adopting liberal views 5) Fewer people have liberal views, leading to a country that panders even more to the majority versus the minority 6) Legal action will definitely be taken against the university, resulting in even more resources spent on this issue instead of simply letting people talk to begin with
nothing against you but  i dont think its that surprising to find people who believe nazis should be punched.
if you were on the street one day and see person B walking up to person A and harasses him, disses his mom and what not. would any of us be shocked if B got punched? not to mention the law would be lenient towards the person who threw the punch in that case. now consider the ideology of nazi and what they've done. to embrace that atrocity and wear it proudly in public its quite disgusting. i wont punch but if i saw someone do it i wouldnt say i didnt see it coming.
>However, if we also take into account mental safety, the university has also been spending tons of money to provide counseling and other forms of psychological help for anyone who needs it.

Providing psychological care to someone who's mental health you're damaging through your acceptance of hate-speech is analogous to providing first aid to someone you've just punched in the face. Don't do it in the first place.

>And let's be honest: how much mental harm can a troll (who again I will emphasize that most people think is ridiculous, especially at an openly liberal university where liberal thought dominates) have on a person after speaking at a university for a few hours?

This is your inability to relate to the struggles of trans people, undocumented folk and Muslims. If you were insecure about your sense of identity, if you were faced with the threat of being deported everyday, if your people were being bombed in the Middle East, you'd think differently regarding your university providing an open platform to those who would disenfranchise and imprison you. It creates a hostile environment. 

It isn't simply being exposed to the ideas that harms people, its knowing that your university and your peers and your community don't care about safety and that when people attack you, they're not going to stand up for your interests. We don't want to send that message to the oppressed.

>Without this right, it would NOT be a democracy. Our society would NOT value equal rights for ALL people.

This is false. Countries like Germany and France have limits on hate-speech because it is a detriment to a safe civil societies. Certain ideas can be violent and have no place in an inclusive society. This isn't about democracy, this is about self-defense.

>Creating a threatening environment does NOT drown out other voices.

Are you seriously telling me that a room full of holocaust deniers isn't going to drown out Jewish voices? Or that a room full of trans people aren't going to drown out trans voices? Giving Islamophobes an open platform sets a precedent for a hostile environment against Muslims. Knowing that your university allows people to go on stage and call you a savage on account of who you are, will drive out Muslims from the community or at least cause them undue anxiety. 

>Stopping people from giving speeches is by far the easiest way to ""drown out"" voices.

Hate speech isn't free speech.

>But are the speakers who are invited to talk saying ""I will give a talk on why I hate ____ people and why these people should not exist""?

This is *exactly* what the speakers are doing. Have you ever watched a MILO video or are you just here to LARP?

>Please...allowing someone who can be actively ignored speak at a college does not tear apart families.

This is deliberately taken out of context. I'm talking about the idea that families should be torn apart. This idea is ethically repugnant and shouldn't be provided a platform. The same can be said for holocaust denial.

>Ben Shapiro's last speech was ""Say No to Campus Thuggery."" Have the other speakers explicitly stated that they will be promoting ""hate speech"" at the university? If not, then the university must allow them to speak.

Have you seen the schedule? There's a whole day dedicated to why Muslims should be excluded from society, again you don't seem to know the facts.

>Because at any given time, a society values certain things over other things, meaning no matter what, some people are going to feel worse than others.

I'm making it clear that nobody should be made to feel bad about something they have no control over. Its an ethical principle. Oppression is not inevitable, it is a product of society and we should fight against it.




Hate-speech can lead to serious emotional trauma. Speech doesn't take place in a vacuum, some voices suppress others and we have a responsibility to stand by the voices of trans, undocumented and black and brown students. A jewish person should not have to intellectually debate a Nazi on whether or not they should be gassed. A black person should not have to defend the idea that they're not a different specie. A trans person should not have to validate their existence. An undocumented individual shouldn't have to argue that their life is that just as important as the life of someone born in America. Mental health is a real issue and the claim that speech cannot be violent ignores its importance. On a campus with a history of trivializing mental health concerns, this comes as no surprise. Hate-speech regardless of its rationale, is highly damaging to individuals. In this context, **shutting down hate-speech is merely self-defense.**

Free speech is in-principle, **logically incoherent**, which is exemplified by Karl Poppers Paradox of tolerance. Imagine a society where the state enforces free speech, now imagine a group that explicitly opposes free speech poses a real threat to the status quo without the use of violence; the state now has two options, to allow itself to be dismantled, which would end ""free speech"" or to restrict free speech. In Popper words:

>Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.

Rawls too, pointed out that a society must preserve itself in the face of intolerant, hateful views like the ones that will be provided with a platform here at Berkeley:

>While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.

You might be surprised to find that speech is already curtailed in the US, **the principle is already compromised**—it does not exist. There are laws related to “obscenity, incitement to violence, copyright infringement, press censorship during wartime, whistleblowing” and “restrictions for the incarcerated.” Hate speech is as damaging as many of the items I've listed. Again, this is a matter of self-defense. 
> not to mention the law would be lenient towards the person who threw the punch in that case.

Maybe but probably not.   
*the Supreme Court has effectively limited the exception to only include abusive language, exchanged face to face, which would likely provoke a violent reaction.*

It is, but it is probably not a ""fighting word"".


>  i dont think its that surprising to find people who believe nazis should be punched.
Would you say the same thing about people walking around campus espousing

+ pro-Communist beliefs?
+ pro-Israel support?
+ pro-Palestinian support?
+ anti-feminist support?
+ anti-vax support?
the law looks through the lens of a utilitarian. i have no arguments with regards to fighting words however the extent to how much of a law is enforced is very subjective. 
many things can be analyzed with relativity. in a bell curve of horrid ideas with atrocities written in probably every modern history text book in the world, i would think the nazi ideology and what it represents sits pretty far up the bell curve compared to that list wouldnt you agree? just like you wouldnt react the same way between an ant bite and a shark attack.
I'd say speech is speech and speech is different than actions and behaviors.

I'd say a small group of assholes going to Nazi rallies and deplored by all is much less a danger to society than antifa which as you can see in this thread enjoys popular support and is a radically undemocratic organization, eager to assault people to within an inch of their lives and engage in rioting.

And communists in the US? Communists have killed anywhere from 20 million people to 100 million people https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes

Compared to the nazis that we are encouraged to punch, the communist threat to humanity is so great clearly it justifies punching people who pass out or wear communist propaganda.

Punch those guys with the Che t shirts on for instance.
i do not disagree that the antifa is a problem. i think they are a bigger active threat than white supremacist currently. i dont disagree with you one bit on that.
however with regards to communism there are many differences in those instances. some of my ancestors were executed by the communists. ive heard many tales about it. however we have to acknowledge that there was a civil war going on. before communism in china or russia there were emperors and tzars. if you were a threat they killed your entire family and punished anyone even remotely related to you. that was to prevent future generations from plotting revenge against royalty. the nationalist party executed communists as well. the difference in that case was that the communists won the war or it would have been the other way around. the same with regards to russia.

now most killings during communism's rise was to attain or maintain control/power. the nazis killed jews after they were in control. you think the communists in china or russia or anywhere else in the world would be let off so easily if they lost their respective wars? if communism lost, today we would be talking about how capitalism and democracy killed tens of millions. now put that in the context of the nazis killing jews. i just dont see how its an apples to apples comparison
I'm not aware the killings in communist countries stopped when the government takeover was complete.
""or maintain control/power."""

Yes. The Chancellor of the Berkeley campus generally isn't involved in the selection of off-campus businesses (and that's a good thing).  UC does own some off-campus buildings with commercial storefronts, however. 

You probably want to write instead to the Downtown Berkeley Business Improvement District (DBA), or the Telegraph Business Improvement District (TBID).

White professors have historically been the true, insidious upholders of white supremacy.  Information is powerful, and to control the information and who you teach it to (namely, successful white people), the American zeitgeist is changed to reflect such white supremacist ideals.  Oftentimes these colleges proclaim to be inclusive but it is really just a cover for, literally, institutionalized racism.  Working under a ""white manager"" (which isn't even the case, my manager is from Nigeria) at a software company allows me to bring wealth to my family.  To turn down this opportunity in the name of ""dismantling white supremacy"" as you claim, is idiotic.  By YOUR logic, any POC should turn down lucrative jobs to continue working at a gas station or panaderia for $11 an hour.  YOUR mindset is the one strangling BIPOC from ever succeeding.
you are a white worshipping indian
[deleted]
[deleted]
Sure bro whatever you say
The actual cause of gentrification is the white landowners who refuse to build to more housing and keep prices artificially high, cementing generations of institutional white supremacy and wealth transfers from BIPOCs to whites.  Me working at a tech company making $140k a year has been enough to allow my family to move from the ghetto of Oakland where we grew up into somewhere safer.  And I have been doing everything I can to bring up my fellow latines.  Look, I know you have a hate boner for success, but my path has done more to dismantle stereotypes, white supremacy, and wealth disparity than a lifetime of a international development career.  Your social science degree has done nothing but tell me and my fellow latines that we are not meant to work in tech because thats for white people.

And hey,

""But you're right, I'm a white worshipping Indian""

At least you can admit it."

How come? lol,"I think it's just common at any college to joke about the chancellor/president
![gif](giphy|eMU5zptKfFBDWUyvc6)
Before her was Chancellor ""Daddy"" Dirks, who also got memed to high heaven. But her namesake probably helped the student body paint her as the 'savior' of the university in otherwise dark times-- she took over just after the Milo fiasco and after Dirks was found to be misappropriating public funds. This was all in the midst of the worsening political climate in America, etc.

I think it is kind of wild that she came out of retirement for this stint as chancellor, and made bank doing it. I am a little concerned about her health, though; she appeared a bit diminished at commencements this year.
Thank god you included her middle initial, I would’ve been so lost otherwise
I haven’t kept up with the Christ memes since after 2018 but Dirks was meme’d relentlessly during my time at Cal. More so than I ever saw Christ get meme’d online at least.

It’s just the nature of being in the highest profile position related to the university. You see it happen with POTUS too.
I think she's pretty well-liked, and that why she's meme'd most memes I see her are very positive, unlike other Chancellor's like George Blumenthal of UCSC. Actually i'm pretty confident she's well liked.
she (or her staff as her) just sends a lot of emails about random nonsense that nobody cares about. Most people will never meet her or have any particular reason to care
She is our savior
You don’t know? 😮
She almost makes a ridiculous amount of money for just essentially what looks like public appearances, while moffit looks how it looks. So tbh I’m a #Carolhater

So I work at the library… we just hired 4 students and they are getting trained rn. So far, only 3 students, and myself, are signed up to start working past 10pm.

BRUH YEA WHERE R MOFFIT EMPLOYEES LOL
mad respect for library workers (i work on campus too!) and understandable that not everyone wants to or can work past a certain time! but with the recent library hours uproar many people have come out to say that theyve applied for library jobs indicating availability during late night hours and still not received replies or been rejected. i remember someone posting a few weeks ago that they emailed asking about when hours would be extended and received a reply saying they wouldnt be extended until dead week? i could be remembering wrong, but either way nobody really has any idea of what is happening behind the scenes and it’s confusing when work study applications are being rejected/unlooked at while theyve been touting staffing shortages the entire semester

Same! But i think we're safe since the audit is going after the rich donor kids
The newer posts say they admitted children of staff and donors regardless of qualification so I think it's the other way.
Are you white? Are you an out of state student?
In state and Asian Female
why are you asking if they're an OOS student?

OOS students on average have noticeably better stats than in-state students.
Did you possibly have some impressive extra curricular (like research or something)? Or maybe you’re a really good writer and your essays were amazing?
Because they pay more and therefor admission are more incentivized to admit someone who might not have the stats when they will provide more money to the school
Admissions has yearly quotas to fill for in and out of state students. They are never actually directly compared in the admissions process.
Maybe you didn't see what I wrote:  OOS students on average have noticeably better stats than in-state students.
She did not. She straight up said she had bad stats and doesn’t know why she got in in the original comment I replied too. This is 100% completely irrelevant to this case. It’s like you think averages apply to individuals even when they specifically state that are not average lol"
The Order of the Golden Bear is experimenting with immortality on Carol Christ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q7iqpm/the_order_of_the_golden_bear_is_experimenting/,2021-10-13 12:30:47,"Okay so a less-than-well-known part of Berkeley is the Order of the Golden Bear ([http://ogb.berkeley.edu/](http://ogb.berkeley.edu/)).  I overheard some people in a library talking about the next meeting of the order and they mentioned some coordinates (specifically 37.8720, -122.2553). So being the forensic investigator that I am, I went on a little trip. Upon arrival to Senior Hall, which is near the Faculty Club, you realize that the main entrance to the building opens up to a room much shorter than the actual size of the building. I then walked outside and saw there was a secret door on the outside to get into a special room, but it was locked. So the order meets in a little room behind a false fireplace and wall in Senior Hall. 

Upon hearing conversation between these two members, I gained insight into their true purpose. Now everyone knows that Carol Christ (will be referred to as Carol) is our Chancellor and wants to stay that way. The conversation that I heard had something to do with ""extending the life of the order."" Now its painfully obvious that the order is experimenting on developing a cure for death, but to be specifically used on Carol. That's why the room is locked, so the knowledge doesn't leak out past their super secret invite only society.

TLDR: Carol's new order is making her never die in a secret room.","Is this a new copypasta?

You may be ironic and trying to be sarcastic, but it is a first for the campus, and one we should be proud of.
Definitely not the case. I've known her for a few years, and she's an incredibly competent leader - selfless, hardworking, very accessible and communicative, and very committed to Berkeley. She's been on the front lines in some of the biggest issue areas, from reviewing Berkeley processes vis a vis sexual violence and harassment to chairing the task force that looked at the future of student housing to managing the budget deficit reduction. She's a great choice in all respects.
She was one of the finalists about a decade ago when Chancellor Birgeneau was selected, before she left for Smith.
She's also a fantastic writer and literary critic. 
Where can we read about her platform? How does she intend to fix our budget? How does she intend to fix student housing issues? How does she intend to revitalize donor and alumni relations and fundraising?

Hi, it is your self-proclaimed dating expert NotCarolChrist here to provide you with some tips to dating.

Now, here are the obvious ones:

1. Dress well
2. Be sociable
3. Initiate Conversation

Whoever has told you these things is lying to you. Go up to them and slap/punch them in their faces.

You see, the true secret that they have been hiding from you is that by trying to do these things, you've been doing everything wrong. Here are the **REAL** tips.

**Tip #1: Use your meal plan.**

They say muscles and organs remember better than the brain. What better way to monumentalize your first date than with food poisoning?

**Tip #2: Preach about Denero.**

You may have a crush on someone, but we all know your true love and devotion is to Denero. You must  make that very clear, to the point where you might think it's creepy how obssessed you are in hindsight, but trust me, -690% of the time it works 420% of the time.

**Tip #3: Become OSKI**

Everyone loves Oski.

**Bonus Tip: Start Talking about the Rice Purity Test**

Nothing charms a person more than interrogating them with a blatant disrespect for their privacy and boundaries on their personal experiences!

Thus, I offer you 3 more tips to fix your relationship (which you don't have, yet).

**Tip #1:** **If you're in MET, spam it.**

Clearly you need to mention it every 0.5 seconds that you're MET like it's a basic human need like breathing or something. After all, they clearly didn't hear and/or understand it the first 400 times. After all, they aren't in MET, amirite? (Nice MET majors are lame).

So if you live in Clark Kerr, bring your date there. If you want to start a relationship with a person living in dorms, find someone from Clark Kerr. Has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that Clark Kerr is close to frat houses and is allegedly filled with bigger rooms and hotter people.

What do you think about Chancellor Carol Christ's goal of making Berkeley a hispanic-serving institite (HSI),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ag05es/what_do_you_think_about_chancellor_carol_christs/,2019-01-14 12:44:19,"Berkeley chancellor has a goal of making the school a HSI, meaning that at least 25% of students are hispanic. What do student on campus think of this?
Seems really hard to implement without indirectly compromising asian and white students. It also seems to be a racial quota, which of course is racial discrimination.","Remember that becoming an HSI makes the campus eligible for certain grants from the federal government.  
Given that California's population is 40% or more Hispanic these days, why would a public state university's student population reflecting the population of the state it's supposed to serve be a bad thing?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_California_Proposition_209), 

>Proposition 209 is a California ballot proposition which, upon approval in November 1996, amended the state constitution to prohibit state governmental institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity, specifically in the areas of public employment, public contracting, and public education.

I wonder how she plans on achieving this goal without breaking the law.

Edit: It seems she answered that in [in this message](https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/08/20/a-warm-welcome-and-updates-on-the-budget-housing-free-speech/)

>We also must expand our African American and Native American student populations. To achieve these goals within the confines of California law, we will assess our entire admissions process from outreach to yield, and work even more closely with Bridges, our student group that does excellent work with recruitment.

In other words, while their admission cannot consider race, their recruitment program can. 
Is there a link to the HSI initiative? 
Finally. Berkeley needs more people of color.
How come you're on this sub trying to stir up shit?
I don't think Carol said the racial groups you mentioned would be displaced. Engineering degrees, which have been emphasized typically requires specialization that might give preferential admission.
[deleted]
She won’t be breaking the law — her HSI conversations center more along the lines of adopting policies akin to the UCLA [Prop 209 primer](https://equity.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Prop-209-FAQs-primer-2016-12-05.pdf), which is legal. 

Part of the reason UCLA has maintained more equitable enrollment (I.e. looking more like California’s student youth) is because their administration recognized that the campus should place emphasis on recruiting and retaining underrepresented minority students without regard to admissions. This means encouraging minority students to engage with the university during their time in high school or community college in hopes of them applying and matriculating. 

Obviously we can respectfully disagree on this; I personally feel like this initiative is in line with our university’s public mission, and it is not taking resources or admission away from other identities, merely encouraging stellar underrepresented students from all over California to apply and enroll at Berkeley. 


Outreach programs? Unless you go full racial superiority mode, the Hispanic population in the area should at least translate somewhat to the student population.

You can look at the CS vs EECS gender split. CS these days is more like 60:40 while EECS is still 80 20. Exposure and availability can be a big part of why demographics are what they are.
it was in an email the Carol Christ sent out 
r/asablackman
[deleted]
The monies for recruitment and retention is allocated in our university’s funding and in part by the state. I understand you feel that it’s discrimination and I accept that — I personally disagree. Using funds to encourage URM students to apply and matriculate is inevitable, and the initiatives in conversation are merely articulating how funds will be used. Moreover, it is not making admissions ‘easier’ for anyone and race is never disclosed in the admissions process. 

Speaking as a non-urm, I do not want our campus to let 209 completely eradicate diversity of the student body (well not even diversity, but merely having the state’s flagship university look nothing like the state’s public) while other universities thrive by having common sense policies. In my opinion we should not freak out over a public university wanting to maintain access to the public, and we should also consider just how different Berkeley is in terms of enrollment than any other public university in the country."
How Berkeley chancellor Carol Christ plan to reduce deficit,http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/27/incoming-uc-berkeley-chancellor-lays-out-plan-to-reduce-budget-deficit/,2017-07-02 18:31:17,,
"Carol Christ's latest email on the violence on Sunday doesn't even mention Antifa, let alone condemn them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6wpaca/carol_christs_latest_email_on_the_violence_on/,2017-08-28 22:46:21,"I had high hope for Christ's leadership, but this message falls short. The violence on Sunday, based on the video evidence, came solely from Antifa, and she takes this time to fervently condemn white-supremacy which is all fine and good except the rally was anti-communism and the organizer (a trans woman) explicitly denounced the Alt-right. She also very much downplays the violence (or maybe Berkeley standards are just warped) but I watched the live stream for about 30 minutes and saw many individuals being attacked by mobs dressed in all black with their faces covered. Why is it so difficult for these people to NAME THE ENEMY or be honest about what's going on. Does Christ really have something to lose in condemning Antifa? Trump wouldn't name the problem in Charlotteville, now Christ won't in Berkeley. Disappointed. 

Dear campus community,

I am writing out of deep concern for the multiple communities affected by the rash of violent rallies that hate and bigotry have spawned across our country.  Like Berkeley’s Mayor Jesse Arreguin, I applaud the thousands who protested peacefully in Berkeley yesterday against such hatred and prejudice; I am glad there was relatively little violence and, like the Mayor, I condemn it.  Questions have been raised about the specific measures we chose to protect our campus and community in yesterday’s protests. As with any event involving security on this scale, we will evaluate whether the steps we took were effective in protecting our community.  We invite your feedback; our primary goal is the safety of the community and the exercise of the right to non-violent protest. 

The bigotry and racism of recent rallies across the country are loathsome; they violate our values as a nation, and they violate our values as a university community.  Even as we uphold the right of free speech as guaranteed in the constitution, we must speak out about odious ideas that devalue the full humanity of groups in our society and that sow hatred and division.  We will provide even more opportunities for groups, including those who have experienced prejudice, to have platforms for more speech, speech that reflects our values as a campus, celebrates diversity, builds unity, and values all identities. We will make the necessary expenditures to keep people safe. These are unplanned expenses that come amid our budget crisis.  While certainly there are other needed uses for this money, we must prioritize the safety and security of our community.   

This is a moment when our core values are threatened—not only free speech but reason, tolerance, inclusion, diversity, and non-violent protest.  I wrote in my introductory message to the campus that my first goal as chancellor is to foster community.  I invite your suggestions for ways in which we can best achieve that goal in the challenging weeks ahead.

Sincerely,


Carol Christ
Chancellor
chancellor@berkeley.edu

","I don't get it? She never mentioned in the letter that she condemns white supremacy alone and not antifa. She states that she doesn't condem bigotry and racism, pointing out to both of the groups 
[deleted]
If you think the mayor and BPD chief don't support ANTIFA at this point you just aren't paying attention. ANTIFA have free reigns to do whatever they want in this city and no one can stop them. The police will always back down to them.
Campus was 100% secure this weekend. The rally occurred in MLK park and wasn't the responsibility of the UCPD to secure. Also there were dozens of BPD out at the rally decked out in hardcore gear, I really doubt that 2x more would have changed anything. But what Berkeley resident doesn't realize this?
lol how were you not able to figure out which office she holds when her email is chancellor@berkeley.edu
Or maybe they don't wanna start a riot over a park? At a certain point, let the bloody people be. Overpolicing is imagining that the police have the answer to everything, when in reality their presence is oftentimes a source of a fair few problems.
If you think the BPD chief and mayor supporting ANTIFA isn't a bad thing when they do you try to deny it?
I never said whether I support it, nor whether it's a good or bad thing. Because it's simply not a thing, not even remotely one. Otherwise why even bother arresting those antifa yesterday? If they're so brazen, why bother? Hell, why not let the cops loose on the Nazis, instead of restrainedly arresting the violent ones? Why shield them from the crowd?

Your negative trolling isn't very good tbh. Nobody actually believes you're a socialist.
ANTIFA run the entire city of Berkeley, they are a de facto vigilante police force. They can do what they want, when they want, and no one can stop them. The cops never have and never will try to get in their way, that's just how it is in this city.

ANTIFA knows they run this city too, that's why they can do what they do (beating the shit out of anyone they want to in broad daylight at a public park) and not have to face any consequences. Stop playing stupid.

Have questions about coronavirus and the campus's response? UC Berkeley administrators are here to take your questions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fdiv30/have_questions_about_coronavirus_and_the_campuss/,2020-03-04 12:08:28,"Hi Reddit,

This is /u/michaeldirda from the chancellor’s office - you may remember me from such threads as [Chancellor Christ’s first AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/) and [Chancellor Christ’s second AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/).

There is clearly a great degree of anxiety on campus about coronavirus and how it will affect the Berkeley community. In an effort to more clearly communicate what we know and how the administration is responding to the outbreak, I am posting this thread to compile questions you may have related to the virus and its implications for campus. Over the next few days, I’ll track down various senior administrators - Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Steve Sutton, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services Guy Nicolette, UHS Medical Director Anna Harte, and others - for responses to your concerns, and will post their answers in this thread.

Thanks to /u/lulzcakes for helping us put this plan into action. I know that this is an important topic and the administration wants to be as transparent with and responsive to our students as possible. Looking forward to your questions.

**Edit March 6, 11 a.m.:** I am posting responses we've been able to assemble to date - the information presented is current as of this morning. I didn't present administrators with all of the questions as many repeated similar points - so please read through the thread if you feel like we didn't get to your question, it may have just been addressed elsewhere.

For the *most up-to-date* info on how this affects campus, visit: https://news.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/

For questions or concerns related to your health: https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-information","We've seen time and time again over the past 3 years that the campus continues to respond **reactively** instead of **proactively**, and I think that is the cause of a lot of the current disillusion in campus response. 

When this blows over, how do we, the student body, show our support and desire for the campus to take significantly more **proactive** measures? Who or what do we support to get more resources put into campus disaster preparedness?
As a student with a compromised immune system, I am concerned that the administration is not taking enough preventative action, such as encouraging faculty to shift course content to bcourses. There seems to be a false attitude on social media that the virus only holds consequences for those in advanced age, and the response in recent emails from administration seem to perpetuate that. The student body is a diverse one, and each individual body has varying ability to fight a potential infection from coronavirus. However, sacrificing health (and the health of others) to attend class or take an exam for the sake of grades shouldn’t be a choice students of the number one public university be forced to make. Even if it was the end of the world, Cal bears would still do everything in our power to stay on track to our degree. 

While I understand the administration doesn’t act as every student’s medical advisor, what will they do to ensure an equal academic opportunity to succeed for those who acquire the virus? 

How will they proceed, sooner rather than later, to protect all students equally from coronavirus?
Once we get a confirmed case on campus, is your current plan to move all classes virtually or cancel them entirely? If they’re cancelled, will we be on standby? Will this shift classes over a semester and therefore delay graduation? 

What are your plans for actively sanitizing the campus? 

What happens to the students living in the dorms, 45 person halls, 360 person buildings? Will you advise us to go home? Self quarantine? 

Why are you waiting for a confirmed case on campus when we already know that there is probably already someone infected and spreading it? What happens when the cal population gets mass infected?
Most of us live with roommates in close quarters. If one of us gets sick, how should the rest of us react? How do we keep ourselves from being infected? Do we also quarantine ourselves and not go to class? Will classes be webcasted? Will professors excuse us from mandatory labs/attendance? 
Should we yeet ourselves to stanfurd to assert our dominance? (/s)
I've heard when a professor was asked by a student feeling under the weather if they could be accommodated for their midterm, the professor referred to the universities' (lack of) response and said there was nothing they could do. So as of right now people that might have the virus are forced to close contact with hundreds of students.
In multiple classes now, for example EE16B, course staff have made adjustments such that while it is possible to avoid the upcoming exam, it's still objectively better for your grade to take it.

As a result, multiple people on Piazza have said that they are sick, but are not willing to jeopardize their grade, so they are planning on attending the midterm.

Will administration enforce policies that allow people who highly suspect they have coronavirus to avoid large events without objectively harming their grade?

I feel that if you want to self-quarantine, you should be able to do so without being penalized in the class. Otherwise no one is going to self quarantine.
Verified.

Please remain respectful and professional in your questions. No trolling or mean behavior.

This thread will be in contest mode until the answers start coming in. After which it will switch to Q&A mode.
What conditions have to be met for you to justifiably (by your definition) cancel classes? 

Like another person has stated, spring break starts in a month. Considering that there is already a case in Berkeley, it’s probably safe to say that some number of people on campus will get sick by spring break, and if they return home it would spread the disease even further. Cancelling classes EARLY would probably help.
Speaking genuinely, not as a troll, it's safe to say (at least in my experience) that your past actions or lack thereof in response to various crises the campus has faced within the last year has shot a lot of your credibility with the student population. Simply put I and many others I've met do not trust you to properly take our health and safety into account in your decision making. What are you doing to rebuild this trust and put student interests first?

Are there any plans to shift classes or at least exams substantially online? Many people's classes have mandatory in-person attendance.

I understand not wanting to substantially affect things or cause a panic, but trust me when I say the hit to your reputation will be far worse when a large group of students gets sick.
1) Given the high density of people in the dorms, it's possible that just a few people could infect huge numbers of people. What is the administration doing to be proactive in high risk situations like this? 

2) What is the recommendation on travel outside the US? Not just countries with restrictions already imposed, but anywhere. In the case that students are stuck in other countries, what can they do?

3) At what point would the administration consider canceling class (or going webcast only)? 

4) How can you ensure that students know what they need to? This thread is already filled with questions, and there's a lot of uncertainty about what to do. I think a helpful suggestion would be releasing the minutes for the multitude of council and group meetings referenced in the emails sent to students.
Let’s say hypothetically it’s found in the student body on campus.

What is the administration going to do regarding the feeding of freshman who are not able to go home in the event of a cancellation of classes? Crossroads and the rest of these densely packed dining halls will become breeding grounds. What is the plan to safely feed thousands of students?
Why hasn’t UC Berkeley already taken strong action in the form of cancelling classes/shifting them to all online? By the time the first confirmed case is on campus, the virus would have already spread massively because of the two week incubation period. Also, what will happen for the dorms? Once the virus is in the dorms it will spread like absolute wildfire.
1) Are there protocols being developed to deep-clean/disinfect classrooms, public spaces, campus shuttles, etc to mitigate the spread of the virus?

2) Will SHIP cover testing costs for the virus? Will the Tang center be testing students?

3) Does campus administration advise against traveling over spring break?

4) What are the (quantitative if possible) criteria for deciding to cancel class? Who has the final authority on this?

5) Will large on-campus events (sports, shows at zellerbach, etc) be cancelled even if classes aren't yet? These seem to be higher-stakes places in terms of virus spread, and lower stakes academically.
How will you support students who rely on dining halls and live in residence halls without creating a breeding ground for the virus?
How severe does Coronavirus need to get in order for the campus to be closed? Also what is the plan of action if the virus is found in a densely populated place such as the dorms?
Why are we waiting for students to get sick on campus before doing anything? Given all the data and what's going on in other countries, shouldn't the response be to help prevent/slow the rate of spread? We are lucky that we weren't the first few countries that were affected, and as a university, we should use this time and information to prepare and implement adequate measures now before things get out of hand.
Hey I just wanna say: you making a space to ask these questions is more than any other administrator has publicly done regarding this situation. I'm comfortable with the fact that it's extremely likely that I (and the 43 people I live with) will contract the virus but fear I will be unable to see my family (they're all 55+) until a vaccine is made (which at current estimates could be literal years before public release). Basically all I'm saying is thank you for trying your best to provide some attempt at comfort and access to information, something the admin has yet to do.
Will teachers be required to have webcasts in the coming week? Or is the administration waiting for a confirmed case on campus (which feels like waiting too long).
As a physician and Cal student, why do you base your information so much on the CDC?

You were saying ‘no community cases’ in your emails in a period where the CDC wasn’t even testing community cases. I am frankly disappointed in the health measures taken so far, especially for an academic institution with so many students. The amount of cases double every 3 days, and are probably already massively spreading in campus.

There is no need for panic, but there clearly is a need for an immediate switch to online courses to slow the spread and overburden of the healthcare system. The results will be way worse if you do not do this in time.’
Given that the incubation period is about 2 weeks, it’s very probably that some students might already have the virus. That being said, If classes are canceled sometime soon, how can students get tested for corona virus? The last thing I would want to do is go back home and risk the possibility of infecting my relatives
What are you actually doing to help mitigate the effect once it reaches UC Berkeley. Not something like “ we are taking the necessary precautions”
Hey! Thank you so much for this. Obviously there’s been recent developments in America, particularly in Washington state and the Bay Area in the growing number of cases for the coronavirus. I’m particularly scared because there’s so many big groups and students in general on campus and in lecture halls. I know there has been one confirmed case in Berkeley and another in Alameda county and the amount of people who might have the coronavirus in our extended community might be more than the mainstream news predicts there to be. In what ways can us students ensure our safety and in what ways will campus ensure our safety as well(I.e online lectures, etc) ? Again, thank you so much for this.
Can we close campus until spring break? Imagine if students get infected and then go home to our families because they’re still in their incubation period...

Please don’t wait until the first case on campus. By then it would be too late.
Can you officially require all classes to be webcasted and all exams to be take-home/online immediately? Even if it takes a bit of time for everyone to get adjusted, it will be much better than risking to wait until a confirmed case appears on campus. And right now it seems like even the people who want to get tested for the virus cannot due to the requirements and the lack of available test kits.

One example of the authorities not taking preventive measures when they had a chance to is South Korea. By the time the government took actions it was too late; now there are thousands of cases, pretty much all businesses are paralyzed, and everybody in Korea wants to impeach the president. Can we please learn from other countries and be wiser about this?

If the university is forced to shut down for an extended period of time, how will this affect tuition and financial aid? And would classes be postponed or will they move to an online format?
[https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2020/coronavirus-map/](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2020/coronavirus-map/) (Depicts 64 cases in the bay area alone)

With Stanford moving classes online why haven't we? Who does it hurt to move classes online?
why have almost none of these questions been addressed?
Will test kits be provided so that students can be tested before they go home to see their relatives.
Several classes, such as EE126, have noted that no plans will be made to accommodate remote lectures unless there is cancellation or a requirement by the university to do so. This is in spite of the messages of encouragement made by the school in the last week. It is clear that recommendation and encouragement are not going to sway many courses to move instruction online. What is the university going to do in order to more concretely make sure these classes transition smoothly in the event of cancellation?
What measures can we take to get tested for coronavirus?

I was in 3 of the Level 3 risk countries 1.25 months ago and have suffered cold symptoms that have gotten worse since then with added chills, cough, and trouble breathing. When I tried booking an appointment UHS they were pretty rude and have made it kind of impossible to book appointments to get tested, even after explaining my symptoms and informing them of the countries I've been to.
I am a prospective PhD student and I will be visiting UC Berkeley from another state that does not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19. Should I limit handshaking with faculty and grad students?
Adminsitration, please read these short guidance published by China CDC 2 days ago throughly. It covers everything about COVID19 aka SARS-COV-2.

 [http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-03/03/c\_77246.htm](http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-03/03/c_77246.htm)
Can the campus officials please start being more proactive and make it a policy to webcast rather than simply encouraging professors to webcast? Some of my professors haven’t done anything about this. Additionally, club meetings should be put on hold for a while. 

For one of my classes, it’s still not webcasted and we are still required to turn our homework in during class every week and my professor is still hoping to have our midterm in person. One class is webcasting but we get extra credit if we attend 2/3 of lectures so many still want to go. We should not have to put our lives in danger to save/help our grades. 

A few of my classes have told people to stop coming if they’re sick. However, because of the incubation period, we could all be sick and not know it for another two weeks or so. 

I’m almost certain that some people on campus have the virus by now and by the time one is confirmed, it’ll have spread like crazy.
Require all instructors to provide lecture webcasts and make online discussion sections or refund some part of our tuition, please.
How do you respond to the issue of masks particularly the n95? It seems like the administration is stating they are useless but in many countries they are credited with helping stop the spread. What is your opinion on PPE for the general public?
is administration taking any steps to be proactive rather than reactive? is there a certain defined limit where further actions will be taken, or is that up in the air currently?
Please suspend all classes in person immediately. 

Put everything online. 

Lectures, exams, homework everything. 

People will die if you take inaction. 

Students I suggest you involve your parents to call the office of your respective college to take you safety as the highest importance. 

Do you want to die because you filled in a scantron?

Are R1B classes considered lecture courses? Are they included in the mandate to be held online by tomorrow? Thanks!
Preface: we all still really appreciate that yall are reaching out in this manner.

1. Should professors be taking attendance on zoom? My house didn't have internet for two days but my professor still marked me absent and brought my grade down. I don't think this is fair and I know many other students think the same. We knew that zoom would come with some problems but some professors have completely disregarded this fact. Teaching via zoom cannot work out the same as in-person.
I'd go to campus to get internet but that defeats the purpose of canceling classes. 

2. This is for international students at Berkeley. What happens if an international student contracts the virus?  Are they just put on a cargo plane back to their countries or are they treated? Some international students only have SHIP as health insurance and that definitely wouldn't cover medical expenses.

3. People have said this and I'll say it again, if only one student in the dorms contracted the virus (which would take 14 days to even be noticed), they'll infect a minimum of like 50 more students because the amount of contact in dorms is insane and students are just going everywhere around Berkeley just casually touching anything.
We are all currently living through a GLOBAL crisis. I personally have a lot of people that I care about that are being impacted by this pandemic fall out. In light of the times, I am not feeling secure, and I am just one of many. 

How is the university going to care for students that face real mental health and physical health declines over this global crisis?

Under normal operations, I am considered a disabled student and require certain accommodations. I know that for myself, I learn much, much, better with in-person classroom learning. 

With this disorienting, abrupt switch to online classes for all, what other accommodations will there be for the students, faculty, and staff?
How likely is it that Covid-19 will mutate into a strain that could re-infect the population that has already been infected with the original strain? 

Do the chances of these types of mutations go up with the number of people infected? (I.e. number of virus replication cycles?)
Do we know when we will have an update about classes after spring break? This uncertainty is seriously stressing me out
**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

The campus is taking this and other major campus disruptions very seriously. Some of the issues we’ve seen have been truly unprecedented - for instance, massive Public Safety Power Shutoffs in urban areas with no advance notice had simply not occurred before this past fall. We are learning from these emergencies, and developing a mindset of expecting the unexpected: See our Academic Resilience effort - https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/10/28/a-new-collaborative-and-resilient-approach-to-instruction-at-uc-berkeley/ - and the UC task force that was convened after the 2018 wildfires as examples.

In regards to student input, we truly welcome it. This is a great forum and I’m thankful for the thoughts that are being shared on Reddit. We would particularly love to hear from students what is working and what is not working with regard to remote class participation, so we can catalogue best practices and work on issues. If you have thoughts on that, please share them here (or with Jenn Stringer, our Deputy Chief Information Officer).
THIS. I’ve been forced to attend lectures with an “upper respiratory virus” because Profs and Admins refused to accommodate me. No online lectures, voice recordings or even notes. Either I infect people, and make myself feel worse, or I fail physics, what kind of choice is that?
^^^this. This person person should not have to risk their life (at a far higher extent than the rest of us) in order to avoid failing their class/classes.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services and Anna Harte, UHS Medical Director:**

This is an important point - most CDC and public health comments have been focused on age demographics. But like most infections, any person with a serious chronic medical condition or immune compromise is at higher risk.  UHS will add this aspect into more of our communications (we often promote infection control not only to prevent individual illness, but to protect our most vulnerable populations).

**Paul Alivisatos, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost:**

Regarding your first question, we are making a commitment to ensuring that any students who have been directed to self-isolate or have been quarantined can continue to fully participate in class.

Regarding the second, there are many protocols that we have or are putting in place to protect our community, and they touch nearly every aspect of the campus: We are encouraging instructors to move classes online and facilitating this change. We are asking instructors to relax attendance rules. We are building guidelines for student travel. We are developing telecommuting guidelines for staff. We are weighing whether to hold large events on campus, with guidance from local health authorities. RSSP is creating contingency plans for what will happen if and when a campus community member tests positive for COVID-19. We have and will continue to communicate these issues in regular emails about the situation. Up-to-date information is also available here: https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-information

**Ella Callow, Director, Disability Access & Compliance | Chief ADA/504 Compliance Officer:**

Disabled students have a right to be safe and healthy, *and* get their education. The tools are in place right now to help facilitate this. If going to class is a risk for you due to coronavirus, go to your Disabled Students’ Program Specialist. Talk to them about amending your Letter of Accommodation to include that the class must be made accessible to you through the use of the Instructional Resilience resources available to professors and GSIs. If you haven’t used DSP services yet, go online and check them out here https://dsp.berkeley.edu/. You can submit medical documentation of your condition, and set an appointment with a specialist to see if you qualify for this accommodation. They are super-devoted to their jobs and will do all they can do to move the process quickly. Also, if you want to check out the suite of Instructional Resilience resources available to you, professors, GSIs, and groups of students (lectures, labs, and study/project groups), you can do so here: https://teaching.berkeley.edu/instructional-resilience-teaching-and-learning-technologies. There is a great “Tips and Resources” section that breaks down what resource to use for what - e.g. for access to lectures, professors or GSIs can add you to class by Zoom, or record the lecture and place it on bCourses. For asynchronous “Threaded Discussions,” the professor or GSI can use bCourses Discussions. 

Also, denial of reasonable accommodations contained in DSP issued letters of accommodation may be a violation of UCOP PACAOS 20: Policy on Non-discrimination, and PACAOS 140: Guidelines Applying to Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Disability. If you feel that your rights have been violated, please file a grievance with the Office of Disability Access & Compliance here: https://dac.berkeley.edu/dac-requests-and-forms.
This. What are you going to do when this inevitably gets into campus regarding feeding freshmen? Crossroads will become a breeding ground.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services:**

This has largely been answered elsewhere, but we will absolutely need to isolate those with coronavirus infection if cases are found; my expectation is that we will need to do both: move some healthy students out of rooms and at other times move ill students out.
Yup. Happened to me.
I think it is incredibly irresponsible to not cancel the in person exam. There are many other ways we can be tested that do not require an in person exam.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services:**

If you highly suspect you have the virus - i.e. you have fever or cough/difficulty breathing AND you have traveled to any area with sustained transmission within the 2 weeks before symptoms start OR you have had contact with a proven case - you should call your healthcare provider (for faculty/staff) or the UHS Advice Line (for students) at (510) 643-7197 immediately for advice. This does not necessarily mean you have the virus, but you should put on a mask and get assessed ASAP. Strict CDC guidelines determine who can be tested for coronavirus; these are updated regularly as the situation evolves.

**Ella Callow, Director, Disability Access & Compliance | Chief ADA/504 Compliance Officer:**

The Cal messages that were sent out on March 2 and March 4 (below) from the Provost and Chair of the Academic Senate address some of your concerns:

March 2:
https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/02/how-uc-berkeley-instructors-are-preparing-for-the-spread-of-coronavirus/
March 4: https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/04/an-update-on-how-uc-berkeley-instructors-are-preparing-for-coronavirus/

We also wish to emphasize that students who are ill are protected by our policies on non-discrimination and non-discrimination on the basis of disability, specifically (UCOP PACAOS Policy 20 and related PACAOS Guideines 140, respectively). If necessary, they should request an accommodation from the Disabled Students Program which will assess if they qualify for academic accommodations based on their medical documentation.

In addition, students should review the accommodations for absences due to illness guidelines that are posted on the accommodations hub: https://evcp.berkeley.edu/programs-resources/academic-accommodations-hub
Hello lulzcakes!  Will you help UCSB with our activism?? We desperately need help!  Thanks!


https://www.change.org/p/ucsb-close-the-ucsb-campus-to-stop-the-wuhan-coronavirus
**Paul Alivisatos, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost:**

We are monitoring conditions on campus and in very close contact with the CDC and local public health officials (Berkeley Public Health and others). We would use their expert guidance, as well as consultation with the UC Office of the President, to make a decision like this. It is likely we would require all classes to move online before making the decision to cancel them.
Would love to see them respond to your first question (they wont)
This needs to be upvoted into oblivion
**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

Thank you for this comment. Without a doubt, the past few years have seen major, widespread, and unprecedented challenges for Berkeley - AQI issues, power outages, and now COVID-19 - and we understand your frustration that the campus has not always gotten everything right in dealing with these issues. Please know that as a campus we are learning from these cases and refining how we handle emergencies: after the wildfires in 2018, for instance, Berkeley staff and others across the UC system assembled this report on emergency management, (https://www.ucop.edu/enterprise-risk-and-resilience/_files/systemwideaqwg_report_final_20190925.pdf) and after the power outages began a significant effort focused on how we can serve our academic mission when facing large-scale disruption (https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/10/28/a-new-collaborative-and-resilient-approach-to-instruction-at-uc-berkeley/). One thing we are committed to is developing better strategies for in-the-moment communication, which is a reason we’re posting here, in addition to sending out frequent email updates to the campus.

Student health and safety are absolutely our first thought and primary motivation in all decisions the campus makes in emergency situations. Sometimes the situations change very quickly and we have to play catch-up (AQI issues); sometimes the expert guidance we rely on is incomplete (COVID-19). While we want to be proactive in making changes to ensure safety, we also have to balance this with the the impact of curtailing campus operations, which can be hugely disruptive to everything from course schedules to event planning to research experiments.

Others have responded to the online classes piece in more detail elsewhere, but I’ll just note that we are strongly recommending instructors make material available virtually and relax attendance rules. More info is here: https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/02/how-uc-berkeley-instructors-are-preparing-for-the-spread-of-coronavirus/
I’m curious about number one as well. If a student were to get sick, what would he do? Go back their dorm to infect their roommates and floor mates? Take transport home, and get everyone on the plane/train/bus sick? Stay in the hospital until no longer contagious?
> 1) Given the high density of people in the dorms, it's possible that just a few people could infect huge numbers of people. What is the administration doing to be proactive in high risk situations like this?

**Steve Sutton, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs**

We are currently bringing in an existing outside vendor to provide deep cleaning services for dorms and other spaces. I responded more fully to this above, but RSSP has plans in place to move students who are confirmed to have COVID-19 to isolation spaces (with beds, showers, kitchenette) and to have food delivered to them. If experts believe that multiple people within a dorm/floor have been exposed, we plan on quarantining floors and again providing food delivery. 

> 2) What is the recommendation on travel outside the US? Not just countries with restrictions already imposed, but anywhere. In the case that students are stuck in other countries, what can they do?

**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

Our recommendation is to follow CDC guidance, which currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. The CDC is advising social distancing strategies, including staying home for 14 days, for individuals returning from these countries.  Please check the travel guidance on our website for more info: https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/guidance-traveling

> 3) At what point would the administration consider canceling class (or going webcast only)?

**Oliver O'Reilly, Academic Senate Chair:**

This has been answered largely elsewhere, but it would be a decision made with guidance from health authorities and from UCOP.

> 4) How can you ensure that students know what they need to? This thread is already filled with questions, and there's a lot of uncertainty about what to do. I think a helpful suggestion would be releasing the minutes for the multitude of council and group meetings referenced in the emails sent to students.

**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

We aim to release frequent updates to keep the campus informed. We will also use social media channels such as this one. Specific groups (for example, students on study abroad) have or will be receiving relevant information tailored to them. The senior leadership is focused squarely on this issue at the moment, and recognizes that communications is a key piece of it.
Everyone should review information on the CDC’s website:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/takingcare.htm
I second this
Lack of leadership.
**Oliver O'Reilly, Berkeley Academic Senate Chair:**

Our local public health authorities, with whom we are working very closely, have not at this time issued guidance that we cancel or limit classes, events, and gatherings.

Our goal and hope is to be able to continue instruction, modified as necessary. We are actively recommending that faculty use technology to accommodate students and to discourage sick students from coming to campus. To date, many departments have been adopting the recommendations, however we are aware that some have not - I shared a message with department chairs last night to strongly encourage they do so. Should the public health officials advise the campus community to limit time spent in close physical proximity to each other, faculty who adopted the recommendations will enable the campus to maintain instructional continuity and ensure that students will continue to make academic progress. Instructors who haven’t adopted the recommendations will be in a very difficult position and may be unable to continue teaching their courses. This will put their students in an even more challenging position and will put the faculty member at odds with their responsibilities.

---

**Steve Sutton, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs:**

We are working with an existing outside vendor to provide deep cleaning services for dorms and other public spaces. Residential & Student Service Programs has plans in place for moving students who are confirmed to have COVID-19 to isolation spaces (with beds, showers, kitchenette) and food delivery from Cal Dining.  To the extent that public health experts believe that multiple people within a dorm/floor have been exposed, we plan on quarantining floors (e.g., limiting usage to specific rooms, bathrooms) and again providing food delivery from Cal Dining.

We recognize that students with disabilities may face higher risks of contracting and/or experiencing complications from the virus, particularly if they also have chronic medical conditions. This means that all scenarios we are modeling around housing take this into account, and since people often have multiple disabilities, that is part of our equation, too.
I’m not an Infectious Disease specialist but I did part of my medical training at the NIH with Dr. Fauci. There is a lot of unknown about Covid19 but we do know one thing and that is each individual’s unique immune response and underlying health condition will determine how severely they will be affected. Having said that, with the large student body at Cal it is best to take early action to PREVENT the spread of this infection in large classrooms and crowded dormitories. Getting ahead of this epidemic and preserving the health of the Cal community is and should after all be the most important priority. Without health, the excellent work that Cal students, faculty and scientists can do, will not be done. Many colleges have already moved to online education in an attempt to curtail the spread. It’s not about if, it’s about WHEN? We thank all of you, Chancellor Christ, VC, and everyone involved for working so hard in making the best decision for this incredible community.
> 1) Are there protocols being developed to deep-clean/disinfect classrooms, public spaces, campus shuttles, etc to mitigate the spread of the virus?

**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

The campus has indeed enhanced disinfection and cleaning procedures for common areas. We have expanded our day service to clean and disinfect touch points in public areas, restrooms, and entrances. (e.g. door knobs, elevator buttons, water fountains). We have installed hand sanitizer dispensing stations in high-traffic, visible areas across campus and especially entrances to buildings (though we want to underscore that frequent hand-washing can be more effective than hand sanitizer). We will also be expanding our regular custodial coverage from weekly to daily in classrooms, labs, and conference areas. 

> 2) Will SHIP cover testing costs for the virus? Will the Tang center be testing students?

**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services and Anna Harte, UHS Medical Director:**

There is no cost to students for testing of those people that meet the CDC criteria for testing. Call the UHS Advice Line at 510-643-7197 if you believe you might have this illness, and we will help guide the next steps. Faculty/staff need to contact their healthcare provider, unless they believe they were infected in the course of their required duties at UCN (e.g. healthcare providers, UCPD), in which case they can also contact Occupational Health at (510) 642-6891.

> 3) Does campus administration advise against traveling over spring break?

**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

We are recommending students follow the Centers for Disease Control and  U.S. Department of State recommendations for personal travel. CDC currently advises against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea. Aside from any risk from coronavirus itself, the transportation bans and infrastructure disruption are significant. It is also possible that U.S. borders might close to re-entry from some areas, making it challenging to return.

**Steve Sutton, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs:**

There will soon be a short spring break travel survey from the Division of Student Affairs that will help us understand students’ spring break travel plans. We encourage students who receive an email invitation to please fill out this form, as it helps the campus better prepare. Cal Dining will be providing service over Spring Break for students who remain on campus. There will be service at the Crossroads location Sunday, March 22 through Saturday, March 28, with hours of service to include brunch 10am-4pm and dinner 5pm-8pm. 

> 4) What are the (quantitative if possible) criteria for deciding to cancel class? Who has the final authority on this?

**Oliver O'Reilly, Berkeley Academic Senate Chair:**

The quantitative criteria rest with the public health services. That decision would be made jointly by our leadership, UC system leadership, the City of Berkeley’s Public Health Service (who are in continual contact with the University Health Service) and with CDC guidance.

> 5) Will large on-campus events (sports, shows at zellerbach, etc) be cancelled even if classes aren't yet? These seem to be higher-stakes places in terms of virus spread, and lower stakes academically.

**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

The California Department of Public Health and local public health officials are not recommending the cancellation of public events at this time. In line with that, we are not currently requiring event organizers to cancel on-campus events. Certainly this could change - we are monitoring it closely - and it would not necessarily be tied to a decision about classes.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services and Anna Harte, UHS Medical Director:**

From a public health perspective, we -- in collaboration with the Berkeley Public Health Department -- closely monitor cases and the speed of spread in order to give guidance to the campus. There is no set ‘number’ that automatically triggers any specific action; administration receives regular guidance from  our Emergency Operations team.  Each UC institution will have to make its own decisions, but UCOP would undoubtedly give some guidance as well.  Regarding your second question, we would work quickly to separate sick from well and monitor and support both groups.

**Marc Fisher, Vice Chancellor for Administration:**

I want to point out that the campus never truly “closes”, instead there are degrees of curtailment. We have thousands living in university housing, for instance, and need to feed them, give them a place to sleep, and make sure they’re safe. We have lab animals and experiments that require constant supervision. So the question becomes: What, specifically, do we decide to curtail? Even if classes move online and non-essential events are canceled, our intention is to have housing and dining remain open, along of course with essential services like UHS and UCPD. RSSP is creating contingency plans for these areas looking at questions like how to deliver meals in a different fashion. We will be communicating in more detail to the res life community about these things by early next week if not sooner.
Obviously they’re looking for leadership from the superintendent of schools and the governor.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services and Anna Harte, UHS Medical Director:**

We so appreciate that you are thinking about your family and the community and the importance of avoiding spreading infection where possible. You are right that the risk is higher for older people and staying away from parents or grandparents or anyone with a compromised immune system or serious chronic medical condition is the best thing you can do for them should you become ill.  Hopefully, this virus too will dissipate once the summer comes, if not before. We do not think you will need to wait for a vaccine.

And thank you for your appreciation as well - we are doing what we can for campus to mitigate that spread by advocating reasonable policy and operational change, while avoiding messaging that overly increases fear or worry.  We also understand that isolation from family can precipitate stress, anxiety and feelings of loneliness and our counseling services have multiple points of entry to help students with this.
**Oliver O'Reilly, Academic Senate Chair:**

In brief, we are endeavoring to ensure that students who feel unwell are not compelled to attend lectures or take examinations while they are ill. We also want to be sure these students are not penalized. As mentioned elsewhere, campus has sent out two messages this week with more information on this subject, and additional guidance to departments. 

At present, in-person classes will continue to be held - though we have asked instructors to consider suspending attendance requirements and, if feasible, to offer an online option for course material. We have assembled resources to help instructors to record and/or webcast their lectures: https://teaching.berkeley.edu/instructional-resilience-resources. We are asking instructors to familiarize themselves with this technology now in the event that we are forced to move all classes online or something similar.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services:**

We understand that like many viral infections (including influenza) we really won't know how many have had the infection as some were so mild that the patient was never seen or tested.  So, it is true - we won't know the denominator (because of lack of testing, and some people having mild cases not needing medical attention.  It is fairly typical to overestimate the mortality rate of infections like this because of this fact.  FWIW I have tried to be very careful to say no 'confirmed cases' in my communications, even though I understand that might be seen as splitting hairs

With a novel infection, response can indeed be slower as the information needed to make certain decisions takes some time to come in.  Now that we know more about who is high-risk we have started making policy/operational decisions to better address those vulnerable populations.

In addition to CDC guidelines, we also stay in close contact with California Dept of Public Health, our local Public Health officials and our own Berkeley School of Public Health, and use all these sources of information and guidance to make the best decisions we can.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services and Anna Harte, UHS Medical Director:**

We have already amended our triage processes (online and nurse-staffed) to enhance our ability to take care of as many people as possible while minimizing the risk of exposure to others, and we will do so further should there be a case on campus.  UHS operations are planning to convert to a higher volume mass assessment model should we face an outbreak situation, changing our appointment model, separating patient flow, and potentially conducting triage outside the building.  We are setting up contracts with temp agencies to provide additional staff and have been preparing for adapted use of medical equipment to make it stretch further, in alignment with CDC guidance.   We are also preparing our mental health staff to be better able to support our students, and our occupational health and employee assistance programs to do the same for faculty/staff.

The absolute best thing we all can do, now and later, is to continue to repeat the education about personal protective activities - frequent handwashing, avoid touching your face (mucous membranes are the largest point of entry for infection), social distancing strategies, and staying home when ill.  From a facility standpoint, regular disinfection is recommended especially on surfaces that are frequently touched/used and deployment of hand sanitizers.  It is understandable to want stronger barriers to spread of infection, but no other strategies have been proven to prevent spread.

Treatment of the specific case depends on the circumstances, but generally, for a student in on-campus housing we would use an isolation room if available for the duration of the illness and monitor as per guidelines.  We also are exploring quarantine spaces should public health require us to separate and monitor large numbers of exposed people.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services and Anna Harte, UHS Medical Director:**

The best tactics we have right now are frequent handwashing, staying home when ill, avoid touching your face as much as possible, social distancing strategies when others are ill, regular disinfecting of commonly touched surfaces, and proper sleep, nutrition and exercise (to maintain good immune function).  From a campus community perspective, we are maintaining a focus on this education.  There is no evidence for a UC connection to either case you’ve mentioned; however, we do expect UC-related cases eventually and are preparing as if it is inevitable.   And campus is absolutely preparing for and supportive of academic resilience measures like remote/online lectures, see responses to other questions.
There are likely already many students infected. Its just that a vast majority are asymptomatic or have mild illness and aren't going to the doctor or arent getting lab tested.
Seriously, it’s so fucked that students are, surely, getting infected and will head home for spring break and affect other people in states that probably don’t have it yet. I’m so pissed at this administration.
I am more concerned about provisions for tests, quizzes, and even homework. Lectures are less important in my opinion because students can simply read the textbook if they’re sick. Even if lecture are webcasted, however, that still means nothing if we still have to go in for quizzes/tests/midterms.
This is a definite ""No"". There's not even enough test kits for all people with symptoms, much less an entire population. Even if there were enough supplies, there's never going to be enough people to test an entire population at the same time (and you have to test simultaneously in this case or else someone might get it afterwards).
Please go to Alta Bates Emergency as soon as possible. You are experiencing all three of the most common COVID-19 symptoms. They didn't test me because I hadn't travelled or had severe symptoms, but it sounds like you do.
Adding onto this: The advice from health officials is to not shake hands. The admin should be sure everyone is aware of this, so that this OP doesn't look rude/unprofessional for not doing so.
**Oliver O'Reilly, Academic Senate Chair:**

You may hear from the department shortly - in order to ensure equity in prospective graduate students’ experiences and in light of travel concerns, we are recommending that departments replace in-person graduate student spring visits with virtual experiences. We are working with department faculty and staff to make sure that these virtual visits can nonetheless show off the best of Berkeley.
**Guy Nicolette, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services:**

Surgical masks are intended (in this case) to help sick people mitigate the spread of respiratory illness by catching respiratory droplets. They appear to offer minimal (if any) protection for people wearing them who are well.

N95s filter much smaller particles (0.3 microns), but many viruses including COVID-19 are smaller.  It will catch respiratory droplets though, and thus most think it catches the virus particles contained within them.  However; respirators need to be fitted to work.  They must be worn properly to work.  They don't work as intended on people with facial hair.  They are relatively expensive and not intended as re-usable.  They also cause problems for people with pre-existing pulmonary and other diseases.  So, we don't recommend routine use of these.
You know it’s great and all that you’re ENCOURAGING teachers to move to online classes, but that’s not the same as TELLING them to do so. We need some fucking action here, half my teachers are still taking attendance and not making assignments and tests online
Their current plan seems to be put up signs that say ""please sanitize hands before entering""
I am sick. Many of us are sick. We have gone to the hospital and have not been tested because we do not fit the criteria – we don't have a fever, we have not travelled outside of the United States, blah blah blah. Do you want to risk this?
This is such a non-answer. What specifically would warrant a closure? Confirmed case on campus? You can't expect our concerns to be assuaged with such vague responses.
> Others have responded to the online classes piece in more detail  elsewhere, but I’ll just note that we are strongly recommending  instructors make material available virtually and relax attendance  rules.

Is there any actual incentive on Professors to take heed of these suggestions?

I have been ill for the past couple of weeks. After emailing professors, I have had to come to class ill multiple times this week. They said they would not make material available online or make accommodations for alternate testing. Others have reported similar issues in this forum.

I would understand you do not want to suddenly burden the professors by forcing them to performing additional work. However, it would be trivial to pay uGSI's to film on a cell phone and scan documents and or notes for each class for the remainder of the semester.

Would you not agree the risk to the students and university is significant enough to justify such marginal costs?
I appreciate your thoughtful response. However, none of my teachers have said they are going to work to make material available virtually. One said that unless the school tells him he HAS to, he will not being doing that. How is that proactive in any way?
You already have China and Italy. What more information do you need to understand that this disease moves quickly and can kill healthy adults?

All I see is ""emergency report"" ""initiatives"" ""strongly recommending"" – when are you going to take concrete, decisive action that follows *predictions* of health experts, not playing catch up as you have admitted? When will the administration actually focus on ensuring that students will not have to choose between their health and their education? We are one of the premier educational institutions in the world. Surely having professors lecture from the comfort of their home is not too much to ask. Do I want to risk having 60-70% of my grade ride on one single examination? No. Do I want to spread or contract COVID-19 while sitting in a lecture hall? No. This should not be a decision we are faced with.

I think we know why we aren't #1 Public University anymore – it's because people like this are in charge of our school.
As someone who doesn’t currently have a safe alternative housing situation, apart from university housing, I am incredibly grateful that the administration seems to be taking this into account.
Pretty much every ""accommodation"" rests on the assumption that everything will be fine in May and that having 60-70% of a student's grade rest on a single 3 hour exam is perfectly normal and ""not a penalty"" in a department where this never happens. There are other methods of evaluation. Many humanities classes can easily shift to take home essays. Technical courses can do timed bCourses evaluations. Take home projects. We should not have to risk asymptomatic transmission by coming to exams.
>	We also want to be sure these students are not penalized.

I’d like to let you know that this is not happening in EE 126 yet
Please force a move to online classes ASAP!

Look at Italy how the disease spreads in a western country. In Spain the cases doubled (!!!) overnight.

If you wait until you have 5 positive (and severe, because only those are tested!), you will have more than over a hundred infections which means that all dorms will be infected sooner rather than later.

A lot of students go home to see their parents and grandparents during spring break, you are putting all those lives at stake here.

In-person classes are like large events, and all of those should be cancelled and moved online ASAP.

I have seen students coughing all over the place because some professors don’t offer online classes yet!
Thank you for the response by the way!

Best of luck with handling the coming weeks and months.
how do you propose we support social distancing when classes still happen on campus?
And guess what? These students are still roaming around campuses because classes like EE 126 refuse to take any actions to provide online resources. Go fucking bears
Sad times
I’m also in the same situation. If my visit gets canceled, will departments still offer reimbursement for purchased plane tickets?
Thank you

still nothing but i'm also waiting on on my dependency review
My aid packages have not arrived sadly been waiting and I have SAI -1500...
thats awesome! hopefully mine will be fully covered too, because this semester I had to pay 2 months rent from my savings and I'm almost out of money...
Your SAI should be on the finances tab of your calcentral. -1500 is the lowest and 99999 is the highest I think? Its essentially the new EFC, but its just an index number instead of a dollar amount they expect out-of-pocket. They made it weird and more complicated for no reason, but idgaf as long as I get my rent covered.

I'm with you on that I hope that the new chancellor will be a better leader than the outgoing one, but I don't think walking on Sproul Plaza is an indication of anything.
What? I saw Dirks one time in MLK, therefore Dirks was better than Christ. /s
I've always seen Dirks walk through campus and at events.
I saw Dirks walking by Barrows once and I was surprised by how short he was and how tall his hair was.
In my two years at Berkeley I saw him at least three times per semester. Wish I could have said hi. Also, he fenced University House (too expensive, IMO, but still) because of the BAMN mobs surrounding his house holding banners screeching ""Dirks is a Racist."" I would want security if I was in his shoes.
[deleted]
I've seen Dirks twice this year walking around campus.
I've seen him 8 times in a matter of a year, stop with your bullshit. 
dirks was on sproul on the night of the election, watching the projection. there was even a line for people to try and talk to him.
Door. It was a door. It may have been an overpriced door, but it was not an escape hatch. It was just a door. 
Dirks is always at sporting events.
Dirks didn't add an escape hatch to his office, but glad to see you're incapable of thinking for yourself.
I've seen him calm down
at least Dirks' surname wasn't so blatantly sacrilegious 
If he grows it a little longer he'll be Einstein level.
Yeah I think people were too hard on him tbh. He's probably not fit for the job but people who stayed longer remember that the chancellor *before* Dirks was even worse (remember Occupy?).

"Carol Christ kicked off Cal's Free Speech Year with an address at the Berkeley Forum. Carol Christ: ""If a speaker has been invited in accordance with our policies, we cannot legally deny that person the opportunity to speak on the basis of his or her opinions, no matter how loathsome we find them.""",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/09/01/carol-christ-addresses-free-speech-tensions-at-berkeley-forum/,2017-09-03 00:22:13,,Good learning for the kids but bad adding herself to we; should have been you.
"Carol Christ to Daily Cal: Your recent editorial cartoon targeting Alan Dershowitz was offensive, appalling and deeply disappointing. I condemn it. Are you aware its anti-Semitic imagery connects directly to the centuries-old 'blood libel' that falsely accused Jews of engaging in ritual murder?",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/24/editorial-cartoon-targeting-alan-dershowitz-perpetuates-harmful-stereotypes/,2017-10-24 23:01:00,,"just when things were quietening down, some idiot has to start shit up again. uggh i can so smell another free speech week incoming cuz of this stupid shit. can we just make him bend over for milo and move along like nothing happened? 
It was pretty anti-Semitic, but showing a soldier killing a non-combatant is *hardly* depicting a Jewish person in the act of ritual vampirism upon a Christian child. The grotesque body was insensitive enough; no need to make more of the cartoon than was there. Dershowitz is loving this, however. It's the perfect point of outrage for Israel apologists to zero in on, all the while Palestinians still have their land and lives taken by an unlawful occupation.
I fucking cannnot compute how its blood libel, its reference to actually physical slaughter that is actually occurring in the real world now. Its criticism of soldiers killing civilians outside of Isreal in occupied Palestine. If 'blood libel' is when the IDF kills civilians then shit, its not really libel... or even unique to jews.

I don't even buy that the cartoon is antisemitic. Its not supposed to be a depiction of Israelis, its a depiction of a monster state commiting atrocities while covering them up. The cartoon isn't supposed to be nice. It would be different if the cartoon was supposed to be a depiction of Israelis - like Antijewish propaganda posters in 3rd Reich Germany - but this isn't that. This is the criticism of a state. The complaint about the body is analogous to demanding cartoons criticizing America depict uncle Sam in a non-grotesque way. Furthmore, the cartoon didn't even play on stereotypes like large noses which would have been anti-semitic. 

Its insane that any criticism of Isreal as a state is anti-semetic.
Is Carol Christ literally retarded? How is the cartoon depicting child-libel? Shooting a kid (which happens all the time) != a highly specific case of medieval cannbibalism-ritual sacrifice allegations. Woah, it's almost like pro-Israelis are paranoid about this kinda stuff because they feel secretly guilty. 
Enough with this 'let's just keep our heads down and be quiet' bs. It doesn't work. Berkeley is this icon in the culture's mental landscape -- undeservedly so tbh. So people like Dershowitz (look up 'hatchet man') or Milo or whoever will always come here for a bully pulpit. 
This is the first time in a long time I've 100% agreed with you on something. I think it's a pretty poorly done cartoon (it's Daily Cal, idk what I expected), and it's definitely got some racist/antisemtic undertones... but to go so far as to say that the imagery represents blood libel?  Hmm, that's assuming that Daily Cal is capable of such complex symbolism. 
Palestinians had like 7 wars to try to take israel and got murked in all of them at a certain point you have to acknowledge who's king of the hill right
It is totally not anti-semitic, and to say it is anti-semitic IS anti-semitic. The dead-kid (i didn't notice it was a kid tbh, it looks like teen or man) is not the same as the allegation of ritual-cooking and cannibalizing that is blood libel. Do you mean to say that whenever a Jew kills a child, one cannot accuse of them of doing so for fear of being accused of blood-libel-anti-semitism? I hate to break it to you but some pedophiles are Jewish and the D.A certainly doesn't give a fuck about the muhantisemitism-blood-libel-defense. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
u got a solution? lets hear it.
Honestly, it's a pretty well-done cartoon -- objectively speaking. As in, it is clever and well-drawn and communicates effectively -- so effectively that this retired Harvard Professor got triggered. 
I mean, I really hope we're not judging right and wrong by military power. I know that, at the end of the day, we really are, but I'd rather at least *try* not to. Also it doesn't justify any peacetime affronts.
The Arabs were not real states in the 48' war, they were former Ottoman provinces that had been won by Britain/France and given Mandate-status and then 'independence' under pro-British Monarchs and armies literally staffed with British officers. 
You seem to understand history like carol understands antisemitism. 
I never said that. The anti-Semitism is rooted in what is, at the very least, an incredibly insensitive, and historically precedented, dehumanizing of the body.
What would an appropriate cartoon to criticize the state of Israel for murdering Palestinian civilians in Palestine while manipulating with west with PR look like to you?

Apparently, it cannot feature and blood as this is a reference to ritualistic child vampirism, nor the media, as this is a reference to media deception.
And even if it couldn't be seen as anti-Semitic, even if it didn't have historical precedent, why give him ammunition? Dershowitz calls literally everything an attack, so why give him an easy opportunity? It's infuriatingly short-sighted by the cartoonist.
Also, just so you know, the chancellor, and Dershowitz are both calling blood libel on the cartoon. They are not saying ""Greedy Merchant"" with  arachnid body.
Are we actually talking about the same cartoon?

The ""Happy Merchant"" has a exaggerated nose, no glasses, mustache, extensive facial hair, ceremonial head covering, beard, curled hair. He looks wholly different than character in the UC cartoon. I can't see any similarity at all. 

The arachnid body? I couldn't tell he was a spider, nor did I know that arachnid is a common antisemitic stereotype. 
Is it anti-semitic to say that Dershowitz literally looks a little Jewish? Many Jews do, and it's a joke among Jews that some Jews look more 'jewish' than others.
1. Stop selling this meme of ""berkeley is the heart of free speech"". It's not. The historical movement was brutally put-down and it's members totally blacklisted for life for their 'free speech'. Are you familiar with the concept of 'virtue signaling', the university does this with the 'free speech movement' and sells it to recruit impressionable young students. Stop. 
2. Organize pre-emptive right-wing or left-wing debates with strawman ""our guys"" right-wingers or left-wingers -- so as to take the wind out of the sail of these campus-visitors. 
3. Stop the hypocrisy and speak sincerely. If campus cares about free speech, then care about it. It doesn't. It cares about looking good  (good optics) and staying on the good side of powerful people and institutions elsewhere. That's the real identity -- sucking up to power, pretending to be otherwise than you are, and crying about it if it leads you into trouble. There is no sense of stewardship of the institution of Berkeley, only high-placed administrators or faculty looking out for their next-gig. 
The combined Arab countries definitely had more military power than Israel - they got a lot of tries but just couldn't execute. Sad! 
As was Israel.  And practically from the day of Israel's establishment, its neighboring countries have (with very few exceptions) attempted to end its existence.  It's not terribly surprising that Israelis have a fortress mentality.

None of which excuses any human rights violations the Israeli state is responsible for, of course.  But you know, at least in Israel wives don't have to ask their husbands' permission before leaving the country.
Dershowitz looks like that. Some Jews look characteristically Jewish. This is a fact. Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and Seth Rogan even joke about it. Do you think the Aryan-beauty ideal is superior? I don't, that's why I don't think it's anti-semitic to lampoon an obviously Jewish man. Or do you think it is dehumanizing and therefore anti-semitic to show the truth of what Israel does to children of Palestinian identity (many of whom are also semitic)?
[deleted]
So you think free speech should be totally curtailed so that Dershowitz -a defender of murder -- doesn't get triggered about defending murder? So we should not talk about rape-culture and powerful men raping women so that rapists don't get triggered?

1. a lot of times its not what is but what people think it is. if someone gives me a prize for being a thoughtful human with a 10,000 check im not just gonna give it back. publicity matters even if its questionable. trump's presidential run was the perfect example for it. its not that i dont understand where you're coming from but the most straight forward moves usually doesnt equate the best ones.


2. whos gonna debate? look at the guys that go up for Q&A during shapiro event. do they sound smart to you? and when people debate their beliefs they get so emotional like fukin goons. the brightest people i met wont ever give a shit about it that means you can never have an even debate of ideas when the intelligence level is different/low. most of the arguments on both sides can be read online so IMO i dont think its a way forward. What would actually be productive if the right tried to argue on the left while the left tried to argue on the right. at that point i think things might actually get somewhere.


3. of course good optics matter more today. public colleges are broke and have to run like businesses. money speaks volumes. of course free speech matters. but look at google and the memo saga. how is the school funded, where it gets its research $ from? compared to decades ago more and more from corporate/donors/students. how many right wing companies donate to the school? now compare how many tech/research/banks donate/contribute to the school and what are their beliefs and values?
 your values represent where your money comes from, just like politics. pretty straight forward.

Israel was supported by France and the US and even Soviets during the first war. Israel lost the Yom kippur war and had to be bailed out by the US from Incirlik at the 11th hour. US air-lifted guns, tanks, fighter jets into Tel-Aviv and apparently even manned some of them. 

""husband's permission""
This is only true in the states in the ME that Israel is allied to, like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Emirates (Dubai). Syria, Egypt, Iraq, etc. were not and are not this evil islamist boogeyman. Neither is Iran. Iran has more women PhD students and women in STEM than the U.S. or Germany.
I mean, I'm not attracted to Dersho, but I sure as hell don't think he looks like a beady little arachnid. My entire point is that it's insensitive. It shouldn't be a big outcry, but the whole thing is the product of an unduly strong pro-Israel (note: not pro-Jewish, not Jewish in nature) presence in the US, which attacks even the smallest flaws in any critique of Israel to be indicative of Nazi-like sentiment in the US.
Its critical of the government without mentioning the murder of civilians by foreign soldiers or America's support for Israel. Which is proof that you can criticize Israel in a tame and wholly inoffensive way.

The school cartoon was supposed to criticize how America is manipulated, and not seeing whats going on behind the scenes. I think its hard to make the case for bloodshed without blood, I think its hard to make the case for manipulating American liberals without some kind of deception being implicit. I don't think blood is per se antisemitic when associated with actual acts of bloodshed by a state. 

Blood is a reality man. At what point are the facts just anti-Semitic? I an innocent is killed by a solider and bleeds and someone takes a photo, is that anti-Semitic?
You are the only one claiming anti-semetic owing to use of spider body - which I do not see. The official line is its blood libel - which is emphatically senseless garbage written to delegitimize criticism of Israel. 

The face on the spider thing is closer to the UC cartoon than the ""happy/greedy merchent"". Its not a greedy merchant cartoon. 

I am not sure if the original artist intended his drawing to be a spider or not, but cartooning all jews as parasitic arachnids preying on white women is different than cartooning the state as a monster. 

The arachnid cartoon has spider limbs, and a clear spider body in a spider web. The UC cartoon has human limbs. The only similarity is a circular body. Weather this is intended to reference the cartoon I cannot say with certainty, but perhaps the state is just supposed to be a monster. You also have to remember the argument the cartoons make are very different. The arachnid cartoon says All jews are predatory subhumans who trap vulnerable white women. Which is clearly antisemetic. The second says Israel is a monster has bamboozled liberals and is killing innocents without there knowledge. This is not anti-semetic.

1. What? So Berkeley should just lie about it's history because Trump is President? Berkeley has been doing this since the 90s, possibly earlier. Real FSMers all dropped out (after profs refused to grade their work, or admin harassed them, go read some biographies bro), got expelled, and ended up in very dark paths. A few like Alice Waters ended up going back to school years later and becoming famous by entrepreneurship (no-one would hire them). That's what the university should teach, because it's true, and it's not a fairy tale muh triumphalist liberal 60s-were-great propaganda. FSM is in truth a deterrent to free speech. Maybe you wish FSM had turned out differently and you think it's ok to mislead people because of a greater-ideal purpose Batman 'The Dark Night' Harvey  Dent thing? In which case, you're literally teaching 'false consciousness'. Good job. 
2. If CNN can find some fake-right-winger and Fox can find some fake-left-winger to bring on for fake-debates. Then so can Berkeley. Bring classy people, like Tucker Carlson. Or Stephen Kotkin (who is a Berkeley grad and Prof at Princeton and famous Conservative with a brain. He speaks at Yale Republican Club and other Republican clubs). 
3. Michigan and Virginia are not broke. Many public schools are not broke, even without funding from the public. Berkeley just complains and complains. It gets the research money from the feds for DARPA-related work mostly or Big Science. Or big companies. Monsanto gave money to Agriculture and Nutritional Science, next thing you know, we had purple-hair-dyed cute leftist girls running around campus saying ""not all GMOs, Guys!"". 

You don't understand. Berkeley claims to be FSM, it's not. It should never claim the FSM-mantle to begin with. Stop talking about it. Go by the law, no more, no less. It claims to be a special place of free speech, It's not. 

Optics are an issue of course. Berkeley personalities like Carol or Dirks or various Profs care about their individual personal optics at the expense of the University. Rather than defend Daily Cal's free speech, Carol caves in record-time because Dershowitz is a notoriously vengeful academic with wide-reach. Dershowitz has literally gotten profs un-tenured or grad-students expelled because of their free speech. He was ruined people's lives, he has gotten people fired from cozy board seats or directorships. When was the last time Dershowitz donated to Cal?

Cal is run/staffed/administered/payrolls-out-to and by a bunch of idiot SJW with fetishized memories of the 60s and with a chip on their should about being the first woman to do this or that or the first minority to do this or that. It's not run with brutal technocratic efficiency and prowess -- which it should be. That's basic. As long as you got that technocratic brutalism, you can put a facade of cuddly liberal feel goods on top. But if you don't have that and you try to be a cutesy tolerant false-reality, you're gonna have a bad time. 
So we shouldn't criticize rapists for raping for fear of upsetting rapists? 

You basically believe that the Israeli lobby is so powerful that it is impossible and un-advisable to upset their narrative? Why are they so powerful? Is their power democratically justifiable? How has the strongest country on earth allowed a small middle eastern state to colonize it's media/academia/political establishment/discourse?

i dont think the SJW theme only occurs in Cal. listen to the admin in any prestigious university including the ivys. they all sound like clones of one another. 


and yes i do believe that i totally understand your view point on every single issue you bring up. theres a quote i think applies here. children talk about whats right and wrong. adults only judge on pros and cons.
We shouldn't criticize rapists by drawing them in a way which criticizes by pointing to physical deformity-- and especially not to certain racially motivated physiologies-- as part of the issue. If they drew him looking like Larry David, nobody would have any reason to care.

They're so powerful because: a) they're more or less a weapons testing ground for the entire Western world. It's hard to know how good military tech is without using it on humans, and Israel does that very well. b) Because many Christians in America feel a savior complex towards Israel (while also being very anti-Semitic themselves). c) Because there are a lot of wealthy people who are rigidly pro-Israel. This isn't democratically justifiable. I'm against Israel, fundamentally, as it exists. And as to how they colonized so effectively: money and industrial concerns.
Well, I may be retarded. But, I simply cannot fathom how any association of blood with the Jews is now racist b/c blood libel was/is a thing.

This is a state - not a religion or ethnicity . This is a state being criticized for actual violence it commits, rather than mythical ritualistic violence of a ethnicity. It seems ridiculous to me that for all time, Israel can never be accused of manipulating people (thats what states do), or responsible for the blood of civilians it kills.

Saying the IDF is a bunch of jewish vampires who kidnap and murder palestinian children and collect their blood is antisemetic. Saying the IDF kills innocents and that this is bloodly is not. IF the picture showed any kind of collection of blood, any kind of reference of ritual consumption, the pouring of blood onto a ritual object, that would be anti-semetic blood libel. Blood libel is not the same thing as blood. this is such an insane argument. Blood libel is hyperspecific, its the killing of christian children to collect their blood for use in baked goods associated with a Holiday. I cannot fathom how any blood per se, without reference to the other elements is at all is antisemitic. Similarly, if the picture showed all news outlets being controlled by the jews this might be antisemetic. If the picture shows American liberals being manipulated by Israel this isn't the same thing.

if, this is not anti-semetic b/c of the depiction of blood, the corporeal depiction of israel, or the stage (which you referenced) than I cannot understand how it is.


I feel like these arguments are a stretch. They take something that has any connection at all to ethnicity (Israel=> Jews), (blood => blood libel), and stretch them to create an elaborate, politically motivated sense of offense based on hypothetical intent of speaker, writer, artist.

OK. I'm for all of that. If only Cal could pull it off -- but Cal can't. Ivies are not transparently incompetent like Cal is. 30+ year of live-action-role-playing as a savy cynical realist has not worked. It's time to reconsider first principles.

Cal is OG Sjw. Anyway, this is what happens when you let washed-up-hippies and their offspring play at power. They pretend to put-away their idealism and be 'realistic' cynics. They suck at it, and they're just bad, poorly skilled, low-effort, bad. Not to mention, their cynicism itself is idealistic. 
> physical deformity

That's anti-semitic. He's not physically deformed just because he looks a certain way. He's even proud of it, when he was casting for Reversal of Fortune, he made sure to get someone that captured his characteristic beady eyes and large nose (I'm not joking here). https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B13fDbQ75Sk/maxresdefault.jpg

>""Powerful""

The West does OK testing it's weapons itself. Israel doesn't test anything exciting, it mostly bombs and shoots people using known weaponry.

The Christians in America with the evangelical take on things are really special. They believe that Israel has to be supported because it is the sign of the apocalypse and the end-of-times, and so to literally destroy the world and prepare it for Jesus Christ's return, Israel must be defended. They didn't always believe this, only starting in earnest post-world-war2. And Israeli definitely plays it up, they have deep ties with the evangelical right -- and this includes left and right-wing Israeli governments.

>""Wealthy people"". 

Is the characteristic cause of their pro-Israeli stance their wealth or something else? American Jewish support for Israel is nothing new.

Chancellor Carol Christ's AMA is coming up in 2 days. Here are the rules and guidelines I'm enacting in order to ensure a successful AMA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhrcm/chancellor_carol_christs_ama_is_coming_up_in_2/,2018-10-08 11:55:59,"**[Link to the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/)**

The Chancellor's reddit account is /u/carolchrist. The actual AMA thread will go up right after I post this thread, and you will have two days to think of a question and post it in the thread. Christ will have only one *devoted* hour for the AMA. However, we are hoping that the following day, Christ will have about half an hour to answer any additional questions. The Chancellor is very busy however and we can't promise anything soon. 

As a note, if this goes well, there may very well be future events in this subreddit involving the Chancellor. The goal of this initial AMA is for the Chancellor to hear and address student issues. I also want her, as a result of this AMA, to view /r/berkeley as an important platform for student discussion. So stay on your best behavior and please read all of the rules. 

-

**THE ACTUAL AMA**
-

* **No questions are off-limits. But keep it respectful and formal.**

Christ does not want to limit any sort of questions *at all* for this AMA. Nothing is off-limits. However, you must stay respectful and formal. Make sure you remain respectful and your question will not be removed. 

Joke questions *are* allowed. 

* **The AMA thread will be in contest mode until the actual AMA start time.**

This is because I don't want people to start long discussions before the AMA has begun. We also need time to promote this event on different channels and make sure everyone affiliated with the campus has time to create an account and post their questions. 

The Chancellor will start answering questions this Wednesday 3:00PM. 

* **Parent comments only**

The Chancellor does not have enough time to read through chains of comments. We want original questions posted as *only* parent comments. If you want to piggyback off of another parent comment you liked, you may refer to it in a parent comment of your own. 

This may seem odd, but we want people to have as many chances as possible to get their questions answered, and we want the AMA to feel like an actual back-and-forth discussion between our community and the Chancellor. 

**All children comments will be deleted until Christ starts her actual AMA. After which children comments will be allowed.** 

Once the Chancellor comes in, I want her answers to be the only child comment to each parent comment. That way, even after this two day delay, you won't have to go hunting for Christ's answers, and you can follow-up on her answers more easily. 

In a future event, we may be able to have the Chancellor answer question that arose from discussions, but I don't want those long-winded discussions to start prematurely.

Again, please be on your best behavior. We may have even more events in the future, and maybe the Chancellor would be open to coming to a subreddit meetup. This will only be possible if this AMA goes well.

I imagine there will be a national search for her replacement.
The University of California Board of Regents will appoint the new Chancellor, with a recommendation from the UC President. There is usually a national / international search process that lasts for months, and one or more advisory committees working with the President. UC's Academic Senate (faculty) will have something of a say, and there may be some small ""advisory"" role for UC non-faculty employees and students. 

There will be some ""public process"", like an announcement and a call for suggestions of candidates, but all the real work will be done by secretive committees and negotiations behind the scenes.

There will inevitably be some rumors, true and false, about who the leading candidates are or will be.

Once the name of the new candidate is released, their appointment by The Regents is a foregone conclusion. The Office of the President generally submits nothing to The Regents without knowing in advance the recommendation will be approved.

No voting by students, or anyone else. 

Finally, once appointed, the new Chancellor will be brought to campus wearing a laurel wreath, riding in a gold and ivory chariot pulled up Telegraph Avenue by a dozen hand-selected undergraduates, with the faculty lined up on either side of Sproul Plaza strewing rose petals in front of the chariot and cheering Huzza! Huzza!

Yes. As long as the previous chancellor wasn't ceremonially executed on the accession of the new arrival.

"UC Berkeley faculty members debated issues of hate speech and white supremacy Friday at a panel on free speech hosted by Chancellor Carol Christ. john powell, director of the Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society: the Supreme Court was wrong in its public school free speech decision.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/08/free-speech/,2017-09-09 00:57:45,,"> “I don’t think (free speech) is a defining issue in the country. I think the defining issue in the country is white supremacy,” powell said during the panel. “We are fighting a civil war, and the South is winning.”

That's ridiculously hyperbolic. Statements like this make it hard to take many on the Left seriously, even if what they're saying is valid. 

> “The only way to make sure we’re protecting our speech for tomorrow is to protect the speech we don’t like today,” Chemerinsky said during the panel.

Bingo. If the tactics we use are acceptable, then why can't the Bible Belt use the same ones to enforce their own beliefs? Everyone thinks they're in the right.
""I don’t think (free speech) is a defining issue in the country"". ""Said at the panel that he believed the Supreme Court was wrong in its decision"" (in saying that public schools are obligated to uphold the First Amendment).

John Powell is a moron.
So Berkeley is officially no longer the Cradle for Free Speech anymore.
Nobody's arguing that it should be speech based on correctness. Those against free speech just want controls on outright or implicitly genocidal speech. A fool could yell 'Arabs are inferior' and that'd be allowed. They couldn't yell 'therefore we should kill them all / remove them from their lands!' It's the distinction between speech which explicitly or implicitly calls for identitarian violence, and that which is simply bigoted.

Never really was. Tankies just pretended to care about free speech so they could make the move they are doing now.
Until you tankies start spouting the idea that advocating for capitalism is violent speech in and of itself, thanks but no thanks, I'm sticking to unfettered Free Speech.
>Those against free speech just want controls on outright or implicitly genocidal speech.

Does this mean we can crack down on communist sympathizers?
Speech is not at all quantifiable, because there is no basic unit metric to measure its ""harm"". Everybody is offended by something, I for example hate when people in this campus go abound glorifying socialism for something that it's not. Someone else in this campus is offended because of a bloody ICE joke on the UCBMFET page, you can't have a basic unit of measurement abounding hate speech if its up to individuals to decide what is and isn't harmful. 

Limiting speech isn't scientific, it's authoritarian, and idiotic. For the man to claim that Free Speech isn't an issue in this country at the moment when not too long ago Antifa burned down part of our bloody campus because of it is completely disingenuous and shows his partisanship.
I never advocated for that, nor am I a tankie, nor do Marxists possess even a modicum of political power. Why are you conservatives so afraid of the Marxist menace? Could it be that you're pulling this definition of 'tankie' and Marxist from your ass, and it'd be really hard to boogeyman us if you actually read our material?

An interesting example of what happens when capitalists read Marxist literature can be found in Hugo Chavez: he read contraband works as a member of the Venezuelan military, and soon after realized that the politics he'd been opposed to were, in reality, far more intelligible than the liberal vomit that's been proved ineffectual and weak endlessly many times.
If they're genocidal. Anyway, I'm no sympathizer.
Are you part of RevCom or BAMN? What material are you reading?

Ah yes, because his policies of public expropriation of private companies as a means of giving political patronage for the Socialist Bolivarian Revolution have worked out soo well for the people of Venezuela, never mind the fact that his public spending on social programs and reliance on a volatile commodity led to the massive loss of diversification of the Venezuelan economy, which all but collapsed because of its reliance on the public sector. Right now 80% of Venezuelans are below the poverty line, that's an all time historic high, brought to you by Socialism.

We *have* read your shitty material, hell some among us have actually been stupid enough to actually implement the bloody thing: *it never fucking works*, because believing that public ownership of the means of production of an economy can ever be achieve without the existence of a centralized authority to enforce said laws in the first place is completely idiotic, so you marxists always move the goalpost: ""Oh shit, turns out we can't have a classless society without a government, ok then let's have said government manage society to achieve our ideal of society"", which in itself fails to account for the idea that that centralized authority has now been given all the political power to enforce it as it sees fit, and always without fail leads to the authoritarianism that is by now synonymous with Communism.

There ain't nothing intelligent about Marxism, it's a failed economic and political and social system whose tenants entirely revolve around the disproven Labor Theory of Value and whose application in nation after nation after nation have brought nothing but pain and misery, and material for ignorant prepubescents around there world to jerk off to thinking that they're somehow more enlightened than the rest.
\>I'm no sympathizer.

\>cultural marxism / critical theory flair

\>socialist apologetics in the thread

Whatever you say.
Dunno what the first is, and no to the second. I read Marxist literature! So, a lot. Not connected to specific groups.
Man, this is a bad argument you're making, but you're at least trying to argue, so I'll give you the time.

>never mind the fact that his public spending on social programs and reliance on a volatile commodity led to the massive loss of diversification of the Venezuelan economy

That makes no sense. Lack of diversification has no contingency upon social programs. I agree: VZ fucked up their economy big-time. Reliance upon oil was a massive mistake, and huge spending was never the solution to their social ills. But those two have no correlation. And no, VZ is actually, compared to pre-Chavez, far better off than they were. Of course things are terrible right now-- they would be for a nation without diversification, 'socialist' or not.

>stupid enough to actually implement the bloody thing

Huh, that's weird. Since nobody ever effectively implemented the economic plan of Capital, but always the earlier Marxist theory. Here's a question: why *can't* public ownership of the means of production be accomplished without a state apparatus? And you are fundamentally mistaken if you don't interpret today as authoritarianism: I'd sooner be lorded over by an authoritarian state socialist regime than millions of individual authoritarian regimes lorded over by bosses, enforced by a bloated capitalist authoritarian regime at the center. And I say that as an American! Imagine being in a third-world nation, used as target practice and slave labor!

>disproven Labor Theory of Value

Oh, this is funny. You realize Capital is all about why LTV-- which was created not by Marx, but by Ricardo and Adam Smith!-- is not capable of describing capitalist economies? Oh wait, no, you don't realize that. You're like the rest of the capitalists: the millions killed by your policies are necessary, but those sent by the USSR are genocide. You claim to understand our theories without having even read summaries of them, and you and the rest of your intellectually-impoverished backwash ideologues suck each other off over the a priori truths of third world poverty.
I'm not a sympathizer. I'm a fervent supporter.
Revolutionary Communist Party. They run Revolution Books on Durant (effectively on campus) where they recruit and conduct teach-ins.  
""Over a priori truths of third world poverty"" says the man that currently denies the easily proven fact that Venezuela right now has a higher poverty rate than at any time during its history. 

There's that typical marxist excuse: ""Hurr durr the vision of Communism as per the Manifesto has never actually been achieved, which totally means that Communism is still valid hurr durr"" despite the fact that any attempt at implementing Communism, from the USSR, to Cuba, to China, to Cambodia, to Venezuela, has time and time and time again failed to bring any modicum of prosperity to the people aside from an equal sharing of miseries. 

Perhaps I should've been more clear in my previous comment: The loss of diversification in the Venezuelan economy was brought upon by the widespread crack down against and public expropriation of private businesses done by the government, which subsidized the continued losses in economic productivity by keeping the public dumb and happy with massively wasteful social programs that were all bought and paid for by a nationalized oil scheme. All in the name of Social Justice ©. The economy *wouldn't be lacking diversification* in the first place if it wasn't for the governments idiotic goal of attaining a socialist utopia. Things are terrible right now because of Socialism, period.

> why can't public ownership of the means of production be accomplished without a state apparatus?

Because basic game theory necessitates that treaties and deals, as ""public ownership"" would be, require a third party power mediate the validity of such a scheme, otherwise its abuse being beneficial to both parties obligates said abuse in the first place. Apply this idea to the macro level, and it necessitates the idea that in a society of millions, a state apparatus is required for the idea of ""public ownership"" to even be respected. The final nail in the coffin comes from the simple fact that this detached state apparatus is never ever ever going to be incorruptible, and as said before, surrendering such unilateral power to said state apparatus will without fail lead to authoritarianism, as it did in the USSR, Cambodia, Cuba, Venezuela, Vietnam, etc communist countries ad nauseam.

I understand your shitty theories, and even more importantly, I understand the consequences of your theories whenever they're attempted, which is why I detest your ilk. You're nothing but an ideologue masquerading as an intellectual and who does nothing of any human meaning or worth, who in his pursuit to validate his shitty theories denies the overwhelming evidence against it, instead jerking yourself off to the idea that you're somehow more enlightened than the rest because you refuse to accept the evident fact that private property as a fundamental right is the greatest conveyor of prosperity the world has ever seen, and delude yourself into thinking that we live in an age of authoritarianism and misery despite every single factual measurement of prosperity proving that we live in the best time in human history, brought to you by Capitalism.
lol, ""effectively on campus"".  calm down buddy.  you're letting the boogie man anger up your blood.
Oh no, I know them, and I actually kinda like the bookstore (it has good editions of Lenin, Mao, et al), but I'm not involved in their group. I don't like how clique-ish some of those groups can be-- which isn't a denunciation of their movement, just isn't for me.
I could have honestly just said ""on campus"" but like to be precise with my language. What would you call a location that has the actual UCB campus around it in every direction? 

Do think they picked that spot because of the high volume sales they get there?

As far as my anger goes it's  stunning how many people blindly support the hatefully dishonest mass murdering communist ideology that RevCom spews. Yes, I am very angry about that.
No, you weren't being precise, you were trying to link an un-affiliated entity to the university.  

Those old-ass berekley commies are super dangerous, you're so right...
I chose my words carefully; Revcom's bookstore is literally surrounded by actual UCB facilities and run by UCB alum who are explicitly part of an UCB alum communist cult. Where is the outrage for their decades of hate speech?
Yes, carefully chosen to conflate a private business with the institution.  It’s quite clear what you’re doing.

So do you have a specific issue with the individual business folk you’re decrying or just scary people with political beliefs counter to your own?  You’re sounding an awful lot like antifa right now.
My position is that in 2017 communists should be treated with similar scorn to Nazis. Do you disagree?
Yup

Edit: tell me, since you’re quite forceful on this point, what do you feel should be done about these particular folks?  What particular actions of theirs condemn them to your preferred fate?
I'm not sure what the best course of action is other then trying to educate people on hypocrisy of letting violence supporting self-identifying communists falsely label people Nazis.

The best outcome would be for more people to honestly investigate their rhetoric and start engaging in open dialogues. A lot of allied SJW groups have a very cultlike vibe that feels normal to members because their whole group thinks the same. Setting up situations where they have to really engage the dishonesty that is the foundation of their beliefs is key.

Action Needed NOW: Retain Our '@berkeley.edu' Email – Here’s a Template to Contact the Chancellor!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/170slpp/action_needed_now_retain_our_berkeleyedu_email/,2023-10-05 13:35:54," 

Hello Bears,

As many of you may be aware, a decision has been made to discontinue the provision of '@berkeley.edu' email addresses to new alumni, starting September 6, 2023. We understand the importance of this email address, not just as a means of communication, but as an identity and a connection to our esteemed alma mater Your [""@berkeley.edu](mailto:""@berkeley.edu)"" email address instantly verifies you as an alumnus of one of the most prestigious academic communities globally. It adds credibility and weight to your correspondence. This isn’t just about looking official - it’s a signal that you’re part of a rigorous academic environment renowned for producing some of the brightest minds in the world.

We’ve started a petition, and many of you have already shown your support (thank you!). Now, it's time to take our efforts a step further. We need to reach out directly to the administration, letting them know the gravity of this situation and the adverse impact it will have on both current students and alumni.

Below is a template you can use to send an email to Chancellor Carol Christ. Feel free to personalize it to reflect your experiences and sentiments.

**Email Template:**

Subject: Urgent: Retention of '@berkeley.edu' Email Addresses for Alumni

**Dear Chancellor Christ,**

**I trust this message finds you well. I am writing as a concerned member of the UC Berkeley community to express my deep unease regarding the sudden decision to discontinue '@berkeley.edu' email addresses for new alumni.**

**Our Berkeley email is not merely a communication tool. It represents our identity, achievements, and lifelong connection to an esteemed institution known globally for its academic excellence and innovation. It is an essential aspect of our professional, academic, and personal endeavours.**

**I am not alone in this concern. Over 7,000 individuals have already signed a petition highlighting the significant role that our '@berkeley.edu' addresses play in our lives and requesting a revision of this abrupt policy change. I invite you to review the petition here:** [**https://chng.it/m5Wby97S44**](https://chng.it/m5Wby97S44)

**We kindly urge a reconsideration of this decision. A potential alternative could involve offering alumni the choice to retain their email addresses through a subscription service or a one-time fee. This would ensure continuity and connection while potentially assisting with any administrative or operational costs associated with maintaining these accounts.**

**We are confident that under your esteemed leadership, a solution that respects and upholds the concerns of thousands of Golden Bears globally can be found.** 

**Thank you for your attention to this pressing issue. I, along with many others, am eager to engage in a constructive dialogue leading to a resolution that honours both the legacy and the future of UC Berkeley.**

**Sincerely,**

**\[Your Name\]**

&#x200B;

Send this email to Chancellor Christ at [chancellor@berkeley.edu](mailto:chancellor@berkeley.edu). It’s imperative that our voices are heard collectively. The abrupt nature of this change warrants immediate attention and action.

Go Bears! 🐻💙💛","Wait does this discontinue it for current alumni as well? I use my .Berkeley all the time for personal use and it's connected to countless accounts.
Why was this discontinued? What was the official rationale?
Important that everybody sees this. Comment for engagement
Thanks for putting this together/sharing it!
Can the moderator pin this post to the top or something? I feel like this is the most important issue right now.
Done!
Thanks! When I come to Berkeley, my senior told me I can still use the email after graduation. So I use this email to sign up for a lot of websites. So if I can’t use my edu email, it is nearly killing me in some way!
Such ""thoughtful"" decision. How can anyone in bright mind think this would be met with understanding?
I hope they switch over to outlook so I never have to fucking use Google docs or sheets a day in my life again over Excel.
“Dear Chancellor, we are desperate for clout”
Get with Cal Legends for sure.
Current alums already with an email won’t be affected
I have this same question :( I haven’t gotten the email about discontinuing alumni emails.
Google massively hiked the price, so the campus couldn't afford it.
Oski loves you 🐻💙💛
Niche situation, but what about alumni who already claimed it, yet returned to UC Berkeley as a student? I graduated and claimed in 2018, but I came back a few years later for grad school.
I graduated in 2022 and got an email saying I’m losing access
Somehow I figure ""couldn't"" is contestable, but good to know. Thanks!
There has to be another way, like purchasing a private server or something
Google is evil. I hate every single product Google makes. Fuck GCP, fuck Android, fuck Google Home, fuck Bard. Absolute dogshit company.
https://dailycal.org/2023/09/25/students-lose-access-to-berkeley-edu-accounts-after-graduation

Does anyone know what specifics in the terms changed? I don't see any press release or indication that google apps for education had a price increase or significant terms change.

I question if its all BS, especially if alumni are willing to pay. Thats probably just a matter of laziness of not wanting to build a payment system and not wanting to deal with the political backlash of ""inequity"" - privileging those with and harming those without even if its a mere $60 bucks a year.
Well, there was a bespoke private server, but this was moved away from. https://iris.eecs.berkeley.edu/faq/calmail-migration/

In reality though, it's BCR and their friends who are anti free speech. I see way more arguments between opposing sides outside of their rallies than ever occurs inside.

If they were trying to direct harm at students, it'd be a good thing. Left, right, in between, there's no room for bringing harm to the students.

That's funny, I watched Ben Shapiro's livestream and he did none of that. And frankly, the Q&A he had was great for both sides to discuss their issues and everyone was very respectful with each other's answers.

Perhaps you're just using a blanket argument against all right wings?

You think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS_RKwCYcl8) should be the ""consequences of free speech?""
Awesome. They're ""harming"" students so how does Berkeley retaliate, threaten harm back.
Free speech applies only to those who bought tickets? I don't remember that part of the First Amendment!
When the speaker's advocating harm against members of the campus community? I don't have a problem with that.

Are you referring to Bloody Thursday...?  Do you know anything about protest history in berkeley you haven’t been fed in the last 6 months?...
Boy, have you ever been into the fucking cafe we have dedicated to the Free Speech Movement on campus? Where it talks about how students surrounded a cop car for 40 HOURS and wouldn't let them take a man to jail? If we did that today, you idiots would be clamoring for the National Guard. If we did Civil Rights Era sit-ins, you'd be begging for police violence. You're a bunch of hypocritical, holier-than-thou liberals, whose lack of political understanding validates a position that simultaneously kills unarmed black men, and blames the black men for getting pissed off in response.

Everyone speaking in Berkeley has the right to feel safe. If you do not agree with what a person believes, would you rather have them agree with you based on rhetoric, or based out of fear? 

UC Berkeley is a public institution and, as the birth of the Free Speech Movement, should [financially] support speech (within reasonable means), even ones itself as an institution disagree with. Cal would be doing you a disservice if it tries to shield you from other people's beliefs and opinions because, as a Graduate, trust me, the rest of the world is not as politically and ideologically unified as UC Berkeley may be.
I hope so, but I doubt they would. It'd only give them more to whine 'oppression' about. 
I didn't mean security, I meant the large speaking fees.
I guess you could protest the organization pay (and thus the university) their speaking fees. But you really can't if the organization pays for it themselves.

But let's face it, often times when Berkeley protests a speaker, they don't protest that the University is actually paying them to speak, it's that they're actually speaking at UC Berkeley."

As a lifelong Bay Area resident, I have one request(I’m looking at you SoCal kids)…

Please stop calling it “THE BART”. It’s just BART. You wouldn’t say you’re taking THE public transit, just public transit, just as you wouldn’t say you’re taking THE Bay Area Rapid Transit, you would say you’re taking Bay Area Rapid Transit(BART without the “the”). Go to bart.gov and find me one place where it is officially called “THE BART” and then I’ll eat my own words and call Carol Christ mommy. Obviously saying the BART station or the BART train makes sense but not calling the system as a whole “THE BART”.

Okay sorry for my caffeine induced mini rant and safe winter break travels😅😊

Edit: I know I’m being petty lol, just something that’s been on my mind. In the grand scheme of things, I can’t make you not say it how you want to💙","[deleted]
I’m gonna go take a the shit brb
I think OP is right https://www.sfgate.com/local-donotuse/article/BART-corrects-Uber-CEO-others-It-s-just-12988514.php

I still need the ""the"" or I will go insane
You see (UC), it feels natural to say the Bart just because it sounds vaguely like “bus” and you take the bus. I can’t unuse the phrase at this point
As a Southern Californian, we preface things like freeway numbers with the (as in I would get home from here by driving on the 5) and this extends to saying the BART too. I know people from the Bay Area don’t say it that way, but I’m not from the Bay Area and don’t particularly want to shed my Southern Californian linguistic tendencies for the sake of assimilation.

tl;dr this is the most bland thing you could possibly choose to gatekeep
Born + Raised in the Bay and I usually say “The Bart” LOL

The real red flag IMO is when, as one person already described, people say stuff like “The 80” instead of just “I-80”
For a lot of people, BART is synonymous with subway

I take the BART to SF —> I take the subway to SF
Nah you take THE subway, or THE bart, or THE bus
Hi fellow bear,

You're incorrect. And I find your contempt to be misplaced, and pretentious. Acronyms frequently assume colloquial noun forms that transcend their initial grammatical structures.
Oh really? So do you usually ride THE BART little shit
Ok, I guess I'll just go take car to get on bus to go on train instead.
What's problem?
My friend who's a recent transplant, ""Man, traffic on the 80 was awful today.""

No dude, that ain't true because *the 80* does not exist in the Bay Area.
Who tf cares holy sht u srs ?
Isn’t it called THE underground train?
idk what you’re getting downvoted you’re literally right
10000%. I also grew up in the Bay Area and while at Cal I could always pick out SoCal people by the preface “the.” The Bart, The 5, etc.
Imagine not calling it THE Bart. Must be a smelly Compsci kid thing to do
I think people go ""the BART"" because they tried to go ""the subway"" and stopped out of respect for its special name. I wouldn't ask for more if I were you.

I don't know what people actually think when they say ""the bart"" tho, because determiners aren't invented yet back in my mother tongue :P
Unless you want to put a little respect on it’s name.
lot of socal haters in your replies 😞
Paraphrasing the words of the great Justin Timberlake/Sean Parker from Napster “Drop the ‘the’. Just BART. It’s cleaner”
Ok I’ll just take bus next time
Who Tf cares
I will now and forever say The BART.
Cope and cry
It’s not that deep
I’m good lol. Caffeine is one hell of a drug.
I means she/he/they/them/it is right though….
Not that odd, really. Adding “the” in places it doesn’t belong is a SoCal & midwestern thing that instantly identifies you as a transplant who’s too fucktarded to adapt to local customs. 

It’s fine if you still want to say “the BART” and “the 101” but understand that when you do you’re very loudly signaling that you ain’t from around here and you don’t care enough about here to bother learning the regional customs.
I barted
Or you could just say “I’m taking BART”. One less word, but I know what you mean🙃
BART is the name of the system, not the mode of conveyance. In terms of a bus it would be more like saying “I’m taking the AC Transit” which sounds stupid as hell.
This is exactly what it is. I grew up in Southern California as well and even up here, I’m naturally more inclined to say “the” 24 or the 580.  I don’t really care if people in the comments talk shit about it. I’ve never met anyone in real life who actually cares. It’s a habitual speech pattern that’s been ingrained in my head for over two decades.
Fuck SoCal tho
Socal mfs LOVE to talk about the 80 and the 5
You’ve fallen to the dark side lol or I’m just in the wrong acting like I actually ride on BART enough to care😅
same
Yeah, nobody from here calls it that, transplant.
Nope. BART is the name of the system, not the cars. If you want to compare it to a subway calling it “the BART” is like calling it “the MTA” and fucking nobody says “I’m gonna take the MTA.”
BART is the name of the system, not the mode of transport. Bus and subway are modes of transportation. BART is an acronym for the name of a transit system.

Hate speech is intellectually challenging?...
All speeches are hate speeches. I remember when I was at my kindergarten graduation and I thought I was going to die listening to the first speech I ever had to sit through. My best bud Harry said he used to give speeches all the time when he was a religious leader. He said he didn't believe any of the stuff he was saying anyway. 
I know this may be an unpopular view on this sub, but I'm quickly getting less and less supportive of ""free speech"".

Every first-world country besides the US has hate speech laws. Why can't we?
I'm getting the sense that no one these days knows what the definition of hate speech really is. It just kinda gets thrown around as a substitute for ""hateful speech.""
What do we do about a Milo event, for example, where he outs students who are here illegally, or trans ones? Ideally, these students wouldn't be harmed for being outed, but we know that's never going to be the case, not as long as there are groups which violently hate those students. Is the 'intellectual rigor' of Milo-fucking-Yiannopolous, or any of those goons, worth the risk to students -- and if it is, is that decision to be made by the campus at-large, and foremost the Chancellor, who will never be endangered by this speech, or by the groups made vulnerable by such speech?
Yes.
If you can't muster up an intellectual response, then yes, it would appear that it's challenging. Her speech was predicated on the fact that listening to only one view point creates an echo chamber. Give dissenting opinions a voice and challenge yourself to provide thoughtful replies.
It can be a challenge to distinguish between hate speech and genuine discourse, certainly. 
Since they can easily be a tool to silence unpopular opinions and ones that are politically convenient. 

For example, Germany is a country for the longest time hailed as an place that had limits on free speech but they were limited to a situations like holocaust denial and such. A few months back though, a German comedian decided to mock/insult the president of Turkey. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Böhmermann_affair

 Germany has laws against the using of speech for ""abusive criticism of a foreign state leader."" Normally a country like Germany would not bother making a big deal or using their speech limiting laws over a comedian mocking a world leader who has a number of horrific skeletons in his closet. They wouldn't define his insults as hate speech/abusive criticism. 

That said, if I remember correctly, either the EU was in talks with Turkey or had just signed a deal where Turkey would block/slow down the number of refugees it was letting into Europe. 

In this political background the German government chose to take into consideration the fact that Erdogan felt personally insulted and the Turkish government  demanded criminal prosecution of the comedian. They filed to prosecute the comedian on the charges of abusive criticism of a foreign state leader. 

Now thankfully the German public was fairly against this, and the government later dropped the charges against the comedian. That said, do you see how this could have a negative affect on society? For a while I am sure many people felt like the need to self censor and not speak their mind since the government was cracking down. A chilling affect was created. 

As long as hate speech laws exist they can easily used to target those that are politically convenient. They might first just be used to kick out the horrible, horrible neo nazis and such. Wait long enough though, it's not too difficult for anyone on the political spectrum to use it to their advantage. Communists/socialists peacefully rallying in Berkeley? Maybe a person who had escaped a terrible, terrible situation in the USSR files a complaint. They say that the use of the Soviet flag is a direct attack on them and ignores the huge number of their family that was put to death by an oppressive government and the fellow millions that also died. It might not be as good of a case like silencing neo nazis, but given the opportunity, do you not think that a sufficiently right wing president/government would not support that? 

There's a lot more too it, but this is what I was able to think off the top of my head about. Let me if you're still unconvinced/have questions. 



What do you mean
> where he outs students who are here illegally, or trans ones

Are you saying that he provided the names of individual students who fell into these categories?
Your fears of these actions being taken by Yiannopolous are unsubstantiated past one single incident, which has not been repeated since, despite having many tour stops afterwards.  It would be cruel and mean if it happened, but it would not be the responsibility of the University that he made that decision.

That burden would fall upon the BCR for inviting him, and I would hope, that they would have the common decency to acknowledge that they hurt their community, and should attempt to make amends for the situation.

You cannot judge a person before a crime is committed.  Neither Yiannopolous, nor Shapiro have committed one, and instead you intend to deem them, and ""any of those goons"" as guilty to your eyes, and with such a verdict, carry out actions to punish them - by barring them from their natural rights.  

That is vigilantism, not compassion; that is cowardice, not bravery; that is illegal, not justice.  
>students who are here illegally


Fuck em, America doesn't have the obligation to host them. Come here legally.
[deleted]
Is there a specific date?
The phrase was ""hate speech"" not ""dissenting opinions""

Hate speech, the vast majority of the time, appeals to the basest emotion and exceedingly little to intellectual discourse.

I take OP's point, I think the phrasing was bad.
No one should be forced to intellectually defend their own humanity; that's what arguing against hate speech would force you to do.
Is it really?...
**Böhmermann affair**

The Böhmermann affair (also known as Erdogate) was a political affair following an experimental poem on German satirist Jan Böhmermann's satire show Neo Magazin Royale in late March 2016 that deliberately insulted Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan using profane language.

Days after a music video titled Erdowie, Erdowo, Erdoğan in another German satire show had infuriated Erdoğan, prompting Ankara to summon the German ambassador, Böhmermann went on to find the line between satire, which is protected by freedom of speech legislation, and ""abusive criticism"" (German: Schmähkritik) of a foreign state leader, which in Germany is a punishable offense. Explicitly acknowledging this experiment to be deliberately offensive and ""forbidden"", Böhmermann went on to present a poem that not only harshly criticized Erdoğan for his human rights record, but was also liberally seasoned with profanity.

After the show was aired on German public television channel ZDFneo, the Turkish government released a verbal note demanding that the German government begin criminal prosecution of Böhmermann.

Regarding the Böhermann affair: I think we can all agree that it's stupid, and in no way would mocking a political leader be hate speech. Nobody is calling for a law that does that. We want speech limited for those who endanger others.

Edit: the law would have to be crafted precisely, obviously. But there's no reason it couldn't be; seriously calling for genocide, and basing your ideology on that call for genocide, is pretty cut-and-dry.
Yes. At Minnesota, the latter, and word was he planned to do the former here.
And the ones who were taken here by their mothers and fathers when they were infants? Fuck them too? And the ones brought by human trafficking? And the ones who are refugees from violence in their birthplaces? And the ones who, I dunno, just want a better life, and pay their taxes, don't hurt others, and frankly contribute more to this bloody place than a shithead like you ever will? Fuck them all?

Fuck you. Also, congrats on glossing over half the argument.
You care about the law more than you do others' safety. Lovely.

Hate speech is easy to poke holes at. If you disagree with something, you should be able to argue why. Doesn't matter what it is you're disagreeing with.
You're right, no one should be forced to. But it's really the only way to eliminate the ideas that cause the hate speech in the first place
dramatic, anti-intellectual appeal to emotion, topped with hyperbole and buzzword

bon appétit
[deleted]
for some people 
It's a slippery slope. One restriction on speech leads to another.
How would he possibly obtain the names of those students? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm genuinely curious.
And he has not done it since then.  You cannot stop someone from speaking based on the assumption they might say something that is hurtful.  

Regardless of that fact, saying something hurtful is still accepted speech, as long as it is not an implicit threat upon someone's life - and outing someone is not that, as cruel and mean as it is.  You do not have the right to stop someone from speaking merely because they are going to say something hurtful.

See, this is not intellectually honest. Yes, there are some people who were brought here not by their choosing at a young age or by human trafficking. They should be excused. 

However, those certain cases do not excuse the other people who intentionally broke the law. And NO, just because you pay taxes and don't hurt anyone doesn't give you a free ticket into this country. There are thousands to millions of people waiting in line to come here LEGALLY and obey the law, and you don't just get to cut the line and fuck over everyone else because you ""just want a better life"". 

[deleted]
I think you're inferring that I'm saying hate speech shouldn't be part of the conversation - I'm not.  I think it's a ridiculously weak avenue but of course there will always be hate speech.

I'm questioning that it's ""intellectually challenging""
There were just protesters in Charlottesville yelling that certain types of people should be sent to the gas chambers. We have had Nazis in Berkeley as well; it's not exaggeration to say that such rhetoric is encompassed by ""hate speech."" Is it really intellectually beneficial for a Jewish person to argue to a neo-Nazi that they shouldn't be gassed? For a black student to argue to a white supremacist that they aren't subhuman and aren't a different species?

The OP mentioned hate speech, I'm not bringing it up out of nowhere. And I'm not saying that said speech should be made illegal, just that its presence is not educational (as long as the definition of hate speech isn't extended beyond what it was intended for initially). Don't put yourself in a situation where you are arguing for the usefulness of racial slurs in a classroom, because that's abhorrent.
Read my other reply. I don't think it should be banned, I just don't think slurs and other hate speech have any educational value. Is that really so controversial?
That's not necessarily true. It's actually a logical fallacy, even.
At Minnesota, I'd assume it wouldn't be any harder than having an ally at the uni with knowledge. As for the validity of the illegal immigrant story, here's a source (https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/uc-berkely-protests-milo-yiannopoulos-publicly-name-undocumented-students-cancelled-talk-illegals-a7561321.html%3famp), albeit one without substantive proof. I wouldn't put it past him, but I'm also not assured that he was going to.
That's a fault of the immigration system. I frankly couldn't care less about those 'waiting in line' -- there should be no line in the first place. And I do understand the economic realities of today: unbridled immigration obviously can't work where there are countries which have, and others which lack. The root of this problem is economic; I won't blame individuals for breaking a law which they had no part in, and which makes their lives worse for having been born elsewhere.
The law physically protects people? Or maybe the fact that most people aren't killers does, since the law is ultimately ineffective and works on a repression independent of itself.
[deleted]
Oh, I mean I agree, that is a totally uncontroversial claim. 
I would disagree with that, actually.  Hate speech teaches us what people fear, and who they feel they can blame.  It can be important to know why a group is hateful in the first place (usually, it is either ignorance or cognitive dissonance), and knowing which, allows one to try to combat the issue.
You don't need to buy into the logical fallacy to accept that the German incident shows a larger trend:

Government is not above abusing well-intentioned laws. STINGRAY was supposed to be used to intercept terrorist phone calls. Instead, they use it to track weed dealers in black neighborhoods. Protest licences are supposed to stop chaos in the streets. Instead, they're used to allow city officials to choose what kind of dissent is permissible. 

Even if you think Neo Nazis should be locked up (I sure do), I will never trust government enough to hand them the power to brand ideas impermissible to express. 
No, it's really not. It's not an exaggeration to say that one restriction in free speech will lead to more. 
Yea I mean there is literally 1 guy from a university across the country who made that claim, with anonymous ""reputable"" sources. It just doesn't seem likely. I suppose we'll never know though.
>It's extremely easy to refute hate speech, and constructing arguments against things that make you angry is a great way to not only clarify your own views, but also to fight hatred with more than just just screeching ""RACIST!"".

Right... that's what I said.  I never said screech 'racist'

I disagreed that it was intellectually challenging.
Sure, it can be valuable to discuss hate speech. But there is no place for people in a discussion using hate speech.
I'm anti-govt, don't you worry. I am not in favor of any law as loose as being simply anti-hate speech. I'm for restricting speech which literally, or implicitly, calls for genocide.
It literally, truly, is. Especially when you consider that Böhermann said he knew he was acting against the law, and still was never punished. Claiming slippery slope here is like saying the government forcing children to eat vegetables in school meals is going to lead to the government forcing adults to eat vegetables in every meal. It's a lazy and illogical argument.
Well, the Drexel prof and student affairs. But the trans threat is definitely real, even if the immigrant one is difficult to measure.
[deleted]
As I am to understand, neither Yiannopolous nor Shapiro intend to have a discussion, they have been invited to give a presentation - a speech.

The dialogue about their comments will happen outside the bounds of their invitations - held by students among themselves and, should they feel motivated, by the faculty in their classes subsequent to it.  

At no point was any of it billed as a discussion.
It's already illegal to directly incite to violence. So anyone at a rally chanting ""it's time to start killing blacks"" is already breaking the law. 

As for implicit, that's a very dangerous road to go down. Is BLM implicitly calling for a genocide when they say ""fuck the police"", or when Ishmael Chantu (allegedly) writes ""kill cops"", is that an indirect call for genocide? In a more proximate example, is someone chanting ""build that wall"" calling for genocide? 

The spirit of the law is a good idea, but I'm afraid that its application will end up being turned on the people.
No. It's not. Give an inch, they'll take a mile. Having a law that slightly curbs free speech sets a precedent that people are mildly okay with it.
They may have both been real, and they would have both been illegal due to HIPAA and FERPA laws.
I don't get why you're expanding my argument for me here.  I said hate speech most often isn't intellectually challenging.  I didn't say anything on the subject beyond that.  

I think you're keeping a very broad definition of hate speech FOR me here in order to make your argument.
I'm not referring to that and at no point have we been discussing that.
No, I don't think that's genocidal. But that's (hopefully) why we have a justice system. I'm not claiming a law would be perfect -- none is --, but rather that it would save more from harm than it would harm.
Don't worry about it. Everyone else reading the exchange knows what you mean. He's just willfully missing the point.
[deleted]
That's where we'll have to agree to disagree I guess :)
Please argue me if you're responding to my argument.  Not some strawman you've built.
When you get angry (like if someone says shit that strikes you as hateful or attacking), it's an intellectual challenge to  keep your brain turned on, listen, and think instead of just seeing red.

That's obviously just my opinion, though. Maybe it's more of a challenge for me than for most people.

John Yoo, the architect of the 2ndBush-era torture program's legal justification is still employed by UCB.
Why is this bad? The article says that there are going to be layoffs in non-academic departments. If that means less administrators, isn't that better than what we have now?
Complain there are too many admins, and then complain when they get cut. Typical reddit.
Kariv was also the department head of Economics while i was there so i'm not that surprised by his salary
That's disgusting. I'm amazed this isn't more widely known. Guy is a war criminal.
It's all fine and dandy until it all starts affecting your financial aid and other things, which is going to happen. How are people going to feel when they can't talk to someone about what's going on and instead have to wait four days in line in a tent to get an answer? 
Because it isn't ""administrators"" (which is a vague term that typically refers to the ""overpaid"" UC management) that get cut, it is front-line staff that lose their jobs or cannot afford to live in the area anymore due to stagnant salaries. Facilities get cut, student service providers get cut, undergrad advisers get cut.

This means the service that those who remain can provide are of lesser quality to each individual because those who provide the service are overworked (e.g., janitorial staff covering multiple buildings, or undergrad advisers having added job responsibilities).

Also, consider the reality that a good portion of UCB staff are UCB (and other UC) grads. When these positions go, it's not only the student experience that suffers directly for the reason above, but *your jobs* also suffer. When you outsource programming staff jobs (as UCSF did), you undercut the jobs available for UC grads for any domestic job since the available job market gets more cramped because there are fewer options.

Cost cutting is not a magic bullet since there are still jobs that need to get done--and with increased tuition and more student experience is expected to get *better*, not worse.
*implying anyone can talk to financial aid services right now*
The number of administrators has more than doubled in the last 15 years. Somehow we were able to get by with far fewer than we have now despite the fact that financial aid existed back then too.
Yes but what about the student population? Has that not also grown exponentially? 
No. It's grown but not at anywhere close to that rate."

- Carol Christ (email)","Can I just say that I really appreciate that fact that Berkeley is listening to their students about this issue unlike UCLA that literally halfassed a virtual commencement and called it a day.

I know this might be cliche but I'm really touched by a lot of the kind gestures extended by our communities (students offering to help each other out with groceries, offering to tutor each other) I am proud to be part of Cal. :')
Who was this sent to? Haven't gotten said email
Great! They listened :)
Ok I am glad we’re still getting a commencement ceremony thank god they actually listen. Hopefully things will calm down enough for a July date.
Could we just have it online? Everyone's acting like we know coronavirus will be gone later this year. Even if it is, many people won't get to experience graduation since they'll be in grad school, working, etc.
I agree. We love to cynically complain about admin but Berkeley has handled this whole thing astonishingly well all things considered.
Go Bears!!

>unlike UCLA that literally halfassed a virtual commencement and called it a day.

Let's just hope that Berkeley keeps it this way and doesn't resort to a virtual commencement. I'd prefer to wait till a safer period in time so we can all still celebrate.
To be fair, UCLA is on the quarter system, and their quarter ended at about the same time that this pandemic became a big deal. Cal has plenty of time until the next commencement, because it is the only UC on the semester system, but the other UCs have had almost no warning whatsoever.
UCLA reversed course a few days after they announced that it would be virtual. They have yet to announce what they'll actually do, as far as I could find.

Why not me, esteemed mod of the Berkeley subreddit? I shall volunteer.
I can respect the Union striking for better contracts but this sucks for the students who are graduating.
We should just replace the commencement speaker with a hour long meme slideshow and highlights from overheard. 
[deleted]
lmfao imagining her walking up there twice
God Carol Christ was the most fucking boring speaker ever. She took our entire commencement to talk about her own official inauguration. I found it inappropriate for a day that is supposed to be about the students moving forward.
jesus christ
One last middle finger from this town I guess.  Was actually kind of excited that we got a pretty interesting speaker.
This is ridiculous I'm mad. Why even say yes, have us announce it and get everyone excited and then withdraw last minute leaving us without a speaker? This is Berkeley and it's the 150th anniversary as well we deserve to have an interesting important speaker. Nobody likes or cares about Carol Christ. I didn't pay $50 for commencement tickets for this. 
When I call to see a doctor, the staff tells me if I don't show up on my appointment, there will be $50 bill charged on me. I guess this is a lesson for any universities, put it in the contract if the speaker decides to cancel, he/she has to pay a lot of money.
I wonder if they could get Thomas Sowell to fill in in a pinch given close proximity.  He is getting up in years and will be sorely missed when gone.  But given that he dislikes public speaking, doubtful.
This just in: Liberal union convinces liberal politician to disappoint thousands of liberal students.

I'm not saying this isn't a good way to give their cause attention, but I'm not sure I think all publicity is good publicity. I know people flying in early *just* to see her speak, and I was only going because of the interesting speaker. What a shitshow.
Bring back Dirks
LOOOOOOOOOOL
Wow I graduated in 2009 and it looks like the union workers are still fucking over commencement speeches 9 years later.

At least we got Chris Gardner as a last minute fill in because he gave zero fucks. He went through a lot of shit in his life so was not going to let a union picket line deter him. He turned out to be great IMO. He even made it a joke ""I wasn't your first choice, your second choice, or even your third choice, but I'm the one that picked up the damn phone.""
our school is such fucking trash LMAO
Weak move, I’m furious. 

I wasn’t happy when she was announced to begin with. This is our day to celebrate with family and get some parting wisdom, Harris’ central presence would politicise that. 

She made it even worse today because she went against her word and is dulling a crowning lifetime experience for thousands of students - we have Carol Christ now ffs. 

It’s absurd to me that a protest which had nothing to do with Harris is now ALL about her. I really do feel for the workers but why couldn’t she express her concerns in a conversation with Cal’s administration? Or reference it in her speech? This is so over the top.

The cynic in me sees this as her pandering for brownie points from her liberal base and also dissociating herself from Cal - for a Presidential run as another poster mentioned - in one fell swoop. 
Beast mode IMO.
Hopefully they sort this out in two years. I'd like a cool speaker at my grad ceremony if I end up going.

Not a fan of Harris to begin with to be honest, but I understand her reason for dropping out. 

She still rubs me the wrong way, she seems very corporate. I feel like her commencement address would have been underwhelmingly just a campaign speech from her. But overall, her reasoning for choosing not to speak in 2018 is fair I guess. If you've aligned yourself with the unions, then you shouldn't cross the picket line for some speech. Loyalty is important, even if I don't completely agree with/support her.
We want Milo!
Damn, I was really jealous that class of 18 was going to have Kamala Harris. Now, I am okay. Hehe. 
This is so progressive! Kamala 2020!

who the fuck cares? finals >>> some shitty commencement fluff. fuck kamala, fuck the strike, fuck carol christ 
I’ve never heard of Kamala Harris until right now. 

Edit: wow Reddit is harsh. So many downvotes cause I didn’t know a senator. 

Edit 2: lol this is so funny. 
Her prerogative.   
honestly
Actually had a nice conversation with him the other day. You could do worse. 
why couldn't we just have oski at this point 
My guess is that Kamala Harris wants to support the strike, and insodoing demonstrate a commitment to California's lower and working classes. 

Also, if she's thinking of running for president (https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Kamala-Harris-2020-election-Trump-country-Michigan-12890494.php), then additional associations with Berkeley (as a bastion of liberalism) won't help her.
She's refusing to cross the picket line. 
Walking in with that huge crowd (it takes like half ah hour just to process in, walking at a decent clip) is a once in a lifetime feeling you’ve earned. The speakers are almost always beside the point. Not gonna lie, it’s a looooong hot morning, but it is thrilling to be part of that elite group. 
Same here. I guess I’ll just get a burrito somewhere else. 
Task force commencement speaker lil B
If we're admittedly being a little selfish, sucks for a lot of freshmen/people with meal points too. Cal Dining is going to be pocketing a ton of unspent points because of the staffing shortage this week. 
Also sucks for the student employees during finals week who have to make up for all the missing labor 
[deleted]
Carol Christ
Cuz the unions just went on strike and just called for the boycott...
Call her office to leave a complaint.
Take your anger out on UC for not paying workers fair wages & agreeing to the union contract. I think Kamala is showing great leadership by doing this. There are more important things in life than a commencement speach or a school birthday.
The doctor pays you to show up? 
It draws negative attention to the university, thus pressuring them to negotiate. The power to make the university look bad is one of the unions' big points of leverage.
You should see what they’re doing at /r/UCLA
They're not liberal
thanks bazooka jr
Ah yes, those damn union workers. They're way too influential, wielding their power senselessly just to screw over the five people who actually pay attention to commencement speeches! I bet they purposefully negotiated poorly last year and made their own lives a living hell so that they'd have a reason to strike during finals week. So smart.
Lol
I mean you should probably know the senators of the state you live in
keep the Fieri dreams alive
No.  Not Oski.  No.
To your second point, why would she have agreed to speak in the first place?  Berkeley didn’t just become a liberal bastion in the past two or three months since those arrangements were made. I do think sympathy with unions and low paid workers is a thing tho,  
Mm.  You've definitely got a point, but the fact that she doesn't say as much is disappointing.
I suppose we have different motivations. I have primarily viewed going to school here as a (somewhat) necessary stepping stone to progress with my life. I'm happy knowing that the job is done and that I can move on. 

Completing this degree has drained the life out of me in many ways. It has redirected my attention almost entirely away from my friends, family and personal well being. To be honest, I have developed a level of disdain for this place. I understand that the process has probably made me a stronger person and that most of the suffering involved was primarily self imposed, but I am not exactly left with the fondest of memories. Most of my existence as a human being has been reduced to a quiet nobody sitting in the corner of a library studying. IMO that's no way to be, and I don't think the process of learning inherently requires this.

TLDR: I have been looking forward to seeing the Campanile in my rear view mirror all this time, not the sea of robes at graduation.
What’s up with sahai and anime? I see it referenced a lot , even though cs162 is the anime class.
Yes I understand and support the workers and believe the UC is at fault but this doesn't seem to accomplish much except disappoint students. Idc if Kamala speaks I just want someone better than Carol Christ. Plus for the workers to be paid fairly. 
This is entirely the UC’s fault. If they payed their workers a living wage then this wouldn’t have happened.
I agree I'm mad at Berkeley they should be paying workers fair wages. This wouldn't have happened if they did. They should be taking action. But why are the students the ones being punished for it? I don't necessarily care if Kamala is the speaker but I think they could get someone better than Carol Christ. She's the chancellor she's gonna speak anyway. Why not get Robert Reich or someone as a replacement... 
If I make an appointment and fail to show up at the time of the appointment, the doctor's office will charge me a fee.
they are so angery
I mean, what better week to do it? It's not like they're intentionally negotiating poorly. In fact, just the opposite. This week is when they'll have the most leverage so it's the best time for them to protest.
There’s a lot of senators and too many names to remember. Plus I’m horrible at remembering names. 
username checks out
When she accepted she might not have been considering a presidential run.

That said, my second point was (and is) just conjecture.
She's pulling out to support the strike [according to her office](http://paydayreport.com/exclusive-kamala-harris-to-skip-uc-commencement-at-unions-request-arizona-strike-settlement-tenn-gov-moves-to-bust-union/). So it's more that the article/email doesn't say as much.
You are not alone by any means and I imagine the number of people who share your opinion outweighs, by far, the number of people really sad to be closing this chapter. Time and perspective has a way of redirecting your memories and emotions though, and my fondness for Cal, and my appreciation for my time there has grown with each passing decade.  I encourage everyone to spend your last weeks there gathering memories, because Cal will never again be “yours” in quite the same way. 
[deleted]
Kamala could have used her speech to advocate for these workers. Backing out punishes students who didn't do anything wrong, and who may have even participated in the protests themselves.
If you feel that way, you should call to complain that she accepted in the first place but, more importantly, complain about the fact that, despite her talk, she hasn’t used her position to effectively advance the position of workers or the UC.
Probably just no time to find another replacement.
[deleted]
exactly
just two my guy!
UC Berkeley never tells the full story of ""the other side"" when communicating about strikes. So, it's not surprising if they didn't provide much detail.
That's good to hear.  I checked her website and Twitter feed but neither had said anything to that effect.
Cs162’s head TA has all the exams, worksheets, and review sections have anime references to them. No anime knowledge needed to actually take the course (or to do better on exams) but it’s still fun to see them show up. Lectures are sadly anime-free.
But pissed off and disappointed students will pressure the administration to perhaps do something for the protesting workers - so she probably is making the right political move here.
Ok... We just don't want Carol Christ as our speaker. We don't have the right to be disappointed? 
I mean, it's not like they're not still intentionally fucking people over. I don't disagree with either of you I guess.
Yea but then there’s also the house representatives , state governor, my local mayor, the district representatives and all that good stuff. What I was trying to say is that there are a lot of names to remember in government and I’m not good at remembering those names. 
That might work for high school, but this is college. Berkeley, no less. We're not idiots. There are other ways to support a strike and people that attend UCB have the basic reasoning skills to understand that. This is a choice made by Harris, and any student who gives enough of a damn to be pissed will see that. 
[deleted]
yeah, but I don’t think it’s an unreasonable price to pay for things like this. 


or even large enough to warrant the complaining in this thread 
Ehhh. 

You’re a grown-up. It’s part of being an adult to learn the people who hold sway over you, politically, socially, economically. Etc. 

I know all of those names. I might be missing a local superintendent or two, but I know my governor (Brown), federal senators (Feinstein and Harris), state rep (Speier), and state reps/senator (who I won’t name  merely because it gives away too much local information.)

The more you cede this to others, the more you get shitstain politicians and leaders. 

Don’t be a patsy. 

You ""hate"" her now? Really? Because she's not speaking at your graduation anymore? Jesus Christ there are so many more important things in life than this.

What legal routes does the university have to ""make some changes so this shit doesn't happen again""?
It's too bad the people the security was hired to stop can't be billed for it. 

First remove the masks then take out their credit cards.
You're definitely right. So of the real costs, the university footed 98.7% of the bill, and BCR's billionaire buddies footed 1.3%.
Christ mentioned capping the limit to funding from the university to pay for events, which seems like it could be a Constitutional start. The government can't stop people from speaking, but it doesn't have to pay for it. I'd like to see a restriction on certain halls (Zellerbach, Wheeler, etc.) that requires student body approval, or ASUC approval, or something of that nature. So that way if someone wants to use a high occupancy hall, they can prove a) that it's not just to host their troll session on school property, b) that it'll be adequately attended-- and not just be non-students, as the Shapiro event seemed to be at least half-full of. If non-students want to hear someone speak, they don't have a right to take up valuable campus space for it, IMO.
On Weds, the Alt-Right literally started a fight with a group of African American students.  Eventually, the police had to form a line to stop black students from being assaulted.

A member of the Patriot Prayer group went to a homeless camp and started attacking people.

Police had to go to a book store after staff, and security guards from the shopping center were assaulted by Alt-Right people.
The costs aren't about ""paying for speech"", but enforcing the law against Antifa. I don't think (a) and (b) can be enforced unless the school can prove in court that the policies aren't targeting right wing speakers thereby violating free speech. If UC Berkeley caps the funding from the university to pay for events (I think this is a good idea, costs aren't sustainable), then Berkeley or California may step in to enforce the law.

I don't think any policies are going to stop right wing / alt right trolls from coming to Berkeley, if that's your goal. If they aren't in a campus building, then they'll be at People's Park or wherever. The more militant Antifa is, the more the right wingers are going to want to come here. The optics are excellent for them, not just for unifying their movement but also turning the general public against Antifa and communists.
Was that were the security costs were paid to prevent or address? Or was it something more along the lines of large scale property destruction and group melees?

> Why did Chelsea Manning not get that at Harvard?

Harvard is a private school.  Stanford is a private school.  USC is a private school.  They don't have these kind of issues because they are private institutions, private companies, private property.

Cal is a public university.  UCLA is a part of that same public university.  The University of Virginia, which is found in Charlottesville, is a public university.  State institutions which receive state funding (14th amendment) and federal funding (1st amendment) have responsibilities that private institutions do not.
So because Berkeley is a public school, the city and university are obligated to provide security for an unpermitted provocateur to make trouble for their own notoriety at the expense of the community?  Sweet sidestep of the issue, which is the establishment silences leftist voices but demands to spew its garbage in leftist spaces, and gets off on doing it honestly.
Or you could try blaming the groups that threaten violence so no such high cost of security is needed. 
The thing about being a provocateur is that they willfully, knowingly, and intentionally attract conflict for its own sake.  Just listen to Milo's words change to fit the situation.  In his broadcast the day before the event, he said he hoped there would be no violence, but when he got to the event and there was no violence he said he was disappointed the counter protesters weren't being more rowdy.  This is one of many examples of Milo, his associates, and his supporters giving lip service to wanting peace to build sympathy while being both insulting as well as violent and censoring opposing voices when they can get away with it."

Rising sophomores and incoming freshman/transfers who haven't gotten housing offers: start looking for off-campus housing asap!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/oanjw6/rising_sophomores_and_incoming_freshmantransfers/,2021-06-29 19:30:30,"In a regular year, there are many people who don't get offers for on-campus housing. The problem will be especially worse this coming semester. To put everything into perspective, around 7,000 undergrads live in on-campus housing, [95](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/housing)% of entering freshman live in uni housing , and there were [6,000](https://opa.berkeley.edu/campus-data/uc-berkeley-quick-facts)freshman in 2020-20201 (not counting approx, 3k transfers).

During covid, a lot of freshman decided to stay home, and the students that did come to campus were all placed in singles. This means that the coming year will have far less capacity because incoming freshman an rising sophomores who didn't live on campus are now applying for the same housing. If we're being generous, we can estimate 60% of rising sophomores won't need housing (bc they lived in campus during covid), so 2400 sophomores are applying to on-campus housing. Add that to the 5700 incoming freshman, and you're bound to have a **ton of people who won't receive housing offers**.

In a statement last February, [Carol Christ said](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/02/22/an-update-from-chancellor-christ-on-two-uc-berkeley-student-housing-projects/), "" Due to the high cost and low supply of housing close to campus, we estimate that 40% of our students are not able to live in Berkeley."" To rising sophomores and incoming freshman/transfers, please start looking for off-campus housing! It's tough enough to find places in a normal year, but the problem will be more extreme in the coming months.

FWIW in a normal semester most sophomores don't live in on campus housing (as OP mentions) because most people decide that on campus housing is not worth the higher prices. Plus it's nice to have a kitchen instead of relying on dining halls :)

If all else fails, public transportation is pretty good in the bay area. You could easily live in Walnut Creek or Pleasant Hill and take BART back to Berkeley. I believe the UCB has a free shuttle that runs to and from BART often. 

You can find rooms on Craigslist, [Apartments.com](https://Apartments.com), or I would try the local Facebook marketplace rentals (change the map to Berkeley 94720). Rooms are around $900 - $1500/ month.
Just wondering, where’d you get the number that there are 5700 incoming freshmen?
Some housing I found from landlords I know: 

https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/d/berkeley-apartment-for-rent-bedroom-1bth/7347847346.html

https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/d/berkeley-bedroom-apartment-available/7347846776.html
Tbf it’s a pretty nebulous distinction. None of the on campus housing is actually on campus. They’re actually between 1-5 blocks out. You can find off campus housing closer to the campus than on campus housing.
 it definitely feels unfair
If it makes you feel any better, living on campus is overrated.
You knew what you signed up for when attending last year though
But it still in waves, we have end of June and July for decisions. It still a good idea to start on a plan B just in case.
Can confirm, as a transfer student I’ve heard absolutely nothing. Really need to hear back soon cuz I need to know when to make offers for plan B
Craigslist and FB groups
There are around 6,000 incoming freshmen every year.  That link provided by the OP tells you exactly that.

Usually around > 95% of them opt for on-campus housing.
[removed]
Foothill, Bowles, and Stern are all on campus.  But you're right, you can find off-campus housing that is closer than all the rest.
No it's not.  It's where you get ""the college experience"". It's where you meet people that may or may not be your lifelong friends.  Yeah, it's not the greatest housing, but it's one of the few places where a bunch of college students hang out in non-academic settings.
That still doesn’t make it right though.
Nah I thought this covid thing would be over by summer. I didn’t know it would be a year long pandemic

I’m a 2020 transfer. Parents didn’t let me go to campus during pandemic. Didn’t particularly want to too
How many of them actually get housing? Fall 19 I remember there were students temporarily living in the floor lounges in the units. I heard similar things for foothill.

You can find off campus housing closer than all of them (at least in a useful sense). There’s an apartment literally adjacent to Etcheverry - can’t get closer than that.

Foothill is technically next to campus but it’s next to a road on the east.
>one of the few places where a bunch of college students hang out in non-academic settings.

This is the biggest misconception imo. If you are proactive, you'll see that there's endless social activities on campus, through non academic clubs or im sport, there's a lot of places to meet people. If you make friends by living together with others that's cool too. But the off chance you'll click with people randomly assigned to your room/floor/building is small. 

Yeah, living with random people who can be a pain to deal with is an experience. But rubbing salt on the wounds of incoming sophomores by telling them they've missed a big part of college life is nonsense.
Foothill is on a piece of land that is contiguous with the rest of campus. The road is campus owned not city owned. I know this because when we wired up the reshalls for internet, we were able to attach Foothill, Bowles, and Stern to the campus network directly, but all the rest had to go over Comcast installed lines because we contracted with them to get the city permits since they already had a process."

The compliance website, linked from the Chancellor's email today, also states that this is not a fine, which is false per the settlement's language. Settlements like this are typically how universities resolve these violations. 

The violations occurred between '09-'16, before Carol Christ became chancellor.","Love how she just glossed over what specific violations the fine is for and doesn't link to a full version of the final report.
As someone who was attending during this timeframe, but too lazy to see if I could still remember the password don my alumni email, here is the message:

No matter her opinions, I can only sincerely hope that peace and civility will prevail.
Right out of the gate, she is making a serious mistake giving neo-Nazis and white supremacists free reign to espouse utter hate towards the vulnerable members of our community. I hope progressive students put pressure on her at the forum and she changes her mind. With a bigot already in the White House, it is critical that we don't allow bigots to gain cultural traction in our own backyard.
She's going to learn her lesson the hard way.
You're smoking crack if you think that. Already, she hasn't even STARTED the event, and you go about claiming she's giving free reign to the community. Get out of here with that noise!

Hmm, I believe there are much more important factors that show a leader's allegiance to the group he/she is leading. 
I think the White House analogy is a bad comparison. It's advantageous to the secret service and to taxpayers to have the first family in the White House instead of other locations. It's easier and cheaper to guard. No one is guarding the Chancellor or her family. I don't see how where she lives is relevant to her job performance, especially since she still lives close to campus. In fact, in general I think that it's healthier to live in a different location than where one works, in order to properly unwind at the end of the day.

I don't care where she lives, but if she is leaving the University House vacant, she should open it up for low-income students or the homeless to live in."

Then why does athletics receive 31 million each year directly out of campus funds?
And this post refers to the whole library system, not just the anthropology one. Just to clarify.
Forcing students to decide between athletics and libraries is a piss poor take.

How about instead of having students decide what to cut and exchange, the university simply works on getting all student programs adequately funded. Berkeley and UCs in general have been underfunded by CA taxpayers for decades now.
please understand this, athletics has their own income streams, your tuition isn't funding the athletics programs, the athletics programs fund themselves. the problem is 100%, without a doubt, lack of resources . when you fight to rearrange the budget down here within the school, you are directly taking money from somewhere else in the university community (except athletics who has their own money). the real fight is with the state of CA, who has cut Berkeley's budget every single year recently.
please sign the [petition](https://chng.it/w479q7mvyf)! thanks all 🫂
How can we support the campaign?
Why the faculty continually picks fights with athletics, which actually has the ability to generate revenue for the school, is beyond me. 

What should fix this problem is more middle management decision makers from the administratIon dept.
If you think that the money from Cal Athletics is remotely the same money tied to academic resources like an anthropology library, I’ve got some news for you.
Imagine the parking lot that could be built tho
In the past Cal Athletics ran a large deficit that the campus would end up picking up the tab for. Christ decided to just hand over money up front. Only football and men’s basketball (historically, maybe not today) make money. And that’s not enough to cover all the other sports and pay off the stadium debt. Every time a Cal Athletic Director has tried to balance the budget by cutting sports there’s a huge protest led by those programs and alumni to keep the sports. So it goes.
https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/25/hotline-analysis-cal-athletics-turned-a-profit-in-fy20-thanks-to-a-massive-assist-from-central-campus/amp/
Ohhh, the university should just choose to have more money. Yeah I wonder why they haven’t thought of that yet
Lowkey, sometimes it feels like the university *tries* to be underfunded, since then it can argue for increased funding from the government. If everything was adequately staffed and resourced, it would be much harder to argue for “superfluous” budget increases versus “necessities”… of course this isn’t very sustainable…
ya
pretty sure the athletics program runs a ~$6 million deficit every year
men's football and basketball make money. 

but because of title IX compliance, school has to run women's programs. there are also men's programs that don't make money (e.g. baseball/golf), so overall, the athletics dept runs a deficit
so if you think that everything besides atheltics is important, you are always going to reallocating money from somewhere else if you only throw the blame as high as the chancellor
Football funds itself, but IA as a whole runs on a deficit.

IA is an auxiliary department and is supposed to fund itself.  The campus should cut them off and make them balance their own budget.

Thanks! I've been wanting to go to the library because I have two classes in that building and a friend told me it was their favorite library because it's super quiet and usually pretty empty, but whenever I've looked online it says it's closed. Can you tell me where exactly it is in the building? What floor etc.?

https://www.denverpost.com/2023/01/20/ucla-and-cal-athletics-financial-reports-paint-gloomy-pictures-add-context-for-both-to-the-big-ten-situation/

I recalled the numbers wrong, but from 2014-2019 the athletics department ran an average yearly deficit of $14 million.

the last few years have seen a surplus, but the surplus is entirely due to central campus shelling out millions of dollars (without central campus support, last year would've seen a $16 million deficit)
Yeah, no problem. It’s a great library. It’s located on the second floor of the anthro building. Assuming you walk in from the front of the building, turn right you’ll be in front of the double doors that open to the stairwell; walk up till the next set of doors open them and turn left and walk down the short hallway, and you should see the library as soon as you turn left. The hours are 1-5pm but usually I find it open about 2pm.

Does it matter when you your accept admission offer? Like will it impact applying for housing, class selection, etc.?

After two years, what happens if I don’t get into Haas? Also, how do I increase my chances of getting into Haas?
I was admitted to Berkeley and I was just about to submit my SIR...
Is it ok if I don't take an AP test that I had stated on my application that I would take? I decided not to take the AP Lit exam after I realized that taking the AP Lang test already gives me some credit. Will this be ok?? Should I call admissions and let them know?
Hi guys, transfer decisions just came out and I unexpectedly got accepted to UC Berkeley. I was wondering how the social scene is because although it may not be important to others, making new friends connections is VERY important to me. For those who already go to Berkeley, do you find that your social life is going well? Or are the horror stories (that I've heard and read about) of people being socially awkward true? 
I chose the top four ranking sites in a Google search made from incognito mode (so my previous browsing history would not influence search results). Here were the ranking results for Berkeley:

[US News](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities): #21  
[Niche](https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/?page=2): #42

What could explain these rather low rankings?
Hey guys,

I'm a HS senior and have narrowed my choices to Caltech and UC Berkeley for my college selection.

I want to be a Math major and study pure math and theoretical physics.

I visited Caltech and really liked the small size, the great student to teacher ratio and the great research opportunities through SURF.

I was wondering if anyone familiar with Berkeley math can comment on the department there. How is the access to professors and how are the research opportunities?

Also, how's the rigor of the math courses? Are the courses taught by the profs or the grad students? I'm not too worried about the rigor as I've done a fair bit of college math in high school, but I'm just curious.

I would appreciate if anyone can chime in with their opinions on Caltech vs Berkeley for math.

Thanks!

- How much better is the program than UCLA? 

- Will I have problem getting housing if I submit my SIR in about 2 weeks? 

- How's the on-campus food and are there any good places around/near campus? 

- How is the atmosphere/interaction with other students? Challenging/Cutthroat?

- How hard will classes get? Is being super stressed/depressed like a normal thing?

- How modern are the buildings? The chemistry/engineering stuff?

Thanks

hello! I have been admitted to l&s for cellular and molecular bio and ive been trying to decide between here and ucla. although i know berk is highly ranked for bio what's your opinion? likes and dislikes? also im fairly quiet in classes so do you think getting into research labs would be difficult? and are internships(like at ucsf) hard to find/get into?  
How do I know which AP credits I can use as pre-Haas? Their website only states calculus and english, are there any others? 
Hey, I made an account just to ask this. I'm a sophomore and I have some great friends through my freshman dorms and classes, but I really wanted to give the Greek thing a go this upcoming fall(I'll be a junior). I have friends in houses, and I'll ask them about rush and other stuff, but I just wanted to get a general opinion here from those who are in Greek Life. My understanding is it's very rare, there's a stigma attached to it, and unless one has a strong tie to a frat via a brother, it will be far harder compared to a freshman or sophomore, since they actively prefer those. Thoughts? Thanks!

How do people get girlfriends and friends with benefits at Cal? I'm an CS major and all the people I mostly meet are guys. I'm not ugly or anything, but I'm confused how people are dating so easily?
Hi everyone! I’ll be attending Berkeley this coming fall as an out of state transfer student and while I’m grateful for this incredible opportunity on so many levels, I am completely terrified. I have never been to the campus (or even the Bay area) before. In fact, I’ve never lived on my own before and the idea of being completely alone for the first time of my life, without my friends and family or any sort of support system, is making me extremely anxious. I know this is just a part of being an adult (though I’m not worried about having to be self-sustaining because I’m generally pretty independent) but I didn’t expect this step to come so soon and I didn’t expect it to be so dramatic because I didn’t even consider Berkeley as a possibility. In fact I was just aiming to get into my state’s flagship school  (which is super close to home and literally where all my friends go) and planning for that future. But now it feels like my entire life has veered off course and I have no idea what to expect. 
I don’t have a hard time getting along with people or making casual friends but I do have a hard time making connections beyond that and people have told me that I’m hard to get close to. And beyond that, I’ve had a lifelong struggle with depression that can get pretty severe, and I’m sure this entire situation won’t help. Plus the imposter syndrome. Because I’m 99% sure luck has gotten me this far and I’m scared that I’m going to end up failing out.
So... I guess what I’d like to know is... If you went through this experience too, how did you cope? Did you contact family and friends back home regularly? How did you get out of that mindset of being stuck back home? And how did you deal with the extreme change in academic rigor? Any tips would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR Slightly to very emotional incoming OOS transfer student is trying to come to terms with unexpectedly having to live alone for the first time in an unfamiliar place. 
>**\*\*About your first math class** *We* *do not* *recommend Math 53 or Math 54 as your first math class at Berkeley, even if you received a score of 5 on the BC Calc exam or you took single\-variable calculus courses at a community college.  Berkeley Math is very rigorous and theoretical, and many students who choose to skip Math 1B will suffer in Math 53 or 54.  Chemical Engineering majors, in particular, shouldn’t skip ahead.* 

um how much should I take this to heart? My Calc teacher was very adamant about skipping 1A and 1B and I really want to but uh...

also does AP Lang count for R1A \+ 4 units  \(so like 8 units\) or just 4 units?
When do Decals for fall typically go up? I'm particularly interested in the fencing class. 
For Math 53 in the fall, should I take Sethian's class or an 8am with Tataru? I've heard that Sethian's average is almost a full letter grade below the average, but I don't know if 8am lectures are worth it. Does anyone have experience with either professor?

If it matters, my other coursework would be Physics 7A, Engineering 25, and R/C B.

Opinions on taking only 3 classes+decals first semester?

(edit a year later): do it. My first semester was so chill -- I was so happy and better able to transition. It gave me hope at Berkeley : ' ) But second semester when I took a full course load, I was a lot more oof.
Just got rejected, unfortunately. I'm a bit unhappy since Berkeley was the closest to a dream school I ever had, but I did apply to EECS.

As a result, I do not plan on coming to this subreddit anymore. I will probably enroll at UCLA, and end up being happy there. It just sucks to have been rejected.
What options are there if I have not received housing offer from campus housing apts? i'm looking for a single room close to campus around south side (yeah i know it's asking for a lot)
I've heard that a lot of the times students are treated like numbers just because it's a fairly big public university. How is this actually true in  practice? Is it really hard to take classes you want to take?
Hey all, prospective transfer student here (decisions aren't out yet). Curious about the likelihood of me being able to change majors if I were to matriculate. I applied for PoliSci but have an insane amount of econ and math coursework and am now hoping to study Political Economy. Possible? Thanks!
CalCentral is saying that I have 2 incomplete financial aid tasks; it required me to sign a Terms and Conditions form and a TIV Authorization, but even after I clicked to authorize both of them the website still says the tasks are incomplete. Am I missing something? 
on Cal Day:

* is it worth going to if I already visited campus once for the regents overnight program, and I'm 90% sure of attending in the fall? I live in SoCal, so it costs quite a bit to fly there but not too expensive

* If it's worth it, do I bring my parents with me, or should I explore by myself?

* Should I make it a day trip, or is there anything going on really early or late that's a must?

USC vs Berkeley for CS? 

I got into L&S but I'll have to declare CS after freshman year with 3.0+ GPA. Berkeley is obviously a very highly ranked school but overall is the cutthroat environment and quality of living worth the education? 

Also, is it possible to graduate in 3 years at Berkeley with a ton of APs? Or is it impossible because huge classes will mean you'll get shut out of classes during registration?

Hello all! I found out Friday that I was waitlisted for C.S. at Berkeley(which I’m excited about). Does anyone know how many kids they usually take off the wait list(I’m a transfer student). 

I know it’s probably not a set number but I couldn’t find any stats online about how many they have taken in previous years. 

Congrats to all who have been accepted thus far. 

Note: I saw what the person about said but the stats only show freshman students waitlisted not transfer.

Hey, guys, I recently got admitted to Berkeley as a transfer. I'm a math major and I'm currently torn between UCLA and Berkeley. I know Berkeley has a better Math department than UCLA, but what's making me lean towards UCLA is the departmental scholar program that they have for math. UCLA's departmental scholar program basically let's you do your masters along with your bachelor's. I know Berkeley has something similar with engineering but I haven't found anything similar for math. My questions are: does Berkeley have something similar to what UCLA has? Is it worth picking Berkeley over UCLA for the prestige? 
If you late drop a class, do you get a W on your transcript for it, or are all references to it removed entirely? Ws count as Fs for law school, so it’s important I avoid dropping if that’s the case.
I just committed to UCB for MechE and I have some questions for current students.

1)  What housing building/area do you recommend for apartments? I dont want to stay in the dorms, but I want to be as close to campus as possible (preferably the engineering area).

2) Is the food pass worth it? How is the food?

3) How do I find reliable roommates?

4) Any MechE students have any advice?

5) Is anyone going to the transfer weekend this Friday?

I want to know what dates are for enrollment for newly admitted undergraduate students. I found the right PDF but am still having a hard time understanding with how many dates are on the document. I also do not understand how the enrollment proccess works... Thanks in advanced for the help!!!!

Hi! 

I just got into Berkeley from the waitlist and I had a few questions I wanted to ask.

1. For housing, what's the general consensus about what's favorable and who you want to be with? It's chill if I just dorm with randoms my first year, right? 

2. Academically, I've heard a lot of rumors about grade deflation and how it's absolutely terrible but I've also heard that if you don't slack off and you keep working, you'll be absolutely fine. As someone who got into L&S and wants to transfer to MCB, I don't really know what to expect. Can someone provide any info?

3. How bad is smoking on campus? I don't plan on smoking or doing any drugs because I've honestly had my fair share of it down in LA. How prevalent is it? 

4. How's the overall QOL? I've read that prices are through the roof for food and other everyday things compared to OC/LA and I don't really know what to expect. Apparently I'm gonna be eating clam chowder everyday and drinking trash boba but I don't really know because I've never been up there. 

5. How's the weather? SoCal is too sunny for me. 

Thanks for helping! 
I'm having a hard time choosing between ucsd and Berkeley. I got into ucsd for math cs (transfer) and I got into Berkeley with an l and s department with intents on doing data science. I also would have to do the prereqs for it before I get into the major. (Data 8 and Cs 61a, etc.) I know ucsd will be quicker and less expensive since I live in San Diego. I'm just having a hard time making a decision. What would you guys do in this decision?
I'm an incoming transfer student considering off-campus housing. I've been looking on Craigslist and a few of the Berkeley FB groups. A lot of what I'm seeing right now is summer sublets. Should I be aggressive about finding a place right now, or is there some time in July or something when lots of year-long leases become available?
Is it possible to change room assignments? I just got assigned to a stern triple, which is exactly opposite of what I wanted...
How does this look as a freshman schedule?

* Chem 4A
* Math 53
* CBE 40
* CS 61A

I think it might be hard to get the CS class because I'm not a CS major, but I want to take it to really see if I want to double major or minor in it. Will it be too much work?

How many units are normal to take during one semester?
Do you have to pay if you want to go to the RSF? [https://recsports.berkeley.edu/membership\-types/](https://recsports.berkeley.edu/membership-types/)

On the link above it says that students don't have to pay, but other threads have said that there is a $10 monthly fee. Can someone please clarify this for me? Also, would I be better off going to this one or the Stadium Fitness Center if I'll be living in the units?

Also, how crowded are they? I don't want to be *that* guy....you know, the overweight one benching the empty bar while a bunch of buff guys are waiting for him to finish
is cal as competitive/cut throat as i hear it is? i'm really not into that kind of environment. im deciding between cal and ucla for english. thanks!
Does everyone get a locker in the bathrooms in the Units? I've watched some video tours and there were some there.
Has anyone been able to find an internship in tech companies after having completed only CS61A & 61B?
How useful are Reading and Composition classes? I can skip them with my credits but am worried that my writing skills might not be up to par.

What would people say are the main differences between IB and MCB?
Best Math 53 professor?

I’m an incoming freshman civil engineering major planning to take Math 53 this fall. There are only two professors teaching it this fall, Tataru and Sethian. Sethian has a very low grade average on berkeleytime compared to other professors and I can’t find Tataru on there. On rate my professors Tataru has a lower overall rating. Have any of you had these professors and if so, have you had positive experiences with them? 

Someone else told me if I’m iffy about the professors I can take a different prerequisite class and take 53 in the spring. I’m just not sure what I would take instead and I’m worried about forgetting calc skills. I’m also planning to take Chem 1A, Compsci C8, Civ Eng 92, and South Asian R5A. 

If I could get any input I’d greatly appreciate it! Thank you :)
(incoming intended CS freshman) I've inadvertently created a schedule that starts at 1 PM everyday. I've realized that all of my mornings are basically empty, and I thought I'd be able to do hw and other stuff during that time. But is there any consequences of this kind of schedule that I don't know about? I guess this is different by people but I'd still appreciate some thoughts/insights.

Does rejecting a work-study award for one semester exclude you from the award for all semesters? Or is it offered every semester?
Hey! I am an incoming freshman and I wanted to know how work studies worked at Berkeley. Do I have to go somewhere specifically during move in day, and do I get a preference of where I work?
How do you guys get mail and packages from your family? Do they get stolen often, or does the staff hold it for you until you come pick it up? I'm in unit 3, if that helps.
Can you P/NP an upper division major course (Econ)?
What is the social life like at Berkeley?
How long in general are classes and how are they spaced out. Its not like high school where you have 7:35 to 3:00 with 50 minutes periods for example right? And do you have a class every day of the week or only 1 or what ETC...?

Not sure if this is a simple question but I got in for ChemE and didn’t really know what I was getting myself into i just thought oh chemistry and math and engineering so job opportunities okay. I’ve read stuff that it’s not really a lot of chemistry. Now i’m rethinking in and i’m wondering what major would suit me more and have good job opportunities. 
Will tanking AP tests in my senior year get me rescinded? All those tasks in the portal are lowkey freaking me out lol

What is the general schedule for a freshman in L&S cs? 
Visiting on Monday and have a couple of hours between tours.  What's a good place to have lunch that's walking distance from campus or even on site?
Another question, for l&s cs, as long as you have a 3.3 for the pre req classes you can declare your major? Or is it like u of Washington where even if you have the pre reqs you might not be able to declare?
Hi there. I wasn't exactly accepted to Berkeley, but I was waitlisted, and it seemed like a good idea to ask here for any tips, advice, facts, etc. about being on the waitlist. Thank you!

Short amendment: I also want to ask if the Fall Program for Freshman and Global Edge London things are worth checking off the box for or not.

Hi everyone--I apologize if restrictions on this sub have been placed with the flood of new students from this year's admissions, but I didn't see any.

Nonetheless, I was recently accepted to Cal for my undergraduate, and I am interested in pursuing a double major in environmental engineering major and political science. I come from Arizona and have grown up in a politically moderate household. I'm not too liberal, not too conservative, but love my christian church (not judgmental towards others though:)).

Being admitted, I am incredibly interested in Berkeley and will most likely be attending--even with the pricey 60k OOS tuition. I desire to ask this subreddit for some help for making my decision easier: could those currently attending Berkeley please write me their pros and cons of this college?

Furthermore, I was wondering if you could please describe the political environment on campus. I know it is known as the liberal protest school, but as someone who loves Christianity, not judgmental, and is still a moderate, will I be accepted/fit in?

Thank you for your time r/Berkeley.:)

How is Berkeley first-year math? I'm not that good at math and only took calc ab senior year, and I heard that first-year math at Berkeley is pretty hard (without calc BC credit). I don't want my gpa to be bad starting frosh year lmao...
As a CS and Stats double, which class makes the most sense to phase 2?

Hi! I am a intended CS major through L&S and I am trying to compose a schedule. I found an example course guidelines for Freshman on the L&S website, but at the bottom it says that it assumes the Foreign Language requirement is met. I took Spanish I and II during highschool, and then a Spanish course at a local CC over the summer. Does this fulfill the requirement? Or will I have to take a foreign language again. Thanks!
should I phase 2 cs70 or ee16b? (aka which one doesn't expand for enrollment)
Hi, I read that to declare CS you need a 3.3 among the 3 cs classes and that its not easy to get it. I've taken a lot of AP tests including calc BC and I'll be taking the Physics C ones thie year. I was wondering whether it might be a smart idea to not test out of any classes so that I can take the easiest level and just focus on getting a 3.3 in the cs classes.
Got into L&S, intended CS major. I think EECS is a better fit for me, is there any way I can appeal my major right now, or will I have to risk my current acceptance?
Sorry if this is kind of stupid, but when do recently admitted freshman register for classes? Also, I heard that for recently admitted freshman have to do something related to housing soon, what is that?
I'm super conflicted about choosing my college. I was accepted to Berkeley for CS under L&S, and I was also accepted to UCI for CS. I have friends at UCI that recommend attending there, and frankly, I am intimidated by both the 3.3 GPA requirement to declare as computer science as well as the school's reputation itself. My computer science skills are mostly in Java, and I would consider myself just average. Any advice or personal stories about other L&S computer science students would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
Hey all, so I've been admitted to both Berkeley and UCLA for physics and have been reading up on the pros and cons of both schools. I have two questions that I haven't really seen answered elsewhere. 1. In my Berkeley admission conditions, it doesn't say anything about a minimum grade I have to get on my IB exams (which are coming up this may), I applied with my predicted grades and the grades I received before that (I'm going to a German school that offers the IB diploma program) as well as SAT/ACT and subject tests. All it says is that I must send them my final grades. On my UCLA conditions it says something along the lines of ""typical offers require 38+ points and nothing less than a 5 in any subject"" as well as ""we expect candidates to score similarly to their predicted grades"", the latter of which is quite vague. I do think that 38 points is very doable, but I'm wondering if there is a similar cut-off at Berkeley or if they admitted me based solely on the aforementioned credentials and predicted grades? 2. Around what time to classes start if I'm planning to major in physics? I read that lots of classes for CS majors start in the afternoon. I'm an afternoon person myself and would very much prefer not to have to take 8AM classes. Also, if anyone knows, what are the class times like at UCLA?
Thanks in advance!
Glad I am given the opportunity to ask a question here!
I got into EECS, does anyone have information on the gpa requirements? Are you kicked out if you don't get a 3.3 or is this just for CS in L&S? 
Also-- I have basic coding experience but nothing really strong and I don't have a lot of knowledge on the subject, will this be a problem or should I really focus on doing some self-studying during these next few months?

Thanks for all the help!
Help! My school’s official graduation ceremony takes place on the 17th of August this year. However, according to the Berkeley Academic Calender, the Fall Semester begins on 15th of August. As an international student, the earliest I’ll be able to arrive in the US is 18th August. I am the valedictorian so I really need to attend the official graduation ceremony. Will Berkeley understand and exempt me from the mandatory attendance at Goldien Bear Orientation?

I got into UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD for biology (molecular biology for the first and last, human and health for UCLA I believe). I want to go into premed, so which school would be best? I really want Berkeley because it’s close to home, but I have some qualms due to UCSD’s amazing STEM reputation.

neuroscience at UCLA vs neuro (whatever bc there are so many different options for concentrations) at berkeley? how hard is it to declare a neuro major in L&S? i thought i would be getting my major when i was accepted, but my accepted letter only mentions the general L&S college.

i am also oos from TX. are there any tips for oos in regards for tuition costs and COA? (basically, how can i cut down on COA?)
Any suggestions or recommendations for classes next semester? I'm looking for something that's not time consuming and at least 2 units so I can hit the unit minimum. 

In the same vein, can anyone comment on the workload and exam difficulty of Data 8 and Astro C10? Currently considering taking those.
Can anyone recommend some classes to take first semester as a prospective econ/pre-haas major? I'm pretty set on an English class and math 16A. I also want to do Econ 1, but I've heard that it is really not recommended for my first semester at Cal. Will I be overwhelmed taking econ, English, math and a breadth class? Also some recommendations on easy breadth classes would be appreciated. 
Is it difficult to get research and get to know professors as a math/EECS major? How difficult is it and should I be concerned about getting into grad school based on lack of research?

* Which dining hall has the best food? (Also where is the dining hall for Unit 1/2?)

* Some of my APs count for units but don't count for a class... what does that mean? Are the units just useless then?

Hi Golden Bears,
  I've recently been admitted to Cal as an Environmental Engineering. I have other, less expensive choices, i.e: Cal Poly, for I am an out-of-state student. Cal has always been my dream school, and I was blown away at the fact I was admitted-thankful, eager, relieved...and then financial aid came. I currently am receiving $0 of financial aid, making my total cost with a 10 year 7% loan ~250k. At Cal Poly the same 10 year 7% loan would bring it to 115k. I currently have 70k in my college fund, so I can afford one year of Berkeley or two years of Cal Poly. Berkeley is my dream school. Beyond statistics and class sizes and opportunities, Berkeley offers a culture and environment unlike any other. It is unique. It is opportunistic. It is diverse. It is socially aware. Honestly it breaks my heart looking at the crippling debt and realizing--I wont be able to go. I have applied to scholarships left and right but haven't received a single one. When I look at Cal's website and the average graduation debt rate and etc., I have no clue how that average 17k would ever be attainable. I'm desperate. I'm heartbroken. I have contacted the office of financial aid (Cal Central) and haven't received a single reply. I wanna go to my dream school, but I have to be able to afford it. I cant justify the extra ~130k for the reasons above--I need to find ways to bring the cost down. Please, the wonderful people of this subreddit, help me. How do you do it. How do you attain the stats on their website. How do you live without crippling debt.
Is there an orchestra for people that are not music majors-like the pop orchestras some schools have? 

Also, is it possible to loan/rent/borrow instruments and are there places to store them not in the dorms?

Hi, I got accepted into L&s and I just have a quick question about physics. I know its not required, but in the future if for some reason I wanted to take physics 7b, would I need to take physics 7A, or if I get a 5 on the AP Physics C mechanics test can I skip 7A. Do I even need to take the test to skip 7A? I'm asking because I'd rather not take the AP Physics tests since I already have a bunch other I'm taking but in case I want to take 7B later I don't want to have to be forced to take 7A before.

Tldr; If I'm L&s do I need a 5 on ap physics c to skip physics 7A?

Hi all!!

I'm a regents Scholar Admit to Berkeley and UCLA. I also got into USC. 

My preferred major is business admin, and I got into USC's Marshall school. I'd like to gun for Haas if I go to Berkeley, with econ being my backup. At UCLA, I'd do business econ.

The only reason I'm hesitating to commit to Cal is that I don't want to work or live in the Bay Area upon graduation. I live in Los Angeles, and UC Berkeley is my favorite school out of the the three -- when I visited, I thought it was a perfect fit. It's also ""ranked"" higher than UCLA and USC on both business and econ. 

However, I have absolutely no intention or desire to stay in the SF Bay Area post-graduation, and would like to pursue a business-career in the Greater Los Angeles area or San Diego. I lived in the Bay during my childhood, and absolutely hate the broader bay area completely, and love SoCal. However, within the Bay, I just love the city of Berkeley and the school (UC Berkeley), so I'd be happy attending college there. 

If my explicit desire is to come back to LA or go to SD after college, would going to UCLA or USC be distinctly better for my career prospects? Or would going to Berkeley not hinder me in my search for an LA/SoCal-based job? 

While Cal is his ""best fit"" for me on an emotional level, I'd be willing to attend either UCLA or USC if those would be best for SoCal jobs -- I've heard USC's alumni network is incredible down south, although Cal's LA alumni network I'm sure is nothing to sneeze at.

Thanks a lot! :)
Hello, I am an admitted transfer student coming from another UC. I was forced to cancel the last spring quarter of 2018 due to a medical emergency. I already had all of the transfer requirements done before the spring quarter began(including the number of units), and I was wondering if there's any chance of my acceptance being rescinded. I will not be receiving any grades for the quarter. I am also using a UC letter of reciprocity to transfer. Thanks for your help.
I'm posting this here because I just made this account and I don't have enough Karma to start my own post:

Hi, I'm a second semester freshman at Cal and I'm seeking some advice on what classes to take (my enrollment is tomorrow rip).
I'm pre-haas and Econ (trying to double) and so far I've done UGBA10, Math 16B and R1B. I have Econ 1, Stat 20 and Econ 100B left if I'm trying to declare both majors.

I cant decide if I should take stat 20 this upcoming semester (concurrently w/ econ 1) or the semester after act (w/ econ 100b). The two options for professors for Stat 20 are Ibser and Stoyanov and they both have HORRIBLE distributions and horrible reviews. I've never taken a stats class before and I'm not sure what to do. Also considering Data 8 but I got a B+ in CS10 so I feel like coding isn't my thing. Any suggestions? Take it now? Take it later and hope for better professors?

Hi everyone! Newly admitted transfer student here.

What are your thoughts on double majoring in Economics and Computer Science? 

For someone who has little to no experience in CS, but has an interest, would it be unwise to either completely switch my major to CS or double major in CS and Econ?

Thank you for your time!

Top 5 things I need to bring to college? (Im going to be a freshman)
Hello. I am a current EECS major in need of some upper division humanities classes. I was wondering whether ECON 100 or ECON 101 series would be better for me in terms of learning a bit of economics. I have taken MATH 53 with an A grade, so I can handle the math, but I was wondering which series is more manageable and more worthwhile for someone not planning to major in econ but just wants knowledge.

I am turning 21 soon but won't be able to renew my ID (aka get a horizontal license) until several months later. I have heard that mostly it doesn't cause problems to have a vertical as long as your DOB shows you are 21+, but I have also heard of people getting turned away from certain places that just won't accept vertical IDs regardless of the DOB. For those of you who have been in a similar situation, what is your experience here at Berkeley? Any places in the Bay Area ever given you trouble for a vertical?
Is it true you have to interview to get into clubs? If so, are interviews generally really hard to pass?

I know waitlist admit students still get housing priority, but do we have the same chances as traditional admit students? The only things I can afford are Units 1,2, 3, and Kerr triples, since my finances are stretched extremely thin and I'm paying for FPF. What are my chances for getting these?

I got off the waitlist for Civil Engineering recently and I really do want to attend Berkeley as it has been my dream school. However, I'm now completely terrified that it's going to be too difficult and that I may not have the college experience I want to have. I've heard about major grade deflation and I'm now wondering if I should just stick with UCSD. Is it really difficult to maintain at least a 3.0 without killing yourself? 
I am an incoming intended Legal Studies major at UC Berkeley and I am thinking of going to law school after I get my Bachelor's. However, after talking to multiple retired lawyers, many suggest that I get an undergraduate degree in some other field. They argue that I would be learning the exact same material during my undergraduate studies as I would in law school, and by majoring in some other field, I would make myself more marketable for future employment. Is this true? I was thinking of taking certain G.E./elective classes to make me stand out within the Legal Studies department (i.e. maybe a business class and a psychology class), but I'm wondering if this will be enough. Also, are there any clubs, honor societies, or Greek life that I should look into for more exposure to the legal field? Any advice would be much appreciated!

How hard is it to transfer into EECS from ME? I was recently admitted off the waitlist but I honk my interests might lie in EE more than ME? Is there anyway I can take more EE classes or change majors?
So I said I’d take 5 AP tests, but I totally forgot to register for one of them and I just realized. Will i get rescinded? I’m still taking all the courses though. And do i need to submit the undergrad update form? 
Ok I’m pretty much committed to Cal, so thank you to everyone who replied to my previous questions on this thread! 

My last questions are just 1)is it hard to get a spot as a volunteer at KALX? I want to do more behind the scenes stuff. And 2) is it hard to get a volunteer spot at the Daily Cal?

I know you have to apply and interview for the Daily Cal, but what about KALX? I can only find a link online to a 2015 recruitment.
Does CalCentral only update MyAcademics once a day?
Anyone actually know the difference between a Berkeley University Grant and the Berkeley Undergraduate Scholarship? On the financial aid page, it says that if you don't maintain the GPA requirement you get a university grant instead of the undergraduate scholarship, but there's no information on the difference. Is it just less money? If so, does anyone know a way to calculate it?
I'm an incoming transfer student, and I was accepted to Berkeley for EECS and UCSD for electrical engineering.  Currently leaning pretty heavily towards Berkeley but I was hoping for some input before I make my final decision.  Mainly looking for which is more advantageous in terms of future career prospects. 
When do incoming freshman get to sign up for classes?
Hello, I am a transfer student who got accepted into Cal’s film and media studies program. Anyone personally have any experience with the program? I was not expecting to get into Cal and applied on a whim so I don’t know much about the program or the facilities there. I also got accepted into UCSB and UCSC for similar programs if that helps. 
As an incoming physics student (+ math minor), is this courseload somewhat doable?

why is it tough taking 3 or 4 technicals a semester? Is it because there is just so much work or the content is just so dense or is it something else?
Can someone link me to that post which was a google doc with a bunch of different places and things to do in Berkeley? Saw it pretty recently and have been looking for it now but I totally forgot what it was titled and what key words might find it.

Saw someone say that if you’re commuting you could take Bus 51b from Rockridge. Does it drop you off right in front of campus? Think that might be a better option than taking Bart straight to downtown Berkeley. 
What are some good R&C courses to take as a freshman? Easy classes are preferred.

Incoming fall transfer here. My class enrollment date is until July 15 but the two Physics 111A classes are already full and closed. Is there seriously no way for a transfer student to take it? 

What classes do you guys recommend as a Junior Physics transfer?
Do I have to actually do any of the Math 16A prepreqs, or can I just sign up? They ask for some particular tests that I did not take. I really don't want to do Math 32 because I already covered all this stuff in Math SL in the IB; it just feels like a big waste of time, especially since I already know the 16A content and only need to take it due to major needs. Also, we covered up to 1A in the IB Math SL course anyway. If it helps, I got 700 on the Math section of the SAT.
I took stats in high school and elementary statistics at community college, but obviously Berkeley still wants me to take Stat 20 as an Econ transfer. How hard is it exactly? Or for people that took one of the classes I did is it going to be a lot of overlap still? I’ve always done well in the stat classes I have taken so not too worried but definitely curious.
I am a junior at Cal and will be taking the Berkeley Method for Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, IEOR 192, the week before instruction begins in the Fall. I was wondering if anyone else has taken the Bootcamp and if so, what did they do for housing the week of the Bootcamp. I am living in an On-Campus apartment so I am unable to move in early. The Bootcamp begins August 13th and my move-in date is not till August 19th. Any advice or help would be much appreciated. Thank you. 
How bad of an idea is it to take an upper division political science course as a freshman? Specifically Polsci 222. I've taken an introductory polisci class at a community college before though not in that subfield of political science
Teleman or Srivastava for Math 54? (Berkeleytime has no info for Srivastava). Also, Teleman is at 8am and Srivastava is at 5pm (if that makes any difference). 
Has anyone taken the On the Same Page course? Is it worth the one unit?
[deleted]
what are some cool classes to take that arent that hard to get? Im going to study for a semester as an international student so I pretty much have no requirements. I study industrial Engineering if that helps, but Im looking into any area

EDIT: Also just to add, since I'm studying as an international student Im also going to spend time getting to know California so hopefully the classes aren't as demanding
Hello everyone, just had a question about my schedule.

I want to take a freshman seminar, but I believe that it's final time conflicts with my Chem 1AL final? I'm not quite sure because I don't know  if freshman seminars have a final since the class I want to take starts at 4:15 but on the website to check final schedules, it only has options for 4 and 4:30. Could someone clarify this for me please?
I don't want to start an outright war here, but I'm struggling to decide whether if I should stay Windows or switch to macOS as a CS Major. Can some CS people shed some light?

Hi, I'm an incoming freshman and I had already sent in my final transcript to the school before the deadline. During high school, I went to a school in 9th grade and then moved to a new city and continued 10th-12th there. All the previous transcripts I had ordered from my 10th-12th high school included my 9th grade year, so I assumed requesting the final from this school would suffice (as it would include all my 4 years.) But I checked with my advisor recently, and they told me I actually need to have both schools send me final transcripts. 

If I'm not a registered student at my 9th grade school anymore (the school removed me from their system) and summer is already in full swing (don't know how to contact them), how can I get this final transcript sent to Berkeley? If I have a transcript sent in past the deadline, will this affect class registration or anything? 
Hi, my question is what's so bad about Unit 3 dorms? In some of the facebook groups, people were saying it's the worst, it sucks, it was their last choice, etc. I'm a transfer and I don't know if I should take it, I was offered a Unit 3 triple. I'm fine with the price and living with other people, but apparently there are reasons it is very undesirable, can anyone enlighten me??
Is it necessary or worth it to take any of the freshman seminar classes?
Should I try to take classes where the discussion takes places directly after the lecture or have an hour break in between? A pro-con analysis would be greatly appreciated :)
Hi, 
I’m an incoming freshman and I already know I’m going to need work study. Its been making me a bit nervous because we’re just over a month out before arrival day but nothing has been said about the specifics about getting a job. I know from my own research that I have to apply myself though cal central but I’m not allowed to access the job listings until my dependency verification has been completed. What should I be doing and what is the work study process like? 
Thank-you.

I'll be transferring into Berkeley this fall and I was just wondering how intensive the first weeks were. Someone close to me wanted to know if they'd be able to visit me in the first 2 weeks, but they live a 6 hours drive away, so I want to make sure I'd be able to set aside a day to just hang out with them and not worry about work. My classes would be

Computer Science 61A with John DeNero

Physics 110A with Kam-Biu Luk

Physics 137A with Irfan Siddiqi

Physics 89 with James Analitis

Any other advice for these classes would be appreciated too, thanks!

Guys, I’m an international Asian student who was forced to study pre med by parents. When I came here, I got mediocre grades till last year. ( My GPA was 3.4 by 2017 fall) However, on my third semester, I found out that I excelled and stood out among my colleagues in my chemistry classes. I continued to excel in higher level chemistry and physics classes and decided this is what I really want to do the rest of my life. So, this year, I started joining Honors Program, taking honors classes and took 18 units in spring and 11 units in summer. I got all As and my GPA is 3.65 now. I will finish all the pre requisites( All Math and Science series)  for transfer by fall and expecting a transfer GPA of 3.73 I would like to know if I still have a shot at Cal because only Cal has a separate College of Chemistry and faculty members I really want to work with. I’m planning to pursue Physical Chemistry for my PhD and current Cal professors are doing research on topics I seriously would like to volunteer as undergrad researcher

If I took intro financial and intro managerial at a community college, would I still not be allowed to take intermediate accounting 1 here? I don't know if they will enforce pre-reqs for 120AA. I just think it's sort of pointless for me to take intro again for upper div units other than being a GPA booster. I saw the syllabus for 102a, and it's probably going over the same stuff. I'm not Haas, so I don't think I'd be able to take 102a/b, since my advisor said not to risk it. I was willing to do 8 am for 102a/b, but the schedule is not out yet. I will be a senior next fall, so time is running out. 

I'm also a bit worried as I've said in the previous 'ask a question' thread that I messed up an exam but probably could pull a B/B+. I don't know whether to P/NP still, since I'm wishy-washy as hell. Like, the intro accounting would count as an elective, instead of the one that I'm contemplating P/NP.

How hard is it to get into Haas from CLS? About what percent of applicants or how many people total do they accept? Is it possible to still get good finance jobs if I don't get into Haas? Thanks in advance guys! 
How hard is it to get declare and get accepted for the Econs major? I’m kinda worried I won’t get it since it’s capped, and I’m on a scholarship which only lets me take Econ major and nothing else.

How many people is usually the cap and how hard is it to get the major? This aspect of UCB is throwing me off since I also got a place in Pre Econs at UCLA (which is much more promising in terms of me getting the major I want)

Hi! I'm a US citizen living in the Philippines, and all my education thus far has been under the Filipino system. Am I considered an out-of-state or international student?

is the overnight program worth the $175? and what’s the difference from cal days
is undergrad L&S Econ good for finance jobs (if I don't get into haas)
Hi, so I was just accepted to Cal and I'm really excited to go, but I'm also really worried I'm not gonna be able to go. I just have a couple questions about rescinsion.

They say that you need a 3.0 and nothing lower than a C. Does that mean if I get 2 C's but 2 A's and 2 B's I won't get rescinded?

Also does this 3.0 mean UC acreddited classes only? For example if I get a C in PE will it count against me or if I get an A in PE will it count for me?

I kinda slacked off this semester and had 2 B's but I wasn't really worried since I know thats fine. However I got into some good colleges and slacked off a bit extra for literally one week and now I have 3 B's and a C so I'm starting to really freak out. I can get a test dropped and get my C to a B and one B to an A so I'll 90% be fine but I figured it can't hurt making sure I know what exactly the policies are. 
Do Economics majors (from L&S, not Haas) at Berkeley end up mostly working in what type of jobs after graduation?
Hey guys, 

So how difficult is it to get a good finance internship as a freshman/sophomore. Is the Berkeley career center helpful? 
How do I get into the Haas school of business? What do I do if I don’t eat in after my sophomore year?
Hey, I just got admitted and I'm hella hyped. I have a few questions that I hope you can answer!

1. My admission contract says ""I understand that I must complete all senior-year courses listed on my application with a minimum unweighted 3.0 GPA for each term, and earn no grade lower than a C for any individual courses."" - However, I do the IB. What does this translate to for the IB program then?

2. Objectively, how hard is it to get into Haas business school? Will I be allowed to double major, e.g. Haas + CS?

3. Is the whole grade deflation thing true? Is it as big of a problem as people make it seem?

4. Do you know how the OCR for silicon Valley/Wall street is like?

Thanks! Appreciate any help!
If I want to drop a course should I just do it and then fill out the form or do I need to ""request permission"" kind of from Berkeley first?

I have recently been admitted to both Cal Poly SLO and UC Berkeley as an OOS student. Berkeley is around 20k a year more for the first two years that Cal Poly SLO.

A little bit of background: I am looking to study either a double major in environmental engineering and political science or just mechanical engineering. I'm not looking to live an ordinary life--Im interested in eventually entering the political field or working for a higher-up corporation (e.g: SpaceX, Disney, etc.). I ask for your brutal honesty:

Considering UC Berkeley has one of the best reputations in the world for my fields, and Cal Poly trails not too far behind, what would you guys believe to be the right choice for me? Currently, the most attractive parts of Berkeley are the connected nature to Silicon Valley, the name on a resume, and the unique culture of diverse individuals. Could you please discuss these 3 elements in the context of Cal Poly and give me your honest thoughts on which school I should go to? Your help is incredibly appreciated--thank you for your time.

My current financial situation:
Cal Poly's tuition is 40k a year with a 1k nonrenewable scholarship. Berkeley's tuition is 65k a year with a 4k work-study.
I currently have 70k in college-savings.
Just got accepted to Berkeley and LA ChemE and I am having trouble deciding. What do you guys think?
Berkeley Pros:
Cheaper (Financial Aid),
Engineering is top tier,
Silicon Valley,
Semester System (that's a plus right?)
Connections cause less people in College of Chem

LA Pros:
Socially more positive,
LA Area,
Less Stressful,
Closer to home,
Time commitment for band is half of Berkeley

Hi there. I recently got admitted to UCLA and UC Berkeley, but I'm having a bit of a dilemma. I want to decide between these two prestigious schools, but I hear horror stories from both sides like grade deflation and absurd amounts of stress. I would really like to hear how life as a pre med is, like how your first year went and what you majored in, what kind of ECs did you do, did you enjoy it overall, etc. (particularly from the freshman perspective). I'd really be appreciative for this advice, so thank you in advance!

is there a cap on how many ap credits can transfer?
Might be a stupid question, but how do back to back classes work? If there's a class from 9:30-10:59 and another from 11-12:30 that's a 4 minute walk away, is that feasible? Or would I always be late to the second class?

Is Stat C8 Foundations of Data Science offered in Fall 2018?

So I'm pretty confused if Stat C8 is offered next fall. It's showing up in the class schedule on the berkeley page and there's a valid code to sign up for the class, but it says that the enrollment limit is 0 and when I try to add it to my cart every lab section is closed?

Under New Student Tasks there is a task to create a Berkeley CalNet ID with a deadline of April 9 (tomorrow yikes) but clicking on the link brings me to a Forbidden You are not allowed to view this page thing. Anyone else have this problem?

For housing, I'd like an option similar to that of the residential colleges in Yale or Rice – like a really close-knit and social community throughout the dorms but not fratty. Which housing would be most similar to this residential college community feel?
I'm going to be a grad student at Cal and I wanted (might even need) a parking permit, but I may live very close but still within that [designated campus boundary](https://www.freemaptools.com/radius-around-point.htm?clat=37.869408&clng=-122.26786600000003&r=2.41&lc=FFFFFF&lw=1&fc=00FF00&fs=true&nomoreradius=true) (I.e. I would live around the border of that boundary). What do most people do when that's the case? Do they just use public transportation, or do they lie to get the parking permit?

Edit: I also want to add that I looked at the [night safety services](https://nightsafety.berkeley.edu), and all of them except for the one that runs 3AM-5AM (which is way too late for me to really use), don't go to the area I may live in.

I am an accepting but rather conservative person. Will this impair my social life at Berkeley, and is the liberal scene here so prominent that I will feel like an outcast or something of the sort? I just really want to have a good time in college, so if tolerant and accepting people are in limited supply I might not be happy here.
How much time do you have, after graduation, to find a job (before any working visa) as an international student? I keep finding conflicting info (it's always either 60 days or 3 months).

How likely is it for me to get a theme program housing assignment? 
Hi I got into Berkeley and UCLA for chemical engineering and I am well aware that Berkeley is #2 in the world and a lot of elements were founded here. However I'm STILL in between the two... My sister was between Berkeley and UCLA for CS engineering and EECS @ berk is very prestigious, but she chose UCLA because she knew that she could get the same outcome as if she went to Berkeley without all the competitiveness and stress. She is now working for facebook in silicon valley. I'm worried that I'm going to get so caught up in chem e @ berkeley that I will kinda end up depressed and lonely. I have very close friends going to UCLA so I know I will be happy there and I am 1.5 hours away from home if some of my medical issues were to happen. I know college of chem isn't as cut throat as a lot of other majors and the chem e kids say they know each other well and study together, but they are no doubt stressed out all the time. I like the campus, but idk about the area and the housing issue. I'm a tiny, fragile girl and getting an apartment in Berkeley doesn't sound too appealing to me given how sketchy the area is where apartments are. idk I think I'm just really scared of Berkeley and feeling like I'm stupid once I get there. I'm generally good in math and chemistry, but when I get pressured and feel like shit it's hard for me to actually work. I think I could excel @ UCLA, but not so sure @ Berkeley. I want to test my limits, but a lot of the times when I did that, I failed and had to recuperate for a while. Any advice as to how I should go about my decision?

I'm an incoming freshman and have heard that Unit 1 and Unit 2 are generally considered the more social dorms

I have 3 questions: 

1. Does Christian, Slottman, and Towle only contain mini-suite dorms, or are the mini-suites mixed in with regular doubles and triples? 

2. Is the social life in the mini-suite buildings any different to that of the other buildings around unit 1 and 2? 

3. Would blackwell be any different in social life to unit 1 and 2?
UC Berkeley vs. Boston College? 
Hello, I am a prospective student who is interested in being a Business major. Though I may get a bit of a biased response, I am all ears. I was wondering how difficult it is to get into the Haas undergraduate program. Berkeley will be significantly cheaper for me than Boston College, but the uncertainty surrounding my major is holding me back, as I am already in the Business school at BC. I was hoping to get some opinions on this matter. Thank you!
Can someone tell me about Spoon University at Berkeley. What kind of stuff they do and time commitment? Is it bigger here than other schools because of the large food scene? I really want to get involved!
Waitlisted for CS 70, probably because I'm already declared MCB. What's the chance I'll get into the class?
Any advice on a major in Applied Math: Focus in CS vs Data Science? Almost done with prereqs for both but can't decide between which to major.
On my application I indicated I was going to be living on campus, but my parents have plans to move to Berkeley in July, so I'll most likely be living at home now. Does anybody know how much changing your housing status alters your financial aid?? I got a scholarship that covers all of my tuition, so going to UCB would be pretty much free, which is highly ideal. I wouldn't want that to be taken away just because I'm living at home....

EDIT: I updated my housing status \(Living on campus \-\-\> Living with parents\), and my financial aid majorly dropped \($12k \-\-\> $2k per year\). I'll be sending an email to the financial aid department to see if they can give me any extra assistance.

Thank you all :\)
In the acceptance, it states that I must complete the classes I initially said I would take during winter and spring quarter. However, I am not taking two classes that I had initially listed. Would this get my admission rescinded?

If ^ wasn’t clear, the admission letter said that they expect me to take courses A B C D E F G (by winter and spring quarter) and maintain a 3.0. However, I would have only taken A B C D E and X Y (two different classes) by the end of spring quarter. Would I be ok?

Also, can I make a class P/NP? It’s a basic programming/data science class.

Hopefully past transfer admits can chime in!
Hi, I was recently given the option to opt in in the transfer waitlist for College of Chem. I am curious about the chances of getting in. I heard that waitlists have a high chance of getting in. I am transferring from a CCC, and my major is Joint Chemical Engineering Nuclear Engineering.

Hey everyone,

Is there any way for me to late drop a class after the late drop deadline? Someone told me that it was next Friday but I just found out it was yesterday.

I’m super scared and I honestly don’t think I can make it through the final of this class. Please let me know what I can do— I’ve already reached out to advisors and I really don’t know what else I can do.

It’s my first year here and this class really didn’t go so well so please let me know what I can do, if anything. 

Thanks in advance.

Is CalCentral down?

I keep getting timed out of the authorization service.
Hi, I was admitted as a transfer to L&S and plan to go into the PoliSci department, and I wanted to know if someone could explain what these junior seminar courses are? Some of them look very interesting, but are they recommend courses to take in a first transfer semester if I'm coming in as a junior?
rising sophomore needing 21 units next semester for various reasons, but conflicted because l&s has a cap of 20.5 units. can i enroll in 21 units without going to the advising office to petition for a higher unit cap? i guess my question is, is the 20.5 a soft cap or a hard cap?
On the housing offer, do we get to see who are roommate/s are?

""I would like a roommate who is around much of the time""

what does this mean? Around as in there for you, or around as in spending time in the room? Should I just play it safe and just do the middle between agree and disagree?
Recent admit into Letters & Science as a transfer and plan to declare Econ as my major. Do any current Econ majors or business students have recommendations for which class I should take for the stat requirement and intermediate theory I have to take my first semester? Want to have my best shot at making sure I have the best shot of meeting the requirements and any tips help!
I am planning to apply this fall to transfer and am on track to have 96 semester units. Is there a maximum number of transferable units? If so, what is it? And what happens if I am over?  
So I recently got admitted to UCB as a CC transfer which I wasn't expecting at all, so I'm a bit dazed still and I'm very intimidated by how difficult everyone says the classes are. Will it be difficult for me to go to grad school after Berkeley? My major is astrophysics.

Also, how friendly/helpful would you consider your UCB peers to be? I understand it's a competitive school but I only want to compete with myself and I thrive in more collaborative/supportive environments as opposed to an every-man-for-himself environment. I'm none too thrilled by the idea of every class being a Battle Royale-esque fight to the death as to who's the smartest in the room.
Is it possible to phase 2 data 8 for next fall, or will the class be full by then? Im currently a freshman
Does cal have a 0 tolerance policy and if so where can I find it?

Newly admitted eecs freshman with little programming experience with a few questions about class scheduling. I've taken through multi variable calculus and get out of the R1A requirement, so I'm wondering if I should pull in some harder courses that are generally taken later (like my 2nd physics course or something) to my freshman year since it is kinda light, or if I should take the fact that it's light as a blessing in order to help me get into the groove of studying for college and ""catch up"" with most people who have lots of programming experience.  Any thoughts are appreciated.
I applied and got wailisted as an English major in L&S. Granted I do get in, what are my chances of transferring into MCB/BioChem?
Is my housing application supposed to say ""Not Complete""? I did the application before the deadline, up to the point where I finished payment.
For IB students who got in, should I stress about exams? Do they care about what scores I get in each subject, cuz I'm pretty sure I got a 4 or 5 in math. Or do they not care as long as I get the diploma?
I've fallen a bit behind this semester, and I was wondering how late is too late to email professors about possible research opportunities for the fall semester. Would this coming week be okay? Thanks.

I'm an incoming transfer student and just enrolled in 61A for the summer. I was put on the waitlist in the 40th spot. Is it likely that I will get into the class? 
Is there a reason I don't have access to the My Academics page on calcentral?  Most advice regarding class registration here says to go to that page for information, but the tab doesn't exist where it should for me.  There is a link to the page at the bottom but that dead ends to ""cannot find that page"".  Do I need to do something before I can access the My Academics page or what?
Is Brown's serving their regular menu during the strike?
Btw for those people who are in the data science major rn. How is it? Is it extremely difficult or is it douable.
I got in yesterday from the waitlist, but my financial aid package has fall tuition at $805 instead of $20k plus. 

Anyone know what's going on with that? 

Is it that I have to pay the deposit and pick a pathway before I see the whole financial picture? Thanks
I might be renting a room in a house. Thing is, while i trust the people wholl be my roommates (i know them all through mutual friends) they said i cant see inside the place until the lease starts in a few weeks. I dont think theyve seen it either. Theyve also given me inaccurate information in terms of how many rooms the place has, like they’re saying it only has 3 bedrooms but on real estate sites it says the house has 8?

I’m so nervous I feel like I’m already in too deep. Rents like $1300 so I feel like I should be getting more info for that cost??
because l&s cs and haas have the same breadth requirements, any course in a breadth category can satisfy the requirements for both colleges right ? 
[deleted]
[deleted]
I also screwed up my AP physics exam yesterday. Will my admissions be impacted by this? I just got off the waitlisted too. Please help
I got accepted into the college of chem and I need help deciding which housing to choose from. my friend has recommended Unit 3 and she is moving into an apartment after being in beverly clearly.
* How difficult will it be to double major in CS (I'm enrolled as a ChemE major right now)? Is there a lot more units that I will need to fulfill?

* How different is EECS from L&S CS  (because I can't double major in EECS)?

Where's a good spot by Central Berkeley to get a quick bite?
 Hi all! So I just arrived in Berkeley for my internship in LBNL. I am staying till the end of December. I am a sporty person so I would love to do some sports together with some students, however I am not officially part of UCB and am not here during the regular semesters \(here from now till the end of December\). Does any know some sports with students I can join? I am open for all sports. Thanks 
Does bear transit run during the summer?
When do transfers get to choose their courses? Is there a councilor or someone I can meet with to help me out.
Is Math 54 required for the CS major? And is Calc 3 a prerequisite for the class? \(I'm a transfer, by the way!\) Oh, and thoughts on taking Math 54 and CS61A at the same time? \(Not that I would have much choice smh\) 

And what the heck is a normal course load? I've seen people say anywhere from 3 to 5 classes??
Hey Y'all,

I'm a transfer student that was recently admitted to Pure Math in L&S, however, I'm finding myself in a little bit of a predicament. Over the last semester or so I've found that my passion for Physics has eclipsed that of Math; I want to minor in math but not major in it. As of rn to declare Math I have to take Math 55 which doesn't correspond to the minor, and the only course I have to take in order to declare Physics is Physics 7C. I'm curious if it is possible to declare Physics at Cal during my first semester given I am taking Physics 7C. I was told that my first semester at Cal I would have to declare Math otherwise my registration would get blocked during Spring semester. I just don't want to take Math 55 if I don't actually have to. Thanks for any help offered.
How/when do grad students get their ID's? My program starts in the summer and I wanted to use the public transit to get to class, but I don't think I can do that for free without my ID...? 
Hey all, I'm a transfer student entering in the fall under Political Economy, and after constantly looking over career insights from berkely poliecon majors, I'm becoming very anxious about my future prospects :(

There's no way I can declare econ as my major as I have absolutely no calc background; only stats. Berkeley restricts transfers to declaring econ the first month they arrive, and I can't fulfill it in time.

Are there any poliecon majors here that can help me navigate the stress that is college/life/everything.

Got Unit 3 triple, how are the buildings, rooms and are they that shitty as people say?

Hi, can you guys transfer credit from an international curriculum?

Could you guys share the typical schedule of an orms student?

Which is better, Bowles Hall Double or a Unit 2 double for a freshman interested in pre-Haas? Bowles seems to have better accommodations, yet I feel that its social scene is severely worse than the units. I would like to rush a fraternity if this is of any use. 
Does this sound like a good course load for Computer Science through the College of Letters and Science:

Freshman Fall:

CS 61A

Math 1B

Physics 7A

Rhetor R1B

Freshman Spring:

CS 61B

Math 53

EE16A \(Am I allowed to take this even?\)

Humanities/SS class \(any recommendations?\)

\(Note: I've taken AP Calc BC, AP Physics C Mech., AP Comp Sci, AP Lit. and Comp.\)

Don't think I'll get a 5 on AP Lit and probably not on Calc BC either therefore I'll have to take 1B \+ R1B

Still a little nervous because, it's a bit of a big step since I've never really established a work ethic:\).

Also when do we sign up for the courses?

Thank you!
Looking into the environmental science major since I love the environment, conservation, and all that junk. I'm horrendous at chem and physics though, and they're requirements. Got a 1 on AP Physics 1 and barely made it by with a B in the class because the tests were exactly like the study guide. Currently have a C\- in non\-honors non\-AP chemistry. You get the idea \(I love bio though\)

How chem and physics heavy would the major be? Anything else similar I should look into? Also, I was admitted under L&S so I'd have to transfer over to CNR, is that difficult? 
Hi, I’m currently waitlisted, i’m in the college of chemistry as chem and nuclear engineering major. I am struggling with a few of my classes right now (although i’ll definitely pass them).
I was wondering, if i got off the waitlist and was admitted, can i get rescinded for having a lower than required GPA. If so what would the GPA requirement be?
I'm an incoming international grad student in Berkeley, and I wanted to adopt a dog when I get there. How much does keeping a dog cost ok average, for food and vaccinations and vet visits? Are there any cheap daycares where I can leave my dog for a couple of weeks when I go back home?
Any general advice on having a pet is appreciated! :)
 I signed up for a 4 unit session C class after a summer plan fell through and forgot about it until just now. The drop deadline is in 24 hours \(with no refund\), however, I still haven't paid for the class yet. If I end up not paying for the class do I automatically get kicked out? Also if I end dropping the class within the deadline do I get any consequence? Thanks 
Incoming Freshman here, I am an applied Math major and I am working on my fall schedule. I already completed some classes at my local CCC, so I am starting with Math 54. I also am taking COLWRIT R4B To satisfy the rest of my english/comp and Intro to Biomedicine. What other class should I take it. I am thinking of doing Math 55, but not sure if I should just do a breadth requirement instead.
How structured are the discussion sessions for a math course? If I have a different class that starts at the time that the discussion class ends, would it be easy to slip out early to get to my class on time. Are the discussion classes basically scheduled study time, or would I miss anything if I had to get to another class?
Currently planning out my schedule but have a conflict with E25 and Math 53: E25 goes from 4\-5pm and Math 53 starts right at 5pm. In reality, am I able to make this work \(I've heard about ""Berkeley time"" and classes starting 10 min later than scheduled\), and is it safe to go with this schedule?
Trying to plan my first semester schedule. I'm 99% sure im going to be a physics major. I did calc BC and got a 5, so I think I'll skip 1B and go to math 53. Would this be a reasonable schedule?:

* Physics 5A (3 units)
* Math 53 (4 units)
* Anthro 2AC (or other breadth) (4 units)
* French 13 (2 units)
* Freshman Seminar (1 unit)

wondering if I should take another physics prereq instead of the seminar and the french class (like physics 77).
Can you get work study if you live off-campus?
Hi, I started the Golden Bear Advising thing and for Module 4 \(for Letters & Science\), there is a section where I am supposed to write the name of my adviser. How do we know who our adviser is? For my friend, under ""My Groups"" on CalCentral, it said ""L&S Advising"" with the name of her adviser, but for me it just says ""L&S Advising \- A"". Thank you
 Hey guys, I got accepted into UC Berkeley but I currently have a C in Judo \(pe class\). I'm taking 7 classes in total, 4 in which are AP. At best, I'll probably have 4 A's, 2 B's, and 1 C in Judo and at worst, I'll probably have 3 A's, 3 B's and 1 C. Will I get rescinded?

I got accepted as a transfer student and congrats to everyone.

I got my grade today, and I did not do as well as expected in one of my required course (a C). In my admission condition, I am expected to get at least a B\- , so because of that, will my admission be revoked?   
Moving into an apartment next semester and I know a bunch of people love Brita filters. I used to drink the water from the refillable bottle stations (in the dorms) all the time because it tasted good and was nice and cold. Is the rest of the city's tap good when chilled too or should I invest in a filter?
Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I’m a transfer readmit starting this fall. I left berkeley a few years ago, and I’m feeling kind of overwhelmed about coming back. I’m not getting into some of the courses I need. Searching for housing is a mess. A lot of my friends have moved away, and the ones still here I haven’t spoken to in ages and don’t know that I withdrew. And I’m just generally scared to start again. Please tell me I’m not the only transfer readmit feeling like this.
for any chem bio premeds, does Bio 1A and MCB 110 count for the 2 semesters of biology most med schools require? if not, do I have to take bio 1b, or can i take some upper div biology course instead?
[deleted]
Don't know if this counts as a simple question, but alas, here I go:

I'm a transfer student who was accepted off the waitlist. However, I totally did not expect one of the conditions for acceptance was completing a class that I had said I would take over the summer, so before then I had dropped it in favor of taking some summer courses at either UCLA or UCI (the two other schools I had been considering) to get an edge. I guess this could be attributed to bad planning on my part. Now that I had been admitted to Cal, now that I am required to take the summer class that I had dropped, and since the class that had been dropped is now closed to enrollment, what should I do to minimize my chances of losing admission and should I worry at all?

As a second quick question: is it easy to get into L&S CS as second major (having been accepted into L&S)?
Why does Housing and Food cost $13,888 for living off campus? I saw this in my financial aid section for calcentral and was wondering if I should call them about it. Thanks!

Is there any disadvantage to taking Math 1A/1B instead of 10A/10B if majoring in MCB?

Hey guys!

Did anyone here take CS10? I'm an incoming freshman, Pre-Haas, and considering taking it FIRST semester. Any advice or warnings? I have zero prior programming experience except for basic HTML a while back, as well as Scratch back in 5th grade or something. I heard Dan Garcia uses Scratch for CS10.

Basically, is the class easy enough to do first semester with bare programming experience?
[deleted]
I'm planning on majoring in either IB or a MCB track and was planning on doing Chem1A and AL as well as Math10A ( I'm comfortable with both subjects having done HL's in IBDP). However, both have MWF schedules and are literally one after the other, something like chem, then discussion for chem, then math on a Monday and the same but no discussion on the other two days. Is this manageable? And the schedule manager was pretty confusing, how are 100+ schedules being generated if most class times are fixed?
Thanks for any help

Edit - Some basic meddling with the schedule planner has made me realize how it works. Don't have any problem now.
Just got my housing offer as an incoming transfer: a triple dorm in Unit 3 ... I am seriously considering going off-campus because of the offer. Does anyone have any advice for apartment/room hunting? I have friends on board as well.  

Any opinions on Classics R44 for R&C? I heard it also fulfills a breadth req for L&S, but it's also 5 units. 

Would Math 1A + Chem 1A + Classics R44 + freshman seminar be a good course-load for a freshman considering either MCB or CS major?
[deleted]
Hey guys, I'm intended haas + data science, or worst case, econ + data science. 


I was wondering if I should take Math 1A + 1B my freshman year or go for Math 53 and 54. I got a 5 on ap calc bc, so I can skip the 1 series, I just dont want to mess up my gpa for haas. Which path would be easier to do well in? 
1. For pre-med students, will any of the R&C classes count (such as Classics R44 or Italian R5A) towards the 1 year requirement of english for med-schools? Or does it have to be a class offered through the English department like English R1A? 
2. If I test out of both the R&C requirements (with a 5 on AP Lit), what other classes besides R&C can I take to fulfill the 1 year requirement of english for medical schools? Or, If I want to be premed, should I choose not to test out of R&C and instead use the R&C classes to fulfill the 1 year requirement? 

tldr: In other words, if I pass out of R&C, would it be more beneficial to still take one year of R&C or instead take other english classes like English 45 (which would simultaneously satisfy the Arts and Literature Breadth). 
[deleted]
I can't seem to find Data 8 on the Cal Central course search page. Am I doing something wrong or are other people having the same problem?

Anyone can lend me some pointers on how to construct a schedule for freshman fall semester??? For an econ major intending Haas. Got a 5 on BC and Lang, not confident about Lit. The L&S Golden Bear Advising assignment thing is due soon and idk where to go from here lol T_ T
Hi everyone! I'm an incoming freshman intending to declare CS, and I was just wondering if my fall schedule seems okay:

CS 61A

EE 16A

ESPM 6

PHILOS R1B

Does the workload seem manageable for a freshman? Also, if anyone has any other Breadth or R&C B recommendations, that'd be great, since I'm not super sure about those two.

Thanks in advance!

Just finished GBA and submitted my classes to my advisor.

CS 61A
EE 16A
Math 53
Art 21

Is this a manageable course load? I️ decided to do Art 21 (Intro. To Photography) to fulfill part of the H/SS CoE breadth, but I’m not sure if the workload in that class is too much. The other three technical courses are relatively mandatory for EECS.
Hello, guys! I'm aiming for Haas and I have a few questions.

This is my schedule for Freshman Fall

\- German R5A

\- Math 16A

\- Astro C10

\- Advanced Korean 100A

So.. on the Haas Website, it says that in order to fulfill R&C requirement, I need to take classes comparable to ""English R1A and R1B"" and there is a link that shows all the courses that fulfill the requirement. However, some of the courses are R1A and some of them are different like R5A, R4A etc... Do I have to take one that has an R1A tag for Haas? since the prerequisite on their website says ""comparable to R1A and R1B""... a little bit confused.
Hey here’s the schedule I’m aiming for as of now:

-Math 16B
-Psychology of Human Happiness (L&S C160V)
-Muslims In America (ASAMST 128AC)
-War And Peace (History 162B)

I am hoping for Haas rn and I’ve completed every general requirement for L&S except American Cultures. Also tested out of R&C. I was told to save other Haas prereqs for when I’m better accustomed to life at Cal. 

So two things: thoughts on the schedule? Any general tips for freshman that I’m not following?

And two of my classes have final exams that fell on the same day half an hour apart. Should I find another class or is that manageable?
[deleted]
Does anyone know when Fall 2018 Decals will be posted on their website? Do we register during Phase 1/2 or later when classes start? Also, is it common for freshmen to take a Decal first semester?
Hey there everyone. Incoming freshman who just had a quick question that I was hoping someone could kindly answer for me. My tentative schedule is:

\- Comp Sci 61A

\- El Eng 16A

\- Astron C10 or C13 (Depends on availability)

\- A freshman seminar (1 unit)

The thing is, I've heard a lot of people say that I should take only 2 technical courses in my first semester. Now, CS 61A and EE 16A satisfy that. What I'm worried about is, if the Astronomy courses (either C10 or 13) are considered technicals as well? I'm taking them to satisfy the breadth requirement and because I'm interested in the topic, but would my schedule be considered as 3 technicals, and hence a heavy course load for freshmen? How time-consuming/challenging would the astronomy courses be? I'm prepared to study hard for them (not taking them for an easy A) but I don't want them causing my grade in 61A to drop.

I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me out. Thanks a lot, in advance.
How many (units or semester idk) of AC courses are required for like prerequisites and graduating? Also how many (units or semesters) of foreign language?
How do I know whether my submission for ID Photo have been accepted? Will the picture just show up for the Current ID Photo? 
How hard is it to enroll into CS C8 (Data 8) as a freshman?
I am applying for family housing with my partner and our move out date of our current home is August 7th. How long is the wait list to get into the smaller units of the apartment housing?

As a backup, I am considering getting a storage unit for our furniture and moving into a sublet for a while till we are able to find a place that really suits us.

Thanks!

(Moved from own post, sorry!)

Currently I have:

EL ENG 16a
Math 53
Philos r1b

I feel pretty confident with math and I've got a bit of prior coding experience and currently learning python in preparation. I've always been interested in philosophy and was in the philosophy club in HS, but is philos r1b much for my first semester?
When do we have to pay for tuition? I can't seem to find the payment schedule and I also need to know how much it's gonna be so that my parents can move money around and shit
Hello! Is this schedule alright for a first semester? all advice is much appreciated!

Multivar Calc - prof. Tataru,

Does anyone know what the Berkeley Freshman Scholarship is? Is there one for every ""grade""? I got it in my 1st semester (spring admit) but it did not show up on my financial aid page until mid-semester so I didn't expect it. I searched it up but could not find any answer regarding this.
I actually just finished my 1st year at Cal, but I have a question. How much is reasonable to spend on food per day as a student at Berkeley. I don't have a meal plan next year, and I estimate that I spend roughly $7-8 per day on food, on average. Is that high or low? 
Best English/rhetoric/comparative lit classes at cal for an incoming pre med student? I passed out of r&c 1+2

i have my 61a final in approximately a month(im taking it in the summer). I did really poorly on the midterm - like, really poorly - but that was mainly due to not practicing enough. Does anyone have any tips for getting close to a full score on the final? I really want to get a B+ and I need close to a full on the final (assuming I get full credit on hw/project/participation, which i think should be fine). What do i need to do in this month to become an absolute master of 61a material? Any suggestions - right from what kind of practice schedule to develop, which resources to study, other study habit, resources, etc. Basically Id like some tips on how to optimally use this month to be in a poisiton where I can realistically get close to a full on the final. Please, Im desperate.  Thanks:)
I am an incoming freshman (undecided major) and am thinking of taking Classics R44, Chem 1A and 1AL, and Intro to Cognitive Science. Does that sound like a good schedule? I'm scared that I'd destroy my GPA first semester (these classes all have a B+ average) or sign up for classes that are useless in the long run.
Transfer Film major here. Anybody know the workload of some of the film courses? 

I'm planning on taking FILM 25A, FILM 20, and FILM 129. If 129 fills up, I might switch it out for RHETORIC 130 (counts towards my degree). On top of the 12 units going towards my Film degree, I'm taking a 3 unit Costume Design course (Theater 174), as I'm planning on minoring in Theater with a costume design focus. 

I've heard from a lot of people not to take over 13 units your first semester. THEATER 174 shouldn't add too much to my workload, but I don't know how intense the film courses are. 

If it sounds like too much I'll scratch FILM 129/RHETORIC 130, and take a 2 unit DeCal or something. I would scrap the costume design course, but I really want to get my foot in the door at the theater. Thank you!
Anyone went to GBO for company visit/excursions? How was it? I can't decide between kayaking or a company visit to Visa.
Dumb question, is tuition calculated by units per semester or the same for everyone?

Also, when can we pay because I can't find it on CalCentral right now.
I'm flying up to Berkeley on Wednesday and my flight arrives around 1 AM. Are there any other alternatives than Lyft/Uber to travel from SFO to Berkeley?
What are the chances of getting out of a class wait list? I enrolled in 2 supposedly open classes (anthro 3ac (position 82) and japan 7a (position 10)) but I was waitlisted for both... 
ummmmmm I'm waitlisted 27 on the chem 4a lab how fucked am i

it says out of 230 but idk if that's for the lab or the lecture??

Edit: I've switched math 53 to math 54 so i could get an open lab spot :/

now theres no switching back math 53 if full...
I’m waitlisted at 252 for Compsci C8...should I just give up hope for getting in? It says there’s 1200 enrolled and a capacity of 1296. :(
What are my chances of getting into a Chem 1A lecture if I'm 55 on the waitlist? I remember being more than a hundred when I enrolled in it, so is it possible for me to actually get in or should I just switch now?
incoming freshman here, intended l&s cs. was hoping to get some feedback on my schedule;
•CS 61A
•EE 16A
•ANTHRO 3AC
•ASTRO C10 (will probably p/np)
how doable is this? might drop anthro for a decal or something if its too much.
So, has anyone had a chance to read the GBO waivers yet? I just read them and I don't like the wording. This is a mandatory orientation, right? Do I have any other options short of A) signing them and going to the orientation or B) not signing them and getting in trouble?

Now that this year's reunion events have been announced, I have some questions:

1. Has anyone here ever attended a Cal reunion, and if so, are they worth it?

2. Is it allowed to attend a reunion other than that of your graduating class? I was originally supposed to graduate in 2008 but ended up staying another year because I was considering a change in major and took some extra courses. However, I don't really know anyone in the class of 2009 and identify more closely with the class of 2008. I feel it would make more sense to attend a class of 2008 reunion.

Hi, I’m an incoming freshman who is planning to apply to Haas. I was wondering if taking Math 16a or 16b would be best for me. I am currently signed up for 16a. I took Calc BC and got a 5, but I took it my sophomore year so it’s all a bit fuzzy now. I opted for the 16 series because I heard the 1 series is very difficult, and I’m not a huge fan of math anyways. My advisor also warned us not to overestimate our math skills as Berkeley teaches calculus in their own way. I would like to preferably take the least amount of math courses possible, but I’m not really sure how it all works yet. So if anyone has any information on the rigor of both classes that would be very helpful. Thank you!

What kind of class is Engineering 7 like? I’ll be taking E7 along with Math 53, Chem 4A, and History 124A
[deleted]
Has anyone late dropped a summer course before? I talked to the summer sessions office and they said it'll leave no mark on my record nor will I get a refund (obviously). I'm going to retake the class I drop in the fall but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something before I officially do it..
[deleted]
Does Math 53 have a wait list? Because I chose 1B despite having the ap credit to skip it and I regret that decision
Would anyone recommend taking cs 61b, chem 12a, and chem 140 this fall?
I'm choosing between taking Nutri Sci 10 (with Napoli, whose ratings are trash) or Drugs and the Brain with Presti (whose ratings are really good). I want to take Nutri Sci. Does anybody have feedback on Napoli?
Was wondering if there's a list anywhere of all the classes that can be  scheduled with time conflicts, or any way to see what classes have this  'special ability' without actually trying to schedule them.
Does anyone know if there is a way to get ***""consent of instructor required for enrollment""*** in the decal course supervised group study instructed by Nadesan Permaul if your an incoming freshman?
Is there a way to backup a wait listed class with a different class?
Are there any libraries, or places to do work on campus, that are open during the weekend? (I just moved here, and I still need to buy furniture haha)

I'd appreciate any recommendations for coffee shops as well! :)
What graphing calculator should I get? I'm going to be taking Math 1A this semester. I think it's going to be the only math class I take at Cal.
 Is taking cs61a and 3 BREADTHs my first semester a bad idea?

I feel like BREADTHs are my 'easier' classes.

So, I've decided to come to Cal, with the desire to pursue Haas \(Econ is my second choice\). My career goal is management consulting.

Anyway, I'm really interested in politics, and was involved in political activism throughout high school. However, I'm pretty conservative/libertarian. I'm liberal on most social issues, but conservative on most economic ones. I'm not dogmatic though, and try to be more moderate. I supported Kasich in the GOP primary in 2016, with Rubio being my second choice, and I'm a #NeverTrump Republican. That said, I like people like Ben Shaprio, Thomas Sowell, Milton Friedman, etc.

If I could have voted in 2016, since I live in CA, I'd have supported Gary Johnson as the least of all evils, despite his stupid Aleppo comment. I hate Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both. I also think Bernie Sanders is a nutjob.

I think far\-right folks like Milo, Ann Coulter, Dennis Prager etc., are stupid though. The alt\-right is stupid. That said, I disagree with liberals/progressives on a lot of things. I'm pretty anti gun control, which I know is pretty unpopular, but I swear by it. I'm moderate on abortion. I think a lot of liberals/progressives are way too PC these days and are oversensitive. I hate identity politics. I oppose birthright citizenship and think we should move to a merit based form of immigration. I support giving DACA recipients a pathway to citizenship, but I think their parents shouldn't be allowed to be citizens \(but maybe given some form of legal status if they are nonviolent?\) I'm also not a fan of Sanctuary Cities, I'm also extremely pro\-Israel. 

 I'm also an Asian woman, so it's not like I'm a rich white male.

So would I fit in at Cal? What political clubs would you recommend I join? Thanks :\)
Hi! I love choir, acapella, and musical theater. I know that there are a lot of performing groups at Cal, but what are the differences and which do you recommend auditioning for? Thank you. :)
Hi all, 

I am intended computer science and am thinking about a double major with applied math. Without the double major, I will probably be able to graduate a semester early, which would be nice (out of state), but if I stay the whole 4 years, I can probably get the double major - is this worth it? Will this add enough value to my degree that it would offset the semester's tuition? 

Thanks!
Hi everyone. I'm choosing between Berkeley, UCLA, USC, and WUSTL.

I want to major in Business. For that, UC Berkeley is the clear winner. And if I somehow don't get into Haas, Cal is still stellar at economics.

I know this might sound really shallow to some, but one reason I'm hesitating committing to Cal is I really dislike the campus culture I've seen from the memes page, as well as some of the posts on this sub. I'm a pretty ""normal"" guy, and I'll be brutally honest, I'm interested in normal, mainstream things. I want to be really involved in intramural soccer and basketball, join a frat, cheer at football games, etc. I like dressing well, working out, working hard and playing hard. I played football in high school and was a so-called ""jock"" who loves sports.

I don't give two shits about anime, manga, kpop, video games, so all those inside jokes go over my head. Extremely prevalent nerd culture/being quirky for quirky's sake is a turnoff to me. 

I'm not fond of hanging out with really socially awkward people/people with low emotional intelligence. The memes page often seems pretty cancerous, and the depressive, overly-self deprecating nature of that page is a turn off to me. I saw a lot of really weird people and socially incompetent people at Cal day. In contrast, the people at UCLA and USC seemed far more ""normal"" for lack of a better term, and ""cool."" From a first glance, the people there seemed a lot better rounded, a lot more outgoing, happy, fit, way better dressed, way better in maintaining their appearances, etc. 

A lot of people I talked to at Cal day stuttered, didn't show eye contact. Basically caricatures of Richard Hendrix from Silicon Valley. People at UCLA and SC were a lot more energized. And I liked the ECs better at those two schools. It was really cool how hyped SC always gets about football, and UCLA about basketball. 

So am I wrong? Is Berkeley really not what I'm thinking it is? Are the people at Berkeley not as weird as I'm imagining? I know this might be offensive and shallow, but it's honestly what I think and believe.

Shit can you tell me about the social frats then?
How helpful is it to have a micro-fridge in your room? If you had one, how much did you use it?I'm still unsure if I should rent one, especially since my roommates don't feel that it's necessary.
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna commit! Few quick concerns!! pls help. 

- i took a ""research"" class in junior year, (basically a glorified study block) and i didn't include it on my uc portal because it wasn't something i thought fit under the a-g requirements. nonetheless, i also took p.e and i still included p.e under my ""other course work"", will it be an issue if i didn't include research? 

- some of my electives were pass or fail in sophomore and junior year. (sophomore year it was just one block that carried over 3 trimesters and changed from film, to art, to debate - junior year it was IB TOK) they still fulfilled some of my a-g requirements and are on my transcript, so i included them. problem is the application doesn't allow you to put a pass or fail for a class, so i just marked them all as 7/7 (schools grading system), will that look bad? what should i do?



How many credits are generally required to graduate if you do a simultaneous or double major?
Hello!

I'm currently applying for housing as an incoming freshman and am wondering if there are any major differences between the Units? From what I've read online, the Units look like the most likely option for an incoming Freshman looking for socially active / centrally located housing. Is that true? And if so are some Units preferred over others? Thanks!
How good is the campus for skateboarding/ pennyboarding? I'm thinking of alternatives for walking cuz it takes 10+ minutes to walk from residence hall to the buildings
Are we allowed to take community college courses in the summer before entering Cal in the fall (I'm an admitted freshman)?

Trying to decide between UCI and UCB, any advice is appreciated! 
Background: I'm a transfer student studying chemical engineering and material science from a CCC in Irvine. As I live in Irvine now, UCI is definitely a cheaper option for me housing wise and I also have the Reagent scholarship from them. Eventually I'm planning on getting a PhD and researching materials that can be used in the biological field.

After talking to a friend in Berkeley in the chemical engineering department, the classes sound brutal. So from the viewpoint of a grad school, is it better to get perfect grades at UCI or get straight B's from Berkeley? Also would double majoring help my chances of getting into a good grad school? I was thinking of double majoring in chemical engineering and biology if I go to UCI but I know it won't be feasible at UCB. I've also heard research experience is huge for grad schools so is it extremely difficult to get into a lab at UCB? I have a few years of lab experience but only in biological laboratories.

just got into berkeley this year, excited to attend.

Got a few questions:
Is there room in any dorm for a TV, like 47” to 52”? I think I applied mostly for doubles in Blackwell and the units.

I’ve heard that the administrators at Berkeley have trouble dealing with the amount of students at the school. How long does it take to get to talk to someone who can help with a problem?

Parking. if I do get a new car before freshman year, is it worth parking near the campus? My parents’ll be living like 1 hour away in San Jose

I’m from a kinda conservative suburb in NJ. I’ve heard a shitton about the super liberal reputation Berkeley’s got. I think I’m a pretty tolerant guy, but is the whole political thing really THAT in-your-face?

Finally, I’m a major in IEOR, just wondering how the courses associated with it are, opinions on professors, just general impressions.
Hey, I'm heading to Cal this fall as a transfer and put apartments as my choices for housing. Anybody know the likelihood of getting into any of them? I know the whole housing situation there is pretty messy, but what are some of your experiences? I'm not sure if the apartments are more or less desirable than actual on-campus housing. I'm reading up on others' experiences and am now getting a little anxious haha


What is living in a RH Suite Triple Foothill like?

Hi so I got Clark Kerr triple. I actually put double for all my choices cause Im rooming with a friend and I put clark kerr last on my choice before Any so I got kinda rekt. I was hoping someone could tell me some good things about Clark Kerr or triple? I've heard its like 15 minutes from campus so its hard to go to parties or hangout? Also is it unsafe? I've heard berkeley isn't the safest place and walking home in the night seems like a bad idea. If I'm a guy and I walk with one or two friends back will I be fine or should I be worried a bit? Lastly, the mountain lion thing is just a meme right?

Hey guys, in serious need of help here: does anyone know if MATH1A or MATH16A will be available over the suummer?? I tried to see it online and couldn't find anything. Thanks!
About to apply for classes as an incoming Mech Eng freshman. Does a course load of CHEM1A/L, E7, E25, and r/C A sound doable for the first fall semester?
how is the scheduling with decal courses (week by week, every 2 weeks, etc.)? i'm trying to decide if the decal l&s10 (On the Same Page) is worth it time-wise compared to other 1 unit decals
can you join a social sorority and a pre-professional fraternity at the same time? I'm interested in rushing a sorority, but also want to be involved in a pre-law fraternity and am wondering if I could do both.
I am a new admitted student who wants to do premed. My current major is Chemistry in College of Chemistry, but its most likely that I will change it to neurobiology in MCB. Can anyone give me some advice on course selection? 
COC requires Chem 4A and etc.  while MCB requires Chem 1A. Which course requirement should I meet? 
Best math 1a instructor?
I'm sure this has been asked before, but I am a incoming Civil Engineering student. I took Calc AB this year and I feel very confident that I passed the AP exam (probably got like a 4). Should I take Math 1B or something else my first semester at Berkeley?
data 100 or cs 160? it'll be my first upper div course. right now, i'm like #6?? on the waitlist for 160 (and i'll probably get off once my major is finalized), but enrollment for data 100 is still pretty open. i'm interested in 160's material and it's at a slightly better time (i know i'm going to end up skipping a lot of data 100 lectures, it's at the literal worst time other than 8am), but data 100 is also very interesting. so a) which one will be more helpful for internships, and b) which one is easier? for reference, my other classes in the fall are cs70, ee16b, and global 173.

how are most freshman seminars graded and how would it be to take multiple in one semester? I'm interested in taking two freshman seminars my first semester, and was wondering if that's typical/recommended
how is the global edge program? \(I'm a cs major off the waitlist that needs to decide between global edge and fpf, currently leaning towards global edge bc it seems more exciting\)
Has anyone here taken a physical education course at Cal? I'm looking into tennis or swimming. Tennis I am intermediate at, and swimming I'm a beginner at. I'm motivated by grades, and not motivated by my own health and wellness so I figure a class might be good to take. I just want to hear about the experience. 
My registration time for phase 1 is really late, 7/18 at 11:40 am

Between not getting a preferred housing choice and this, I think something screwed up in my Regents scholar contract process, since the contract still says it's being processed. Should I contact someone about this, and where should I contact?
Class enrollment of 1pm how screwed am I to get the classes I want. Plan to do MEB major and is my planned schedule:
Chem 1A/L
Math 16
English R1A
ESPM 24
ESPM 6
Does financial aid cover Summer session C for incoming transfers? 

I’m an incoming transfer student and for some reason when I click my academics it says it cannot find this page? Is anyone else experiencing this problem. I see other transfers finding out their registration times and would like to know mine.
Incoming EECS freshman. I was considering the following schedule:

* CS 61A

* EE 16A

* Math 53

* R&C B

I know its very similar to the sample schedule on the EECS site, but after asking around this would apparently make my freshman first semester extremely stressful and difficult. I'm not entirely sure what to do now. Switch out EE 16A for some Decals? Or switch Math 53 instead? Keep current plan? Any advice appreciated, thanks!

is a freshman seminar necessary? or is it just to fill up units? is it worth it to take one?
Best place to get textbooks? Ex: Physics for Scientists and Engineers Volume 1 Edition 4 for Physics7A
Incoming freshman IEOR major. I would like to double major or at least minor in Data Science as well as there is a lot of overlap between the two majors. Can I petition to take CS 61b instead of Engin 7 (which is an IEOR prereq requirement)?
Got accepted into FPF and a triple unit housing with unit 2. However, their fees still haven't shown up in COA under myFinances in CalCentral. Is this normal, or will it update eventually? Also, do FPF students receive financial aid for the program fee? 
I'm not sure if this has been asked already, but is the Parent Information Form task on CalCentral mandatory for students to complete?
I'm transferring into Berkeley for MCB and I'm currently figuring out if I can fit a data science minor into my schedule. Could someone recommend whether I should take COMPSCI 61A or COMPSCI 88 in Fall 2018 for the Data 100 prerequisite? From what I could gather:

COMPSCI 61A \- Pro: Highly rated teacher \(DeNero\); Con: 4 units, lots of work? \(I know only a little python\)

COMPSCI 88 \- Pro: 2 units; Con: Teacher reviews aren't as good

Any advice from people who took Data 100 would be great!

Anyway i can read transfer waitlist statistics?
When are the expected transfer waitlist waves coming? 
Has anyone successfully waived the summer cancellation fee?
Is Unit 1 or Unit 3 better to live in, even if it’s a subtle difference? I have either as a choice but currently am leaning towards my Unit 1 triple since it’s a “substance free environment.” 
When do counselors contact transfer students about class scheduling? 
Can any freshman take Freshman Seminars, or only Letters and Sciences? 

Also, any particular seminar recommendations?
Are there any clubs/resources for students to rent camping gear cheaply? (Tents etc)
How are the course threads? Does the certificate mean anything?
https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major

Does this include people that were admitted from the waitlist?
Should I skip Math 1A (and 1B if I get a 4 on BC)? I got a 4 on AB last year. I’m an incoming Civil Engineering major so I know I’ll need a deep understanding of calculus. I would like to take less classes overall but I’m worried that skipping to more difficult math classes will be a bad idea and ruin my GPA. 
Is there any way to see the specific times of 999 sections/labs for CS courses before signups are published?
I’m an incoming freshman signing up for Math 1B for first semester. It shows lecture on MWF for an hour each and discussions TTh for an hour and half. Is this normal for Math 1B? 6 hours a week?
planning ahead to second semester at cal, is this a manageable schedule 

cs 61 b
ee 16a
ugba 10
espm 50 ac
Is Chem 1AL required if I'm taking Chem 1A? In the Civil Engineering curriculum, it says only Chem 1A so I'm assuming the lab is not required?

Also is it possible to take German R5B without taking R5A through the AP Literature test clearance?
[deleted]
Hello, I just got accepted off the waitlist as a transfer for Berkeley. I already submitted my SIR to UCSB, and my MAP portal says that I have until June 13 to accept my offer. It seems ridiculous that I get 6 days after the decision to make my choice. Anyways, does anyone have any advice on what to do? I’m a biology major who loved the UCSB campus, and unfortunately it looks like I won’t have enough time to visit UCB before the deadline. Do I have enough time for housing and whatnot? I’m a little worried :(
Hey I’m an incoming Econ transfer and was thinking of taking the L&S 10 class offered in the fall that’s for 1 unit centered around The Handmaids Tale that Cal bought for so many people. Never taken a 1 unit class or a pass/no pass grade course. Do you guys find that these classes are worth it and are they particularly hard at all? Only thing I’m kinda worried about is I haven’t taken an English class in two years so my writing is by no means spectacular and I’m not sure how rigorous Cal’s writing expectations will be for a class like this. Also kinda the same question about decals do you find them worth it? Some of the ones I was looking at look rather interesting but not sure if it’s worth it if they add a bunch of stress to a 16 unit semester.
Hey guys, I'm an incoming freshman hoping to do Haas+Data Science or Haas+computer science. Is the data science major comparable to cs major (as in, would cs get me the same jobs as data science and vice versa). 
Also in terms of classes, which option do you guys suggest? Or if you have any other class suggestions, any are appreciated!

1. cs61a / math 53 / art 23ac(breadth) / MCELLBI C62(breadth)

2. cs61a / Stat 134 / econ 1 / breadth

3. data 8 / math 53 / breadth / breadth

I have a pretty strong math background, but I'm mainly concerned about choosing the correct classes so I can optimize my chances for haas (having a high GPA, but also challenging course load)
Thanks!

Anyone from the transfer waitlist for College of Chemistry majors got any updates? I’m somewhat convinced CoC didn’t do a wave this week because i can’t find anyone else that got any updates 
Do transfer students need to submit their high school transcripts? 
On the enrollment page it says 
> Normal Course Loads
> Undergraduates: A course load of 15 units per semester is considered a normal undergraduate course load, and you are expected to enroll in at least 15 units.

And then later it says the minimum load for L&S is 13 units... It doesn't look like any of the colleges have a minimum 15 unit mark.... why would it even say that there is an expectation of 15 units if the minimum is lower?
What happens when my discussion is right after my lecture? On the schedule planner, it says Chem 1A in Pimentel 1 from 1 to 2, then from 2 to 3 I have what appears to be my discussion (at Hildebrand). Should I keep my schedule this way, or is it a bad idea to have my discussion right after my lecture?
Conditions of admission state that you need a minimum of C in any individual course. Do a-levels count or only highschool grades?

 I'm attending Berkeley this year and I was wondering if commuters could give me insight on how their commute was. I was planning on living in Fremont and commuting up but almost everyone has gotten me worried about homeless people on the BART. Is that really such a big problem? 
I'm not sure if I want to do MCB major/premed, CS major/premed, or just CS major. First question: How doable is CS major/premed?? Second question, if possible: Any recommendations for freshman fall schedule?
If I'm taking California Community College classes over summer and I transfer the credits to Berkeley will the grades carry over into my GPA? Or does it just transfer the credits.
How is the AC transit? I am looking into apartments in Emeryville or Northwest Berkeley \- is it safe and reliable to use, especially at night?

As an incoming freshman in Letters and Sciences thinking of an Applied Math major hoping to later join the Computer Science cluster, what classes should I take beyond the required math ones?

I've heard good stuff about freshman seminars and am thinking of doing something in Berkeley Connect as well.
Please advise! orz
For the College of Engineering online orientation thing where we have to submit a proposed schedule to our adviser, do we have to enroll for the schedule we agree upon with the adviser or can we enroll for whatever we want to when the enrollment day comes?
How is this course schedule for Pol Sci\Econ Major? First semester:

Polsci 5
Stat 20
Phil 25A
Astronomy C10

I at first planned on taking these courses this fall for L&S compsci that wants to double major econ

* Econ 1
* Math 1A
* Compsci 61A
* Art 8

But the schedule planner tells me that all options of Art 8 conflict with Econ 1. But still wanting to take art in the first semester what should I do?

1. Change Art 8 to Art 8A: how do these 2 courses differ?
2. Could I change Art 8 to Art 12? I've read that some people really recommend art 12. But it seems like it requires art 8 as a prereq? What about waiving it?
3. Or, I should move Econ 1 to another semester since Berkeley recommends not taking econ 1 the first term anyway?

Also, how do the Berkeley Studio Art classes compare to the actual courses? For someone who seriously wants to improve their art?
Hi everyone apparently I can't post this as a separate thread because I don't have enough karma but here it is:

I'm coming to Berkeley this fall and I'm wondering if I could get some advice. So basically I currently have Medi-Cal in the SoCal county I live in. I wanna transfer it to Alameda county so I can waive out of SHIP and not have to pay $2500 per semester for insurance I don't need. My problem is that medi-cal requires me to have a address in Alameda before I can switch it to there, and the waiver deadline is July 31st. Am I correct in thinking that means I have to basically move in by July 1st and pay an extra month of rent just so I can waive out of SHIP? Seems kind of ridiculous... Is there no way I could get them to extend the deadline? It should really be by August 30th or something. How does Berkeley expect me to waive it when they give no time to do so? Most people move in in early August...
Has anyone taking the 'Craft of Writing' course offered by the Rhetoric Department? Considering doing it to fulfil my R&C req but don't want to take a really hard course. I'm ready to put in a good amount of work though and am actually interested in strengthening my writing skills, related to rhetoric. Any one have an idea of the class?
Best way to prepare for chem 1A?
How do you use AP credits to skip classes? I can't seem to find a page with detailed information about which tests allow me to skip what classes (in Letters and Sciences). 

If I score a 5 on AP Calc BC can I skip both Math 1A and Math 1B?
I'm planning on either majoring in MCB or CS (I'm also keeping premed as an option.) The MCB requirement for math is Math 10 series and for CS it is Math 1. Which should I take? (I took AP Calc AB/BC and got 5's, but I'm taking math again at Cal because \*cries in premed\*) Which math sequence would you recommend? Thanks for any help, I don't know anything and every piece of advice is much appreciated!
Should I try to finish a lot of my breadths during lower div years so that I can focus mainly on my major in jr and sr year, or should I try to spread them out? I'm going to be an applied math + CS major and I'm thinking about doing summer classes as well. I know this might be a stupid question, but any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated :)
I see on berkeleytime that the special topics history classes generally have the highest grade distributions for fulfilling the history breadth, but I know that the topics for those classes change every year. Are those classes consistently easy?  How much work should I be expecting from the Gender and Sports American Culture special topic? Any answer is appreciated

Anyone know what the whole tv situation is like in the dorms? I'm moving into a unit 3 triple and idk if it's big enough to take one
How are people saying that classes are filling up, while the enrollment period hasn't even started yet? Super confused.
[deleted]
Hey guys,

I'm an incoming freshman, intending on Haas with Econ as a backup. My IB credit will hopefully place me out of all the UC requirements, so I only have the Breadths left to fulfil; ECON 1 should also be placed out of. Let me know if this is an OK ***schedule for first semester***\-- any advice, or things you would change are welcome!

**Math 16A**\-- taking the relatively easy math route, since I heard that it doesn't matter for Haas admissions, nor for internships

**UGBA C5**\-- interested in entrepreneurship, only 2 units though.

**CS** **10**\--  I'm strongly considering replacing this with something more practical/useful

**HISTORY 7A**\-- Could be fun to get acquainted with the history of the US. I also personally enjoy studying history.

**ASTRON C13**\-- genuinely interested in the topic + nice grades (PhysSci breadth too)

17 units total.

Thank you!
Should I take RHETOR R1B or ENGLISH R1B? I got a 5 in AP Lang but I'm not great at literature. I am definitely more skilled in writing in the AP Lang sense.

Intended CS + Applied Math major Schedule:

CS 61A w Denero, Math 54 w Teleman (or srivastava), Anthro 3AC w Holston, and a seminar/decal = 14 or 15 cred

I was wondering if this schedule was way too lax. Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated 

Also, if anyone has taken Anthro 3AC, what is the class generally like? are there many readings/hw? 
So if a requirement doesn't mention AP credit, can I use AP credit to complete it? For example, I have a natural science requirement, which can include Chem 1A. However, that's covered by AP Chem, which I took this year. So can I use AP Chem to cover my natural science requirement?
How accurate is the *Gift Aid and Waivers* number in *My Finances*? As in, does it change prior to school starting? I'm trying to budget off campus housing and I'd like to know if it fluctuates or if it's likely that's how much i'll get. 
[deleted]
Is this schedule reasonable for a first semester junior L&S CS transfer? CS61A, EE16A, CS47B, and HISTORYC157! 
As mentioned by u/2qpp, I'm also going through the Golden Bear Advising for the College of Engineering. Assuming I do well on my AP exams when they come out (July 5, fingers crossed!), my recommended schedule would be:

Math 53
CS 61A
EE 16A

However, there is also the H/SS breadth requirement I must satisfy. I already have two of the six courses taken care of through AP credits, but I'm wondering if I should add an H/SS class onto my already three technical courses listed above. 

Especially for my first semester at Cal, I don't want to overload myself too much. I'd say my work ethic is pretty strong, but I just want to see if any other EECS majors have any insightful input on the matter.

Thanks!

Can someone explain the difference between a Col Writ R1A/B course and a Col Writ R4A/B course? R4 seems to have a higher average. I'm not sure which English/Literature course to take for the English requirement as a premed.
Is:

MATH10A or STATS20 (still deciding which ones to take)


CHEM 1A/1AL


Data 8/STAT8


RHETOR R1A

manageable for a freshman?

New Transfer Student. Are there any GE classes us transfer ppl must take at Berkeley? 
When I looked at the Haas prerequisites, it said that ""I must satisfy R&C requirement by completing courses comparable to both Berkeley's English R1A and English R1B"". Does this mean the class has to have the R1A or the R1B tag? for example, German R&C is also one of the courses that satisfies part A of the R&C requirement, but since it's R5A not R1A, does that mean if I took this course instead it won't satisfy the Haas prereq's? I would rather take German R&C over English R1A if possible. 
 I'm very much looking forward to my first semester at Berkeley as a prospective Stats major; but I have a question regarding clusters: does it make sense to take a cluster course one's first semester (in my case, Demog 110: Introduction to Population Analysis)? Or should I just wait to take it at a later time? Thanks!
 Hi!

Is this a reasonable schedule? I have listed some classes I'm interested in. Is it a good idea to enroll in a ton of classes and then drop a few?

CS61A - major prereq, 4 units

Music R1B- R&C B requirement, 4 units (On berkeleytime, it says it is 50&#37; enrolled but there are 8 on the waitlist? How does that work and will I be able to make it??)

Math53? 4 units

C30T (Drugs and the Brain) - Biological sciences breadth 3 units

I also put down econ 1 and physics 7a as  alternates. Lmk if my courseload is light or heavy, i honestly have no idea
Any current IEOR majors who are willing to PM there personal course schedules? Just want to get an idea from current students 
Is Data 8 (Stats C8) + Stats 88 easier than Stats 20?
I'm trying to finalize my freshman schedule. I'm planning on majoring in Cog Sci with a minor in CS. However, I didn't take AP Calc because I already had a full course load senior year. My biggest regret ugh. Now I have to take Math 1A so I can take CS 61A. I don't want to take them concurrently because I've heard that's too heavy first semester for someone without a programming background. 

Will I be behind for a CS minor and am I screwed for Math 1A since I've heard horror stories? Should I take CS C8? Is this Data 8?
Thoughts on freshman schedule? (possible premed, MCB major, keeping CS/Data Science open options)  
Math 1A, Chem 1A, Data 8/CS C8, breadth/R&C, seminar (17 units) --> Is this a too heavy courseload?

OR

Math 1A, Chem 1A, breradth/R&C, seminar (13 units) --> Is this a too light courseload?
Incoming freshman - is Data 8, CS 61A, EE 16A, JAPAN 1A doable/should I do this?
I did the AP CSP and CSA in high school and felt relatively comfortable, and I want to major CS (or data science? depending on how the major requirements turn out) + Japanese Language. 
Would taking CS61A, Math 54, CS C8 (Data 8), and a breadth course be too hard of a schedule for my first semester at Berkeley?
[deleted]
Some courses on the course catalog have an instructor listed for one section but not for another(for example, Physics 7A has Oskar Hallatschek for MWF but for the TuTh there's no instructor listed) 

Does this just mean the instructor is TBD, and if so usually when does this update?
Incoming freshman looking to declare MCB, how does this schedule look?

STAT 20

RHETOR R1A

CHEM 1A/1AL

COMPSCI (Data) C8

Freshman Seminar

Possible Decal
Thoughts on workload for this schedule?

\-CBE 150B (Bell)

\-CBE  142 (Schoofs)

\-CBE 170A (Zhang)

\-CHEM 135 (Miller)
If I attended two different high schools, do they both need to send transcripts to Berkeley? I had the high school I graduated from send my transfer transcript (from my old school) to Berkeley, but it hasn't been checked off yet on CalCentral. Does my old school have to send my transcript directly to Berkeley?
I'm an incoming freshman in L&S looking to declare a CS major, and currently I'm looking at the following schedule:

CS 61a, EE16a, Educ 130 (L&S Breadth), Music R1B

 I have a little CS experience (took AP CS and was part of the programming team for robotics in high school), so I'm not sure if I'm 100&#37; prepared for CS 61a. As for EE16a, I don't think it should be too bad because I've already taken Linear Algebra at my local state school, so it will just be a matter of learning circuit design. I chose the breadth and R1B requirement because they were both interesting options that had a relatively high class average (A- for both of them).
Where can I find the list of novels English R1B will be reading? Also, for anyone who has taken English R1B, who was your teacher, and what was your experience like? Were you able to improve your writing skill?

On or off campus as a transfer student? I was offered a triple in Unit 2. With on campus aid, I’ll have all my tuition and housing covered but am not sure how a triple would be. I could go off campus and pay more but have my own room or I could stay on campus and pay nothing else for housing. Any thoughts on what would be best for a transfer? 
[deleted]
Hello! I was wondering about the placement exams. I didn't have to take the UC Placement exam in May, and I believe I don't need to take an English placement exam due to my AP Lang score, but what about the math placement exam? I didn't pass my AP Cal exam, so I think I'm supposed to take it, but I haven't received a notification about taking any placements. Lots of my friends going to other UC or CSU schools are taking their placements online so it got me thinking about mine.

When and where are the math placements supposed to take place?
[deleted]
Good to know, thank you for the lengthy and well thought out response! 
Hi, I have two questions as a transfer student about my Conditions of Admission:

1) Where should I have sent my high school transcript? I'm very worried since it's obviously past the deadline, but MAP and the [admissions website](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/submitting-transcripts-uc-berkeley) both tell me to refer to CalCentral for which documents to send and there was no task for high school transcripts on CalCentral. Should I have sent those transcripts from another page?

2) Should I have submitted the Undergraduate Admissions Update form if I am taking summer classes at UC Berkeley right now? Or would that form only be for summer classes at my previous institution?

Thanks very much in advance! 
Are there any PoliSci transfers? What was your schedule for your first semester? Did you knock out American cultures req right away? Is POL SCI 3 a req as well?

Basically, I just want an idea of the classes I should be taking. I know it's a writing/reading intensive major so I don't want an overwhelming schedule.
Hello!  
Does anyone have experience with housing on [www.campuscribz.com](https://www.campuscribz.com) ?  
I feel like some of the listings over there are there are too good to be true and I was wandering it generally considered a reliable site for housing?   
Any and all feedback is well appreciated! 
Where do you usually find if a class has a prerequisite or not?
Hi, I'm an intended CS major going into my first semester this fall.  


I have no programming experience but from what I'm hearing, CS61A is more than welcoming to students who're new to CS.  
I was thinking of taking CS61A, EE16A and two breadth classes. I tested out of Math1B and the R&CA/B requirements. Looking over the Math1B final exams, the topics seem do-able and manageable although I might not be able to ace the whole test if I took it right now but I've definitely learned the material and if I brushed up on it I feel like I'd do extremely well in the class. For my breadths, I'm considering two of these classes: Eng20, Astron. C13, Japan7A, PoliSci 5, and Classic 36.   


What are your opinions? What should I worry about? Anything else I should take into consideration? 
For real for real tho. From 1-10, how would you rate the food you get with the meal plan? How is the quality, and variety?
Is anyone else able to get a confirmation email when submitting a case to Cal Student Central? I'm having no such luck.
Can anyone give advice on Econ 100A with Scott Carson and Stat 134 with Hank Ibser? What should I expect for exams and final grading? Any help is appreciated!

Hi, incoming freshman here; I was thinking of knocking out one of my stats cluster courses early by taking demog 110 this semester. I am a little intimidated at the prospect of taking an upper-div my first semester, but it seems branded as the place to start for anyone interested in demography. Is it a reasonable course to take in ones first semester?
How do I get credit for an AP test I took but did not report I would take when applying(so it's not on my CalCentral tasks)? Do I just send it along with other scores, or do I also have to explicitly contact an adviser about it?
My plan is to take ECON 100B, ECON 115, IAS 45, and probably a decal class. However, ECON 100B seems to be the only class that has reserved seats for transfer students and the rest are packed to the brim with 30+ on the waitlist. What am I supposed to do now? I need the IAS 45 asap so I am able to declare my major as polyecon... Is there really only one section per class? Because it’s not showing me any other choices.
Does anybody have any stories about their experience using PSI insurance? Planning to waive SHIP and was wondering whether anybody has any experience with actually claiming on PSI for health insurance and what it was like. Thanks.
On the orientation page, I was told I would be contacted about my schedule by my ess advisor by june 29th. Now that its a week into July, I'm starting to get worried that my advisor contacted me but I just don't know where. 

Is it normal for schedule responses to happen past June 29th, and if so how do they contact you?
I'm looking for some help with understanding what determines cost of tuition. I'm going to be working and was looking at having a lower course load, but am not sure if ill still be paying the total ""expected cost"" that is associated with a full course load.
Hey y'all,

I'm an incoming transfer student admitted for Pure Math but intend to declare Applied Math and pursue the CS Cluster. This is currently what I have planned for my first semester.  
Math 55  
Math 110  
CS61A  
History 7A

To add a bit of context, I am currently self-studying CS61A, so technically I'll have all the knowledge from the course by the time Fall begins. Would it be a waste of time for me to take 61A? Should I still take it to clear the prereqs for the upper div cluster? Thanks for any help y'all.
What are the classes with no students enrolled and no professor?  Like for example for [Anthro R5B 004](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-fall-anthro-r5b-004-lec-004) and [Theater R1B 006](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-fall-theater-r1b-006-lec-006) they have pages on the course catalog and Berkeleytime but I can't try to add the class to my shopping cart because the class number is not valid.  Are they still trying to find someone to teach them and they aren't a sure thing yet, or are they reserved for freshman and so you can't sign up for them yet or what?  I kinda want one of these classes and all the other sections are full with waitlists so I'm not sure if I should be looking elsewhere or not.
Anyone here take ASAMST 128AC (Muslims in America)? How hard is it? It's 4 units but my advisor recommends that I don't take it because it's an upper level course, as a freshmen do you guys think I could manage it?
[deleted]
Do I pay tuition for each year? Or can I, for example, graduate in 3.5 years and avoid paying tuition for that last semester?
Posting this here because I think it'll get more visiblity (I deleted my previous post):

So I originally signed up for 2 classes session C one being bio1A, but I reached out to my counselor asking if I could somehow drop the class past the deadline as there was a late internship opportunity that I wanted to take advantage of. So I met with her and she gave me a form on Thursday to request to drop the class and she said she should be able to get back to me on Friday. Now that Friday has passed I'm a bit on edge. Is there a good chance I will actually be approved and be able to drop the class? My friend said dropping classes during the summer past the deadline is usually allowed you just don't get a refund (which I'm not worried about right now). Besides this, theres a Bio test on Monday so I don't know if I should study for it just in case or if theres nothing to worry about and the class is probably going to get dropped anyways. Any advice?
How do I figure out what class I have to take based on my AP Scores?
Any course with AC can be used to satisfy American Cultures right?
[deleted]
I'm an incoming freshman (L&S CS) and I'm skipping Math 1A through AP credits. I'm slightly worried about Math 1B (i'm not amazing at math and i've heard the horror stories). Would it be useful to take the adjunct course (Math 98) with it? Also, do you have any tips for Math 1B?
Any personal preferences on Christopher Gade vs. Bruce Mangan for General Psychology? Also having discussion before/after the lecture (for example: Monday lecture, then Wednesday discussion --> lecture VERSUS Monday lecture, Wed Lecture ---> discussion). 
I'm intending on becoming a Haas major. How does it sound if I take Math 16A (I feel like I need a refresher before going into 16B), GWS 10, ART 23AC, and RHETOR R1B?

I'm still not sure if I should even take 16A since I didn't do so hot on my BC exam, but I'm eligible to skip 16A.

Also, if I originally listed that I was going to take two additional AP tests, but I ended up not taking them, should I notify my advisor? It lists those two AP scores as missing.
I applied as BioE but changed to MSE as it seemed cooler, still interested in med though. I struggled in non AP high school chem and physics but did decent at calc. Anyways, how is this 1st sem schedule?
Engineering 7
Physics 7A
Math 1B
R&C A course
Why are there a lot of classes that have many open spots, yet there are already people on the waitlist? I've been going through [berkeleytime.com](https://berkeleytime.com) and sorting by available seats, but even the most open classes already have people on the waitlist???
currently an incoming sophomore majoring in hemical ngineering who wishes to major in CS, and was wondering if it's fairly easy to switch into l&s for fall 2018.

I'm intending to go Pre-Haas/Econ and noticed that they both have Econ 1 requirements. However, I noticed on the economics department website that I had received the necessary IB score in HL Econ to have my credit transfer over. Is it the same for Haas or do I still need to take Econ 1?
[deleted]
Hi all, 
I'm an incoming freshman majoring in Econ/Haas. If anyone has any thoughts on the feasibility of my schedule that would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Computer Science C8 (data 8)
Geography 10
Mathematics 16B
Nutritional Science & Tox 10

How does the process of transferring colleges work? I am thinking of transferring from L&S to Chemistry, but am not sure if that's plausible.
Does anyone know if we can apply to declare multiple majors at the same semester as backup plan?

Hey  folks, incoming freshman. I'm planning on taking Math 53 and Math 54 this semester, along with a history and biology class. Is this a good idea?

I have a real solid background in math (7s in IB Math HL and Further Math) so I wanna take advantage of that. However, I also don't wanna come in too cocky and get rekt. Would love advice.
Incoming freshman intending on Haas looking for help with a Math strategy. I recently received a 5 on my AP Calculus BC exam so I am eligible to skip Math 16A and Math 1A. But, I’m also looking to maintain a high GPA as grades are given considerable weight during the Haas admission process. The following are my options:

1.  OPTION 1: Take both Math 16A and 16B (best chance for A’s but worried how Haas will view the lack of rigor given my AP score i.e., could raise some eyebrows at the decision to take what appears on paper to be an easy class - Math 16A)

2.  OPTION 2: Take both Math 1A and 1B (improved rigor and shows my willingness to take challenging courses but lowers my chance for two A’s). 

3.  OPTION 3: Skip Math 16A and just take Math 16B (safe bet and avoids some second-guessing)

4. OPTION 4:  Skip Math 1A and take Math 1B (is the reward worth the risk?  I looked at some old exams and it wasn’t too difficult but why take an unnecessary risk?)

5.  OPTION 5: Skip both the Math 16 and 1 series and take either Math 53 or Math 54 (suicide?)

Your advice and recos are welcomed...keep in mind the goal is gain admission into Haas. Thoughts?

Thanks!


Hey guys, this is another scheduling post. Which one of the two options do you guys suggest. I'm an incoming freshman looking to pursue Haas/Econ + stats or data science. Any comments are appreciated!

option 1: Math 54 | data 8 | History 11 | astron c10 - 16 credits

option 2: Math 54 | data 8 | history 11 | ugba 96 - 14 credits

It's a difference of one class, and astron c10 has a pretty high average grade, but I'm not sure if I should take 16 credits or just be safe and take 14 credits. Thanks!

Would taking a decal to get to the 13 credit minimum (I currently have only 12) be detrimental? The other option would be to take some L&S breadth, but I fear that with the breadth class the overall workload of my schedule would be too high and I would have a hard time transitioning into college life.

The rest of my schedule is: EE16A, CS61A, Music R1B

Thanks!
What is the accessibility of lectures at Berkeley? 

As a student, would I have to be registered for a particular course to attend lectures for it? 


Can I sign up for a course with one professor but attend lectures for other professors of the same course?

I just finished making some ideal schedules and I'm having a really difficult time picking one of them for phase 1. 


Schedule 1: Stats 2, Phil 2, English R1B, Bio (whichever one has seats left)


Schedule 2: Stats 2, Legal Studies seminar, Public Speaking seminar, English R1B, and Bio (whichever one has seats left)


I really want to take the seminars but Phil 2 fulfills a prereq for the Legal Studies major which is super important. The times conflict so I can only do Phil 2 OR the seminars. What do you think?


I'm an incoming freshman and my EOP advisor told me to take Math 98 (one unit seminar) to help with Math 1A.

My planned schedule for Fall 2018 is something like this so far:

COMPSCI 10

Math 1A

Art 8

COMPSCI 24

Is that Math 98 seminar worth it? Should I try it? If I do try it, and wanted to drop it, how would I do that and would it affect my GPA?

Edit:

Also, is Math 98 seminar supposed to help Math 1A or other math classes like Math 1B, etc.?

Is CompSci 24 seminar supposed to help COMPSCI 10?

Overall, are these seminars class specific?
What is the actual difference between Art8 and Art8A? 

So confused bc the difference is basically the same for both classes.

Hey friends I'm having some trouble figuring out what maths class to take. Got a 5 on the AP Calc BC but also I'm really bad at math lol facts. should I still skip 1A and 1B? or yeet into 53/54 head first

As for major I'm currently deciding between Econ/Pre-Haas and Data Science:b
Is Math 53 particularly important for EECS majors in upper level classes? I took Calc 3 at a community college and got an A, but I was cramming for everything and I’m not sure if I remember everything. Should I retake it here?
Should I skip Econ 1/2 (with AP credits)? Are the upper div Econ courses closely related to Econ 2. I'm trying to major in CS + Econ (Pre-Haas). I'm a little scared to go straight to an upper div econ course in my second sem -- i took AP econ a couple years ago.
Hey there, 

I'm trying to enroll in a course that has open seats, but already has students on the waitlist. I'm assuming the course reserves seats for people in that major or whatever, so I was wondering what date does that course open up to everyone? 

The course is ESPM 155AC, and currently on [berkeleytime.com](https://berkeleytime.com) there are: 114/220 Enrolled, and 30 Waitlisted.

My enrollment is tomorrow, and I'm assuming I can't even waitlist the class since it's capped. Any thoughts? 

Thanks! 
  What are late labs like? Do they usually suck? 

I'm an incoming freshman & I'm fairly sure that I'm going to have to do the lab for chem 1a from 6 to 9 pm on Wednesdays.Just for reference, I'm planning on taking math 1b, chem 1a, an r1a, and a history course. Thx!

Hey y'all,

I previously posted with some scheduling questions, however, I am dealing with a different problem right now. I've been attempting to get tax return documents from my mother for financial aid purposes for quite awhile now, much to her chagrin. I was finally able to get some papers from her but was recently notified that they weren't sufficient. She needs to fill out a 4506-t form to receive a verification of non-filing letter for 2016, however, I've read that it can take up to a month to process and be mailed out. The obvious problem with this is that, I do not have a month to actually fulfill this. I would use the get transcript online tool in order to get her verification of non-filing letter but she doesn't have any identifying documentation, and the get transcript by mail tool did not send her the correct paper, it just sent us a paper that said ""no record of tax return filed for this year"" which wasn't an adequate verification of non-filing. My financial aid covers my full cost of attendance, and has no costs for me outside of subsidized student loans, but what happens if I can't get it approved in time for the semester?

Thanks.
Any EPS students around that want to link up soon?
Anyone have any advice on taking UGBA 10 during the fall as a freshman? My gut is telling me to take it, but the vast majority seems to recommend against it. Anyone have experience taking it fall freshman year? My schedule for this fall tentatively looks like celtic studies r1b, Vietnamese 1a, math 16a, and UGBA 10. Is this too rough for my first semester? Note that I am in summer bridge right now and am currently taking precalculus if that means anything.

Does anyone have experience with using public transportation to go from Berkeley to Stanford? Is the Dumbarton Express at all compatible with the AC Transit Student Easypass?
I'm an incoming freshman, and I was wondering if I should take Math 53 or Math 54 first. I have been getting advice from both sides. What do you guys think is a better class to take first? And if you dont mind, I would appreciate if you could tell me why that is the better course to take first. Thanks!
How are classes/sections later in the day? 

For example, I'm considering a EE16A lab section that goes from 5:00 - 7:59 pm. 

I know 8am starts are dreadful but how about these super late classes?
[deleted]
Math/CS major looking for advice. I definitely know I'm going to take math 104 and 61b in the fall, and wanted to know what other techs would be feasible to do with those. Currently, what I'm deciding between are those two and

1) Stat 140 + CS188
2) EECS126 + a breadth

I guess basically I'm asking if cs188 is easy enough to take with other technical and if the added difficulty of 126 is worth not taking another technical. 

Also, if it matters, I took math 55 instead of CS70, leaving me with somewhat less probability knowledge should I decide to take 126.
Thanks!
Should I bring a printer to have in my dorm room? They recommend it on the website, but I also read that my dorm (unit 1) also has a workstation area that has printers.
Are all upper div courses hard? I'm taking ee16A + cs61A and I was trying to find two breadths. I was thinking L&s C30T - DRUGS AND THE BRAIN and l&S C160V - HUMAN HAPPINESS. However, c160v is upper div right? Berkeley time shows A- average so I thought it would be easy but if its upper div is there some bias cause only juniors take it? 
How do classes with Discussion/Lab coming before Lecture in the week work? Isn't the lecture supposed to introduce topics that are covered/reinforced in the Discussion/Lab?
Should I take take Math 1B alongside cs 61a in the fall or with cs 61b in the spring? It seems like the teachers and lecture times are a lot better in the spring, but it's already 91% enrolled as opposed to 46% in the fall. Is it worth taking the risk of not getting a spot by putting it off? I'm planning on doing a cs-econ double major and I have AP credit to get out of Econ 1 and Math 1A, but it still seems like I need to get the pre-reqs done ASAP.

Edit: For some reason I read Spring 2018 as meaning next Spring on berkeleytime, so ignore the part about not getting a spot in the class.

Just to be sure, is there a penalty or record on transcript for dropping classes then retaking them later on?(ie. enroll for physics7A then realize schedule too hard so drop it early and take it next semester)
Man, my financial aid literally just disappeared overnight, this was after my FA being in reject status for over a month. My phone calls about my reject status had them admitting there was nothing wrong with it and that it'd resolve itself, and my phone call today about the disappearing aid just gave me a really vague general ""just wait and see"" answer. I'm extremely stressed out right now, especially since my SHIP waiver was denied as well. 

I know no one here can do anything about it, but has anyone ever been in a similar situation and can offer comforting advice? I really want to be at cal haha
[deleted]
I enrolled in EE16a but I couldn't get into Math 1B (which is a prerequisite for EE16A). I really don't want to drop EE16a, so will I be allowed to take it or will the class automatically drop me? Any advice is fully appreciated
Will Math 1B have more open seats later? It has been full/closed and I would really like to take 1B this semester if at all possible. Is it worth emailing an advisor to see what I might do if I really cannot take 1B? Go to 1A? Don't take math this semester? I don't want to bother with that if it is likely that more seats will become open.
Are upper division H/SS classes for CoE too hard for freshmen? I wanted to take German R5A or SSEASN R5A this semester but I was #5 on the waitlist for both and I figure that I’m not getting off since both classes only have like 20 people. 

I want to take another class to cover a requirement and I’ve waived both of the lower division H/SS classes with AP credits. However, I’ve heard that upper division courses aren’t meant for freshmen. I’m also taking Math 54, Compsci C8, Chem 1A, and Civ Eng 92 (those 4 are 12 units). I’m considering just taking a 2 unit music class if the upper division classes would be too difficult since I’d like to have a music minor. 
If I have 2 classes I am waitlisted in, (one is a 45 person class, I'm position 7, the other is a 476 person class for which I am position 56), should I stay on the waitlist for either class or drop off the waitlist to enroll in another open class I'm willing to take. I have been dropping many places for both classes since yesterday, so it has given me hope, but I also don't want to rely too much on waitlisted classes in case I get screwed for next semester.

Do R5A classes count toward MEB requirements? Website only specified R1A and R1B. Thanks!

do professors ever enroll beyond capacity? I'm on a couple of waitlists positioned around 15-20% of class capacity and it seems unlikely enough people will drop. planning on showing up regardless and trying for a permission number. does this seem likely?
I messed up my phase 1, and am currently waitlisted for 189 during phase 2. The class has 385/400 spots filled (Though sections can hold up to 500), I guess because of reserved seats, and there are 190 people on the waitlist. As EECS, can I get the reserved seats? If not, how likely is it that I'll be able to get off waitlist? Should I go to class regardless.
Anyone heard anything about History C182C (Introduction to Science, Technology, and Society) with Cathryn Carson or ESM 162 (Health, Medicine, Society and Environment) with Seth Holmes? Taking those two in addition to 61C and 70 but not sure what to expect in terms of difficulty and workload.
I'm coming from out of town for an advising appointment with an English Major advisor this Friday. I had my wallet containing my state ID and old Cal student ID from 2013 stolen, and I'd only have my passport on me on Friday. Am I going to be able to even get in? It's been very long since I've stepped foot on campus and the first time I have an advising appointment for something like major declaration for my readmission process. All I need is to know my ID number... right?
I'm waitlisted for chem 3AL position 28. Do you think I have a chance of getting in? Also is it a good idea to try and put myself on the waitlist for other sections of chem 3AL or does that mess up waitlist position? 
I'm considering engineering or anthro (paleontology) w secondary in ethnic studies. Would appreciate insights into either track. I have experience with unix and electronics, math 1b, but   have aversion to staring at screens for a full day. I am more of a makerfare/experimental thinker.

Alternatively, I find anthro/paleontology a liberating science, but tentative on job prospects.

Is it a good idea to take CS61A and Intro to Data Science (C8) at the same time?
Stupid question but should I know my room number before my move in or will I get it when I check in?
[deleted]
I scheduled my ee16a lab during my cs61a lecture on Wednesday assuming I could just watch the videos for 61a that day... does this sound reasonable?  Didn't want an 8am and no other times were left for the lab.
Also, is COLWRIT R4B any better or worse than COM LIT R1B or are they both just typical English classes?
Did anyone who interviewed for the Cal Alumni Leadership Award hear back from them yet?
Hey y’all, 
Do y’all have any tips you can give me in order to raise my chances of getting accepted in the future?
I know that I need to do community service and be apart of my school while also getting good grades and doing good on my SAT and ACT. Do y’all have any extra tips that you can give me!!!
Thanks!!!

my enrollment time is 9:40 tomorrow, and all of the classes I am planning on enrolling in have at least 20 open seats. some of the discussions sections are closer to being full, but do I have a good chance at getting these classes?
Hi,

Quick question: I plan on taking CS70 over the summer, and was wondering if I should sign up for a R1B as well. Would this be too much? I want to make sure I have enough time to spend on CS70 to make sure I can declare, but also taking only one class over the summer sounds like overkill.

Thanks!
can i apply to MET ( management entrepreneurship technology) during/after freshman year? 
anyone know diff (ART 23AC, ART W23AC) aside from one being ""online""? 
So about a week ago I got an email about my financial aid having errors that I needed to make corrections on. I check, it's because I wrote that my parents filed their taxes but wrote their SSN's as all 0s because they're undocumented. Apparently this is an error, I really didn't know what to do because none of that information is incorrect, so I just submitted it again. Now I have an ""ISIR Reject"" thing on my financial aid tasks, what gives? What am I doing wrong
Hi, this might get lost in the comments, but I have a pretty pressing question.

Is Berkeley really a SJW school? I want to go there so badly because it is aligned with the career I want, but I have heard pretty bad things. Of course, these just may be rumors, but it is always better to know for sure. 
My DS is intending on becoming a Haas Major and is debating whether he should use his AP Calculus BC Credit. He received a 5 but despite the score we are leaning on taking Math 16A as a GPA booster. Theoretically, Haas doesn’t care which math course you take but does care significanlty about the grade.

Is this the right approach? Should we be more concerned about course rigor and take Math 1A/1B instead of 16A/16B?
[deleted]
What's the purpose of having two gender neutral restrooms on the first floor of Moffitt?
Is taking math 53 and stat 20 in one's first semester (in tandem with English 45b and Classics R44) doable? Or should I just substitute stat 20 with an easier course? 
I know that initial transfer credit is automatically reviewed for incoming freshman, but anyone know the chances of placing out of Math 53 and/or 54 if I took multivariable and Linear Algebra at University of Connecticut?
In my bill for first semester, we have a housing payment due on 12/18. Why do we have to pay for housing that month if we're kicked out from like 12/18 to 1/15 anyway? This is for Blackwell.

Congrats!

What I would do is to start looking into your major's curriculum and start figuring out how you want to spend your time here. Don't stress over this of course. You'll have plenty of time to do this during your orientation when you sit down with an advisor but to get you pumped and excited for when you arrive. Find out which classes seem fun/interesting to you and look up who lectures them.  Start diving into the professors to see what exciting things they are working on and/or what they have accomplished. This really puts things into perspective when it comes to classifying Cal as a top-tier university. 
if you haven't already, learn to live on your own (laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc.)

otherwise start a shopping list for your dorm/apt. 
if you don't accept it soon, Oski won't give you an Oskijob
Nah, you can accept it anytime but there's a bunch of forms you have to fill out and stuff, so the sooner you commit the sooner you can get done with the boring paperwork
just do it by the deadline. 

housing is one big lottery.

class selection is based on your class standing 
Not getting into Haas isn't really a big deal since you take a lot of the same classes as an Econ student, and you can totally still work in Finance/I-Banking/etc if you're Econ.
if you don't get into Haas you do a different major. most people will do econ because it's the same prerequisites. 
do whatever you can (ethically, legally, morally) to boost your GPA.

i think GPA is the biggest factor of getting in. most everyone does econ, or you could try to transfer out to another business school. 
You'll be fine. I didn't take several classes at community college that I said I was going to. For two years I had an incomplete task sitting on my CalCentral dashboard asking me to submit my non-existent CC transcripts. The school didn't raise a fuss and quietly removed the task a few months ago.
i didn't take an ap test i said i'd take--i just emailed someone (honestly don't even remember who) and said i wasn't taking it, and they removed the task from my calcentral!
Same somewhere on my dashboard it's asking about Calc BC, micro and macro. I checked my application and I guess I must've for some reason said that I was planning on taking those APs but uh idt I'm going to, so what do I do now
some people are very very socially awkward, but that’s okay. you meet them no matter where you go. i owe my social life to my extracurriculars—definitely branch yourself out there! maybe try rushing too if you want. 
As a transfer who was worried about this when I first got here, my biggest advice is join student orgs and just do stuff. I've only made one friend in any of my classes, but I've had a great time and felt really welcomed in clubs. Even if I didn't keep going to a specific club's meetings, I still kept up with the friends I made there. Facebook and getting flyered on Sproul was the key for finding out about stuff, so go to as many club meetings as you can the first few weeks and just see what sticks. 

Also, decals are really cool. I took the improv decal just for shits and giggles, and I ended up meeting some awesome people and really getting invested in comedy. Just go do stuff you might discover a new interest/hobby.

i would def recommend the traditional dorms. 

every night becomes an impromptu study night with your floormates. all my close friends i keep in touch with are my dormmates from freshman year. 
Long answer incoming, TLDR at the end.

Look up the ranking methodology behind each of them. They often incorporate factors that can't be objectively measured, are irrelevant to what most people would expect from an institution (ie are only loosely correlated with student success), and unfairly penalize UC Berkeley because for being a large public school.

US News National Ranking is based on ""Graduation and retention rates "", ""Undergraduate academic reputation"" - which is composed of student, instructor, and administration surveys, ""Class size"", and ""Student selectivity"".

Niche doesn't break down how their ranks are composed, but they also include ""Diversity"", ""Party Scene"", ""Campus Food"", ""Dorms"", and ""Athletics""  in their ranking. None of which are relevant if your goal is to get an education.

WSJ/Times has ""ratio of students to faculty members (11%)"", ""Engagement (20%)"" is entirely built on student surveys, ""graduation rates (11%)"", and ""amount of money that each institution spends on teaching per student (11%)"" - that's over half the school's performance evaluated on these factors!

Forbes has  ""Four-year Graduation Rate (7.5%)"", ""Six-year Graduation Rate (2.5%)"", ""Adjusted Pell Graduation Rate (2.5%)"", ""Retention Rate (15%)"", ""(15%) went to freshman-to-sophomore retention rate"". Wait, 30% of the criteria is retention rate? 

As a public school without lower enrollment rates, they receive more applications (and are often turned down by students more often - so they have to accept more students, percentage wise!), must take a larger class, and since Berkeley GPA median is lower than that of similar top tier schools, the graduation rate will also be lower. These are factors that, were we to fix them, would defeat the institution's purpose and receive significant backlash from both students and taxpayers.

---

Now let's take a look at a more objective ranking, such as the US News Global ranking. Their methodology is entirely based off [research success](https://i.imgur.com/89jMGBi.png). 

UC Berkeley ranks #4, behind 3 schools all with over 4x Berkeley's endowment. (Just imagine what a powerhouse Berkeley would be if they could match Harvard's alumni donation rate?)

Same thing for Shanghai's AWRU - Berkeley ranks #5.

CSRankings (which only focuses on CS) has Berkeley at #3.

Payscale has UC Berkeley at #1 on return of investment (difference between median pay of college grad vs high school grad 20 years after graduation subtracted by median tuition including financial aid) for computer science and math, engineering, business, science, #6 at economics, #7 psychology. What's funny is, in many of these rankings, #2 is also UC Berkeley, except paying as an out of state student.

It's interesting that the ranking systems mentioned earlier do account for things such as research and post graduation performance, but give them lower weights compared to arbitrary measurements that are ""correlated"" (using their wording) with student success.

---

There are obviously downsides to UC Berkeley as an institution, which I think is best summarized [here](http://qr.ae/TU1s8k). In the end, while I am not a fan of the politics and the school suffers from funding issues and poor administrative management, these are things I am more than happy to put up with to get the best education in the world. I reject the notion that anyone is compromising when they choose Berkeley over a HYPSM.

**TLDR**: The ranking system you provided incorporate variables that are irrelevant to the performance of a higher education institution and unfairly penalize Berkeley for being a large public school. Use more objective factors such as research success or salary after graduation, and you will find that Berkeley is the best of the best.
Ratings systems are buns it takes about 30 minutes of walking around campus to realize this is the best school on the planet
public schools are always punished in the rankings. 
You've listed out all the advantages of Caltech, and these are all factors that they are far superior to Berkeley in(small size, easy access to research, etc.). Caltech is probably one of the few schools more rigorous than Berkeley, so either way you'll have to work hard. I know some friends here who picked Berkeley over Caltech, but their main reason was that they didn't fit in with the Caltech culture. To elaborate:

Caltech is a monastery for science and math nerds(no judgement; they wholeheartedly own and embrace that description). There's no intellectual diversity in terms of majors, interests, etc. There aren't strong departments in other stuff like Econ/Business/Humanities etc, or the diverse student organizations and clubs that Berkeley has. Because the student body is very homogeneous and similar, a lot of them are so immersed in their classes/research that they don't socialize. Berkeley has several of these people too, but the large, diverse nature of the school means you can find other kinds of communities and activities too. Also, if you want to go into industry, Berkeley has better industry connections and will prepare you better for that.


If you're the kind of person that's okay with compromising all of that for the a) truly phenomenal student experience in terms of smaller classes/ better engagement with profs/easy-peasy access to research opportunities and b) its unparalleled reputation in the pure math and sciences, then pick Caltech

To specifically answer your questions: Student body is larger so it is tougher to get research opportunities. Definitely possible, but you need to be more proactive in developing relationships, reaching out, and applying to multiple groups/programs. You need to work much harder to do research and develop strong personal connections w professors. Math courses are very rigorous and prepare you well for grad school. I'm not a math major but I've taken a few upper-divs and I thought they were really well taught. They're taught by proper faculty, and there are grad students who serve as TA's that help enhance the learning experience - most of them are very approachable and all of them are ludicrously smart. Also, math lower-divs are large but the upper-divs get smaller and smaller, which is awesome. If you come here, try AP-ing out of as many lower divs, and get on to the upper divs/grad classes. Also, diversify your education - dabble in classes in CS, Statistics or Econ(esp. the mathy ones).

EDIT: If you visited Caltech and liked it, I think you should pick Caltech, as long as you know what to expect 

This is (probably) a joke, but you can create filters in bmail quite easily.

Go to the cog in the upper\-right hand corner \-\-\> Settings \-\-\> Filters and Blocked Addresses \-\-\> Create new filter

In the filter FROM field put: [CALmessages@berkeley.edu](mailto:CALmessages@berkeley.edu)

In the 'has the words' field put: Carol Christ

You can direct the emails matching the filter to go straight to archive and skip the inbox or to go into a specific folder among other things.

This is useful as well if you want to direct certain emails into different folders, e.g. send emails from piazza / bcourses in a different folder for each class.
I was wondering too lolz
Go to Joy’s Sportswear inside the Sather Gate lane (past Moe’s Flowers). It’s off-brand stuff and I think they make a lot of their own products, but it’s still good Cal gear.
Unlikely but possible. You'd have to talk to some people at both departments. 
you can switch pretty easily, you just need to take 61a and 61b your first two semesters and get at least a 3.3 (which isn't particularly difficult with just those two)
also as an engineering-but-not-eecs major, you'll be waitlisted for the cs classes until the second stage of registration, phase 2, ends, but pretty much everyone gets into intro cs classes so you'll be fine.
Got in Civil too. Why you switch it lmao? It’s the best in the world!
Yes its very possible IF you can maintain high grades in your CS classes. I knew many people (mostly mechE's and Eng. physics) who took CS61A,B (... and C?) and transfered during their sophomore year.

The lower div CS classes (CS61a,b,c) usually do their best to expand enrollment and let everyone in.
yep just go on to the next course! e.g. I skipped out of all my math except linear algebra, so I'm taking that this semester. also, you can add him as a roommate after you submit your housing, but I'm not sure if it would go through.
It would be prudent of you to select classes for you to fulfill requirements. With the exception of prereqs, no one will stop you from taking any level class, but its your job to enroll in the classes that will get you to graduate within the allotted time. You can choose whenever and however to take the classes.
Seconded! I am also a transfer student who would love to meet other transfer students! Dying to know the answer ^^^
[deleted]
transfer students typically either live in the dorms, in a regular apt, or commute in, so i'd so dorms. 

you'll get your mix of 18 year old freshmen running around, but there were a handful of transfer students there as well 
[deleted]
Yeah, you can PM me if you want
Hey there! I’m not a current student at Berkeley but I am an english transfer for fall 2018. I’m in the same boat as you, except I’m trying to decide between UCSB and Berkeley. So just tagging on here because I have the same worries. 
[deleted]
Someone mentioned in another thread about getting an email saying it would be released April 1st. Checking the Cal website, Phase I began April 17th for Fall 2017 last year so it probably will be released in early April.

Sometime in the Summer usually. Phase 1 is usually in July.
Going to disagree with the other answer and recommend Berkeley if the 10k isn't a dealbreaker(sends you into loans or puts unwanted familial strain). Berkeley EECS really confers more opportunity than UCLA, and the whole 'stress culture' thing isn't absent at UCLA either - they too are a large competitive school with large classes and tough grading. The difference in opportunities here (research/proximity/startups/reputation if you wanna head east coast/outside California) is worth it
From what I've seen, my friends from Berkeley who were EECS got way better jobs and opportunities than those who did CS in UCLA. if you work hard to learn (not bs your way thru) and don't fall behind, you can do the same and earn that 10k back in no time. Some starting salaries in the Bay area are ridiculous
10k is nothing if you can afford it. CS graduates have 100k median salary. You'll save that 10k in less than a year.
Hey!! May 5th!! The student-run transfer orgs at cal are hosting their own, and offering all sorts of programming for transfer admits.
Bowles is cool. All my closest friends are people who live there/are otherwise associated with the place. My freshman year I had very few friends, so I credit Bowles with me being a little less lonely. There is a bit of cliqueyness, and we're still experiencing growing pains as we try to reestablish the residential college model and grow as a co-ed institution, but I would still encourage you to apply if you like the sound of it and can afford it.
>due on the 30th

What's the rush, you still got 6 hours
I'd like to differ a bit and say that it was pretty easy for me to get a research opportunity--a professor sent out a list of opportunities in his lab to one of my mailing lists, I emailed back saying I was interested, and I got something (and I'm a freshman)! Also, URAP has like a 50% acceptance rate or something (although I didn't get anything through it, I messed up on parts of the application lmao). You do have to move off campus freshman year (unless you're regents or you have regents friends or you wanna live in a dorm room), though (if you are regents don't be dumb and milk the guaranteed housing can confirm is useful).
There are research programs (like URAP) and also cold emailing. Research programs are very competitive because of the popularity and the limited amount of spots available. Cold emailing is usually more viable, but it requires at least 20 emails to get a few positive responses. Most of the time, you will be under a graduate student. Although you need to put in more effort to get a research position, it is just as beneficial as any other research position at another university.

Housing is also limited and expensive. Only Regents Scholars are guaranteed university housing. During your 2nd year, you will most likely have to live off-campus because there is such little university housing available. Only a small portion of students who aren't 1st years live in university housing.

Edit: Sorry, my answer makes research and housing sound hopeless. Personally, I've had a hard time finding both and I guess I was venting my frustrations a little lol. Most people don't have it as bad though.
Basically resources are limited here. So that means you're in constant competition (whether for housing spots, research spots, etc.). 
Housing is definitely a challenge, but I know plenty of non-freshmen students who currently have university housing. You submit an application and it's basically a lottery. Housing offers will continuously roll out until all spaces have been signed. Also, a lot of students who get offers will choose to decline it due to the fact that it's definitely more pricey than living off-campus and living with friends you meet in your first year appeals to many.

Hopefully this help!
Honestly living in the dorms is more expensive than living off campus anyways so most people want to move out after freshman year. But if you really want to stay in the dorms you can always be an RA
[deleted]
Easy to get in once you're in COE and if you meet the requirements/ The only issue, from what I've heard from those I know doing joint engineering programs is the insanely high courseload - if you're truly passionate about learning and engineering, you'll be fine but if you're doing it for a superficial reason then you will legitimately struggle. My advice: Too early to worry about this. Talk to advisors, come to campus this fall and focus on the holistic college experience, take a class in your preferred second major of interest and then see if you like it and can manage it.

I definitely second taking CS 8/Data 8 your first semester. CS 61A has gotten just a little bit harder each semester, and CS 8 gives you a great introduction to Python, programming, along with a little statistics/data science. It's also much less time-consuming, so it gives you the opportunity to enjoy your first semester more and adjust to university life.
Definitely don't take 61A without prior CS experience. Yes, there are people who have gone in blind and did well, but it's rare. 

Highly suggest dating CS 8 and 10 beforehand.

Think about where st. louis is. Do you really want to live there for 4 years? The midwest is not kind nor is it particularly exciting. I don't recommend young adults to live there. I went to Cal for undergrad and now I'm in michigan. Don't come to the midwest if you don't have to. I don't know one happy person in st. louis, and washu as a school doesn't really impress me either. I would attend UCSC over washu. FWIW, Berkeley has an infinitely better reputation in the professional world.

easy choice.
At Cal, you'll be exposed to a group of people with *significantly* more economic diversity--29% of Cal students receive Pell Grants, while only 11% of students at WashU do. Over 20% of students there come from the top 1%, and ~85% come from the top 20% vs. ~4% and ~50%, respectively, at UC Berkeley. Also, CNR at Berkeley is absolutely wonderful and a very tight-knit community.
I’m going to list it as my first option and pray. However, I’m assuming almost everyone is going to try and get it.
would like to know this to


everyone is admitted to L&S undeclared! you get to declare your major later.
Congrats bud!!! I am in CNR but am not MEB.  I have friends in MEB that rave about their classes though.  CNR is arguably the most close knit college with the best opportunities afforded to the students.  The advisors (staff and peer) are very approachable and extra activities are often hosted by the college to build connections/have fun.  
Professors are lit.  CNR's main building (Mulford) has the advisors, lots of the professor's offices, and also has a nice space for students to study with couches.  10/10 CNR
I was in CNR \(then transferred out to L&S\). CNR is very small! As a bio major in general I can say that there is SO MUCH in terms for you to do in terms of research, study groups, clubs, and workshops. You will not be bored. 
Clark Kerr has its own dining hall and larger rooms. The walk isn't great but there is a bus that takes you down to campus every 30 mins.
Anything you can get into. All of them are going to be expensive/small. Unit1 is considered the best (closest to campus + newest renovation) but whoever you ask will say that the unit they were in was obviously the best.
Clark Kerr or Unit 1. I live in foothill and it sucks ass
Units 1, 2, and then 3, in that order. Southside has the best stuff.
are you talking about FPF? granted my freshman year was like 5 years ago but i really liked it!
FPF is great. Most people i knew in FPF were on my floor even though i wasn't in FPF. They got the full campus experience without the scariness that some experience in the first semester of college 
I'm a freshman and did the normal Fall program (normal berkeley classes). Some of my friends were in FPF (a few berkeley, one SF, but they were all waitlisted for berkeley and were forced into FPF.. I don't know many people who chose to do it (could just be me)
The program is better than UCLA. How am I supposed to quantify how much?  Do you see UCLA here?:

Housing is expensive, you are not guaranteed on-campus but you shouldn't have a problem finding off-campus if necessary.


Food is dope.


Some people are assholes, most people find their own study groups. Some people are competitive, most don't give a shit.


Classes are hard. It's chemical engineering.  There is support for depression.  Being stressed is normal, it's what makes you stronger.


The buildings are old. Gilman Hall, where all the faculty and advising offices is 100 years old. Its beautiful.
+ not a ChemE but our College of Chemistry is insanely good!! ChemE here is notably quite difficult, but I think it's pretty manageable?? from what I understand as well, you make a lot of friends in your major!

+ no, as long as you submit your housing request before the deadline, you'll very, very likely (aka > 98% probability) get university housing, since you're an incoming freshman and pretty much all the dorm space is for incoming freshman.

+ dining halls are mediocre, but if you spend actual money (which, to be honest, is what you'll be spending for the rest of your time here, so it's what matters), there are amazing restaurants literally everywhere!! Berkeley is a college town, and you can find good food of pretty much any cuisine around.

+ it's a difficult school, but p. collaborative in my opinion. it's competitive, but not cutthroat in the slightest--everyone wants to do well, yes, but people are also incredibly willing to help each other. (& the best friendships are forged in fire!!)

+ classes get difficult. people are stressed. but most people build communities around themselves to make that better. also, stress levels vary from week to week, since your extracurricular commitments will also play a large part in that (when people ask me how much sleep I get, I like to say between 2 and 12, since that's honestly an accurate answer for me).

+ buildings honestly vary, even within engineering. again, not ChemE, but within the engineering buildings, you have Hearst Mining Building (which is GORGEOUS and beautiful and old) vs. Sutardja Dai Hall (new & also really pretty). 
You can also just email UCSF professors with a short email detailing your interest in their work. My roommate got a position by emailing professors that he wanted to work with. I got mine the same way, but at Berkeley.

Also, you 100% don't have to know the professor at all to apply. Just find professors whose work _really_ interests you, and send them a cold email! 
UCSF is only one of the labs that offer internships. There are so many labs both at Berkeley and affiliated with Berkeley that you can intern at(in Emeryville etc) Check the following link - its not exhaustive but its a start. Getting a position requires taking initiative, but is very very possible
https://mcb.berkeley.edu/faculty/all

You can waive out of 1 semester of Calc with AP, the R1A requirement with a 4, and R1B requirement with a 5. You can also get out of Econ 1 with a 5 on Macro and Micro. 
Are you good looking? Do you have a healthy physique? Are you rich? Do you have a fun personality? Are you a natural leader? Are you good at conversations? Are you good at making friends? Are you good at partying? Are you good at sports? Is your demographic/background the same as the majority of the members of the Greek organizations you're targeting? 

Those are all factors when it comes to acceptance into Greek Life. Yes they prefer underclassman but if you excel in one or more of the other factors it's not a big issue. Just be prepared to be facetiously called ""Mom"" or ""Dad"".
Nah. What ""danger"" were you imagining?
When I called about it, exact same scenario, they just said cool thanks for letting us know. Don’t sweat it
I can backup /u/givemid , I also dropped a class I said I would complete. Same thing, I just let them know and they were basically like ""oh for sure it's cool man thanks"" and that was it (I also did not need it for IGETC or prerequisites)

Tinder?
Education is your girlfriend, the benefits and fruits of which speak for themselves.
Before transferring into Cal, a lot of the incoming transfers would have get-togethers around Berkeley to get to know one another and make friends before starting the grind. What I noticed is that all of the women that I met were humanities majors - aside from one that was shooting for med school. My advise: expand yourself outside of STEM to meet women. Take classes in humanities, join a club that has nothing to do with CS, or if all fails be a part of the greek system. 
I'm CS and mostly meet people through greek life, a bit through clubs and other organizations, and a bit through meeting friends of friends.
Moving somewhere new is hard, moving out of state, I expect is even harder. Do your best to be open with the people around you and the people back home when you are homesick, tired, confused, and do not bottle it in. Transitions are hard. Change is hard. But these are also the best of times! Berkeley adcoms let you in because they saw something in your app that they believe will be successful in Berkeley and will add to the university! Do your best not to say you just got in because of luck or else that will mess with your mind \(I felt the same way often\). Call friends back home often. Be okay with hating the city and school at first. Hopefully this doesn't happen. Many people, including myself, grow to love Berkeley with time. I hated it at first. Now, I can really see myself living here in the future. The food, people, events, thinking, landscape of this place has really grown on me. Best of luck! WORK HARD AND HAVE FUN. 
Congrats on getting in! 

I wasn't in your situation (from CA, started at Cal as a freshman) but I also struggled with depression and being independent.

For the impostor syndrome and general class struggles, what worked best for me was: a) always go to lecture; b) start assignments early; and c) go to office hours (especially the last one). These are all pretty obvious bits of advice, but at least for me the best predictor of my grades for a given semester was the extant to which I followed these rules. Also: there are no stupid questions in office hours! Ask anything and everything that might help you understand the material. IME professors are very understanding/friendly about it, and it helps them tailor explanations and help. (Er, the exception is CS office hours, so if you're taking CS classes, I'm sorry... go to HKN tutoring?)


For adulting/independence, don't be afraid to lean on your family and friends back home! I was in contact with my parents at least weekly and often daily if I was particularly struggling. I think I was relying on them more than most people (A: depression and B: I am lucky to have really awesome parents), but there were definitely plenty of other students that talked to their parents a lot and got important support from them while in college.
don't take this to heart. skip 1a and 1b don't give it any more thought. no need to waste time doing dumb shit like basic math courses just do 53 or 54 straight depending on what you can enroll in and what works better with your schedule (53 might be easier if you just finished ab and bc). ap lang (granted you got a good ap score like a 5 i think is what you need or 4...idk exactly) will satisfy the ap lang requirement and just give you 4 units not 8 AFAIK. 
Not very much. From what I've seen, 1ab are significantly more painful than calc BC, would recommend saving yourself the pain. I skipped them and haven't had any real issues. 
Take 53 and 54 if you want, but know that you will have to study way harder than you did in high school. Got a 5 with flying colors, struggled a lot in 53 because I thought I could do the same kind of studying and be fine.  
The reason why they say that for chm eng is because the classes you'll take are already difficult, so they don't want you to overload yourself.
Not at all. You aren't going to gain a whole lot out of rehashing single-variable calculus. What's more, taking these classes will make it impossible for a whole yaer to take courses for which the prereq/coreq is 53/54; if you want a more relaxed junior and senior year to better pursue research, internships, etc. then that is much more difficult to achieve by taking math 1AB.

navigating their god awful UI (specifically choice of colors in the filter section), it seems like most are posted late july/early august. i usually look a week before classes start since most have some application process during the first few weeks anyway.
I had 54 with Tataru. He's not a great lecturer but not completely terrible -- you could do a lot worse with math lower divs. Unfortunately I don't know anything about Sethian so can't compare them.
Yes, you should do that, so you don't fall behind. You don't have to do that, but it may save you a lot of stress later if you eventually get into the class.
I can't answer your question, but I just wanna say that you have a cool username
Spring. Give yourself a semester to adjust to college life. 
take it with denero and you wont regret it - the class is going to be relatively difficult no matter what (unless you're a cs god then it doesnt matter)
Most of the I've been programming since I was 5 types take it in fall so the curve is generally better in spring although no guarantees and CS classes are typically not curved exactly the same semester to semester.
Do it whenever you feel ready, the curve doesn't change much. It's basically the same difficulty either way.
keep coming here
Don't worry about it man, LA and Berkeley are peer schools and you'll have every opportunity there. Best of luck, kill it

> I will probably enroll at UCLA, and end up being happy there.

We have better memes here doe.
Sorry to hear that it didn’t work out. I too got rejected, and I agree that it sucks hardcore. Now I’m stuck going to some worthless state school which limited opportunities. California was my dream and, just like all of my other dreams, was broken. 
berkeley>ucla in some cases so you'll be fine. as with everything in life things always seem more glamorous than they are. ucla exceeds berkeley in definitely a few things so should be fine for you
If you want a single room, looking on the FB Housing page is your best bet. There are plenty of people who will be looking for roommates to replace the ones who moved out, or people who found a place and needs people. Expect to pay around $1000 - $1400.

On CL you will find studio apartments mostly, and the ads on the shared housing page aren't guaranteed to be posted by Cal students, if that's something you prefer. If you are considering studio apartments, they will be around the same range but can be costlier. They are sparser than single rooms, too.
there's this place called telegraph commons thats on the corner of telegraph and channing (above what used to be the melt) which is decent and definitely has space still for next fall.  the management is awful but the amenities are good.  it's dorm style living where you have a room and then theres communal bathrooms.  it's a good choice if youre desperate
1. I haven't felt that way, and most of my discussion instructors know me by name. (not true for lecturers)

2. I couldn't get into CS61B this semester, but I attribute that to poor planning on my part. So some classes fill up fast but if you take it just as fast then it shouldn't be a problem.

first year out-of-state btw
It depends completely on your major/college. I'm in CoC and have no problem getting into my major classes.  It is, however, difficult to get into certain BioE and other engineering courses because I don't have priority in that college. Yes, I do feel like just a number to all of the administrative offices - they don't give a shit, honestly.  
You come into L&S undeclared, so it's not that hard. You're going to want to let your advisor know your intentions during the summer advising you'll get as a transfer and they will give you paperwork or explain what you need to do to declare that major.
It may take a while to process.
Same prob. Think it’s because we submit SIR way too early and the site hasn’t been set up properly yet

Probs with CalNet too. Guess we need to wait til April for them to be fixed
cal day is fun. everyone struts their stuff and shows off, i'm pretty sure theres a bunch of free swag you'll probably get. 

Your parents are probably going to be footing the bill for your college experience and even if they're not going to be, they probably appreciate being involved in your life.

Daytripping from LA->Berk and back is really annoying. I wouldn't suggest. If you already driving up, find a hotel somewhere in emeryville and it'll be much cheaper to handle. On the large scale of things, you're talking maybe a couple hundered bucks which is nothing compared to the total cost of your investment in education so I think it's probably a good idea.
It's a day full of school spirit so if you're into that sort of thing, it can be fun. If you're like me and don't like chants and crowds, it may not feel worth it. There are a lot of cool things happening with labs and other parts of campus not normally open to the public being open for tours, but you can easily partake in the 4 Cal Days you'll already be here for!
I would not recommend coming if you've already visited 
Yes, you technically can. Don't.
Yes, but there isn't really a reason for one. I didn't bring mine until I knew I could get parking at my coop junior year, and I mainly just use it when I'm too lazy to wait for the busses we all get for free.
I was wondering the same thing

it's so expensive to have a car since parking is $$$ and hard to find
Definitely is not as cramped or crowded as people say, I love being in a triple cuz that means chances are someone will always be in the room with you. Units 1, 2, and 3 are best.

If they can't change it, at least you can create an alias to use for resumes and such: https://bconnected.berkeley.edu/manage-accounts
Do you have the chance to visit? Spending 3-4 hours at a school isn't a 100% accurate indication of 4 years of collegiate life but atleast it gives you a broad sense of the cultures of either campus and what to expect. Some points off the top of my head:

Caltech - Small private school experience, so more individualized attention. Stronger brand value/prestige due to selectivity and far fewer number of Caltech grads around(idk how much this matters in industry, but it is true), very research and theory focused program. 

Berkeley - top notch programs in CS and math, but the best opportunities are accessed by the top students (someone who got into Caltech imo can stake a claim to be a top Berkeley student, but you still need to work hard), variety of classes, majors, programs, opportunities(clubs/research etc), diverse kinds of people, better connections to industry.

I dont think Caltech is like MIT where going to MIT is an outright better choice - Caltech has really poor social life(their house system - their one source of social life - is also going through some stuff from what i hear), very one-dimensional experiences, classes etc and probably is one of the few schools even harder than Berkeley (they accept no ap credit)

If you're passionate about STEM and are fine with compromising on other experiences Caltech is a better choice, but otherwise imo, Berkeley is the only choice. Post on r/caltech too
If you aren't already sure you want to go to grad school I would not recommend Caltech. It's incredibly good at for research, but limited for everything else.

Also, nothing against Pasadena, but Berkeley is a MUCH funner place to be if you don't have a car.
Berkeley's CS department is significantly stronger than Caltech. Caltech's pure sciences/math is going to be more rigorous than Berkeley's. Except probably Chemistry.

Size of the school is also important. I've gotten research as a high schooler in the San Gabriel Valley area from Caltech but it's going to near impossible to get a reply from any Berkeley professor looking for research without proving you have what it takes first.
Caltech gives out better grades because the first two quarters all classes are pass fail, and essentially every exam your entire time there would be take-home. Also it is nontrivial that their endowment works out to roughly $1m per student, while at berkeley it is about $40k. Berkeley has budget problems
You can certainly find communities here that can carry a conversation in anything of your interest - tech, physics, sports and so forth. I'd say Berkeley certainly is more pre-professional due to the presence of Haas and the EECS/CS culture. (I've visited UPenn and I'd say its vv similar to that)
In Haas, most students here are more driven by GPA, internships, networking and other metrics of success as opposed to a purity of learning. However Econ is the largest major on campus which means you will certainly carve your own experience. There's some great reserch being done here across various relevant departments -Econ,Haas, Psychology etc , and an interested student who takes initiative can get a research opportunity if you like learning. Sociology, History, Philosophy and Polsci have several small seminar based classes(For eg History has around 5-8 such classes every semester) with 25 students, so there's scope for interaction and engagement there. You can 'create' your LAC style environment by associating more with academic circles and less with the professional organizations, clubs etc(but I encourage you to keep an open mind and expore)

LAC's offer a wholly different experience but I do think you can get similar envioronment here by taking the relevant classes, and taking initiative to get into research. THe big advantage of those LAC's is that they will care about you far more than Berkeley will, so if you're not comfortable with taking initiative to succeed(and this is totally okay at 18 years of age) LAC's will give you the individualized attention you need
I would also note that the median family income of students at Oberlin, Reed, and Bryn Mawr is higher than the median income for Berkeley. That being said they also give out much better grades on average than Berkeley. 
I suppose I end up talking about school because I have no life.
[deleted]
nice try 
no, but the floors are mostly mixed gender and you can easily interact with everyone on your floor!
wtf?
Hey I'm a junior in the BioE and MatSci joint major. I came in as BioE, so I think I can give some tips and perspective. 

First, the intro class BioE10 gives a great overview of the field, is taught by an amazing lecturer, and introduces you to most of the other BioEs in your year, so definitely use it to meet people and figure out what parts of BioE interest you. This is pretty important since the major can seem like a grab bag of bio-related engineering applications. Many bioe research labs are heavily focused on EECS, MechE, ChemE, MatSci, and fundamental bio problems, so a lot of people get a minor, do a joint major, or even switch majors (especially to EECS) because of this. However, plenty of people stay in BioE. 

One thing to note is that most BioEs do research, starting around sophomore year, so pay attention during seminar classes and go to office hours to learn about your professors research if it interests you. 
Another piece of advice is that, if you can AP out of a class, do it. Why waste 2 semesters on fundamental calculus that will probably destroy your confidence in your math skills when you can use your extra units to take a semester abroad or get a minor?

Those are the basics that I wish I knew coming in as a freshman. Feel free to ask more questions if you have them.
Bit late on this, but I live there right now so I'll respond.

The distance problem is overrated in my opinion. There's a bus that takes you straight from Clark Kerr to campus every 30 minutes. And the walk isn't bad as well. The only problem is when it's late at night and you're hungry, and you don't want to walk down. But lots of people I know will walk back and forth to CKC between classes without a problem.

The social scene isn't as tight as in the units, where you're extremely close (emotionally and physically) to a lot of people. However, it's more ""social"" in general in my opinion. People are constantly going out to different events. For whatever reason, there is a high percentage of people involved in Greek life who live in CKC. It's just part of the culture. So if that interests you, then I would think about trying for CKC.

What really makes CKC good for me though is the fact that we have our own dining hall, and it's far better than the main one (Crossroads). 
You can (if there is still space in the class), and I had some floormates who did take 61A over the summer. IIRC it worked fine for them. I don't think it gets you much though. Taking 61A with everyone else is a great way to meet/bond with people in your year, and it's not like EECS is a requirement heavy major (it's not unusual to graduate a semester or two early...)
I won’t recommend taking 61A over the summer, but one thing you should consider is getting familiar with/review basic python syntax over the summer (codecademy is pretty good for this purpose). I did this the summer before entering Cal and it really helped. Especially if you are L&S and need to meet the GPA threshold, takes away a lot of stress for freshmen year.
don't do it enjoy your summer
Yikes even if you can (don't know the logistics) I would not suggest that. Enjoy your summer before Berkeley. After college, you will rarely have ""free vacations"" like this! Spend some time with your friends before you all part ways. 
This topic has been asked to death on this thread already. In short, both are large public schools and your experience depends on you - several EECS majors take it relatively chill, join Greek life, join campus organizations, exercise and work out etc, and they still get great opportunities. It requires really good time management and productivity while working - if you aren't good at this yet, you will learn to develop these skills, which is a great ancillary benefit of going here. Note that although EECS classes are challenging and time consuming, it is one of the lighter engineering degrees in terms of courseload, and can be finished in 3 or 3.5 years - so if you want to take a chill courseload, that is possible. You don't have to take a super - rigorous courseload, advanced graduate classes, strive for a really high GPA, do research, TA classes etc if you don't want to - although you should be open to some of this too, imo.

UCLA CS isn't a cakewalk either; it's a top program with smart and competitive students, and will have a lot of the challenges of a large public school that Berkeley has. It's not a stress free haven or whatever - both places will be challenging. Objectively, Cal CS is better and unless you have strong firsthand reasons to believe you'd be happier there, Berkeley is the better choice
Please tell me your source of information wasn’t UCBMFET
It's really not, people have plenty of free time. 
Berkeley EECS is the top CS program in the world tied only with MIT, Stanford and CMU. Basically, choosing anything less will be consciously choosing a worse education, for a similar amount of money. Don't do it. A lot of people come here and graduate just fine, with healthy social life and everything. 
If you're gunning for a perfect GPA/want to get into high tier research labs then EECS will be stressful. That's a given for nearly any school at any major, but Berkeley feels it the most since the faculty here are literally world-leading experts in their fields and there are so many good students. 

That said there are a LOT of people who aren't 4.0 gunners/aren't trying to get into Stanford/MIT/Berkeley grad school who have very fruitful social lives. Which type are you?
It's what you make it to be. There are obviously those stereotypical EECS people, but I know plenty of extroverted and social guys who are EECS. 
Not at all. If you don’t say anything, most people won’t even know. I know plenty of people in clubs and in Haas that we’re FPF. The pre req’s aren’t heavy and can easily be done in 1.5 years 
Given your emphasis on music, the only reason I could see preferring Berkeley to the other two is a) you really like the campus and econ program much better or b) accessibility to music programs for non-majors (basically the same thing I said in reply to your earlier post).

I **know** UCLA marching band is open to non-majors because I had multiple HS classmates do marching band there while majoring in other things (including Econ I think!). I don't know about the Jazz band, so make sure to check its rules before making your decision.

On my first point, I strongly encourage you to visit campuses if you can before making your decision. You want to make sure you at least don't hate the campus and atmosphere before committing, and campus visits can tell you a lot that you can't get from online resources.

That said, it sounds like you know what you want and have done your research. I agree with u/salestoconsulting1 that UCLA sounds like a better fit for your interests. But whichever school you choose, I hope you make some great music there :)
If music is a top priority then obviously go with UCLA bc you will probably feel more at home there but for long term goals, Cal is amazing at placing you into a good consulting firm. It’s essentially idolized on campus, with around 30+ consulting clubs on campus
You can definitely graduate in 3 years if you want to - disregard the other guy's reply.

And Cal >>>>> USC. Like, wtf?
Yeah the environment is cutthroat and hard but if you put in the effort, the internship opportunities are much greater with Cal on your resume as opposed to USC
It's extremely difficult to declare CS through L&S because you actually need a 3.3 GPA in CS61A, CS61B, CS61C and CS70. The average grade distribution is around 3.075, and people who are taking 61C and 70 tend to be students trying to major in CS. So almost all of the students are trying extremely hard to get good grades. I would not recommend coming here for CS unless you have significant CS experience.
I'm not studying at Berkeley right now, but I think graduating in 3 years for CS in Berkeley is not plausible or healthy (even with a buttload of AP credits).
Take business and econ classes, join business related clubs(consulting/finance/entrepreneurship), just try getting involved in the business community - that's far more important than a Haas degree.
Haas does not offer a business minor
no
are you interested in people who do A) social justice work in politics/NGOs/startups or B) people who have worked in senior positions in previous administrations? The majority of speakers fall into one of those two categories.
Don't take a physics class with Charman. I was warned about him beforehand but didn't take the warnings to heart. One of my biggest Berkeley mistakes. But besides him I've enjoyed every other physics professor that I've had here. Welcome! 
>How does the program stack up against the other UC’s (LA, SD, SB, SC, Irvine)?

Cal is higher ranked (though rankings aren't as important as people make them out to be) and the physics majors I've talked to all seemed to think Berkeley was obviously the better program (though most of them were Berkeley students so they might be biased :P). I can't tell you about specific differences in the programs. I know I've seen all six schools featured in science publications/news stuff, so all have noteworthy research.

If you know what specific field in physics you want to pursue (and especially if you are planning on grad school), I would select schools based on research labs/professors you want to work with. As a transfer you don't have as much time to get research experience, so planning ahead now might help a lot.
Hey, I am not a student at Berkeley but I did get accepted on Friday. I was super paranoid I did something wrong during the process so I spent a LOT of hours on the phone and email with all of the UC campuses counselors. I asked them the same question about UCSD (because I got waitlisted there) and they said that the truth is that no one knows exactly. There was an investigation recently (I will try and find the news report) that said colleges are basically abusing waitlist's : they are putting like 3000 kids on the waitlist and admitting 120. Of course, like I said, no one knows FOR sure but from my extensive talks with various counselors, the general consensus is that no one has a clue. I hope that sort of helped ease your mind about the issue. They do not release that kind of statistic because of the aforementioned controversy I think. AGAIN please take what I am saying with a grain of salt. I am NOT a UC staff member or even a student at Cal (yet!) but I have talked to more than 20 counselors and they all said the same thing! Let me know if I can help you with anything else !
[deleted]
Both good schools; despite the hype about competition I personally have found research opportunities very accessible. Some of my close friends who are psych majors are doing research in the Psych or even Haas and other related departments(consumer psychology, etc). It requires taking initative, approachin profs and grad students, and applying to URAP and other programs but I'm confident you'll be able to get one pretty soon. GPA-wise, Psychology classes-most of them- are curved to A-/B+ which isn't bad at all and I think UCLA has the same grading scheme. Overall choose wherever you'd fit in but all else equal I'd recommend Cal
After scanning their [website](https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/graduate/admissions), it doesn't look like the Math department offers an accelerated master's program so it looks like UCLA may be the better fit if you're truly inclined on obtaining your master's ASAP. Personally, if I was a math major, I'd probably choose UCLA over Cal either way just to have the opportunity to watch Terry Tao in action.

Congrats on your admissions and good luck!
Is the departmental scholar program a done deal? I don't think you should base your decision off of that; there's a strong chance you may not qualify for that. Berkeley math does have their own honors programs as well
They do?! Oof.
2. Food is average to below average. If you are lazy (like me) and have a dull sense of taste (also me), getting a meal plan would be most convenient. If one or more of these don't apply to you, cook instead.
For housing look for the Berkeley housing Facebook groups asap. Housing here is super competitive and annoying. Don't bother getting a meal plan youll be stuck eating at the same place everyday and it's not even cheaper. I'm meche but idk what advice to give unless you have specific questions. 
In terms of housing location, you would probably be most interested in staying Northside. All the engineering buildings are clustered in the same area, along Hearst Ave, right next to the Foothill residence hall. 

Other places close to campus are downtown and Southside, these are closest to Sproul Plaza but are going to be more like a 20ish minute walk (uphill) to the engineering buildings. Usually you can catch a bus, all students get free fares on AC Transit buses. The 52 goes right up Hearst. These tend to be more like high-rise apartment buildings, especially Downtown.

You can also look into the co-ops, there are quite a few Northside and very close to campus. However, there tends to be a large waitlist to get into one of the co-ops. More info at https://www.bsc.coop/
Welcome to Cal!

Check your CalCentral Academics page for your enrollment times for Phase I, Phase II, and Adjustment. The times will range from July - August I think. Each of these phases have a unit cap. You can enroll in classes up to that unit cap.

Find out what classes you should take for your major by looking at sample 4-year plans (guide.berkeley.edu). Plan your schedule and use BerkeleyTime for stats for each class. Use Schedule Planner on CalCentral to plan out the times for your classes.

After you decide on a schedule, export those classes to your enrollment page. When your enrollment time comes, you can enroll in classes by clicking on the Add link under the Class Adjustment tab on the Academics page. You should decide which classes you should enroll in for Phase I by which classes tend to fill up fast.

This isn't too detailed, so let me know if you need more clarification on something.
[deleted]
Have you asked administration about this? It is possible to extend how long you stay for double majors.
[deleted]
1. A lot of people find roommates through FB, but there are a lot who also go random. Whatever floats your boat.
2. MCB is hard. There's a lot to go into about what to expect, so let me know if you have specific questions. I've just about finished all the lower div requirements.
4. Housing is expensive, but you can always find cheap places if you look proactively. Dining hall food can become boring quickly, but restaurants near campus are great. The prices are what you'd find in LA.
5. As a person from SoCal, I very much miss the warm weather. It's been in the 60s here for weeks now. In the winter there's relatively more rain too.
Congrats on getting into Berkeley!

1) Randoms is fine. You don't need to be best buds with your roommate(s), you just need to live with them. 

2) Grades here are lower than at other colleges. That's just life at Berkeley. Just put in the time to understand the material and you'll be fine.

3) You'll encounter smokers, but it's not very prevalent. 

4) Protestors/homeless are pretty common, but usually they'll just be noisy. I mean, if you're at a dining hall, no need to worry about food. I'd say an average meal outside would run you ~$10+ There're good boba places, though a lot are trash...

5) Weather is weird. It hailed twice this semester. Definitely less sunny than SoCal, but during the summer/spring you get your fair share of cloudless days.
for CS unless you have a really strong reason otherwise you should pick Cal by far. Cost differences will be marginal and you should make enough money upon graduation, so that's a wash imo
Start now and look broadly. Don’t limit yourself to just the immediate area surrounding the campus. I’d also look into West Berkeley, El Cerrito, Albany, and Oakland. 

Aggressively look. Most people get their apartments late februrary through may, i.e way earlier than now. The housing market is pretty awful, you need to start looking that early (which isn't reasonable for transfers who don't even know if they're coming here, I know, but that's how the market goes).

You should be trying to find something ASAP.
Agree with others, aggressively look. Not worth trying a sublet and banking on a permanent opening later because it probably won't happen. 
Hard but not impossible, and worth a shot. Email reshall
It’s pretty hard 
Don't worry it's almost impossible not to get into 61a. On the other hand, course load might be rough. Try to stick to 2 techs until you're sure you can handle more.
Chem 4a and math 53 can both be a lot of work. Maybe save cbe 40 for a future semester and instead do a breadth class? 
The price is already included in your tuition. You don't have to do anything.

Also how crowded they are depends on when you go/what day it is. More obscure hours like late night will be less crowded. I'd recommend you to take advantage of the free 45 minute session with a personal trainer who gives you a tour and answers any questions you may have.

P.S. Don't be self conscious, people really don't care, you're trying to better yourself, if anything they will try to help you if you need it
It's free, first day of school just swipe your Cal 1 card. Very crowded 2-5, even with ~10 power racks. I still go this time tho since I like going as soon as class finishes haha.
If you're a student, it's free, but if I remember correctly I think you still need to add it your cart? They just don't charge you money
You won't be that guy. We've all paid to be there with our tuition dollars, we're all trying to better ourselves. 
The school can be quite competitive, especially in impacted majors like CS, however English is not nearly as bad. In addition it is worth noting that UCLA is also a very competitive school, so either way expect more pressure than you are used to in High School.
I have seen 0 cut throatedness. Tho my major is pretty far off from English, so not sure how relevant my experience will be. (Eecs)
My best friend was an English major transfer student. My impression is that she found the other English majors to be a very supportive community. She complained about a lot of things, but never the other students :P
That’s a common misconception. I do physics and Astrophysics and nobody does this petty shit because it’s not useful for anyone 
I'm doing a minor in English, so I'm familiar with the coursework, the department and some of the students in it. Just like the rest of the humanities, it's a very interesting major with well run and small-ish classes, great professors, good student-prof interaction and lots of learning. The environment is really supportive and the grading is very manageable, honestly. The content is challenging - far more than anything you've done in high school -  so prepare to work hard and learn a lot. However, it's a friendly and supportive community. Besides, humanities majors have enough time to fully immerse themselves in the Cal community and join greek life/coops/clubs/ec and fully commit to that too. I wouldn't worry about cut-throat or competitive culture at all. Make your decision based on other factors
Frankly, it's extremely hard but not cutthroat. Ask anyone for help and they'll provide it. **Definitely go to office hours** and take advantage of other resources.  
No, other students won't sabotage you. Stories you hear about it are few and far between, and only prove that the world sometimes  has assholes and Berkeley is not an exception. Most students are cooperative.
Yes, there are enough lockers for everyone on the floor. The good ones (not too high or low) get occupied quickly so get one asap when you move in.
I know a lot of people have, even with only 61A experience and about to take 61B. It's mostly about interview experience, with websites such as leetcode and HackerRank -- 61A teaches enough skills to interview in Python, and 61B teaches the information primarily used in interviews after freshman year. 

Google EP and other big companies are aware of your standing and classes, and will take that into account when you're interviewing. 
I've heard they're completely and utterly useless. 
If you pick an easy one it can be good for gpa but otherwise they are a waste of time. Like groot said, just useless
They're not

IMO they're not particularly useful. There are plenty of english/creative writing courses that cover a variety of topics and if you're particularly worried, you can pick one that sounds interesting. Depending on your major, you might still have some writing assignments anyways. 
It'll be hard because the classes are time consuming and difficult but that's just how Berkeley is. 3 techs is pretty normal for a stem major, but that doesn't mean it'll be easy. If you're worried maybe have a backup class so you can easily drop one of them if need be. 
As a first semester freshman you definitely want to have time to meet other people and have fun. 3 techs is fairly manageable but personally I would switch Math 53 for a breadth.
IB takes a more macro perspective on biology, whereas MCB is more micro, but I think you can get that from the names already. There are more premeds in MCB and most take the CDB emphasis since it's the easiest. Premeds in IB take the human bio track. MCB has a lot more emphasis, but IB only has two. Premeds who worry a lot more about their grades major in IB since their upper divs are much easier compared to those of MCB. These are the only differences I know and most of them involve premeds, but I hope you got the gist of it.
Well there's the obvious that the upper div courses are different. In my experience I feel like the majority of people in MCB are premed, but with IB there's some more variety you could say. This is just based on the people I've met though.

It's relaxing for sure. Just make sure you actually are spending those mornings getting work done, otherwise you'll just straight up have less time in the day to do any work.
It sounds a lot more relaxing than morning schedules. I think I personally prefer getting all my classes out of the way so my schedule’s free for the rest of the day
my schedule is like this for this yr (jr). every day basically from 12 onwards. my friend has all class 8-11. both have pros and cons; you'll be fine. if you wake up late then it allows you to stay up later without compromising net sleep but does give you the option to do stuff in the morning
edit: personally it is more flexible since if you want to sleep in some day either because you stayed up late or whatnot you can. the people I know who had an option of early vs. late and chose early regretted it (at least the people I know). some people don't have any choice...some classes only offered at 8 (econ and ugba and language classes come to mind). 
Do you mean divide between your roommates? or dividing your clothes between the different drawers/closet?
I really really recommend working out space with them in advance. I lived in a unit 2 triple and there were 2 closets and 2 chests of 3 drawers as well as 2 drawers under the bunkbed. We divided the drawers as evenly as possible and each took half a closet, with the last half-closet reserved for coats, misc things, and actually our microchill unit.
I don’t see why not. Every URAP project is going to expect something different from you- so just read the details for the one(s) you’re applying for and make sure you fit the bill. 
Yes! This isn't what you asked but also never underestimate the power of talking to/emailing professors that aren't working with URAP -- the URAP positions have tons of applications and there might be a PI outside of URAP doing some research that aligns better with your interests.
Called the housing office about this, and as long as its after move-in, you can just send it to unit 3 and they'll accept the package for you and send you and email that it's arrived
If it's a major elective, you should be ok. I was going to P/NP Econ demog, but I think I'll just pull the B/B+. My advisor said not to just to have flexibility as a senior. I'm a transfer, so I don't have the luxury of time like I would have, if I were here for 4 years. I'm an EEP, btw. 

Sorry if I seem like a jerk, trying to P/NP to avoid a B. I also don't like the class too much because the lecture isn't the greatest. It's not a hard class to get a B in, but like most things here, it's hard to get an A, of course.
On that note, what are the limitations on taking upper div courses P/NP?
It's what you make it to be. And this goes for every university out there. Meet new people, hang out with them outside of class, join study groups and clubs. That's how you experience social life.

If you've heard things about how students here are over-achievers and don't socialize at all, that is not true. They exist, but they are not at all the majority.
[deleted]
You can design your schedule to be whatever you want it to be, although most people either keep all their classes in a huge block or space them out evenly. Personally I prefer to space them out because I'm most productive between classes, but it depends from person to person.

Courses usually have a lecture component and a discussion component (plus lab sometimes), or they just have a discussion. Each of these are usually an hour long, except for labs which are 3-4hours for EE/Chem/etc but 1.5hrs for CS.
Classes in general are either 1 or 1.5 hr sessions. The once-a-week classes can be 3. You will also have ""section"" with a graduate student or advanced undergraduate once or twice a week for an hour.

You can build your schedule however you like. Some of my friends really liked being in class a few hours every day. Some preferred a full day T/Th. Your first year as a freshman you will probably have a more packed year because the classes you take generally involve more class-time.
Hey I'm a current ChemE major at Berkeley. You're generally right in that ChemE is gonna be a lot of math and engineering and not very much chemistry. You'll take CBE 40 during your first semester, which is a pretty easy class that'll help you decide whether you really do like the subject, and if you don't, you can pretty easily transfer to another major.

Job opportunities for ChemEs are definitely out there. The industry isn't booming like computer science is, but if you're a pretty good student and spend some of your time doing internships/research/extracurriculars while in college, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a job, especially with a Berkeley degree. I really like that ChemE is a super versatile degree, so you can go into traditional process engineering, biotech, materials science, semiconductors, or many other fields. Definitely PM me if you have any other questions.
You should probably do well in those AP tests that will transfer into college credit, so that you can skip the relevant course(s) and have more time to pursue electives, a minor, etc. I don't think rescinding due to AP scores is something to worry about.
no they won't! 
It won’t get you rescinded but doing well on AP tests can help you test out of a lot of the campus requirements (I didn’t have to take any R&C courses coming into Cal and my AP calc scores satisfied my major’s math requirement)
tbh odds are slim that you'll the decision reversed unless you have a dope connection or are ready to donate a kajillion dollars to the school.  sorry mate :(
Something like a major update since submitting your application may help, like an award.
If you take each of the pre-reqs (61A, 61B, 70) one-by-one and focus on them solely, with adequate time for learning and exam preparation, then there's not much stress -- not sure if that helps.

Only about 40% of people declare but it’s not stressful since there is a new majoring coming out this semester called Data Science. You take almost all the same classes as CS but specialize in data, machine learning, and AI
Depending on your background (not just CS experience, but background in like being resilient, emotional strength) it can vary a lot. I very nearly didn’t declare, went through insane levels of stress and anxiety (for a number of reasons). 

Made it through in the end and the whole experience made me who I am today, and I think personally I’m definitely better for it and feel way more equipped to handle life as a whole (not just CS/academics!). But can def see how it’s not for everyone.

And there are for sure people who don’t have much stress over it at all, and there are also people who over-normalize unhealthy levels of stress :( 

Basically the whole experience can vary a lot, and I am very big on the whole “it’s what you make it” attitude towards life. 

This is all super ramble-y, but hope it helps and best of luck! 
CS 61A

Breadth Class

Some L&S students take EE 16A and CS 61A concurrently, but you really don't have to, especially if you want to spend a lot of time focusing on CS 61A. Also if you don't come in with AP Calculus credit then you could replace a breadth with Math 1A/1B. And if you come in with a 5 on AP Lit then you don't need to do R & C in the College of Letters & Sciences.

Check out cheeseboard. But there are plenty of places you can go to offcampus. Offcampus is the same distance as any option ""on-campus"" so it's worthwhile to explore a bit outwards
Pappys if you want to watch any sports while eating
you just have to meet the GPA cap. its not trivial, but definitely doable.
For the past few years, Berkeley has accepted quite a few people off of the waitlist. You can find the data [here](https://opa.berkeley.edu/campus-data/common-data-set). 

Fall Program for Freshman is worth it in my opinion, especially if it means you'll be able to attend. I have many friends that were FPF last semester, and it really has made no difference except they had a smaller selection of courses offered. Classes were also smaller and not on-campus. I have yet to meet someone from Global Edge so I will abstain from speaking on that.

Congratulations on waitlist, it still is a huge achievement! Go bears!
Being spring admitted was a blessing for me and allowed me to get a better idea about myself/life in the outside world during my 'gap semester.' If your home life isn't terrible, take the blessing Cal has given you (that is if you get off the waitlist, good luck!) and explore interests that you may have not had time for.
We have 3 different male soccer teams at Cal all of which are highly competitive.  There is the actual NCAA team which is d1.  You won't be able to make that as a walk-on.  There are also the 2 club teams: A team and B team. There is an extensive tryout process for both which, like i said, is highly competitive.  A team is for the stars, B team is for the stars that are slightly less shiny (you have to be really really good cuz our school is huge and there are so many solid players lurking about).  Both teams travel to games throughout the state - it is a big time commitment but a great way to build community.  If you are very serious about the game, definitely get info about club soccer.  If you want to focus more on your academics your first year, I highly recommend intramural sports first and then looking into club later on.  I hope this helps! (Sorry I don't know much about girl's soccer)

Economics is a mix of theoretical and practical stuff about the economy.

Haas is business. More about career preparation.
So by studying in Haas I assume you mean the undergraduate business major. You have to apply to Haas in your sophomore year after taking most of the prerequisites. It’s pretty competitive but the Econ major has the same pre-reqs which is why most people will have Econ as their backup major if they don’t get into Haas. 

In general they’re obviously different majors which means you learn different things once you get into the electives and upper div requirements. Haas has a lot of resources for undergrad students and they get priority registration for any UGBA courses, some of which are really cool. 
Visit both, that's an absolute must - very different cultures and that's what you should decide based on. Academic and Post-grad opps will be similar at both for the average student, though the top students can get more out of Cal due to it's superior research opportunities/networks
Berkeley Physics™ major here - choose Berkeley.
One has more STEM-oriented bullshit requirements, the other is more humanities-oriented.  Actual major coursework is identical.  Employers don't give a shit about the second letter.
The engineering department covets the B.S. which is why it uses it for eecs, if you take cs in L&S you get a B.A. no one will ever discredit you if you have either one and if they do, you shouldn't deal with them anyways. I think Haas gives out B.S. for business just because they can.

The classes are literally the same for can though. Unless you're interested more in the ee side of things, the L&S program is essentially identical 
If you are deciding between another college with a similar ""ranking"" as Berkeley in CS or EE, I think the workload and program will be similar to Berkeley's. As with the other comment, proximity to large tech companies in the Bay area and connections through Alum and faculty will make the transition to industry easier than schools that are not as close or not as well renowned. This allows for more opportunities for people to get more experience through jobs or internships early on. Just my 2 cents

EECS Major, 2nd year
Good rep, good location makes it easier to find jobs. Faculty are generally very accomplished, and getting to know them is possible but up to you.  Research is great but not common among undergrads.  Coursework is hard, resources (advising, job placement, etc) are limited.  Not all sunshine and roses but it's a good stepping stone to industry and you really do learn an ass-ton.
MechE here. Lower-div classes are weeders, so expect pretty harsh grading. Even if you were top dog in your high school, be prepared to be surprised. Classes are no longer walks in the parks, and your fellow students are going to be more intelligent and driven than ones you've ever seen, so you have to be ready to push yourself to stay afloat.

Engineering clubs are everywhere, so you're usually sure to find your own niche. Most of them are very accepting of freshmen, so you wouldn't have to worry about that. Connections can be made pretty well in your classes, as you're sure to find a study group of peers without going too much out of your way. 

Also memes. 
You should be fine on that class. You can email if you want, but it shouldn't affect you.


Everyone who is in L&S goes in undeclared. You need a 3.0 (or 3.3, can't remember) in certain lower-division classes to officially declare a CS Major. 


A C- is not grounds for a rescind. You'll be fine there too.

Good luck.

There are a bunch of really sweet Christian clubs on campus.  You will not have a problem finding a space to practice your religion in and friends to enjoy it with!  
Hey buddy, political science major and fourth-year student here.


Concerning the advantages and disadvantages more particularly of the political science major:

Advantages:

Class materials usually have a reasonable degree of intellectual balance. Professors and instructors usually try to incorporate literature from a variety of different sources and positions (although some professors you may find bear very particular leanings). It may be that I am not too sensible concerning such things, but I haven't found many professors to push their own views as academic doctrine - their own views usually emerge incidental to the teaching (and sometimes emerge incredibly strongly). 

Political Science classes are classified into subfields - Political Theory, International Relations, Quantitative Analyses, American Politics, and Comparative Politics. This makes it easy for you to customize a curriculum and plan that may suit your needs and interests.

It is a reading-intensive major. You will read reams and reams of material, which is a good thing if you are enjoy reading different arguments. 

Disadvantages:

I am projecting quite heavily, but: political science majors can be quite obnoxious. You'll run into some who cannot keep quiet about their latest government internships, or whatever exciting and noble work they've done. It's irritating when it appears that such things are all that they can talk about. Many students like to hear themselves speak and will ask questions - in lectures and in discussion - the answers to which may appear obvious or irrelevant. I pointed this out to a friend in the same major, and she said that it's part of the system - you need to stand out to the professor if you want to ask him for a letter of recommendation, is what she said.

There is a lot of reading. Reams and reams. Some professors and GSIs (graduate student instructors who lead classroom-setting discussions that are apart from the professor-taught lectures) will try to provide tips concerning how to read or skim the material. My perennial dilemma is that I feel like I am cheating myself out of the intricacies of the argument and of the satisfaction of simply doing all the reading if I skip - not like that's saying much, because I simply just do not do much of the reading anyway. My point is this: that you will be expected to read and read and read - which makes me believe concerning myself that coming out of Berkeley as a Political Science (and Legal Studies) major, I have no marketable or noteworthy skill other than reading text.

I personally have not found much of the material among all the classes to overlap. In the Legal Studies department, for example, many of the classes will have students read material that they have read in other classes within that major. There's quite a bit of material and literature in common, be they court cases, political or legal philosophers and theorizers, etc. I have not found that to be the case in Political Science. It's too eclectic, particularly in light of the division into subfields. 

I personally think it is a hard major. This, of course, is highly subjective, and what is hard for me may not be so for you. My friend from above told me that it is hard because the professors want to prove political science as a real science. 


Concerning political atmosphere:

You have nothing to worry about at all. I have not found there to be any question of being accepted or fit in. The company you make depends on your personality, those persons whom you meet in your classes and around campus, etc. I'm uncertain what you are envisioning a ""political environment"" to be, though. There are political-minded and -oriented groups on campus, and these groups and clubs will, like other groups and clubs, advertise themselves on Sproul Plaza, hand out promotional flyers, etc. That's really as political as it gets. Now, there have been some hiccups within the past four years - the Milo Yiannapoulos protests, the Antifa or anarchist ravages, that time that a lamp on campus was set ablaze, that time when some students prevented their midterm from starting and in the course of their protest told the professor in front of all the students to ""check his privilege"" (or something to that effect), those times when some students strung themselves into human chains to prevent ingress and egress through Sather Gate (the major thoroughfare on the south side of campus), vegans who lock themselves in cages to make their points, etc etc. These things, though, are really minor annoyances for the most part - drama, really.  There are students of all fashions here - liberal, conservative, really really liberal, really really conservative (probably). 

Concerning religion:

There are many, many Christian clubs and groups (""fellowships"") on college, so you shouldn't feel too left out. There are plenty of churches around campus - from the top of my head: there is a Catholic parish, a Methodist one, an Episcopal one, a Lutheran (don't know which synod or sect, though), a Presbyterian one (don't know whether PCA or PCUSA, though) in the immediate vicinity. If you are Eastern Orthodox, I'm not sure if there's a nearby parish but do know that there is indeed some sort of ""fellowship."" The clubs seem overwhelmingly to be non-denominational (pan-denomination, perhaps, is a better word) or Evangelical. I don't think any Catholic or Eastern Orthodox groups have much of a presence, though they do have clubs - nor do the Mainline Protestants (Methodist, Episcopal, ELCA, etc etc) vis-a-vis specific or particular student organizations. I don't know, I'm personally wary of campus Christian fellowships (a lot of projection going on here, I'm sure). In any event, you're sure to find some sort of Christian community here.

Some general advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:

Many of the lecture halls are very pretty (Some are quite hideous, but they're the minority).

The flora on campus are quite pretty.

You get a shiny brand-name degree at the end (BIG advantage. This is the only and sole thing that makes attending this school bearable for me).

Disadvantages:

A cold, impersonal campus culture. Students don't look you in the eye when you pass them on campus or on the street. Nobody excuses himself when bumping into you or accidentally getting in your way. Few seem to smile at persons that they don't know. Students here are just very rude.

Enormous and impersonal classes.

The gym's weight rooms are pitifully inadequate vis-a-vis size and equipment.

Homeless persons on the the streets in the vicinity and on the very campus.

In light of the social science classes I have been in and am currently in (political science and legal studies): classes are too fast-paced on the whole. One hardly has time to internalize and digest all the literature and readings and studies before new material and content is introduced. It's break-neck speed and is exhausting and distressing (at least for me). I was unprepared, and after having been here for four years, have not yet adjusted. 

Hope this little harangue of mine has helped you out. I will not say ""Go Bears!"" because it is trite. 








 

There is actually, there's a conflict form that you just need to fill out, but I'm not exactly sure where to find it.
Oh yeah I didn't even think about finals conflicting. I wanted to take them together too, but it looks like they are scheduled to be at [the same time](http://registrar.berkeley.edu/scheduling/academic-scheduling/final-exam-guide-schedules). I'm guessing we won't be allowed to request an alternate final time for that?
depends on what you're majoring in. there are three intro math sequences: 16, 10, and 1, for social sciences, life sciences, and engineering/physical sciences respectively. the difficulty also varies based on the sequence.
Stat 133. Frankly, I don't think the class is worth taking at all for someone with your background except as an easy GPA booster - if you've done 61A, you'll know everything in 133 except how to program in R, which you can pick up in two weeks by yourself.
Stat 133 fills up very quickly. From my memory so does 134 but I think you're more likely to phase two that than 133. 
If it counts as a third year of spanish yes. I did basically the same thing and it got listed as spanish 3 on my highschool transcript and i was in the clear.

An adviser will now for sure and you can probably find out online as well. You also have until you graduate to take foreign language, you do not need to take it your first year.
Haven't had to take those classes myself, but you can use this website to see how fast classes fill up.
https://www.berkeleytime.com/enrollment/
100% test out of your classes. No need to redo a class you can skip. If you're good enough/passionate enough about CS, you'll be able to meet the gpa requirement. 
Sometimes the later classes are actually a little easier. Like I think it’s fair to say that skipping math 1B if you can, and going straight to 54, is easier than taking 1b.
my advice: test out of everything you can (look up what you can test out of though), AP courses are much easier (you have a whole year to prepare) and it can only help you in having a more ""free schedule"" in which you can choose classes you really want to take instead of required/prereq classes
eecs is basically the same major & you take all the same classes as eecs except for physics and multivariable calculus!! p. sure cs and eecs both get access to upper div ee courses as well. there's functionally no difference between the majors.
You still take a lot of overlapping classes. It doesn't hurt to figure out if you even like CS before committing to EECS. I've seen people go both ways but more people going away from EECS.

You've got plenty of time to make that decision and you don't have enough information to know for sure.
https://portal.housing.berkeley.edu/

If you have a CalNet ID assigned, you can log in here to do your housing application for dorms. Deadline's in May, so you don't have to worry that much about it yet.

As for classes, registration usually begins sometime over the summer, after everyone has SIR'd. 
Quite a few people who come into CS at Cal have 0 experience (it's hard but they get by) --  you shouldn't be scared away by the rigor.  Also, there's nothing like Berkeley CS -- sooooo much more respected than UCI CS
[deleted]
I totally get the intimidation factor; my own path to declare here has been somewhat a roller coaster. 

Honestly, even if you’re worried or intimidated, I  would recommend giving it a shot. Even all the “fallbacks” or backup plans here I think put you in an amazing position if industry is your goal; if research is more what you’re after, there probably aren’t many places better to be than Berkeley.

I like talking about my own experience so feel free to PM me if you’re interested! 😅
I don't know anything about the first question, but for the second question: you tend to have a lot of flexibility in setting up your schedule, so you can *mostly* avoid 8ams if that's a priority. When you cant: a) if you get a late enrollment slot and all the other sections are full; b) if it's a class with only one lecture and the professor schedules it for 8am.

In CS, b) mostly doesn't happen (because CS professors don't like being in class that early either I guess?), and a lot of people who get stuck in early sections due to a) just don't show up. Not recommended... but that's where your story comes from.

In physics, I think you have less flexibility with labs but they are *mostly* not scheduled at 8am. I'm not sure about general trends in lectures. You can check for yourself by searching the course catalog if its publically available (sorry I forget where it is now, I think someone post a link earlier in this thread).  [Edit: and you can also check UCLA's class schedules to compare.]

The others who've replied have mentioned taking CS 10 and Data 8 if you have little to no experience in coding, but I would also like to mention that there are plenty of students in CS 61A who don't have prior experience and are doing well in the class (I am an example). There are plenty of resources, help, and even dis/lab sections specifically for people who have little/no experience. If you think you can handle the rigor and don't want to fall behind a semester by taking CS10 or Data8, consider taking 61A right away.
You could take cs61a over the summer before freshman year starts. I know a bunch of people who did that followed by 61b+cs70 in the fall and then 61c+cs170 in the spring. This is nice because you get all the important lower division requirements out of the way in the first year which really frees up your schedule. 

You also make friends with a lot of people before school starts which is nice. All the new students over the summer are in the same dorm and you get to know people who you have stuff in common with, given that only some people would even want to start college early. 
Yes! (It isn't really that mandatory anyways...) Just reach out to them and explain. Also, August 15th is just the start of the semester for the administration. The start of instruction, Wednesday the 22nd, is what you should pay attention to/worry about.

I’m just a newly admit as well but I remember back in December I was talking to somebody on tinder who went to cornell and they said choosing cornell over Berkeley was the biggest regret of his life. Bc Cornell’s apparently in the middle of nowhere and the weather is gloomy and makes you depressed haha. Not my opinion but thought I could share :)
chose berkeley over cornell and honestly don't regret it at all--cornell is in the middle of nowhere. washu, imo, will not provide nearly the same diversity of experience that cal will--[over 20% of students there come from the top 1%](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/washington-university-in-st-louis).
Made a similar choice two years ago (Berkeley, Duke,Cornell, Gatech) and I'm happy with it, although my major is different than yours. I'll offer a different perspective on Cornell - my two high school friends who go there like it for most of the year, although it does get depressing and lonely at times - the weather and isolation of the place aren't very great. It is possible to enjoy your time there  but it is very easy to get bored. On the other hand at Berkeley there are just as many opportunities(clubs,organizations,greek life) to socialize, plus the better weather and access to modern civilization(SF, bay area, etc) that Cornell lacks. 

Reputation/opportunity wise equally similar so base it on the vibe. Visit if possible. ANd yeah WashU is way too preppy and the awesome dorms paper over the other issues students have with the school
I am in CNR but am not MEB. I have friends in MEB that rave about their classes though. CNR is arguably the most close knit college with the best opportunities afforded to the students. The advisors (staff and peer) are very approachable and extra activities are often hosted by the college to build connections/have fun.
Professors are lit. CNR's main building (Mulford) has the advisors, lots of the professor's offices, and also has a nice space for students to study with couches. 10/10 CNR
I'm a CE major freshman. Here's a plan of study that you can follow. 

http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/civil-engineering/#sampleplanofstudytext

Um just check berkeleytime or rating sites to see if one professor grades harshly compared to other professors. Most of them grade similarly but there are a few that are much harder than the norm.
Berkeley is just as good if not usually much better for STEM subjects. If you're looking at reputations, Berkeley >>>>
As a premed student your first priority is GPA (try to keep it >3.7), second MCAT, 3rd research/volunteering/shadowing/extracurriculars. 

Berkeley is not particularly forgiving on the GPA side of things.

MCAT tests basically 1st year level coursework, so it's really not gonna make a huge difference where you go.

As for extracurriculars, the most relevant hospital near Berkeley is UCSF. And as someone doing research there, spending 1+ hr to get to Mission Bay and another back is not fun. UCLA/UCSD have hospitals on campus.

I would recommend you go to UCLA/UCSD instead.

(EDIT: If you are looking for the strongest school in the sciences, Berkeley is the best. However, analysis of black body radiation is probably not something premeds are interested in)
Berkeley grad, current USMD med student here. My advice is, if you're going to be successful, you will be successful anywhere. Don't listen to anyone else who tells you to avoid Berkeley because ""it's going to be hard to get a high GPA"". You don't run from your problems. That's not the way to become a physician.


It almost makes me laugh when people want to compare Berkeley to any other UC in terms of STEM prestige. I'm not a college student anymore but the only school I would pick over Berkeley is Stanford, and that's including those east coast privates that don't impress me one bit.
Probably depends on the team, but it can't hurt to ask. I know my group would be fine with it, especially over the summer. Feel free to PM me with questions, though I don't know much in detail about other engineering teams.
The fire trails to the east of campus are very popular for running. The one time I was paying attention (summer 2015) the track was open to everyone for a few hours around sunset (and maybe also dawn?). [This site](https://recsports.berkeley.edu/tracks/) might be helpful for figuring out the current/future track schedule.
I agree with the other commenter about the fire trail, that is great for hiking and running [not so much when it rains...]. Besides the track and running in a gym and whatnot, I've seen people jogging around downtown and through campus - I personally enjoy just running around in the Berkeley hills, there are a lot of beautiful areas and hidden stairs between blocks. 

Also, the bay trail is really beautiful in some areas! [It's too close to the freeway in some places for my liking, but it's great for a jog - especially in marina spots]
No, the business minor is not offered. Relax - you can still take econ and business courses (register early - they're tough to get into), as well as join business organizations for consulting/finance/etc(tons of engineering/CS majors do this)
Don't worry about minors/majors. Just focus on taking useful classes.
Lots of EECS majors come in with no experience. (I was one of them, although I technically wasn't EECS at the time.) It does mean 61A might be harder than for the people who have been designing their own compilers since age 5 (or whatever the crazy geniuses do, idk), but it's still doable if you stay on top of your work. If you are really concerned, you can start with CS10 (I did and it really helped me), but since you've programmed *at all* before I'm guessing you'll prefer to start with 61a.

The CoE used to have a quiz/information packet for deciding whether you should start with cs10 or cs61a, but I can't find it now. In lieu of that, here's a great [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1htUkJJHXnXnDVMLq4avHsCbIAWFfki_hxuLumtYz6Os/edit) people put together a few years ago. I doubt things have changed much.
CS61A should be enough, that's what a lot of people do.
The whole point of coming to university is *learning*. You'll learn everyhting here. Just come here with motivation to learn. You're not expected to know anything. If you didn't even know computers existed, you'd be fine.
Through your freshman info they send out, you'll be able to craft a rough schedule of classes that you want to take. So, on your CalCentral page, in ""my academics"", on the right side, you'll see a list and a bunch of dates mixed together. Using ""schedule planner"" on that same right side, you'll be able to plan that schedule you'd thought of and see if the timing works, whether the building is too far of a walk, etc. You're allowed to pick a maximum of 17.5 units.

Under ""Phase 1"", that date is the day and hour in which you're allowed to officially select classes. On that day and time, you'll be able to ""enroll"" in your classes. 


Don't do FPF, nobody I know who chose to do it liked it. You're in a secluded off campus building and you don't get the Cal experience that everyone else does.
No need to thank me, friend!

UCLA's neuroscience program is one of its best ones. Berkeley's biology/science related programs are also top notch, and there are several opportunities to research(labs, research groups, affiliated labs in Emeryville like JBEI etc - if you take initiative you can get in one by end of freshman year). The reason people doing these majors consider ucla strongly is they're worried about competition and want to preserve gpa for medical school. If you're pre-med, this is a valid concern; Berkeley's lower divs are ridiculously tough and curved to B/B- which can be demoralizing. However, ucla is pretty tough as well and certainly not a cakewalk either, and this truth gets obscured in a lot of the fear about Berkeley's stress culture - on the comparative, there isn't much difficulty difference. If you work hard you can succeed Berkeley, and have more opportunities than if you went to ucla.
If you're interested in pre-med then ucla has a hospital, but i don't think that matters too much since you can do those kinds of internships in the summer, and at berkeley you have all those labs you can work in during the year anyways.

I'm OOS, but I'm fortunate that my parents are comfortably able to pay my tuition without me going into debt. Everyone's situation is different. If you have workstudy, you can take advantage of that and make 2k ish a semester at the library or whatever - but I'd advise against it unless you really need to because it isn't that big in the context of your overall tuition, and detracts from the other experiences and opportunities at Berkeley - the ones you're paying the tuition for in the first place. Things you can do are consider graduating a year/semester early, find cheap(-ish, relative to Berkeley standards) housing starting 2nd year,groceries and cooking in bulk, etc but most of these strategies come into play starting second year. Just enjoy your first year without feeling guilty - unless you're really into debt or whatever
Data8 is very easy if you've taken CS61A/know python/know some basic stats. It is not designed to be tricky or conceptually difficult, and the grade distribution and course content reflects that well.

However if you don't know programming and don't know basic stats/probability then it may be a bit of work for you. Maybe someone who took it cold may have more to say. 
Ling100 was my favorite breadth course. Difficulty varies with professor from very light workload to somewhat heavy, so check course review sights. But I think its a very rewarding class that gives you a lot of insight into language. [Edit: and if you're worried Ling100 will be too difficult/high workload and don't need an upperdiv, Ling5 is supposed to cover a subset of the material and *I think* be somewhat lighter workload.]

Re: I had lots of friends who took it and none of them found it difficult. (They also all really liked it!) To be fair, most of those were stem majors, if you're rusty on math that might require more effort on your part, but it's not intended to be a high-workload course.
[this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6jxx6z/prehaas_freshman_schedule_help/) might be helpful
It's not that difficult to get research in engineering and sciences, with the possible exception of CS. The hard part (at least for me) is that you have to be proactive about seeking it out -- you have to check URAP and get your application in on time; you have to approach professors yourself and ask them (and followup, because they'll forget), etc. Somehow this seems really hard until you actually force yourself to do it (at least that was my experience).

But anyways, the easiest ways to get research are A) get a URAP match or B) do well in a professor's class, participate/go to office hours so they recognize your face, and ask nicely. They might not have space in their lab/research group, but if so they'll usually suggest who else to talk to. If you're interested in a professor's research but can't take a class with them you'll need a different way of demonstrating competence and interest -- but reaching out to them by email or in office hours is a good first step.

for A), note that URAP deadlines are quite early in the semester, so start on that as soon as you can get access to the URAP system.

The reason I say CS might be more difficult is because my friends' experience is that CS professors want to see really high grades and/or impressive personal projects. Particularly Abbeel, don't remember what other profs my friends worked for.

I should also note that most of my experience and knowledge (from friends' experience) is in Engineering (mostly EE, MechE, MSE), Physics, and Chemistry. Things might be different in Math.
If you take the initiative to approach a professor/postdoc/grad student , you can definitely get one by the end of freshman year. You absolutely have no need to worry regarding not getting research - you will get a few 'no' replies but if you email a  prof/postdoc regarding there research, request a meeting time and show excitement, you will score a position soon. Easier in some departments than others - Chemistry and Engineering (ChemE/MechE) encourage it, while due to the competition it may be a bit more difficult in CS. Math upper div classes are fairly small so getting to know professors is possible
I cannot really speak for your major related questions but as for the others:

- Housing options 
 
Most freshmen end up living in the Units (1 - 3). Those are pretty much all doubles and triples (you will be living with one or two other people). Doubles cost more but most people consider it worth it because triples are *tight*. Also the units only have one bathroom (multiple stalls and showers, but one actual room) per floor.

Foothill is a little more secluded (not really shops around) and is all mini-suites. Meaning that a few rooms share a smaller bathroom (unlike the units). People from the Units often look down on Foothill people a bit. It has a reputation (I do not know how true it actually is) of being antisocial and awkward.

Clark Kerr is a bit farther from campus and people there love to brag about how much space they have. I personally think it is overrated but it has a bit of a ""luxurious image""

Also just this year they have built a new dorm and I believe it will be open to incoming freshman. Obviously I cannot say much about it though because it is not open yet

- Food

The meal hall for Units 1-2 is Crossroads, which is in the block between both of them (by the way you can go to any meal hall you want no matter where you live). Crossroads gets a lot of shit but its not as bad as they say. Also all the meal halls (except Cafe 3) serve more or less the same food so quality does not really differ between them. Cafe 3 is primarily vegan/vegetarian food, but they usually have one meat option available. If you are not a vegetarian/vegan I would not recommend Unit 3 (where Cafe 3 is)

- AP's

Most of your AP's will give you units but will not get you out of classes. If you want you can take a bit of reduced schedule (an L&S student with no incoming credits would have to take 15 units a semester to graduate, you could take fewer) but they do not you a whole lot.
Not too sure about switching majors but a decent number of people switch out of ChemE after a semester or two so I’m assuming I can be done. 
Doubling or having a minor probably depends on what the other major is. If it’s more related there will be more overlap so you won’t need to take as many classes. I know someone who doubled in Classical languages with ChemE and he had to take over 20 units every semester.
For the APs that count for units, those can be used to fulfill your 22 units of breadth units that you need before you graduate. The college of chemistry doesn’t require specific categories of breadths but just a specific number. There are some other requires regarding the American cultures requirement and an upper division elective but the AP units will help fulfill most of the breadth units.

A kettle! Good for tea and noodles. Idk if this was common though.
Kettle, printer, microwave, mini fridge, papers, notebooks, whiteboard (if it's her thing).
I second the electric kettle and the B&W laser printer! Color runs out so fast and is expensive to replace.

Some other ideas to make it homey:

* Probably standard but a goodie box of common office supplies-- pens, pencils, markers, stapler, folders, thumbtacks, paperclips, regular tape, heavy duty/packing tape, USB drive, post-its, index cards, etc. The stuff that just makes life easier when you don't have to go buy it. I graduated years ago and still use the office supplies my mom assembled for me (against my will!) when I was heading off to college. Thanks, mom!
* Mini sewing kit
* Full length mirror (many dorm rooms won't have one, and all the roommates/suitemates will appreciate it)
* Curtain rod and long curtain if there is no door on the closet
* Single set of microwaveable dishes (plate/bowl/mug) and instant things like tea bags, hot chocolate, coffee/creamer, microwaveable foods. Maybe an extra mug to be able to offer your friends some tea :)
Berkeley is pre-professional, not cut-throat. What this means is that a lot of students were valedictorians or top of their high school, and in an attempt to keep up that level of success, they work their asses of here, in hope of getting research positions,internships, jobs, etc. Some may get douchey and overly competitive about it, but most are collaborative and more than happy to help.
I'm Engineering too(ChemE), so I can comment on the lower divs - the Math and Physics lower divs are generally speaking decently well run(my experience) and in addition to the discussion sections, there are office hours, tutoring hours, adjunct classes and other opportunities for studying together - these are inherently very collaborative, and good places to find study groups. Upper div CivE classes get smaller and smaller which has its own advantages(more engagement, etc). 

I strongly believe the only reason someone should be concerned about the competitive nature here is if they're strongly pre-med. Join a frat if you can - it'll help with the occasional stress
Here’s how you do it 

Rule 1: Be in-state

Rule 2: Don’t be out-of-state
The blunt truth is that most OOS and int'l students are pretty well off and come from fairly privileged backgrounds. Most of them have their education paid for in full by their parents or relatives. THose who do take loans only need to take a relatively small amount - upto 50k total over 4 years, maximum. Your situation of 130k in loans is not ideal. You could possibly look into graduating a year early? That could shave off a huge 50k, and many people do that - you can spend your 'fourth' year recruiting and finalizing your job while still auditing(attending without enrolling) classes and hanging around in Berkeley with your friends before taking part in commencement ceremony in May with them. Keep your other choices open too - I really dont know what to recommend, tbh
There's Men's Choir, a women's choir, a fusion choir, and a bunch of assorted music groups(including themed ones like Bollywood music, etc.)
Non-majors can play in the [University Symphony Orchestra](https://orchestra.berkeley.edu/) -- it's open audition. I've heard selectivity depends a lot on instrument -- if you play violin you have to be very good.

More casually, there's the [Chamber Music Decal](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4039) (I did this -- highly recommend!). It also has an audition, and selectivity depends on what groups they can form.

The last classical group I know about is [Cal Community Music](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ccm/), which is a club that organizes community concerts and more informal jam sessions. I had a friend who didn't get into the Decal because too many flautists auditioned that year, and so she ended up playing with CCM, I think she really liked it.

I don't know of rental and storage options for non-music majors, but it might be worth contacting the Music Department and asking. If they can't help you, they might be able to point you to music shops that do rentals.
many threads about this recently, so you may wanna look them up for more info! :) In general, humanities majors for the most part have it significantly easier in terms of grading and learning environment(less competitive since it's more academic instead of career-driven), although the content, depending on the class, can be challenging and rigorous. 
If you got a 5 on Macro and Micro and took them during senior year, I would suggest skipping Econ 1 because I personally didn’t think it was hard at all and I didn’t pass out of Econ 1 (got 5/4) 
would like to know this to


If you're trying to apply to Haas then you will have to take Econ 1 or Econ 2. Which I would honestly recommend in order to boost your GPA for your Haas application.
I think it'd be good to take Econ 1 anyway just to get the grade-boost on your application to Haas, especially since the class should be easy because you've demonstrated knowledge in your AP
Over the summer, you'll sign up with our academic portal, CalCentral. If you don't have an account set up, I'd recommend getting on that: that said, I'm not sure if freshmen have access to it yet.

A lot of this information is out-of-date. You can do research into your freshman classes over the summer, but you enroll during Orientation when you get on campus.

What the actual fuck………man what do you think?

Much cheaper to cook for yourself. 

I had the commuter meal plan my sophomore year while living in an apartment, and it wasn't nearly worth it. There were a few times it was really nice to get a hot meal right near campus, but nothing deal breaking (and with better planning or meal prepping skills I could have done it myself).
[deleted]
I requested access to ""Global Dashboards"" via CalAccess as the site says and it worked. Strangely enough I haven't been able to login ever since. It just says login error.
Your best bet here is to go through the data science department website and figure it out there: many of the advisors are hard to reach and don't respond. There is a phone number 510 642 1483 that you can use to set up appointments, maybe you can ask someone there?
Personally I'm an out of state freshman who also does not want to work / live in the Bay Area. It's been super easy to find internships back home because of the Berkeley brand and Berkeley's name carries a lot of clout in a lot of places. I really don't think it'll be too difficult to get a job straight out of college in LA. Go where you fit.
The Bay Area is a great place to jump-start your career but that doesn't mean it's the only place nor does it mean you have to stay here indefinitely. Many of the LA natives that I have met here at Cal - myself included - have all mentioned that they would most likely make their way back to SoCal eventually. Personally, I plan to do maybe 3-5 years here in the Bay after I graduate to establish my professionale then either do an internal transfer to an office closer to LA (if possible) or just start looking for other opportunities closer to home. In your case, it sounds like staying put in SoCal would be the best bet. Also, the word ""hinder"" should not even be in your vocabulary. Whatever you decide to do, you're going to excel tremendously. Some of the top schools known around the world are at your finger tips. 
Heck, Berkeley has a better reputation and pull in SoCal than in the Bay Area, due to the high concentration of Berkeley grads up North(i.e. you're just another Berkeley grad in the Bay). I've noticed that Berkeley (generally) gets more respect the further away from it you go - especially east coast and internationally, especially for STEM. You will be more than fine should you choose to move to LA. If Cal is the better fit for you, then come here
Definitely take Stats with Econ 1, since Econ 1 is easier than the 100 series in my experience. You will probably never find a good stats 20 teacher so that shouldn’t be a deciding factor. If you want to take data 8, take it after stats 20 since they cover similar topics and thus data 8 would be easier having already done stats. 
Hi there!

Is Community College Admit day for newly admitted transfer students? I never heard of until now.
Hey im also MechE and I am going on Friday! As far as i know, theres only a lunch and a tour for engineers for about an hour. The rest of the weekend is just for transfer students. 
Majoring in Econ and minoring in CS is another alternative? It would be less stressful and you’ll still gain decent amount of skills in coding and whatnot. You’ll have a really heavy and intense load if you double major and it’s up to you on whether or not you want to overwhelm your college years with just academia... (it’ll be hard managing time efficiently to enjoy all of the other aspects of college) Keep in mind that they both have GPA requirements and for CS, it’s at 3.3 which is relatively high for most students so you’ll have to focus on maintaining good grades in three of the prereqs to even declare first. 

update: I also realize you’re a transfer student! That makes it even more difficult unless you’re planning to take an extra year and also take summer classes. You should talk to a counselor if you’d like more clear feedback and more specific details about the process. 
I doubt this would be possible for an L&S transfer, as we only have 136 units (for doubles) to finish everything, minus whatever units you're coming in with. With no CS experience, I doubt you'd be able to keep up with the huge courseload. Maybe consider Data Science as a single major instead? There are several [econ-related concentrations](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis). 
First of all, congratulations on your admission!

As far as your situation is concerned: you should be fine so long as your updated your application after you decided to drop those classes which sounds like you did. I was in a similar situation where I was taking a discrete math class but decided to drop it. Aside from the W on my transcript nothing else came up about it with regards to my transfer.

The only thing I can see that would cause some strain is if those classes were required in order for you to transfer. If they were just fillers classes then I wouldn't worry too much.   
[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4nqlle/what_are_the_berkeley_essentials_that_every/) from last year has some good answers.

Edit: One other thing I'd recommend is coordinate with your roomates if possible on larger items like printers. It's nice if you can share.
Doorstop
I'd recommend Econ 101: the classes are more quantitative while teaching the necessary economic theory and concepts sufficiently well. I felt that my grasp of the concepts and analytical ability was more powerful than that of my peers who took 100. Fwiw, 101 is tougher but also has very generous curves(half the class gets A- or above)
Usually happens during dead week inside of main stacks.
the *what?*
L o l those are 3 completely different majors you're gonna have to figure out what you want in the future and narrow it down because doing all 3 is not sustainable especially when CS is one of the options. In a future career its highly unlikely that you'll need all 3 of these topics. If you can figure out which 1 or 2 to actually major in you can always take a couple classes in the other major for fun or minor in it rather than major. 
Looks doable if you're smart and motivated. 
Hey! I'm a current sophomore and will be a junior next semester. I'm also taking C100A next semester, along with bio 1b and 2 CS courses, so idk if I can help.

So when you say C100A is the only class you can take for the first semester, you can't take any other upper divs, considering you've completed all the lower divs?

If so, I guess you can take some breadths or decals or look into research? Sorry I'm not sure how it is with transfers.
There isn't really set places. Go on craigslist, the housing facebook group, etc. 

Singles are going to cost a pretty penny, usually $1300-$1500 per month if near campus.
Sorry, transfer admit here with no background in anthro. Aren't some of the world's most distinguished anthropologists faculty at UC Berkeley? Like [Tim White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_D._White), who led the discovery of Ardi and Lucy?

Just taking a look at the [department website,](http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/) it seriously seems like the best program to pursue.
Hey, fellow anthro transfer student here! :\) I love the program, but do be warned it's pretty sociocultural\-heavy. That being said, there's a handful of really great, knowledgeable, and fairly approachable arch professors here as well as opportunities for research. I was deciding between the same schools as you last year and definitely don't regret my decision. Feel free to PM me if you have any other/more specific questions! 
I have never had any trouble and I'm 23. Especially because there's no reason anyone would have a fake vertical ID-- kind of defeats the purpose of a fake if it looks like an underage ID from the beginning.
I'm turning 21 soon as well so this is good info. 
I’ve seen people have issues if it’s expired. If it’s vertical but valid you’re fine
Hey this is a bit old, but I will be attending Berkeley this fall after 10 years in the bar industry and I wanted to throw in my two cents. Any bar can refuse you service for any non-discriminatory reason, period. All they have to do is cite one of a couple things: safety, possible prior intoxication, or even just the possibility that someone is underage. 

With that said, the types of places that would turn away a vertical ID are often on Vice's radar, and only have that policy because their serving license depends on it. 

Most bars will accept vertical IDs as long as it is still valid (not expired). 

  
Business/CS clubs are pretty competitive, so interviews are part of it. They're real fucking competitive since they only take a few people. Clubs aren't necessary for success though! There are many people doing well who aren't part of the ""top"" clubs.
Yes. Depends on the club. Business clubs are harder to get into than most clubs.
Sometimes, depends on the clubs. Some of the clubs have like a 10-20% acceptance rate, but some of that is artificial.
What got you so worried?
How did things turn out for you? I was also waiting around to find out about being rescinded but I found out last week that I wasn't. 
As others have mentioned: summer classes tend to double with respect to work/time/effort so you're looking at 16 units all together. That's a huge workload, especially for your first semester. I'd suggest taking 61A only. 
if you're looking to declare cs i wouldnt recommend this for the faint hearted 
No, that sounds fine. If it's too much you can drop and take something else.
Most people get triples or quads, so chances are good.
No, most students walk. I would say maybe 10-15% of people bike, skateboard, or scooter. Benefits would be avoiding uphill climbs and not worrying too much about back-to-back classes far from each other. I'm not sure about electric bikes, but electric skateboards are common.
E-bikes are becoming more common, but I don't think I'd want to lock an expensive e-bike outside for extended periods.  Our local bikeshare system (Ford Gobike) has e-bikes for share in SF and I would imagine they will come to the East Bay eventually.   Limebike also has dockless e-bikes and e-scooters in SF, but that company is banned from placing bikes in Berkeley.
If you're not concerned about making the CS major, Cal >>> SD, for both your fields. A large part of the stress goes away if you're free to enjoy the learning experience instead of worrying about making a cut-off. Strongly reccomend Cal; trust me, the 'stress' and 'competition' culture is totally overrated(unless maybe you're pre-med).
come to berkeley - cal has a bunch of fingers in different areas of linguistics (especially california native languages). our computer science program is also top notch (where you'll be taking some of the courses needed for CogSci).

granted we are biased, but also in those majors, there's not as much competition that you might hear about from pre-whatevers and comp-sci intended.
Hi! I studied cog sci at Cal and am now studying for the GRE and looking into diff cog sci/psych grad programs. I personally loved studying Cog Sci at Cal! It's a great program, but the only thing is that it can be a bit difficult to get into some of the UD \(upper divs\)because there isn't always priority for cog sci majors, but I was still able to get into everything \(just had to be on the waitlist sometimes\). The classes were collaborative and fun! I always had friends and people I worked with. The cog sci faculty is amazing and there are a lot of opportunities to get involved in research etc! I hope this helps! Feel free to PM me for more in depth questions or anything! :\)
Depends – do you have a good handle on math and physics? Do you have good study skills, and are you disciplined when it comes to getting work done? Are you able to waive major/college/university requirements with APs? If the majority of your answers are yes, then CivE will be a challenge, but a manageable one. If not, it will take some time to adapt. 

As for grade deflation, it’s not nearly as rampant as people make it seem. Check out berkeleytime.com, you can see grade distributions for some of the classes you’ll be taking to get a better sense of what the average grades people have in those classes are. 

Overall, if Berkeley is your dream school, I say go for it! It’s totally possible to have a good social life while majoring in engineering – CivE is one of the “easier” engineering majors, and with some discipline you can maintain a 3.0 without pulling too many all-nighters. 
listen don't read anything more or even give it any more thought. UCB>SD you shouldn't be giving it that much thought IMO. grade deflation and stupid shit like that will literally not matter in any big picture scenario, but attending Berkeley over UCSD will. obvious choice don't screw it up. gl
I was at one point considering Legal Studies and heard similar advice. I would say, don’t major in it unless you’re certain it’s what you’re most interested in and you’re prepared to repeat some of it in law school. 

As for exposure to the legal field, Berkeley has a couple pre-law fraternities worth checking out! They usually table on Sproul and have a couple of “rush” events at the start of each semester. 
From what I’ve heard, it doesn’t really matter what you major in unless you plan on taking on something really technical, like an engineering degree, and then plan to pursue patent law or something. Other than that, I’m not sure how important your major is, and I know tons of Legal Studies majors who have been very successful at law school, etc. I would major in whatever you find most interesting and think you could succeed in! Personally, I’ve really enjoyed being a Legal Studies major and I think it presents a great external, critical perspective on law that you’ll almost certainly not get in law school. Feel free to message me if you want to talk about the major in more detail!
Hey so I am a Legal Studies major and can give you some advice. First - These classes are nothing like law school. They teach about broad issues in law, but not how to be a lawyer. So for example a class on criminal law won't discuss legal code or the complex interworkings of trials per se, but rather a discussion on punishment, the philosophy behind plea bargaining etc.   You also don't need to major in legal Studies to become a lawyer. Personally I find Legal Studies to be a mix of philosophy history law and statistics so it touches on a lot of areas for me. That said if you are a freshman or even a transfer willing to take a full load of classes, I would suggest a double major. For me personally, I love history and think about going to grad school often so it was a no brainer for me.  Final suggestion would be to join the BLSA and if you are really dedicated, a legal frat. But these aren't necessary, and a good relationship with a few professors plus good LSAT scores will get you far.  Anymore questions feel free to respond or PM me.
Look on Berkeleytime.com for grade distributions, but MCB is hella hard for getting a 4.0.  I transferred from a CC taking 4 technicals a semester and getting all A's to ChemE here and am wondering if I will pass the *two* classes I am taking.  

If you're a freshman: just take EECS classes on top of your engineering requirements, then apply to transfer to EECS after two semesters. If your GPA is ""good enough"" (the level depends on space) you get in. It's not a guaranteed thing but I know lots of people who succeeded at doing this.

Although as 127-0-0-1_1 pointed out, it's also very possible to take EE classes as a non-EECS student. Depending on what subfield of EE you're interested in, you might actually be better off sticking with MechE and just taking the relevant EE classes. (I did have one friend who seriously regretted changing from MechE to EECS.)
Don't know about transfer difficulty, but just btw like 99% of EECS students are ~~EE~~CS students and basically just take EE16a/b to graduate. 

If you look at enrollment numbers, many of the upper div EE classes, very unlike CS classes, have less students than their capacity. Basically if it's not 126/127, don't worry about getting into EE classes.
Probably not. I missed two AP tests (not for classes I was taking)  and was fine. Probably want to send an email  though. 
Daily Cal has already done the majority of their hiring for the next academic year, but you should totally reach out to KALX. I worked on a show with them this last year and it was seriously so much fun. They're very low stress. 
Yes, I think sometime in the early morning.
Idk, Berkeley engineering is top tier, it has great connections to tech companies, particularly in the Bay, the Bay has a better tech scene than SD. 

It's pretty clearly better for career prospects. There are other factors involved in college decisions, but if that's your major concern, then sure, this is a great place to get a job. EECS graduate had an *average* salary of $110,000 last year.
The other commenter is wrong, they've changed up freshman classes with the introduction of GBO last year. Just go to ""my academics"", and on the right side, look at the date next to ""Phase 1"". That's your time. Be ready by then. During the online course called GBA, though, (which is different from GBO), you'll be walked through which classes you should be signing up for, and you'll send a rough draft to your advisor.
at orientation unless you dont go to orientation then it's usually like a week after for phase 1
I would def try posting on the FB groups as well, since there might not be a lot of film & media studies students on this sub
A little late, but I'm also an incoming transfer into the film and media studies program! I obviously haven't taken any classes yet, however I know the program is mostly theory based. There are some opportunities for you to learn production (if that's what you're into), but I think there may only be a couple electives offered that delve into that. 
Cal has a couple film clubs, like GiANT filmmakers and Cinebears. You can check those out on facebook; you might be able to use equipment  through them (not sure though). Also, there's the Pacific Film Archive near campus, which is a super cool resource! 
It really depends on your mathematical maturity. Most freshmen couldn't do it, but it looks like you had a lot of opportunity in high school.

If you have experience writing proofs and did well in linear algebra (and that linear algebra class was about linear maps rather than just mindlessly manipulating matrices), then you shouldn't find Math 110 too hard. Otherwise, this schedule is probably too hard.

Can't speak for the other classes, as while I've taken some physics classes here I've never taken 5A or 77. Most freshmen I know found C10 very easy however.
[deleted]
I would recommend not taking 5 technicals your first year at berkeley. 5A is extremely time-demanding (3 hours of lecture, 2 hours of discussion, 1 hour of lab, and probably 12-15 hours/week of homework and studying), and taking 2 other physics classes along with an upper-div math is a bit of an overload. I took lin alg+diff eq my senior year too, but the math classes here are just more difficult. Focus on 5A, maybe 77 (I would say 89 is better because you took lin alg+diff eq senior year), astron C10 and a breath requirement. Take a freshman seminar if you want, and I recommend that you do.  
Also, don't worry about your GPA! If you find it's too hard (which you should figure out fairly early on), you can drop classes without consequence in the first few weeks of school.  
TL:DR Physics 5A is very time demanding and difficult, definitely take Astron C10, considering 89 over 77 and 99 (you can take them later), and consider waiting a year for math 110 especially if you choose to take 89.
I would drop the 77 and C10. 77 is *not* a major requirement (despite being listed in the Physics Dept's recommended schedule) and the professor for next semester is known for being an erratic grader. C10 is definitely a great class to audit the lectures, but you don't need it to meet any requirement (as a physics major) and you probably wouldn't find it too interesting. If you're really interested in astronomy, I would strongly suggest just taking an upper-division astro class that's *not* crosslisted with physics (Stellar Physics, Optical/Radio Lab) as your out-of-major upper-div elective, when the time comes.

Regarding research, I have no idea what you've got planned, but my best suggestion is to find a postdoc in the Astronomy Department and work with them, regardless of what field you eventually want to go into. Astronomy postdocs are *strongly* incentivized to write papers with undergrads, since they are gunning for tenure-track positions and the key requirement of that is the ability to do publishable research and advise students. It's a great way to get a first-authored publication and that puts you way ahead of the game in grad school. Wait a semester before doing this though, you're gonna want to have some kind of an academic record to show that you can do the work. Research units are completely irrelevant.
All of the above. But IMO the real killer is when you get to midterm season, and suddenly you have to split your attention to 3/4 classes all while doing work for all of them as well.

I have a friend who took CS61B, CS70, and CS61C at the same time. He had to take 61b one day, then CS70 and CS61C back to back the very next day, 7-11PM. 

It's very difficult to split your studying while still having to go to class and still keeping up with classwork.

maybe this one?

I wouldn't advise it. You may be able to succeed but you won't get as much out of the classes. If these are your first college classes you should take it a little more slowly so you can get used to the rigor of Berkeley. I think you could do it. But unless you need to take that many units for some reason. It probably isn't a good idea. 

Yep, right in front of MLK.
Yes, it does.
if you really want easy, try filling the requirement via community college if possible.

otherwise i recommend looking at berkeleytime.com for grade distros, but R&C are really hit or miss depending on the prof/gsi teaching.

[deleted]
It's definitely not hard compared to some of the other classes here. I'd say it's a good class to take freshman year to get used to the culture and rigor of the school. There isn't going to be too much overlap from what I remember but it's not like that really matters since you have to take it anyways. 
if you want to take a challenging stats class, if you take Stats 134 you will come out of it with an extremely comprehensive knowledge of probability. 
usually 0XX is lower div, 1XX is upper div, and 2XX is graduate level. 

http://polisci.berkeley.edu/courses/faculty/3847

this says 222 is a graduate student course, so i would say it's not a good idea as a freshman.
Not a poli sci major, but have friends who are, and from their woes and complaints, I'd say wait a semester or two for upper divs :)
From what I've seen on ratemyprofessor.com that Teleman is pretty bad at lecturing and his homeworks are pretty hard. They say that Srivastava is better at lecturing and is more supportive in classes. 
Never taken a class with Srivastava, but out of the classroom he seems like a cool guy, if that matters to you at all.

The Chem 1AL final is on the last day of classes, before dead week begins. Whether your seminar has a final or not, it shouldn't interfere with the lab final.
If you're a ""power user"" or otherwise comfortable developing on Windows, there's no problem. The only class it'll be an issue for is 184.

If you're new, you don't even know what a terminal is, etc, then OSX would be the best complete batteries included experience. Of course, it comes at a hefty price tag.

Have never had issues with Windows, use cmder and install the Linux subsystem.
There's a lot more support for UNIX in the Berkeley CS community (because most students use OS X), but you can definitely get by with Windows if you know what you're doing.
I think in the summer, empty rooms in buildings are more available compared to the school year, but you can still book them in advance at Doe or Moffitt.
Have you tried to contact your 9th grade school or are you just assuming you can't?  I don't know of a school system that permanently deletes records.  Also even though it's summer, usually school/education admins still work.  You should try to contact them and if the school really isn't reachable, work your way up to the board of education.
have you contacted admissions? I was in the same boat as you (moved away for 11th, final transcript showed grades from my previous school) and had no problems with only submitting a transcript from the one i graduated from
I lived in unit 3 and I really enjoyed my experience; Berkeley students are just generally pessimistic whiny people who find fault with literally everything(meme page is a good reflection of this - most students are totally fine and doing well at Berkeley, but still like to post deprecatory memes). Unit 3 is close to dining hall, grocery store(Bear Market), campus, RSF, and is at the heart of Southside, so you're close to all the fun stuff that happens. The people on your floor will be more important to your experience than which Unit you're staying in - they all have their pros and cons, and for unit 3 the downside is older, slightly ugly looking buildings and facilities. That's it
Unit 1 and 2 were recently remodeled and Blackwell is new. Clark Kerr, although far, is also nice inside. Unit 3 is pretty old and ugly which is why it is most people's last choice.
Unit 3 is chill don't worry
necessary: no.

worth it? the engineering one (E92 back in the day) looked useful, but i didn't take it
A lot of them are pretty interesting (imo) and are good ways to bond with others in a small setting while getting to know a professor. I wish I took one.
Directly after. There's no real pros to hour breaks. They're just a pain in the ass. Avoid if at all possible. An hour, factoring in travel, ends up being like 30 minutes in the library doing nothing bdcause you don't have enough time to accomplish anything.
I would just keep my eyes peeled for opportunities. There are plenty of work study jobs available, and it's just a matter of applying and following through on the opportunities you're interested in. A quick search in my inbox for work-study jobs popped out this [job](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iq-vTAOCSqj03JD6qxpUSnnpcLjYVL3O/view), which looks like it's still available. 

I'm also working for an organization on campus that'll be hiring a few people in the fall, and we're always happy to see work study applicants. Shoot me a PM if you want to learn more.
It'll be dependent on your professor/GSI. A lot of writing-related classes (philosophy, history, english, etc.) will tell you that you'll have 2 hours of of the 3 to take the exam, for example, but that it's an incredibly generous estimate. Chances are, it won't take you the full 3 hours, and there's also a good chance you won't have an exam at all. 

Also, from personal experience, I've taken 3 finals in one day -- as tiring as it can be, once you get it over with, it's over with. It's not the *best* case scenario by any means, but it's doable. You'll have time between the exams to snack/rest/recharge. 
It depends on the course, the instructor, and how many seats there are available. If you're waitlisted but at a pretty high number (or there are still a lot of seats available, even if they're ""reserved"") you should go to class anyways - if they take roll, you're automatically on their good side if you show up. When they open the seats is up to the professor, I believe, and they might wait a couple of weeks to ensure that anybody that *needs* the class (i.e. to graduate) gets in. 
Search your class on here: [http://classes.berkeley.edu/search/class](http://classes.berkeley.edu/search/class)
For Chem1AL what matters is if you get into the specific lab section you signed up for, which is about 20 people, so think of it as a 20 person class.
It depends on what classes' prereqs you are trying to satisfy. If your schedule permits, math 53 and 7a is a common combo since 7a is an easy class if you've done AP physics.
I personally found Berkeley classes significantly harder than community college classes. 4 techs sounds rough.
You're going to have a bad time taking all those techs at the same time, especially with 61A and 137A.  Day 1 is off and running, you'll definitely have problem sets due in all those classes by week 2.
I agree with the other folks that commented- four technicals is *really* tough. If you’re only looking for a single day of freedom, you’ll probably have it, and CS61A is 100% webcasted so you can watch the lecture later, though from what I’ve heard it’s incredibly easy to fall behind. You can potentially find old syllabi from the other courses online, or even email professors asking for them (though in my experience, professors have no clue what they’re doing until it happens have the time in terms of scheduling). Aim for earlier, for sure. 
Chances are that schedule is going to kick your butt. 

89 isn’t conceptually difficult, if you already saw the material at CC. It will have a solid amount of PSETS. 

137A will be difficult with a large amount of PSETS. I found 110A quite challenging conceptually. Lots going on there, tons of equations to learn, mountain of PSETS. 

CA61A is notorious. 

The only people I’ve seen do a schedule like this are and actually do it well are just complete machines: the people who do 18 units a semester every semester as well as side projects and research. Like one or two people a year are like this, most who try 4 tech classes just suffer. Do yourself a favor and take like Berkeley connect or a decal or something. 

Go talk to the physics advisor (Amanda not the others) and see what she says and listen. 

Oh also you should ask Analytis about joint his research group, he’s nice. 

Oh yeah, don’t know if you’ve looked into it, but if you’re a physics major then double majoring in astrophysics is only 3 more classes ..
From my experience and in talking with other student employees from different departments hours are flexible/accommodating but I usually work regular shifts each week. 
[https://www.kiwicampus.com/](https://www.kiwicampus.com/)
Ubereats now delivers w/o fees from restaurants within 3 miles of you. So that.
Postmates and Uber Eats are pretty common around here. If you haven’t used them before, I’d ask someone for a code - sometimes you can get ~$25 credit just for signing up. They email a lot of coupons as well— free delivery from certain places, free food altogether, etc. 
You can call the housing office. They answer their phone. At least they did in the spring right before the deadline to pay a 'small' deposit fee. They're also pretty good with email too. You'll at least get a response in 24 hours if you ask at the beginning or middle of the week.
...why?
Freshman year I had like a 2pm move in time but my family and I had driven up the night before and the morning of move in at like 9am we asked if we could move in while we were there already so they just gave us the keys and I got to move in like 5 hours early. They're divided by buildings (for Unit 1) and my table for move in didn't have a line so I think they just let it happen because it was not busy.   
I figure since yours is the first slot there will be plenty of other families trying to do the same thing so just head over early as you'd like to. I figure they'd start setting up tables around 7 am but it doesn't hurt to ask once they're done setting up. Hope this helped!
no, only blood
For 99% of all classes that I've had but it really depends on your professor 
I recommend going to the administration office that handles loans and ask questions there. They may be able to help you find answers
Most people have BoA or Chase. BoA definitely has the closest branch, they're like a block off from sproul. Chase's is in downtown by BART, but BoA is probably the most infamous of the big bangs, so there's that.
Wells Fargo has done some really, really [sketchy stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_account_fraud_scandal) in the past few years. I've been with BoA for probably 8 years now. They have some really convenient locations near campus (Shattuck and Center St., Telegraph and Durant) and every time I've gone in person, I've received excellent service. 
Chase is great for both a checking account and for credit (the Chase Freedom card is a good 'starter' card). If you don't have credit history however, I highly recommend the Discover it student card; rotating 5% cash-back categories with 1% on everything else, double cash-back first year, and a $20 statement credit for every academic year you have greater than a 3.0. If you want a referral code (where we both get $50) hmu. 
Chase. Better user experience, customer service, and products than BofA or WF. 

Source: Had BofA for many years, switched when I got married (wife had Chase), will never look back. 
Hey, I'm currently living in Unit 3, Norton Building, for Summer Bridge. There is a water/Ice dispenser on the ground floor in the communal kitchen area where pretty much everyone gets their water. Pretty sure it's filtered. 
The water from the taps is safe to drink. 
Average gpa is 3.93. However, your test scores, essays, and extracurricular will matter too.
One of my roommates went to the RSF track early in the morning (RSF website says it's open to all students between 7am and 9am). Afraid I can't offer any specific advice -- IIRC she didn't have class until late morning so timing wasn't an issue beyond waking up early enough.
You can get day lockers at the RSF and leave your stuff there, then shower/change in the locker room. I'd say that's probably most efficient, though you'll be carrying your sweaty clothes with you for the rest of the day (unless you know you're going to walk back past the RSF later in the day, and you can pick it up then). 

Other than that, give yourself a lot of extra time. Are you going to need to eat something, and if so, do you rely on the dining halls? Do you have to avoid waking up a roommate if you go straight back to your dorm, because it's 8am and they don't get up until 11am? 
There’s a better gym in the stadium than the RAF
individual rooms wont have full length mirrors but the floor you're on usually has a decently long mirror for anyone to use.
probably. that being said, you'll probably want to fill some of that time with clubs and socialization. it depends on what you call ""free time""--I'd say I very rarely have time to myself, but I do have a decent amount of time not spent doing academics.
Get coffee and a sandwich before the first class, drink the coffee during the first class, eat the sandwich between class two and three
Figure out what bathrooms are located near each of your class locations so you can quickly go between classes without losing time
As others said, definitely bring something to eat. A lot of professors don't mind if you snack in class, but keep it lowkey (fruit, energy bars, etc... not a whole meal). Bring a water bottle, too, and keep yourself hydrated (especially if you're keeping yourself caffeinated). 
For what major/field? There's a bunch at Cal, especially for pre-law, chemistry, business, etc
Berkeley ML/AI programs are some of the best in the world right now. Some big professors that recruit undergrads are Abbeel, Klein, and Song. For undergrads, I know quite a few people who work in top AI labs. I got into an AI lab as a freshman and it's not super hard.

If you're considering grad school, Berkeley has a much higher PhD placement rate in AI programs because big name profs -> better letters of rec and more research published for undergrads.
better
Berkeley hosts the best Machine Learning class in the world: CS 189. Also the curriculum is very tailored towards Algorithms/Machine Learning. It's definitely better than UCLA in this regard.
not easy. prepare to work hard and don't expect a 4.0
Yeah, don't do that.
Don’t do 4 tech classes your first semester
That looks pretty normal (assuming you’re a ChemE) 
...Are you the same pre-med student who made like 5 different accounts to rant on this sub?
Find something to do that gives you life
Almost definitely too late for the semester, still fine for summer. I applied for co-ops for Fall 2017 during Fall 2016, and my number was still in the 300-400 range.
It's not cutthroat in the sense that more people seem to collaborate and work together to solve problems than tear up other people's notes, but it is a competitive environment
if youre not in stem, dont let the fear of competition steer you away.  cal is stressful, but if you find a solid group of friends to vent/sob/laughcry with, you'll be fine
I heard about all this cutthroat stuff coming in to cal and did not experience it at all. It’s competitive but also very collaborative and fun. Especially if you’re not doing something like premed or business
two things: size & wanting to be in an entirely stem environment. from what I understand, caltech is more stem-y than even the rest of the stem schools (mit & harvey mudd), and it's very small compared to cal. it's also in a more suburban area. they're definitely very different schools, but both are great academically. at cal, you'll be around a lot of non-stem people (although you can very easily surround yourself with stem people if you so please--one of the great things about cal is that you can create your own community because it's such a big school). there is also likely a larger variety of student groups at cal. I honestly suggest visiting both and determining which fits you better!
The real question is do you want a small college or a massive university experience.  You gotta consider what type of learner you are/how important sports are to you/ability to make friends and find a niche in addition to the academics and location 
Good. 

Good. 

Good.
It's too early to worry about this. All the statistics are out there but you have two years (iirc) to declare for haas.Theres lots of good information for you available from the source here http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/class_profile.html
the number of ""pre-haas"" freshmen are plentiful. most dont even get through pre reqs and give up. well even english majors can get finance jobs. its about how well u stand out
There's no quota; it's a GPA cap. You must have at least a 3.0 in all prerequisite classes and you're in.
Econ is one of the easier capped majors to declare. Just don't get below a 3.0 in calculus, intermediate micro/macro and intro to stats. 
Cut-off is 3.0 , and the classes aren't too hard - for most people declaring econ is a piece of cake(almost a given). There are reasons to pick LA over Berkeley and vice-versa, but this is certainly not one of them. 

The classes you need a 3.0 average in are Math 16A and 16B(you may get AP credit, but these classes are very manageable), Econ 1 or 2(Again, maybe AP credit but both have great professors and are well-taught, easy to get a B+ , and beyond that if you work hard you can do even better), Statistics requirement(usually Stat 20/21 - this is the hardest class imo since Stats classes have tough curves) and either Econ 100A or B(from my Econ peers, i hear this is tough and totally depends on the professor; however  it is certainly possible to do well). If you so desire, you can plan your schedule such that you take only 1 necessary class each semester so you can focus on that(and take breadths/other stuff to kill other requirements) and declare by sophomore spring, but this isn't necessary. 
not hard at all. everyone i knew in the econ major declared the first time. edit: everyone besides me that is because i had some... circumstances lmao

but if you have any questions about the econ major feel free to ask!
No undergrad nursing major, no. [heres a career center post about it](https://career.berkeley.edu/Health/NursPrepWhat)
You're fine; send an email.
I knew about a half dozen people who did EECS+MechE double major. They were all above average in competence and academic ability by the standards of Berkeley engineers or willing to work much much harder -- so a really high bar. So I would say its very hard, but some people find it doable and rewarding. To double major, the important thing is to plan out your schedule in advance so you take the right courses at the right time -- MechE has a lot of requirements so there's not much slack in the schedule.

I don't know for formula SAE specifically but for most engineering competition teams they take anyone who is interested. The main issue might be a high time commitment, but that can vary a lot.
My roommate is in Berkeley FSAE and he loves it. I don't think it was a hard process for him to get on the team, you just consistently go to events and they'll probably pick you up. 
Switching majors within the College of Engineering is not bad. I believe you'll need to have taken one EECS lower div per semester of attendance (e.g. 2 eecs lower divs after two semesters) and get the >3.3 gpa. 
I didn't give toefl or ielts as an international and i was fine. Just email the admissions office re: your situation, they'll most likely understand. The fact that you're a US citizen makes me 99% certain they won't care re: TOEFL but ask anyways

Cold emails and family connections my friend. Same here as everywhere else.
I think the career center is a nice place to get started. They have some solid resources to get you going on a resume (esp. transitioning it from a high school one) and cover letters. They also have one-on-one appointments you can make to get resume advice and advice in general.

Beyond just cold emailing and applying, joining different finance student groups can be useful - both to hear about best practices for applying and stuff but also to reach out to their alumni connections.

It's all done online if its before a certain deadline, no one is really going to check/tattle on you if you stop showing up to class (unless that's a requirement). If you are past the drop deadline, then you need to talk to your adviser/college about proper action to take, this isn't a bad thing, the colleges/advisers want to help you.
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/865053/17_did_you_just_get_into_berkeley_have_a_simple/dwmt875/) is a good comment about doing haas + cs

if you really do want to do it, i'd say freshman fall would look something like CS61a, math 16a/b (depending on your math strength), an r&c, and a breadth course

I'd recommend trying to find roommates you get along with. If they end up being the same major as you then that's cool too, but you shouldn't focus completely on that
You'll have no problem meeting other ChemE students.  Odds are there will be at least 1 on the floor of your dorm and multiple in your building.  Also, you will likely meet some in your classes.  Alsoooo, you shouldnt worry about befriending people in your major yet.  You are gonna be in mostly lower divs for your first semester, so your classes will overlap with like all different types of STEM people. Support in your classes will come from all over.   Priority is finding a roomie with a compatible personality. <3 
If you got a financial aid waiver for application, I believe the SIR fee is deferred for you, and you'll pay it along with Fall tuition. 
Might make more sense to take the BART if you're staying in the city. 
If you can afford it I’d live on campus apart from your family. Living far away would really mess with your social life; you’d have a hard time doing anything in the evenings ever.
I know many people who are from SF or the Bay Area who still live on campus. I think there's something important about living in a dorm that everyone should try to experience. Plus, I personally wouldn't want to try to deal with the traffic every single day.

But it's up to you. You'd have to look at financials and other variables that I don't know about.
Unless you really can't afford it live in the dorms for at least the first year.  
Since it's your first semester, I think you should try to ease into the Cal chaos.  Four 4-unit classes can be a lot for your first exposure to Cal.  3 classes and a seminar sound good to me.  Also, keep in mind that you'd be able to enroll in 5 appealing courses (four 4-units and a seminar) and then drop one once you've gone to a couple of lectures/assessed the workload

1. Getting into a lab is totally doable if you really want it. Just email a lot of professors, show your enthusiasm (and mean it) and someone will take you. Also programs like URAP are useful for a lot of people.
2. Depends how much you want a challenge. It is not impossible to get good grades, but you'll have to work for them. Personally, I've grown a LOT from the academic challenge alone and really appreciate the experience. That being said, UCSB rocks (but not guarantees that it'll be easier to find a lab--source: my boyfriend went there and struggled with the same thing). 
3. The CS major is not a SUPER long major and the minor is basically the major, minus a few upper division classes. If you're minoring, you will not get registration priority and it'll be pretty hard to get the upper divs you want (majors get to enroll first). 

Feel free to PM if you want to talk more! I'm a 4th year MCB/CS double major. 
Someone posted here earlier today with some FAQ's re: pre-med/bio under a broader FAQ thread.
As for the CS thing, half the biology intended students i know either switched or minored in CS. Biggest issue with minor is getting into upper div classes, although with astute planning and using summar sessions this is possible. Lower divs are easy to get in, although the material(obviously) is challenging. Doing Bio + CS is very hard but no need to rush into your choice of study -  L and S is amazingly broad in that way.
If you're very confident that you want to do pre-med then SD is a better choice purely due to gpa, but if if you value or are passionate about  literally anything else come to Berkeley
Neither of them are cheap, and both will leave you in debt. Berkeley OOS, like any pricey private school(assuming you dont get aid) is worth it only if you're not going into significant debt as a result(like 50k total max,imo - anymore is financially irresponsible). If I'm reading your situation right you will be 90k in debt at Poly and 150+ at Berkeley? 

Working many hours in college isn't preferable since you want to get the most out of a pricey education(by studying, socializing, engaging in cool clubs and opportunities, attending cool events, etc) and even if you choose to work it'll barely cover any significant cost keeping in mind the larger context of COA/debt. You could think about taking summer classes and graduating early(but this would require you to forego any double major/minor, and the point of attending a school like Berkeley is to take full advantage of ALL its top notch programs and opportunities so idek what to say)

Having said that you sound like a driven and motivated student. I know people here who came to Cal OOS shouldering the burden of debt. They worked hard (several graduated early) and are poised for a successful career where they will probably pay back debt in anywhere from 1-8 years. However, without knowing you Irdk if I could recommend it. Cal Poly isn't much better financially either - Id actually say come to Berkeley over it since the cost-benefit analysis is better. What are your other choices? What's your state school? ANy other sources of funds(Relatives/other scholarships etc)? 

As for your 3 questions - Berkeley is incredibly awesome in all of them and comfortably beats Cal Poly(imo) but that's not the point here - your financial situation is far more important to consider

If you weren't admitted to Berkeley as engineering undeclared it'll be difficult to switch engineering majors
I don't really have an opinion one way or another but keep in mind cost of living is higher in Berkeley. Rent and food are both more expensive than southern california (where I am from, actually).
It really depends on what you prioritize. Although Cal engineering may be slightly better than that of UCLA, are you willing to trade that for the pros you listed for LA?

Also, Cal is generally thought to have stressed out, unsocial students but that is not at all the case. There are those people but they aren't the majority. Your social life is what you make it to be.

If I was in your position, I would choose Cal because it's less money, for the semester system, and for the quality of education (although it isn't all that different from LA).
This is what my official admission offer says:

""I understand that I must complete all senior-year courses listed on my application with a minimum unweighted 3.0 GPA for each term, and earn no grade lower than a C for any individual courses.""

I would sign up for a different lab now, keep an eye on the lab you want and switch* in if a spot opens up, and try to negotiate on the first day of class if the second step doesn't work.

*If switching between sections is possible with summer classes? I don't remember and its probably changed since I took a summer class.
Yes

The best answer is it depends on what you want.

There have been some really in depth posts comparing the different residence halls but I can't think how to search for them right now. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/swu1s/which_dorm_should_i_live_in/) a long thread which discusses options. It's 5 years old though so some things are out of date (sorry, reddit search is terrible). Ignore anything about Bowles Hall for sure.

~~Edit: [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/21kjxp/new_admit_question_thread/cgf5g29/) a more recent comment (read the replies).~~ No that's still four years old. Grr.
all l&s undeclared get priority for registration in the lower-div cs courses. upper div priority is reserved for majors.
Yes, whenever my question is unanswered, I always feel like a listless woman in a negligee lying among leaves and toys.

Class registration starts somewhere over the summer, check your calcentral page (if you have one already) for exact dates.
All classes start 10 minutes late. It’s called Berkeley Time. So a class that is listed as 11 starts at 11:10. 
Are you more interested in being in the center of things (restaurants, social things, events)? Then go for the Units (1,2,3 all work)

Would you prefer a quieter environment that is closer to the engineering buildings (especially Soda Hall, where you'll be spending a lot of time)? Then Foothill (/Stern/Bowles as applicable are also worth looking into.)

Clark Kerr is further from main campus but it's apparently quite nice, and the rooms are mostly bigger. I've never actually been there so don't have much to comment.

Some people will say Foothill is socially dead and miserable, but that's not true overall. If your suite is too quiet, find another to hang out in! People tend to be very friendly and open to meeting new people in college, and it helps that you'll have a lot of classmates living near you. I lived in Foothill and loved it -- particularly the fact that I could wake up at 8:03 am and still be on time to my 8am Chem lab :P
Try the units - theyre more social and well connected to the rest of the Berkeley community. The extra 5 minute walk pales in comparison to the sheer loneliness that Foothill residents face 
Obviously there's a huge name recognition difference between the two but I would suspect that you would receive a high amount of resources per student at the honors college. Here, you're thrown in with all the other majors and told to sink or swim (which is good if you're a strong student!). 

I suggest you do your own research as to what benefits you will receive if you choose a smaller school (what kind of interactions can you get with the faculty?). Also, consider who is paying your tuition (if your parents are rich then disregard the cost, but if you're taking out loans then I'm not sure I recommend going to a public school for 60k/yr).

That said, I think the math department and professors here are excellent, and there are lots of opportunities to take high level courses and engage with the professors (nearly all of them are stars/leading experts in their fields).  
I agree with the other answer - the difference between the two schools, both in terms of school rep and quality of opportunities for your major are big enough to justify the investment IF your parents are well off, and you don't have to take significant loans. As an OOS myself, Id say that upto 50k in loans total over four years is the maximum you should aim for - anymore and Penn State is the more responsible choice. The honors college deal sounds good too, but the on campus and post-grad opportunities Berkeley gives is far more imo
Yeah, it's just listed as CS C8.

http://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-fall-compsci-c8-001-lec-001
Definitely, just try and get into it as early as you can
I did easily
I've had friends who skipped half of the lectures due to time conflicts. The slides are pretty good but honestly a large portion of why you take the class is to listen to shenker imo. So yes, but you're losing valuable side commentary and just lecturing in general
No, but you'll be missing out. Shenker is a fantastic lecturer. There's a textbook, but nobody reads it and his slides are good. If you go over slides and go to discussion, then you'll do fine.
Easier than it would be from LnS . Depends on which CoE major - if its EECS then virtually impossible, but for anything else its possible but you need to have a good GPA, take the relevant classes and do well on them. Email your advisor(or any advisor in CoE) 
dw there's one made already, just send the request and wait for it to be approved

I'm in UC Jazz - unlike most schools, our jazz ensembles aren't just restricted to only music majors, and it's quite a good program. Note that we don't have a jazz big band, mostly ensembles of 5-8 people. You could also easily minor or maybe double major in music if you were inclined to.
Berkeley music being somewhat less prestigious actually seemed like a benefit for me, because it meant that more programs were open to non-music majors. UCLA especially gave me the impression of ""there's the orchestra for music majors and really informal stuff for everyone else"". (I was specifically looking at the orchestras so don't know about jazz & marching band.)
what classes have you already taken? 
cs189, ee126, ee127, cs174, cs172, cs164 these are my favorites among the ones you didn't take.
No, it's pretty much the same difficulty grade-wise each semester.
61a isn't curved, so you don't have to worry about competition.

In some cases the grading buckets might be adjusted, but it will never hurt you.
More than half of the students in CS 61A Fall 2017 were not EECS or intended CS, surprisingly.
61a is a very standardized course. It's been the same every sem for about 10 years now. Nothing will change. You'll be fine.
You can view grade distributions here. https://www.berkeleytime.com/grades . It does seem like upper division chemistry and chem e classes are curved to as low as a 2.7 or 2.8 average (though some are much higher), whereas upper division physics is usually around 3.0, and I think a lot of the college of engineering might be too. 

I'm a first year chem e major now and I think fellow students are usually pretty supportive. That said, the vibe from the chemistry  department in chem 4ab is really that they don't care about quality education, and I haven't heard great things about the teaching in chem e. But this was just my experience, we had bad professors for the first 3/4 of the year and now that we have a good one things are much better. 

With limited experience, I have a much higher opinion of departments like physics and materials science than chem and chem e, but that is probably mostly due to my professors and interests. 

I don't know if this helps. I would be sure to ask some upper division chem e majors. 
If you login via Calcentral and go to the ""Academics"" tab, on the right side there is a list of steps for ""Fall 2018"".  In those tabs should tell you your phase 1 and phase 2 dates.

When your phase 1 starts, you can register up to 12 units (about 3 classes). Phase 2 lets you register up to 16 units (or slightly more, forgot). 

You don't HAVE to add your phase 1 classes on the date that is stated on calcentral, that date just says when you CAN start to add them (although waiting longer might put you on a waitlist). You can add classes anytime between that date and when phase 1 closes, same idea applies for phase 2. You can see when phase 1 and 2 end here (http://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/UCB_StudentEnrollmentCalendar_2018-19_V1.pdf)
Sounds weird... just email the tech support office. I guarantee you though, the deadline is unimportant and nothing whatsoever will happen if you create your Calnet in late April (the horror)
Bowles hall was formed specifically for this purpose - it's more expensive, but you get the close-knit community, as well as nicer rooms and all that. You should check that out and apply
bowles, or maybe clark kerr (although with CK it really depends on who's on your floor)
I think most people in the radius of the green circle walk, bike, or take public transit. Parking is tight enough on campus that you might spend as much time looking for a spot as you would have sitting on the bus. (Although I'm guessing this from friends' complaints; I never had to park on campus.)

Another possibility to try to get residential street parking on Northside or Southside. That's through the city; I don't know the rules but it didn't seem difficult for my roommates to get. Another possible option is to rent a parking space from someone with an appartment close to campus -- this tends to be very ad hoc, and I'm not sure how to search for people selling spots systematically. I sometimes see people asking/offering on the Free and For Sale facebook group.
I rent a parking space from a local property management company for 100$/month. There are often lots of spaces available on Craigslist for less just depends on where.  
Are you a freshman or (junior) transfer? If freshman, not likely and a double will not be the end of the world. Why ""quite obviously""? You're lucky you didn't get a triple haha! Anyways, if youre a transfer, it's possible, but not common at all.
I think the biggest misconception of Berkeley (the campus and students) is that it's very politically active and this pervades the entire scene. It gets that way during election seasons(so 2020 maybe a bit weird) but generally speaking, vast majority of students are politically inactive and apathetic, and in the past year Ive seen so many people actually shift right in their views. Your experience depends on the kind of role you'll take here at Cal - are you a conservative student, but not really vocally so, and not engaged in campus politics(BCR, etc)? Or do you plan on joining the political scene and spreading Republican discourse?

If it's the former - that you have conservative views but don't plan on joining the political scene - then you have no worries, imo. No one cares, and even several liberal students(most) dislike the protests (and riots that happen once every two years). You'll be totally fine.
If it's the latter, you'll probably have your share of unpleasant interactions because you're putting yourself out there, but there are several organizations (BCR, Conservative Society, BridgeCal, whatever) that you can find friends in.

Generally speaking, CS/Engineering/Haas/Econ/most other majors have several moderateish people in them. If you associate with people in Ethnic Sudies, Gender Studies and Sociology, then they will dislike you. A lot of what I said is applicable to any college campus, imo

Good goups to join - Greek life(very very moderate/libertarian), business/consulting organizations, tech/engineering project teams, neutral politics-related groups( Political Review, MUN, etc)
I think the answer depends a lot on you as a person and what works for you, and I highly recommend you visit campus to see for yourself if that's possible. 

I don't come from a conservative background, so I don't know if I can address your question, but it's a good one and I wanted to try (plus I've spent so long on this answer I just want to post something at least).

The general public discourse both on campus and around town is notably liberal, so if being surrounded by that is going to make you unhappy then Berkeley is a bad choice. 

However, the majority of students are not politically active and are also just trying to have a good time and do well in their classes. This does depend somewhat on your major (if you want to do e.g. Chicano Studies it's probably impossible to avoid politics), but in engineering and stem I think people mostly don't care -- or at least prioritize classes and getting along over picking political fights.

Again, the background culture is liberal. I've heard CS professors crack jokes about conservatives in the middle of lecture (not all the time, but a few times). Some people will complain/say mean things about conservatives in your hearing (although if they are decent people they'll stop if you ask them to).

I've been thinking my most useful contribution might be this anecdote:

* My first semester was Fall 2012, and I had a floormate who was a vocal Romney supporter -- she wasn't actively campaigning, but if discussion turned to the election she wasn't afraid to bring up her support and why she supported him. I remember a conversation a few weeks before election day where she said she was feeling very alone -- not because anyone had given her a hard time, but because in most conversations she was the only Romney supporter debating multiple Obama supporters. As far as I know this stopped being an issue after the election. In other ways she was a very good fit for Berkeley.

So that's the closest to an answer I think I can settle on. If you find you're a good fit in other ways, and especially if you find a community that works for you, the larger cultural or political differences may not matter much at all. [Mostly tangential: I see from your post history that you're into rock climbing, which is really big in Berkeley. [Cal Climbing](https://climbing.berkeley.edu/) is a big and active student group, and there's a handful of indoor gyms and outdoor sites in the area. I'm particularly partial to Bridges -- it's where I got started, and I miss it...]

Berkeley is not even nearly as liberal as people think it is. Especially if you study STEM, no one will give a shit because everyone is super worried about that test next week.
International CS student here (I graduated last year). In your last year you apply to OPT. OPT allows you to work 3 years in US (1 year if not STEM). You have 3 months after college to find a job. In STEM 3 months is WAY WAY WAY more than what you need. You can easily find a job in a couple months. I don't know anyone who didn't find a job before graduation.

You first apply OPT. You wait 90 days. From the days OPT gets to you, you have 3 months to find a job. Otherwise you need to leave US and apply to H1B or other visas to come back.

Good luck
Definitely doable if you're not worried about declaring. 

If you're worried *at all* then drop one of 110 or 70 (you have two choices - if you're already good at proofs then do 110 to really sharpen skills and then ace 70) or do take standard way and take 70 to prep you for 110 (if you don't know how to already do proofs). 

Are you freshman? Do not take Math 110 before CS 70, bad idea, CS 70 is designed to increase mathematical maturity as a passage to upperdiv math/cs classes. Also 61B without 61A?
Hey so I'm in the BioE/MSE joint major but I started in straight BioE so maybe I can help. So I would say that it isn't hard to fit in a couple other classes without falling behind, since most people AP out of a lot of prereqs. A lot of people get minors, do joint majors, or say that they are going to do a double with BioE/EECS and then just switch to EECS. I haven't seen anyone do what you are describing and I'm assuming it would actually be really hard since Haas is so competitive. So I would say it is feasible, but an Econ minor or something might be more realistic. 
That said, if you know you want to pursue the Haas route, it is easy to switch out of BioE and into L&S, which would give you much more freedom. 
Just switch out of bioE if you're not interested in it. Conversely, know that you dont need to be in Haas to work in IB/consulting - just keep a high gpa and join business frats/consulting clubs/ investment groups

There is no such thing, it's just one major. You can take a blend of EE and CS classes, and are required to take the intro classes for each.
A lot of people have them both on and off campus. Off campus jobs are usually service jobs. On campus jobs include service jobs and office jobs. Time management is completely up to you and your schedule.
Can't speak for CS, but I did my degree in MEB in CNR (finished ~5 years ago). I took a lot of ""pre-med""/MCB classes and a lot of CNR biology classes too. Depending on your major, the required courses for a CNR degree might draw from a lot of other colleges. I definitely wouldn't say the CNR classes were easier or less rigorous. As /u/pourover_and_pbr said, they tend to be smaller and more hands-on. That means the classes can be more fun/engaging, but also that exams can cover a really deep level of understanding since the professors have time to grade each exam in-depth. For that reason, some of my CNR biology classes required a lot more study time than some of my MCB biology classes. Overall, there are going to be strong and weak classes in every college.

CNR has some definite advantages: smaller number of total students, more access to major advisors, access to neat electives with field research components, exposure to the north side of campus, a more accessible undergraduate sponsored research projects program (SPUR)... I have no regrets at all re. choosing MEB over MCB. I always felt that I had all the access I needed to MCB classes.
I’ve taken a few classes in CNR and they tend to be more hands-on and smaller lectures. Definitely easier than CS or pre-med intro classes, although you might have to take a few hard pre-reqs depending on your major. 
If the class takes 750 (what I gleaned from [berkeleytime](https://www.berkeleytime.com/enrollment/?course1=2327-fall-2018-all)), your chances are very good. 10% is a good rule of thumb for getting off the waitlist.

edit: link
Depends on the popularity of the program. I think the Asian American one was pretty popular, since some people I know applied and didn't get it. I don't know about the other programs though.

Honestly, it sounds as if you've already made your decision. If you look over your comment and look at all the positive versus negative things you've said about Berkeley/UCLA, the answer should be pretty clear. At least, it is to me. I know what I would do in your shoes.

That being said, Berkeley is really what you make of it. Half of my friends hate it here and half of my friends love it here, but I know few people that regret coming.

I know plenty of people in the STEM majors who have become depressed here due to academic stress, but there are also people who thrive. It all depends on the expectations you come in with, what you make of the experience, and the support network you put effort into building.

Personally, I'm pretty chill about everything so I don't get super stressed about academics and have had great experiences because I've put in the effort to be involved in on\-campus activities and make amazing friends.

FYI, Berkeley is still #1 in the world according to many rankings. :\(
I do agree that chem e at berkeley, along with anything else would b real hard. I think this depend on your goals. Do you want to graduate with a job (and have a better chance at that) or do you want to risk some hard work but get rewarded for all the network and ambition that you can get only at Berkeley. I think you can get a cushiony job anywhere, even from a california state university. What sets Berkeley apart is the drive to push forward and the environment (which you do not seem to like). The intense competition can make you loyal friends and give you the ambition that will stay with you long after you get your first job………
Wharton is the best business school. If you want to work on Wall Street go there. If you want to work in Silicon Valley come to Berkeley and do MET. Both schools are cutthroat for business students but you avoid the whole pre\-Haas circus as a MET student.
I would argue UC Berkeley has a better name brand and prestige than Penn... I actually didn't know Penn was an Ivy league before your post, hah. 

Berkeley really isn't dangerous, the homeless problem kinda sucks though. And the housing situation is pretty atrocious.

edit: If Penn is your dream school, go for it.

Im gonna guess it was 1:4 single gender to coed based on the amount of people in each one. The smaller suites <10 people were at the ends of the floors while the coed sections were larger and in the middle. 
From friends' opinions several years ago: some enjoyed Phil3, and one friend strongly disliked Phil12A but she was coming from a math/compsci background and at least part of her issues were professor specific (don't know who the professor was). Sorry this is vague, hopefully you can find some people with more experience in Phil classes to give advice.
2) I feel like the mini-suites are significantly less social than the other dorms because they don't have regular doubles and triples. 
Doing anything at Berkeley will give you far more opportunities than at BC, unless you're really interested in getting involved in DC politics - I think Boston College has some very good ties for that. IF you're interested in the traditional fields - consulting, banking, management, accounting, marketing or even unrelated stuff(tech, etc.) Berkeley is far better, Imo. Also has a better reputation, for what it's worth. Try your best to get into Haas(its 35% acceptance rate) but Econ/Data Science/Math/Humanities/anything else will be fine from a recruiting standpoint. Plus, you can always take classes from the business school.

The important thing is to get involved in the business community - join a professional fraternity or a consulting/banking/marketing/entrepreneurship club, and these networks and experiences will be far more important. There are far more of these kinds of opportunities(clubs, orgs etc that all have ties to Haas) here than at BC. 

Of course, there's an above 35% chance you'll get into Haas, in which case you're golden. Just know that if you don't make it, it's not the end of the world - you can still achieve all of your goals and more. And if Cal is cheaper, this is a no-brainer, Imo, unless you reaaaaaallly want to study business at any cost and nothing else
Pretty much guaranteed you'll get in.
Just do whatever you're more interested in - if you want to learn CS theory go with CS. If you want to learn stat theory, do stats/data science. You don't get any preferential treatment for a minor so it doesn't really matter in the long run anyways. 
Does your scholarship cover housing on campus as well (i.e., did you get a full-ride)?  If it just covers tuition, your housing status should make no difference. If you got a full-cost-of-attendance scholarship, however, your housing spot has likely been reserved for you, and if you turned down housing they aren't just going to hand the cash to you, heh. If it's a  Stamps scholarship or something, being a resident might be part of the package that you can't ""decline"", strictly speaking. 

In any event, if your housing is covered, take it. People who live on-campus tend to do better academically, for a variety of reasons. Plus, mom and dad don't need to know everything. >:)

Edit: It's really none of my business,  but I saw your post from a month ago,. Be aware that Berkeley has some pretty good counselors who have lots of experience and ""get it. "" just something to keep in mind.
> Is it possible to switch majors to CS

There's really no hard-set rule on you sticking with Applied Math as your major. Technically, seeing as though you are coming in undeclared, you can just take the required CS61a/b + CS 70 like any CS-intended transfer would and then submit your CS declaration. No one would bat an eye. 
Since you're in L&S, you can definitely take CS courses and get a minor. I'm not sure how declaring works for CS, so you might not be able to major in it.
Keep in mind that Data Science at Cal was just recently implemented not too long ago and will be seeing its inaugural roll out this Fall so I wouldn't worry too much on having any prereqs completed - especially as a transfer. Looking at the structure of the major, many of the classes you are required to take emulate the CS breadth which means that those classes can all be scrunched into a typical 4-semester schedule and maybe with some space/time to spare. 

https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba

Hey, Applied Math/CS major here, looking to add Data Science as a third. There is a ton of overlap between all 3 majors, so prerequisite wise you should be able to complete the major in time for all of them, given you've finished up to discrete mathematics. Berkeley, however, is a little weird in it's crediting policy for courses from other schools, so I would check with an L&S advisor to be sure!

Also, data science course wise, look on the major page! There are only two hard data science courses you have to take, 8 and 100. The rest are stats or cs classes, and a few general ed ones.
Cafe 3 is completely vegetarian, so if you want meat you'd probably be eating at Crossroads. It's not ~that~ far, so you could walk if you really wanted to live at unit 3.

I'm not sure why you would though, unit 1/2 are way better. 
I’m at unit 3 and I walk to crossroads all the time. Never went to cafe 3 except in orientation week
Cafe 3 isn't completely vegetarian (they have 1 meat option daily I think). Definitely easy to walk to crossroads though, it's really not far at all. 
i live in unit 1 and walk to cafe 3 to eat daily; pretty sure it wouldn't be difficult to do the opposite.
Yup I'm pretty sure you still can!
it gets updated!
[deleted]
No. It doesn't really make sense to drop stuff during dead week...
Ok, I'm honestly confused by how UCLA does it because I don't care. I was turned off by the 3.3 or 3.5 they require as a transfer after you get there. At least at Berkeley, you only need a 2.7 as a pre-econ in the pre-reqs. I made it with an A in Stat 131a and an A- with Econ 100a w/ Kamala. I was lucky that my professor was new for 131a and she is not teaching this semester [Saharan].

I don't like the Econ major because I did not like the environment of the classes and I am really graphically challenged. Chances are that Stat 20 is going to screw you GPA-wise, so go for Stat C8 with Stat 88 [it'll be 6 units] and take 100a with Acland or 100B with Hawkins. It honestly depends if you want to take a more math-oriented econ class first or an econ class that requires you to understand graphs. 

I like EEP better because the people are way more chill in general. I also developed mental problems coming to this school. I am sad and have a lack of self worth. If you succeeded socially in high school, you're going to be fine. I did not. I was that person that was really into movies and into my GPA. 
They definitely won't rescind you without first consulting with you. If you're really only taking one class and your cumulative GPA is otherwise strong I don't think you're at risk.
My best friend was a transfer English major, and she found the department and student body very welcoming. Obviously the workload is intense but she never felt the other students were competitive or cutthroat as far as I know.

I don't know anything about UCSB's English program or Berkeley's journalism certificate (though here are some Daily Cal people in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8fkyyo/is_the_daily_cal_really_that_bad/) who might know about the latter). But I hope this is helpful and good luck making your decision!
Go for the best English program in the nation!
Phoenix Consulting works with biotech/healthcare/pharma, if you're interested in consulting, but it's not that technical.
> How hard is it to declare CS as a transfer at Cal?

There is no major cap constraint here at Cal. If you can obtain the minimum 3.3 GPA in the three required classes (cs 61a/b and 70) then you're golden. Here's the kicker though: these three classes are made to weed out the weak or ill-prepared. I like to think of it like the Navy SEAL training process. Anyone can sign up to be a Navy SEAL (provided that you meet some minimum requirements of course) but first, all prospects must go through what they call BUDS training. This is nothing but 6 months of ass kicking. Now, if you're able to survive through the end you're in. The thing is most do not.

> CS at UW vs CS at Cal?

I don't have any data nor experience in the UW system/area. I'd maybe suggest asking someone in the UW subreddit who is majoring in CS for some advise. As far as Cal is concerned: well Cal is Cal. top contender in STEM research. Recognizable by any/every major tech company. Beautiful weather. Terrible housing options. Homeless epidemic. Little-to-no parking. 

> what if I wanted to double major with media studies? Would that be at all viable considering that I’m a transfer student?

Double-majoring is possible as a transfer but only for certain STEM-related majors. Keep in mind that we only have at most 5 semesters to complete our CS track here so trying to fit in a whole other major which no CS cross over is quite tough. The strategy when it comes to double majoring anything with CS is to take up another major that over laps with CS i.e. stats, math, cog sci, etc. Most of these major allow most CS classes as electives which allows you to kill several birds at once. If you are really hard pressed on filme/media then I guess a solution could be that you can take 18+ units each semester and also give up your summers for summer classes, but that's definitely not recommended tradeoff. Summers are usually reserved for internships. If you really want to scratch your media itch while also getting your CS done then there are a few film/media classes that satisfy as tech electives so I would look into those if interested.

Any other questions about the CS transfer life let me know!
yeah u good
as a freshman, i'd strongly recommend you just stay in the dorms and make friends with other freshmen!
[deleted]
Yes. They have a link to a report on bCourses. 
I'm not sure on the cap, but from my friends' experiences petitioning doesn't seem to difficult -- they usually approve it without much questioning. So I'd try to petition anyways.
Very very easy to petition it; just go to the L & S office and fill out a form signed by the advisor present there and hand it in. People routinely take above the unit cap; you'll be fine.
No, you can see your roommates on the portal a week or so before your move-in date. Your housing offer will be released earlier than this, though.
Attending rush events for the sororities you're interested in is the best way to figure out if you get along with the girls that are currently there.

It depends on where the units are from.

If you have over 89 units from both CC and UC (say you took a summer or cross enrolled course), your application will not be considered.

If it's just from CC, you are fine.
Congratulations!

>Also, how friendly/helpful would you consider your UCB peers to be?

In my very own experience, I have found most people here, in general, to be cold and unfriendly. Perhaps there's a different culture in your particular department, though.
I'm also an incoming transfer so I can't answer your second q, but according to this [50% of astrophys](https://career.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Survey/2017Astrophysics.pdf) majors attended grad school right after undergrad so probably not very difficult :) I'm sure astrophys schools know UCB is a difficult, top program and will forgive a lower GPA.
Phase 1 for sure, it's one of the most popular classes on campus.
0 tolerance policy for what?

You come into the university as undeclared. You fulfill lower div reqs and then declare a major. If you get in, you will be considered undeclared until you finish the required lower divs for MCB and then apply for the major. It doesn't matter what major you applied for.

Check [this website](https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/transfers-berkeley/transfer-student-faqs) for more info on declaring and other stuff (I am assuming you are a transfer student).

If you score highly enough in certain exams, you may be able to pass out of breadth or lower div requirements, depending on your college and major. ([Here](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2016-17-undergraduate-guide/2016-17-exams-ap-ib-level-and-transfer-credit-information) are CoE's rules, scroll down for IB.) Otherwise no it doesn't matter much.
It's not late at all. Honestly, for the fall semester, I'd say its early. Go for it.
Almost 100%
I would be legitimately astonished if you didn't
Yes. 61A usually expands to accept everyone on the wait list.
me too can’t find it :/
Not in it, but looking to go from CS to it since there's an AI domain emphasis. It's very doable, they've made it accessible to everyone.
Wow, everyone going for CS/Haas.
(Also interested in answer)
Yes
[assist.org](http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html) should tell you if your specific class fulfills those requirements.
I can't speak to that class, but I believe it's possible to take your R&C requirement at a community college if you wanted to go that route.
[deleted]
A lot of this comes down to what  you are specifically looking for in a residence hall. Here's a few things to structure your thinking, if you answer them, I'll try to help you out

 - How important is it to you to be able to basically roll out of bed in the morning and be on campus? Would you mind taking a 10-15 minute walk to get to further classes?

 - How much do you value the size of your room? Will you be spending a lot of time in it?

 - How social of a person will you want to be? Are you more interested in peace and quiet or in a lively environment?

 - How much do you care about the ""pristine""-ness of the environment you live in? Do you need things to be beautiful, or is functional totally fine?

 - Do you go to the gym often? Do you swim often? Do you like to hike/have convenient access to nature? Does your proximity to services that facilitate that matter to you?

 - How close of a community do you want your floor/building to be? Is this something you value?

Obviously include other important things to you if there's something these questions didn't touch on, and I'll try to help you pick, cause I know I was really lost two years back when I was in your shoes.

Lol CS and ChemE is possible but extremely difficult just because you have to fulfill requirements for both college of chem and for L&S. Plus, ChE is one of the most requirement heavy majors and therefore one of the most restricting. I wouldn’t recommend attempting both; probably best to just leave ChE and pursue CS (which is the general sentiment I get from friends that have tried to double in ChE and CS) 
hard as fuck. think about why you would want to major in both. If it is to be marketable and be aligned with the tech boom and software engineer life then either go to a bootcamp or just self-study CS. I mean if you wanted to major in it you probably don't hate it so shouldn't be a problem learning on your own. Even better if you like it. Both have nearly the best career opportunities with CS --> software engineer and Chem E --> engineer for whatever but at least you make decent $ especially petroleum so can't go wrong with either necessarily if you care about post-grad $$$. If you are dying to become a software engineer at Uber or some shit then do CS but there are plenty of people like you competing to declare (need 3.3 average which is B+ in three lower-divs to declare hence every intended CS major can't declare). gl
They tend to room transfers together -- I don't know if they do that automatically or if you have to specifically request it, but my friends who were transfers and lived in the dorms mostly had other transfers for roommates.
Yes....? It's running this week so probably it will run for the rest of the summer....
Yes. There's classes happening through the summer.
Transfers get to enroll in courses for fall during Golden Bear Advising starting June 13, I believe! You'll get a task in CalCentral around then. Best of luck!

54 is sort of required. Not sure if it's different for transfers (probably not), but the two paths are

ee16a + ee16b 

OR

Math 54 + ee16b

The ee16 series is basically linear algebra taught by the EECS department, in case you're confused. If you choose to do math 54, you'll have to learn the circuits part of the class on your own for ee16b, which you must take to graduate.

A normal course load is typically 2 techs, 2 filler (breadths, electives, whatever). However, as a transfer you might be expected to take more technicals per semester. 
Hi! Fellow CS-intended transfer here for Fall 2018 (but taking 61A during this summer). I would take EE16A instead of MATH54 considering you need EE16B 
Math 54 is no longer required as other commenters mentioned. For what it's worth though, I took Math 54 and the EE16 series and felt that Math 54 did a better job of teaching linear algebra and differential equations. Just my $.02. Some others may disagree with me
You have to declare a major in your first semester, but if the only class you need to declare physics is Physics 7C just take that first semester and declare Physics.
What about physics 89
Your program might give it to you during orientation, but many grad programs don't and you can just go to the office at any point and get it. 
Definitely depends a little bit, but not a huge difference between the other units. Much more dependent on the people you end up living around. 
[deleted]
Should be fine
If you're MCB/IB, it's recommended you take the Math 10 series for med school, but in 10A they go through some core calc concepts pretty quickly so there's time for stats in the latter part of the course. 10A and 10B use a lot of derivation and integration so it's key that you are good at these two.

You can also consider taking the Math 1 series and then a stats class. It's three classes as opposed to two, but the Math 1 series is only calc, so it'll give you a stronger foundation. 

If you want to avoid as much calc as possible and confident in at least derivation and integration, take the 10 series. If you want to get better at calc, take the 1 series and then a stats class for med school.

Edit: For science, most freshman take Chem 1A or Bio 1B their first semester. That, along with math and breadth/AC course(s) would be a typical schedule.
The recommended schedule is usually Chem 1A/1AL and Math 10A (or whatever math you’re doing) first semester. Then you can throw in a breadth/R&C class. After that, you can either add a fourth class or start light by taking a freshman seminar or decal.

It is also dependent on what major you’re planning on. This would be perfect for MCB/IB but might need adjustment if you plan on a different route.
[deleted]
units imo 
It depends on how good you are at at least one of the techs. You would be taking 3 techs, but certainly some people come in good enough at calc 2/CS that one of 61a/math 1b isn't really a problem.

But if you're not confident then it's too much. Also, you don't need to take physics at all in L&S CS. It's nice if you want to learn physics, but I wouldn't put it in the first semester then. Chill out.

Same for your 2nd semester; 3 techs before you get a taste of Berkeley courses isn't a good idea. You also don't need 53 lol, but ee16a is highly recommended. You need to complete ee16b to graduate, and ee16a gives you the circuits knowledge over 54.

Basically I'd say both are a little too hard, especially trying to do 3 techs + r1b in your first semester. R1B courses aren't necessarily a joke, and all of the easy R1B classes are already full now.
I would say the first schedule is on the hard side but certainly possible. Don’t expect an easy ride, but I’d say try it out if you wan t
First is pretty hard and second is still hard as well. Rhetoric R1B is a pain if you really are against writing essays. You're AP classes and scores don't mean much IMO and writing that you've never established a work ethic can be a nail in the coffin in terms of your GPA/first semester life. You might be better off doing 1B equivalent requirement at berkeley city college or alameda community college (friends did that to satisfy requirement because HW in 1B is hella dumb. Class is ""easy"" since it is mainly just extra stuff added onto Calc like interesting methods for integrals and series and the like but hella homework even to just copy). GL anyways
So I’ve decided to take all these tips and change some stuff up, make it a little easier. I’ll be keeping CS61A and Math 1B, but take Intro to Astronomy and I’m thinking Reading and Comp B for fall. Does that sound better? I’m still 50/50 on astronomy and reading+comp. Any recommendations for classes to take freshman year that would satisfy my English B req and another breadth would be much appreciated! Thank you. 
Why not consider doing Conservation and Resource Studies? You only have to take Bio 1B as a pre-req for that. Plus you get to design your own major, in a sense, which is super cool. You can check out more info here: https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/CRS%20Major%20Snapshot.pdf

You'd still have to transfer to CNR, but it's very doable (I did it and they really didn't make it that hard for me).
So I looked at the lower div requirements [here](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/environmental-sciences/#majorrequirementstext) and looks like for all three concentrations you're gonna have to take chem and physics. You'll definitely take Chem 1a which is general chemistry, so like AP chemistry but faster to cover all the material in a semester. You might take Chem 3a too, which is the first semester of organic chemistry. Physics 8 series is as difficult as AP Physics C is, and Physics 7 series has the same material but is harder. 

So basically the only physics and chemistry you'll have is in your lower div requirements, but considering how well you did on your HS courses, you may struggle a lot. Don't worry though, just get plenty of help!

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: I don't remember how difficult it is to transfer colleges, but I'm pretty sure others have asked the same thing. Try searching on this subreddit for the same question.
If you're going to take physics, take Physics for Future Presidents. It's intended for people like you, who aren't too serious about physics but still covers the breath.  
Physics 8 is like AP Physics, 7 is harder, and run away from 5 as it's for physics majors only.
i doubt that if you get off the waitlist and are accepted that they will RECIND your NEW ACCEPTANCE unless you get like hella Ds. C's are fine. Don't worry about it too much though. Just focus on passing high school classes. 3 A's and a F < 4 C's AFAIK. 
Sorry, no legit animal shelter is going to let an international student adopt a dog.

Dogs require more time and money than you'd think. Also keep in mind most landlords don't allow dogs... if they do most will require ""interviewing"" the dog... and if you get far you get the honor of paying an extra pet rent+deposit.

Although if you/your family own a house/condo over here that makes things more plausible.

I recommend you first volunteer at an animal shelter/be a foster home for dogs. Maybe even do Rover for a bit to get your doggo fix.
Not sure if you'll get kicked, but if you sign up for any summer classes and drop all of them you get charged the [$100 cancellation fee](http://summer.berkeley.edu/application/fees).
Don't take 2 major requirements in the same semester. If you want to take another class, then take a breath over Math 55. However, I would recommend taking a DeCal or a Freshman Seminar instead of another class, as 16 units tends to be tough for incoming freshman considering how Berkeley is.
The R&C classes are pretty much all useless. I actually took colwrit r4b and we talked about our feelings for an hour and then wrote reflections on the discussions. We didn't really do anything in terms of learning about writing. 

The class wasn't curved as nicely as other r1bs in other departments. I would just pick whichever class has the highest grade distributions from berkeleytime. 

https://www.berkeleytime.com/catalog/
click the reading and composition b requirement on the left and sort by average grade.
Personally I think Math 55 is fine to pair with 54, it's a fairly low stress class. It'd be good to take it before you start taking math upper divs, too. The only problem is that R4B can be time intensive (especially if you aren't naturally good at writing). If intro to biomedicine is a breadth, I'd recommend P/NPing it so you can focus on your technicals.
What you have planned is fine. Don't overload your first semester but two technical courses should be fairly okay, given that you are fairly advanced already. Though others might have differing opinions, I think it would be a good idea to try and hit the ground running to develop a good work ethic/intuition for the subject quickly, rather than drag this process out. My best advice is to work at a level where you're feeling just a little bit stressed; what this level is differs from person to person based on background, and in the end only you can be the judge of that.
How far away are the two classes? Many people have back-to-back classes, which is why all classes run on “Berkeley time”. They start 10 minutes after the hour.

Edit: I just realized that “after the hour” is not always relevant. What I meant was “10 minutes after the scheduled time”. Some classes are scheduled at, say, 12:30. So they would actually start at 12:40.
Depends on the class. The worse case is that they do quizzes in section, but they usually do those in the beginning after Berkeley time. Apart from that you're free to go whenever.

You won’t have to leave early. You’ll have enough time thanks to Berkeley time to get there 
Perfectly fine. I've had schedules with 3-4 classes back to back. Even if 10 minutes aren't enough to walk from class to class, which was the case for some of my class (mostly soda -> sproulish or back, takes ~15 minutes), remember that this isn't high school; it's perfectly fine to leave 10 minutes early or arrive 10 minutes late. No one cares.
Every class will start 10 minutes after so math 53 won't start till 5:10 you're fine. It's totally normal to have back to back classes. 
Actually it’s good to have back to back classes because you then don’t have awkward breaks in between. Berkeley time will take care of all of that
Seems like a fairly reasonable schedule. As for 77, *it's not a physics requirement* (merely suggested, the text on the department website is somewhat misleading), and next semester's instructor is a rather unpredictable grader, so it may not be the wisest choice. I suggest knocking out one of the reading and composition requirements if you need it (should be 4 units, graded) rather than taking French 13 and the Freshman Seminar. Or else take some other breadth.
Just gonna say that this is a doable schedule. While I think people sometimes get something out of 77, my recommendation is to just learn coding through research
Yes. It depends on what FAFSA awards you 
i havent heard of anyone getting rescinded unless they failed a class (and the very few cases i've heard was that they failed classes required to get their highschool diploma)
option 1 > 3. option 2 seems ill advised unless you are trying to become a phys major or you are eecs.

but also have you thought about just taking cs61a/ee16a/math53? it would be more concepts but when you inevitably take 110 it might be helpful to have linear algebra reinforced across multiple semesters. tbh you say you dont want to start out behind but it sounds like you're already a year ahead of those who didnt have the option to skip 1A/1B. 

but i dont actually recommend you take 3 techs your first semester here, it's really not a good idea for freshmen who arent used to berkeley and berkeley classes.
[deleted]
I can't speak on the other classes, but I do have experience with Data8. How much experience do you have with stats and coding?
I'll chime in a bit about chinese1x: language classes feel more like a highschool course rather than a university course just because the way to practice language is to use it every day, rather than mull over theoretics. i'm not sure of your background in chinese, but i've heard it's pretty straightforward to do well in those courses.

also it's a great place to meet fellow bears due to daily meetings and small class sizes. just know, i dont believe it fills requirements like international studies.
Email your advisor or admissions officer! They’ll be able to help you. If you warn them, they can advise on next steps etc. 
I drink water unfiltered but chilled. It's not amazing but it's at least decent.
I was in the same situation as you last semester, except I was not a transfer student. I had the same fears, though! All my friends basically graduated and moved on; I kind of thought of it as a new slate, a fresh start.

Are you first gen/low income/an underrepresented minority? If so, I recommend getting into contact with EOP + signing up for the coops ASAP. Housing was very stressful for me too, but once I decided to come back, I put my name on the coop list to ensure I did not have to worry about housing on top of the many anxieties that came with re-enrolling. If you don't get a spot in fall (idk how likely this is since I know the list is known to be hella long) or you are not about that coop life, you should stalk the FB housing page--there are always spots opening up throughout the year.

I know that feel of being scared to start again. But honestly, it is just something you have to go through. The process of readmission + getting back my financial aid + finishing my first semester back after a few semesters away from Berkeley was challenging, but definitely do-able. I made it a point to focus on academics my first semester back and put everything else on the back burner so I was well adjusted with the workload + life at Cal in general, but also made a point to have fun when I earned it. Happy to say that after only a semester of being back, I have snagged myself a work study job, been elected an officer position in an organization I am involved with, and have made small steps towards building my network of friends. If I can do it, so can you!

You got this, fam :) PM me if you have any questions! 
Med school require 2 semesters of Bio + lab. Not sure if chem bio requires you to take MCB 110L, but if you want to forgo Bio 1B you would have to.
If you look at the graduation worksheet (at least EECS), there is a humanities table. Says you have to take 6. 2 are half filled as R&C. So yes.
Just message your advisor or admissions or whatever. In general you'll probably be fine, Berkeley rarely rescinds anyone.

>As a second quick question: is it easy to get into L&S CS as second major (having been accepted into L&S)?

The process is the same for everyone, and it just depends on how good you are at the subject. Can you get a 3.3 GPA in CS61ab + CS70? That's all that matters. If you get it, you're in the major. If you don't, you're out. 
That's what they estimate housing and food to cost for the purposes of financial aid.
That’s a pretty low estimate. I cook all my meals and live at a cheap place and my cost is a bit more than that.
You'll probably get a refund at the beginning of the semester. They just use it to calculate aid
Nah doesn't translate into a grade. AP scores don't mean much, especially after HS
There's a bunch of statistics, probability, and differential equations that the 10 series covers but the 1 series won't. The 1 series also explores more calculus topics whereas the 10 series focuses on the more essential ones. According to [the MCB website](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/major/major-requirements/requirements) it says both series are fine but the 10 series is preferred.
Getting from Berkeley to OAK is easy if u take the BART. For OAK, take the downtown BART station (located on Shattuck) and take the Warm Springs/South Fremont line, then get off at Coliseum. There will be a platform that takes you straight to OAK. It'll cost you some money, not sure how much though, maybe \~$8\-10. Probably takes around 40 minutes.

If you have a party (3\-4 or more) it might be cheaper and faster to uber straight to the airport.
deCals are classes that aren't specifically ""classes"", if that makes sense. They're a lot more specialized and can be taught by current students, not just professors. They can be anything like cooking, fencing, Kanye West, Harry Potter, playing the Campanile bells, etc. They count for 2 units. You don't sign up for those until after the semester has started, so it's nothing you have to really worry about now.
awesomebuffalo gave a good answer. Here's their [website](https://decal.berkeley.edu/) for more information. Information on fall Decals should be posted sometime in August I think.
yes this is pretty standard for those who did not / could not take BC calc. just know 1b is known to be a pretty hard course, try not to take more than 2 techs/semester if it is tough your first semester. (although know that you should not be looking to take math53/54 if you're going to be a CS major, you should be taking ee16a/b)
Unit 3 is nice because it's really close to campus and the RSF. It's uglier than unit 1 & 2 imo, but shouldn't really matter. Plus you get the benefit of having bear market and cafe 3 right next to you!

When I first applied to housing I really wanted a double, but i got a triple instead. That turned out to be the best thing in my life, since I met my two best friends that way. However, I've heard from other friends nightmare stories of their roommates, so it can go both ways. I loved the triple, it was kinda small but felt really cozy (i pretty much never left my room).
Jeez man it feels like they gave all the transfers triples in unit 3. I'm not going to accept it at all.
At some point during the summer, you'll get to select your move-in slot for housing. At that time, you're ""allowed"" to move into your dorm. Then you move in, pretty self-explanatory. It takes a good few hours probably, and it gets chaotic because there are thousands of others doing the same thing.

You can buy your mom a flight and have her leave the same day, but you'd have to make it work with the timing. Good luck!
That's because there are lots of different times for discussion, so the lecture time doesn't change, but there are like 5 or 6 different times when discussion may be held. Also, as incoming MCB freshmen as well, how are you meeting the unit requirements? I'll have to take like 5 classes to get past 13, but everyone on this thread seems to only be taking 3 or 4 at most
Unit 3 isn't actually as bad as people say it is (you have Bear Market and Cafe 3 right next door), but if you can find a reasonable place off-campus with friends then definitely go for it
Well, you're not definitely not too behind on the housing hunt, people are starting to move out of their places as most leases run to their end at this time (July 31st ish) If you're not on the Berkeley free and for sale page and off campus housing facebook pages get on those asap as well as craigslist. You might be able to snag a double thats open for two people, triples with 3 open spots might be hard because most posts I've seen are people who are looking for someone to fill just one or two spots.  But also, you'd probably save tons of money going off campus anyway. GL
It’s a ton of reading. I know a lot of stem students who struggle with the workload of Classics R44 and aren’t prepared for the amount of reading and writing. I’m a Classics Major and R44 isn’t really even recommended for us to take because it’s less focused on the Classics that we study and because it’s way more intensive (and not worth the trade off to take a more difficult and less focused course). 
are you not taking any MCB or CS related classes first semester?
Seems fine. Don't know anything about CivE though (I assume you have to take Physics 7A/7B sometime?)
R&C A/B workload depends on the instructor more than the department -- and since most are taught by a grad student with no teaching reviews on ratemyprofessor/whatever has replace ninjacourses, you can't really know going in. I'd pick a class on a topic that seems interesting so at least you're putting in the effort towards something that keeps your interest.

Well I find this surprising, but [this form](https://www.ce.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/assets/aao/CEE%20ugrad%204%20year%20plan%202018.pdf) for the ce.berkeley.edu website suggests that you do not need Chem1A Lab. If you can use an AP/IB score to skip out of Chem 1A I recommend doing that though.

Data8 is not a particularly high workload class. It's recommended to take a connector course at the same time (at least that's what my roommate did and it made the class a lot more interesting for her.)
Also prefrosh, so just regurgitating what I've seen on here: lots of people see Math1A+B as the easier option to take if you've passed AP Calc and expect to coast through the classes and get good grades since they've learned much of the material, but then the classes actually end up being much harder than expected and can actually hurt your gpa significantly.  So I guess the advice there is to not assume that Math1A+B is an easy gpa boost, and if you do decide to take them, be sure to take them seriously.  Just something to keep in mind.  I'm not going for Haas so not sure how it works but if you skip 1A and B could you take on a lighter schedule seeing as you're now two classes farther than you would have been?  Cause I would probably do that if it was an option.
It definitely does not have to be through the English department. I took Asian American Studies R2A and it counted both as the first part of R&C and as my first semester of the pre-med English requirement.

I passed out of R&C with a 5 on AP Lit, but all it means is that I can take my second semester of English for the pre-med requirement whenever I want, and don't have to take two semesters of English in my first two years. If you do test out, I'd say to not confine yourself to R&C classes and just take whatever you want or whatever will fulfill breadths/pre-med requirements.
this is a fine schedule

edit: i've been told easy R&C B's have been filled so i would recommend looking for an easier H/SS course, try 
https://www.berkeleytime.com/catalog/
filtering for H/SS under CoE
Literally have the exact same recommended schedule as you. I️ have the same question: should I️ just stick with three classes for first semester, or should I️ take an H/SS course as well? If so, which course(s) would you recommend?
r&c b courses vary wildly based on individual gsis; but generally speaking, the work you'll have to do for them is weekly readings, a midterm paper, and a final paper (+ some assignments relating to those). you can always register for an r&c b or h/ss course and drop it by the coe drop deadline if you need to (which is the same as the l&s drop deadline for h/ss classes, so you should have a decent amount of time to gauge if your schedule is good). 
it's listed as compsci c8
Towards the hard side. That's 3 techs + the hard R&C B's. All of the easy R&C B are already super filled. You'll have to take like English or comp or something , which can legitimately take more time and effort than 61a, 16a or 7a, esp if you don't like reading.

Tbh there's no reason to take them early. I would save R&C B for sophomore year, and maybe lighten up on the techs.
definitely do-able. some might say it's on the easier side, so maybe think about adding a fun decal or joining a club.

[no comment on seminar/connectors, no 1st hand experience]
same boat!
http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu

http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu

Really recommend you check these 2 sites. There are some really great courses at Berkeley and they satisfy breadths.
Hey /u/DontFFplease! Nice schedule! As for your question, R5A etc. is basically the same stuff except rumored to have more reading involved. Most people don’t prefer these for that reason (citation needed lol) but it should work towards those requirements. 
This reminds me of my freshman starting schedule. I would often feel like I was missing out because others were really overworking themselves with ""harder"" classes (technicals) but it just ended up helping me start off with a good gpa. So I'd say, yeah, this seems like a good start, getting used to Cal is important. 

Edit: I had that finals sitch two semesters back. It is overwhelming and draining not going to lie. Its do-able but if you could find a better schedule, that'd be better. 
You can definitely not go to live lecture for 61A (they pretty much don't have room if everyone goes), though I do recommend going on like the first lecture and last lecture or something for that live DeNero experience. 

But yeah overall, I think you're gonna have to cut something. The first 3 there are no joke especially physics 5A. Never took classics but from what you're saying you're just taking it for a breadth. 

Especially for your first semester here put it this way: is the convenience of fulfilling your breadth sooner worth the risk that you do worse in your other classes? You're a freshman. You're gonna be here for a while. There will be other fall semesters. There will be other breadths.

If you're unsure between data 8 (and that route) vs the regular cs path, I'd just take the 61A path. I really like data 8, but you might be shoehorning yourself a bit, rather than if you take 61A. 

Just take a decal or something for that last unit to get to 13. A lot of people start off rough first semester since its their first college experience and all so you really shouldn't bite off more than you can chew. As a general rule you shouldn't get too aggressive with the schedule unless you've proven to yourself that you can do well with something similar, or you're in a do or die situation. 
Just a warning that Classics R44 is a pretty difficult breadth class. I’ve taken a few classics breadth courses and they’re a lot more work than one might expect. If you don’t like reading a TON, don’t take it. It’s literally all reading. It is NOT a history at all. Many of my classmates who were stem majors struggled a lot in the class because they didn’t expect it to me so much work. If you don’t do well with literature and writing, it might be best to take something a bit easier. 
Decals usually start a week or two after instruction begins, decal updating on the website probably not too long before the term starts too. It's definitely fine to take decals as a freshman, I took several for my first two semesters and enjoyed them. Just make sure you keep your overall workload balanced, I had a full schedule and then piled decals on top of that.
No, Astro is not a technical. I took C10; it's super fun, but it's also pretty easy if you just keep up with the readings.
Just a heads up, if you're a cs major cs61c will satisfy the physical science breadth for you, so taking astro c10 for a breadth requirement would be redundant.

You might just wanna take it for interest though.
1 course of AC,

For me it became my new Cal Central profile picture too
No, it's not hard, it usually expands a lot to fit everyone
That sounds like a decent schedule, especially given your prior experience and interest in philosophy. You'll probably enjoy your R1B more because it's something you're actually interested in.
When I enrolled in a summer class a deadline appeared in the Finances tab of CalCentral after a few days. There was no email notification or CalCentral task, though.
[deleted]
If you look on the right side of CalCentral, you'll see a message saying there's an issue with the Golden Bear Advising task. They're trying to fix it. So no worries. :)
A few weeks before the beginning of a new semester. 
Is it need-based or merit-based? If it's need-based then it's probably just a name for where the money is coming from (since your need-based grant will come from different sources), but if it's merit-based then it's something I haven't heard of before.
Not bad. I spend around $6 a day so about $2 per meal.
[https://career.berkeley.edu/Medical/PrepPrereq](https://career.berkeley.edu/Medical/PrepPrereq)

According to career center, simply retaking the r/C series is the safest bet. If you really don't want to retake them, you could try looking at upper div english/rhetoric classes.
Generally back to back is recommended, at least over 1 hour breaks, but you may want to give yourself an hour for lunch if you've got classes like 9-3 or something similar. In general 1 hour breaks are the most annoying things. You can't go home in that amount of time, so your options are basically to eat, sit playing with your phone on campus, or find someplace to maybe get 30 minutes of studying in before you have to go to class. In general it's much nicer to just go through your classes, and get to have the rest of your day totally free rather early.
Personally I like breaks in between because that's when I'm most productive. I love knocking out some of my work between classes when I'm still in the heat of things and pumped up. Depends on your preference though.
I do back-to-back when possible cuz when i have breaks I sometimes decide to just skip class and go/stay home
[deleted]
And how hard is to get into the class, especially since I have a late enrollment time (12:40).
Is it for the dorms?
Current AI here. Like pnobel already said, practice exams. It's the best resource because the exams are always written to be the approximately same level of difficulty every semester. They are meant to be very tricky so make sure you get all those tricks down.

Other helpful resources are mock exams, group mentoring worksheets, guerrilla section worksheets, discussion worksheets, etc. Take advantage of all the practice material they provide. Practice makes perfect.

Good luck!!
Cog sci 1 is notoriously hard to get into, especially for freshmen, so you might want to consider some alternatives.
Jeez, where was kayaking and company visits at last year's GBO... Honestly both of those sound lit but personally I'd go with kayaking
Same for everyone
not a stupid question, btw, as a lot of my friends at different colleges are charged per unit. (or they are charged by unit thresholds, but the only threshold here is parttime vs fulltime)
You could take BART (train) directly from the airport to downtown Berkeley, it's only a few blocks from campus.
I'm pretty sure there are night buses
go on google maps, put sfo as depart. berkeley as arrive. set depart at 1:00 am on that day. do the first route (when I did it it showed me I had to take two buses at 1:45 hr travel time). 


What's your position, and how big are the classes?
I was also waitlisted for Anthro 2AC, even though I thought it was open too...
Very fucked. If you're position is that high there's no way you're getting in that lab.
I’m 60 on the waitlist and I also remember being more than 100 initially. What would you switch to? I need chem 1a for my major req:/ and I’m already in chem 1al
A **lot** of people drop the course within the first couple of weeks. You *should* be able to get in no problem, but keep an eye on it as we get closer to the semester. After the first few lectures, you'll see a lot of movement. 
Looks like a solid plan and schedule
this is a fine schedule and the decision the p/np is on you, but remember you have a long time to decide whether to p/np classes here
why do you want to p/np astro c10? 
What's wrong with it? There's also a form to exempt yourself from it (but you still have to make up bear pacts or whatever it's called), but IMO just do it. It's exhausting if you go to everything, so don't be afraid to skip, but it's still a good opportunity to see campus, the bay, and meet people in/around your floor.

Besides, what else would you do for that week? It'll be boring as hell since everyone else is gone.
Unless they're listed on the course scheduler or the website, you probably won't be able to figure out which TA corresponds to which lab, and in all honesty it won't make much of a difference. As for morning vs. night lab, are you able to get up in the mornings or would you prefer to spend some of your evening in lab?
Also what’s the purpose of the lab??
you'll find out who your TA is when you show up to section/once the Fall 2018 website is up. locations don't matter at all for anything practical but I think 105 cory is the nicest lab room :\~)
Depends on the course -- I've taken beginner yoga (vinyasa) and the bulk of our grade seemed to come from attendance. Those courses are typically heavily impacted and if you don't show up in the first couple of weeks you'll be automatically dropped. We had one ""exam"" in which we answered questions about yoga on a sheet of paper with a partner. You can (IMO should) also PNP them since an A in 0.5 units will do very little to your GPA. 

TL;DR: took beginner yoga, got a very easy A just by showing up and actually *trying*
I think seminars are better, personally. Seminars are basically hyper-focused, intimate classes, while bconnect is more of an online learning experience with some in-person meetups for discussion. Also, I think bconnect just provides lighter alternatives of real classes, rather than seminars, which offer unique topics.
are you taking about berkeley connect (\[dept\] 98BC)? if you just want to meet a bunch of people interested in the same thing as you and get free food, take berkeley connect. if you want to learn about a specific topic take a seminar
no
Don't drop Chem 1A. People tend to drop out of 1A within the first few weeks, so you still have a chance, and you can't be enrolled in 1AL without 1A. (you can take 1AL separate from 1A, but you have to take 1A first.)

If you can enroll in a different lab section for 1AL, something with a shorter waitlist or no wait, do that. 1AL is the class you want to try to get a foot in, since people don't tend to drop out of that one as much.

I would try to find a new reading/comp class if you can, since most people won't be dropping out of those classes.

Since Psych C162 is an upper div, I would say your chances of getting in are slim. Drop it and switch if you can.

My friend was a transfer student accepted off the waitlist, and his residency status is already verified. It might be different for each student, but I would contact the financial aid office and see if they're still reviewing your documents, or if they need additional information. 

Financial Aid: [https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/contact-us](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/contact-us) 
I just received my residency proof email today.
I’d def contact them. I had to do my SLR in June and was notified of my status after two weeks upon completing the documents. Your submission should go from “pending” to “completed” then receipt of an email to your berkeley email address notifying you of your status. It then takes about another week to apply the status to your CARS bill for any adjustments such as non-resident waivers. Hope this helps but def shoot a follow-up email to registrar. 
I don't think we can make an accurate answer without looking at your financial aid packet. I would look at your Estimated Cost of Attendance vs the amount of Awards you were granted, and just do the math. Also, you should contact the financial aid office and ask them about the difference.

Financial Aid: [https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/contact-us](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/contact-us)
The bills are posted but financial aid doesn't pay out until August 13th at the soonest. 

[""Fall financial aid will begin disbursing on Monday, August 13 for eligible students.""](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/whats-new-financial-aid-and-scholarships)
I think it does when I checked my academic progress thing. I'd follow up with an advisor but I'm 90% sure it does. 

However, it's highly recommended that you take upper div classes outside your major(s) to explore things that you normally won't do. For instance, I took an art history class and I'm thinking about pursuing a minor in art history.
Haven't attended any reunion events myself but I think they're worth checking out at least :)
ALEKS is new this year, so it's not likely that anyone here can answer with surety. Most likely it is extra credit, but ask your professor or TA.
Really depends on the class & department.

Most big lower div science classes (Chem 1A, Chem 3A, Physics 7A/B/C) have online assignments that grade on completeness - but a problem is only marked correct if your answer is considered correct by the program.

Math varies by professor -- some are graded by TA's, who tend to spot-check but might grade by completeness, and some don't grade hw at all. Usually it's a mix of hw (graded by completeness) and in-discussion quizzes (graded by correctness ofc)

CS assignments are graded by autograder programs. So kindof both.

Humanities classes it really varies by the class.

The good news is that professors usually lay out homework expectations and grading rules in the syllabus and on the first day of class.
Correctness, almost always. High school it's usually completeness, but I really wouldn't count on that in college. 
I did not take 100B, but I had friends that did. I guess you are lucky that Steven Wood is not teaching it, but that does not mean Hawkins is necessarily a walk in the park. I think you are dealt a better hand.

History 7a is just US history from whenever they want to start like 1492 or even earlier with Native American involvement to the Civil War. I glanced at the course description. It probably won't be much different from CC in terms of the timeline, but you are definitely going to do more reading. Were all the ACs taken? Is there any way that you could take this history class online next summer alongside with whatever job or internship you take up?

I hope that someone could clear up that class for you in terms of difficulty. In general, pre-Civil War history is easier to understand because not too many things are happening at the same time. The trade-off is that you have to read text that isn't easy to digest because the English is not the same. Post-Civil War is easier reading b/c it's more contemporary but there are more things happening at the same time.

Edu 198 is fun and you might be able to make friends b/c there are more than likely going to be Econ transfers in there as well. It's really chill.

Stat 20 - good luck. The curve is a killer. I didn't take it. It took 131a, but my XP with that is not as valid b/c I had first-time-ish teacher. She was not Berkeley tough yet but had adhere to the curving rules. She really did not want to do that to us but policy is policy.
ngl most of my friends who are decent at math think the 16 series is very easy, so you should probably be fine taking 16B? even if you don't remember much of bc, I don't think 16a does much beyond basic integrals & derivatives. here's a link to a 16a final so you can gauge your knowledge: [https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/archives/exams/math-16a](https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/archives/exams/math-16a)
If it's anything like this past spring semester, it's:

* Weekly labs that are usually pretty challenging. Expect to spend a good time going to office hours or other lab sections (they're open to anyone), unless you're somehow really good.
* Relatively brutal tests, about half theory, and half matlab questions. The matlab questions should be pretty easy (since the labs are actually pretty good at teaching you), but the theory ones get quite tricky.
* Final project is probably pretty scary. Hope you have good teammates.

Point is, labs are brutal, lectures were meh. A good chunk of your time may be diverted to this class.
If you some experience coding (AP CS A for example), it should be entirely manageable. If it's your first class in programming / computer science, you may spend a little more time on it. I will note that the class is significantly easier when taught in the Fall by the ME department. 

If you want a slightly more interesting look into computer science, I highly recommend taking CS 61A after E7--the material is a lot more engaging imo.
I'd say if you still have units left to enroll with, just sign up for any easy breadth class that you can get an easy grade with or screw around P/NP. I found that it was better to over-enroll that way if something comes up where you have to drop your other classes, you're not stuck under the unit and having to enroll in some obscure class where the average isn't very high either.
Definitely do more research, but I had a friend drop a class right after the final and it has no mark on his record. YMMV 
So if you have housing in any of the campus housing it will be basically impossible to get a permit for street parking. There are lots/garages but they’re expensive. Best option I found was looking for parking spots for rent on Craigslist. I rent a spot a few blocks from campus for $100/month. I rent from a local property management company that rents out their unused spots (Raj Properties) they usually have a  bunch available. 
Some of the frats rent out excess parking spaces, maybe try free and for sale or asking around.

does not seem like there is a waitlist rn

also good move AP skipping out of 1B
What else are you taking?
Are you taking either course to fulfill a requirement? If you're thinking of taking one ""just for fun,"" I'd recommend Drugs and the Brain. Presti is a rad dude and the course is just neat. NST10 can be a bit boring from what I remember (I took it with Greg Aponte, though I'm sure the course material is probably identical). 
Typically that’s up to the professor’s discretion if you can skip class. 
email
I'm not sure what you mean by a ""backup"" -- as in, signing up for a similar class that fulfills the same requirement? You should be able to add as many classes as you want so long as you don't go over the unit cap. I'm not sure if waitlisted courses pose a problem for courses that would be at the exact same time. 
If there's an open class you'd like to be in if you can't get the waitlisted class, enroll in the open class and use the ""Swap"" feature to attempt a swap for the more desirable class. It will only unenroll you if you get off the waitlist.
Plenty of places on campus open during the weekend, especially once the semester starts. You can check this site for hours: 

http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/hours

Northside Coffee: I really like Brewed Awakening, but there's also Northside Cafe (I think they have wifi now?)

Southside Coffee: Cafe Milano (wifi is kinda slow), Strada, 1951

Westside Coffee: Yali's 

I assume you're asking about coffee shops as places to work - not sure about the quality of coffee at these places, as I'll drink anything with caffeine :) 
math classes at cal typically don't use graphing calculators (or any calculators at all). If you want to use a graphing calculator for practice and studying, i'd suggest a free app called Wabbitemu which is literally a TI-84 on your phone/computer.
Depends on the breadth courses— if they’re all literature related and you’re going to be reading hundreds of pages a week, it might get tough since CS61A is incredibly time consuming. That said, it’ll probably be easier than CS61A with other technical courses. 

In my experience, taking 1-2 breadths every semester was ideal. When you’re taking tough upper divs in later years, it can be nice to have the break. 
i lived in a triple, and there were three ports for ethernet, but one was very inconveniently placed next to the lightswitch in front of the door (so that we'd probably trip over it everytime we tried to leave the room). The other two were fine to use, but since all three of us wanted ethernet we invested in some extra ethernet ports which turned out to be worth it
From my own (limited) experience in physics/astronomy, what is most important is your ability to do the work. Newton's laws, the Schrödinger equation, and statistical mechanics don't care for your party affiliation. My own views are hard left but are in some areas considered ""conservative""---this has led sometimes to disagreement with faculty and students, but it would be a total lie to claim ""oppression"". Perhaps in business where soft skills are more important, this is different, but I strongly suspect that even there nobody cares a huge amount.

My best advice is simply not to care. Conservatives especially seem to be overly concerned about what ""campus liberals"" will think of them, and the honest answer is nothing, unless that's what you make the centerpiece of your identity. The best solution is to distinguish yourself through both academic/business work and diverse outside interests, rather than making ""political activism"" the foundation of your persona and consequently being known as a triggered conservative snowflake. 
Yo, chill out. I'm a moderate conservative at Cal, and most students are apolitical and don't care. Cal is largely apolitical - if you don't go out of your way to get involved in political discourse, you will probably not even see or hear anything at all. Of course, every now and then(once every two years) there will be some big protest and that will suck.

Some organizations you might be interested in: Greek life, Berkeley Forum, Berkeley Conservative Society, College Republicans (though they're highly pro-Trump), UCBMUN, Berkeley MUN (this is different from the previous one), Berkeley Political Review, any pre-law fraternity, any of the consulting or finance clubs.
Barestage Productions puts on 1-2 musicals per year and they're fully student run -- I've enjoyed working with them. Big time commitment though. From what I understand, the school's theater department (TDPS) rarely, if ever, does musicals. Would definitely recommend Barestage.  
All of them! They all have pretty different personalities, so I'd recommend checking them out and seeing which ones you vibe with
All(?) of the acapella groups perform at Sather Gate once a week, if not more, so I’d recommend finding out when they perform and checking them out to get their general vibe. The main ones that come to mind are AiR (artists in resonance), Noteworthy, and California Golden Overtones. We also have men’s and women’s octets. In the first weeks of the semester, they’ll be handing out fliers on Sproul looking for folks to audition. 
Double majoring for a superficial reason like ""Resume value"" isn't prudent because it adds almost zero resume value(maybe rarely for fields like banking and consulting, they may take a second look). If that would be your only reason, then don't double.

If you like math(note: nothing you've taken in high school is a good indicator of upper division math classes, so you don't know yet) then the double major imo is worth the tuition. You'll probably get a good job after graduation, but you only get the learning experience in an undergrad community once, so if it isn't a deal-breaker tuition wise then do the double. 
I would say a double major in math isn't worth it that much. The EECS department already has math courses geared towards cs in the EE120 series (probability theory/ optimization theory) and the CS170 series (cs theory/ algorithms).

The only math class that's really applicable to cs is Math110, upper division linear algebra. (maybe also Math128 for parallel computing type stuff).
Almost certainly better financially to graduate early.

The only way I can think that doubling in math might add value to your degree is if you are thinking of going to grad school in math or for the very math/theory-heavy side of CS. Even then, it's not so much the formal degree as the classes and research you've done.
I was dmajoring with math. Instead, I graduated one year early. Better choice imho. If you wanna study more go to grad school.
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
First, it's not offensive and shallow to dislike a lot of the culture around Cal. I too don't really like the meme page - I think it's basic and full of weird overreactions. I too love sports and was worried that no one would care about stuff like that.

Luckily, Cal is so big that you can, basically, ""ignore"" people who don't share what you want. Intramural sports is actually pretty big here. It's a big race to get spots before they fill up, and, for example, they let you play flag football at the main stadium under the lights. People love to work out, evident by the crowded lines at RSF (the main gym). There is a thriving Greek system (if you were at Cal Day, you probably walked down Frat Row and saw all the people who are more ""college normal""). My main point is, you'd be fine socially at Cal, and the prestige of Haas is an added bonus.

I would recommend looking into living at Clark Kerr if you really want a more ""frat"" lifestyle. It's on the same street as the frats, and so a lot of people who live in CK end up pledging. Also, a lot of athletes live there, and that athletic culture transfers over to everyone else. If you have any more questions about stuff like this, feel free to ask.
h-hey xD. I guess I'm one of the people you're describing, i love anime, manga, and vidya gamies!But that's just be cause i'm quirky haha, I'd hate being just another regular person in society... I was just born this way :D. but anyways i might get why you feel a bit... jealous? haha jk well not really but yea so maybe Berkeley might be too much for ya. Only unique people come here, ya know (like me!)? Neurotypicals might better be suited, at say, USC for sure haha
Lol dude just join a frat
The business and Econ(and humanities) community is the stark opposite of what you described - that's mainly the CS/engineering stereotype. The meme page exaggerates stuff - but then again, that's the theme that contributes to most of the group's humor. I don't know a single Econ/haas student that's depressed or stressed out(I think this is mainly true in mcb/pre-med). Join a fraternity your first semester - our Greek system is thriving. I'm surprised by your Cal Day observations - did you visit frat row? I could hear the parties from a mile away. Plus, the day before was 4/20, and I'm sure you know how popular that is to celebrate here, so know that you can certainly find all these social opportunities here. We have game days throughout our fall semester that are equally lit and although our school spirit isn't the best, it's pretty damn good on those days. There's music festivals every weekend at the Greek theatre, tons of intramural sports, fitness is a huge deal here(attire, not so much). In fact, Greek orgs and other clubs/orgs on campus register their own team for all the intramural tournaments(basketball/soccer/volleyball,etc) so that's really fun to do. You could also consider a business frat; my roommate is in both, a normal fraternity and a professional business fraternity and it's basically like two awesome social groups - except one is co-ed and has incredible business networks that basically guarantees him a top banking job(regardless of Haas or not), along with a nice community

Berkeley is huge and you can definitely find your niche, like every other social outgoing guy/girl does. 
As one of the socially awkward nerdy people I just wanted to let you know that I also find the meme pages pretty toxic and am very happy that they did not reflect my experience on campus much at all.

As far as finding people you like at Berkeley, I think u/efewfwfafewfw and u/awesomebuffalo describe the situation well. You will certainly find lots of people who share your interests and values. (People have already mentioned frats and intramural sports, and the sports-fan culture, while smaller at Cal than the other schools, definitely exists). Where you might have a problem is if you dislike simply being around people with poor social skills, or people talking anime, etc. In which case my impression is that UCLA has the same situation and USC or WUSTL are probably better fits for you.
When you connect to wifi wirelessly, the data has to travel through the air, so if walls and what not is in the way your connection is worse. With ethernet, this is not an issue.
Ethernet cables are usually useful since they're pretty reliable and fast. Don't worry if you're not having much  luck romantically, cuz Airbears2 (the dorm and campus wifi) will definitely go down on you everyday. The Ethernet usually gives you the same or better internet speeds and doesn't screw up often.

My laptop did not have an Ethernet port. I bought a Ethernet-to-USB adapter, which are pretty cheap on Amazon. My room also was supposed to be a double apparently since we only had two Ethernet ports in the wall for the three of us. If that's the case you might want to buy a splitter. Or you could do what we did and have one of us use another person's laptop as a WiFi hotspot.

I'd recommend you get your laptop configured with the Ethernet when you move in, cuz you don't want that Fortnite Victory Royale to come crumbling before your eyes because Airbears2 decided to mess with you.
Sometimes I got frozen meals and ice cream, or I had leftovers from meals, so the micro-fridge came pretty handy then. Maybe try convincing your roommates, or you could make do with the common fridge residence halls have on the bottom floor (I think they had one when I lived in Unit 2).
They are life savers lol. I sometimes get hungry past midnight when everything is closed 
Great for breakfast and late nights snacks. When I had one, I always had milk for cereal/oatmeal, individual cheeses for snacks, and sometimes boxed soups (pop some in a mug, microwave it for a bit, BAM, a slightly less depressing mid-RRR-week study snack). Sometimes you just want a cold drink without having to leave your room. You might not use it every day, but it really comes in clutch to have one when you want and need it. 
Fellow admit here. On their website it says that for a l&s and engineering  minimum is 120 units and the maximum is 136.  You are allowed an additional semester though. 
Units 1 and 2 are generally more desired by incoming freshmen because they have been renovated more recently than Unit 3. However, Units 1 and 3 are the closest to campus (only 1 block away) while Unit 2 is farther away (3 blocks). Clark Kerr is popular because of how nice the quads and the facilities are, but it is 6 blocks from campus so take that into consideration depending on how early you like to wake up! There's also the option of coops (cooperative living), but I believe that's generally more popular in later years or with anyone who is trying to save money on housing, which is totally cool as well. In terms of social life, Unit 1 is very social, Unit 2 is a little less so, but both of them are pretty near Frat Row apparently (?) so there's definitely some active socialisation nearby. 

No matter what, try to figure out what's the best fit for you! Just because a lot of people like how close Unit 1 is to campus and how social it is, doesn't mean you won't prefer Unit 3 which is less social and a little older but feels less like you're right next to campus (or so I've heard?). I'm still a recent admit myself so take this with a grain of salt, but these are just the opinions I've heard from some people.
Unit 1 is the best dorm in my opinion, and I lived in Unit 2. This is because Unit 1 is extremely close to campus, it's closer to restaurants than unit 2, and everything social happens on Southside.
Going from most dorms to campus is downhill or flat. Going back is the hard part
Lots of people walk, bike, or scooter around campus. With bikes you have to be careful to lock your bike (and use the right locks -- two of them -- bicycle theft is very common). With the other two, I think people mostly bring them into class.

If you want to do recreational skateboarding, campus seems to be good for that too. I don't know if there are formal clubs or just people hanging out, but it seemed like there were always a half dozen people skating the slopes/ramps around Hearst Memorial Mining Building in the evenings when I was heading back to Foothill.
You can, but you should clear it with your admissions officer first. 
I took classes the summer prior to my first semester and I got credit for it. Would recommend to take a look at [assist.org](http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html) if you are from CA, shows what CA community college courses fulfill at Berkeley
No one gets guaranteed on campus housing except for regents. But I think a large portion of transfer students get on campus housing since it's their first year at Cal. Off campus housing isn't too bad to get either, you just need to be proactive about it because housing can get expensive. Singles and studios range from $1000-$1300 and shared rooms range from $600-$900.
should be fine, i have a lot of friends in cs who took ee126/127 without 16b. they did fine, the work is hard, but 16b probably wont help too too much.
I’m in ChE at cal and overwhelmingly, a lot of the transfers I meet struggle a lot GPA-wise simply because they come in and jump right into the hard material and coursework and don’t have as much GPA padding so to speak as the students who did two years at Cal beforehand. It can also be hard because the jump in rigor from junior college to Berkeley is really enormous. 

Berkeley is hard. ChemE at berkeley is REALLY hard. But that’s the whole point! The program is a victim of grade deflation, but there is no better preparation for a PhD. The professors are well known & at the top of their fields (so you do meaningful and high impact research as an undergrad), your peers (the people you are making connections with) are brilliant. And you really learn how to think creatively & critically and how to work hard. If you come to Cal, you’ll be challenged and your GPA may not be perfect, but you’ll leave a hell of a good scientist. 
If you're gunning for grad school good grades are a must. Go to UCI (cheaper and much easier than UCB).
Straight Bs would be kinda really bad, but I think you're overestimating the difficulty of Berkeley. It's hard, sure, but if you're the kind of student to ace everything at UCI, you'll do fine here. Maybe not ace everything, but fine.

Grad school isn't just GPA, admissions isn't that stupid, they'll consider ""grade deflation"", and there a lot of unique opportunities you wouldn't get otherwise here.
I don’t think it’s possible to study abroad this upcoming fall, that requires months of planning, a student visa, college approval, etc.

As for any grade point requirement, I’ve never heard of a major where they’re lenient...but hey, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. If you can talk to the right people in the department (NOT just your l&s advisor) you might be able to work something out.

>Got a few questions: Is there room in any dorm for a TV, like 47” to 52”? I think I applied mostly for doubles in Blackwell and the units.

Pretty small. If you're in a double tbh the room isn't really well suited for it since they bisect the room basically with the desks. I would recommend rearranging ASAP if you want to bring in that big of a TV.

>Parking. if I do get a new car before freshman year, is it worth parking near the campus? My parents’ll be living like 1 hour away in San Jose

No

>I’m from a kinda conservative suburb in NJ. I’ve heard a shitton about the super liberal reputation Berkeley’s got. I think I’m a pretty tolerant guy, but is the whole political thing really THAT in-your-face?

The reality is that the Berkeley student populace isn't really *that* politically active anymore, for better or for worse. With the STEM boom, and Berkeley's prominent STEM rankings, there's a lot of international students, OoS students who frankly just don't care. Not to mention that there's some overlap with crowd and incels...

In any case, the most jarring thing will be that your orientation group leader will ask for your preferred pronouns. I think they're forced to do that, but other than that, the only other activism you'll see is people promoting things on sproul.

Basically, if you come in with the intention to get triggered by liberal things, you can find plenty of things to get triggered by. If you come not caring, you won't even notice most of the time.
Having a car near Berkeley campus is way, way more trouble than it's worth. 
i think students already got their housing assignments ; did you get a double? if so, you can re-arrange the room to accomodate a TV. If you got a triple, it really depends on the size and layout of the room
I used Craiglist and ended up with a cheap apartment on Northside, about a 15-20 min walk to campus, and I couldn't have been happier with that (this was 2013-2015). But I'm also an introvert and prefer to be somewhere quiet. Housing is very difficult to find, more so now than it was when I was there. I think I got one of the few remaining cheap apartments available. 

You really have to dedicate time to scope out apartments, go meet landlords, etc in person. The further you're willing to live from campus the cheaper your options will typically be. But it's still going to be ridiculous. 

On-campus housing is going to be the biggest ripoff unless you can somehow get family housing which you probably can't. 
join the uc berkeley off-campus housing group; there will usually be people looking for an extra person for their housing groups. also, afaik the wada apartments are almost entirely reserved for transfer students. 
I lived in a double not a triple, but suites aren't that different from dorm floors. Fewer people on an individual floor, so you're probably sharing a bathroom with fewer people, and I think you have one more key to keep track of (suite and room key), but socially I think the variation within groups (that is between different floors or between different suites) is bigger than the difference between the groups. If you don't like your suite (or floor) much, make an effort to meet people in nearby floors/suites. We always had a couple people hanging out in my common room because they like our social dynamic.
I never went inside CKC (walked by many times but never on campus), but my friends who lived their liked it. They didn't find the walk a huge inconvenience, and during school hours there's a frequent shuttle. You're actually still pretty close to Frat Row.

> If I'm a guy and I walk with one or two friends back will I be fine or should I be worried a bit?

You'll be fine. If you don't have friends and don't want to walk alone, both [bear walk and the night shuttle](https://nightsafety.berkeley.edu/) will take you to CKC. The wait time might be half an hour or more so try call ahead before you plan to head home.

My rule was to avoid walking alone and at night unless I was very familiar with the area. Also don't have my phone out and stay alert. I know two people that were mugged in Berkeley; one wandered into Oakland drunk at 4am, and the other was walking with their phone out on Westside at 2am. I know there are stories of people being robbed in daylight and with other people around, but taking a few precautions really cuts down on the risk.

> Lastly, the mountain lion thing is just a meme right?

I don't know what you're talking about but [probably yes](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Mountain-Lion/Attacks).
Clark Kerr RH or suite?
hello!! I stayed at Clark Kerr for 4 days on an overnight program. It is more like a 20-25 minute walk from campus depending on where you are going imo. It is not hard to go to parties/hangouts because most people who live in Clark Kerr are known to associate if not participate in Greek Life this is because Frat Row is right across the street from Clark Kerr. It is safe like every other part of Berkeley just would not recommend walking alone late at night, but my friend who lives there has in the past and nothing bad has happened. 
I don't have experience with him, but you can use www.berkeleytime.com/grades to compare grade distributions by professor for Math 1B
No, transfer students admitted to other majors cannot be admitted to Haas. But you can declare Econ.

> Students admitted as junior transfers to UC Berkeley's College of Letters & Science or other majors are NOT eligible to apply to the Haas Undergraduate Program. In addition, we cannot review applications from students who have already earned a bachelor's degree.

scheduling may vary from every week to every other week to even maybe twice a week. They are usually 1 or 2 units (2 units likely having more work/time-committment, albeit still small). Check the decal page (https://decal.berkeley.edu) and look at past years if you wish to compare different DeCals. The idea is that the time you spend on the class, save actually attending, is basically close to nil but it depends on the decal. If you are taking it JUST FOR UNITS and don't really care about what it is about then find one with minimal time-committment (maybe 1 day for 1 hr a week + not much additional work + grading P/NP based on attendance for the most part). gl
Most are 1-2 hours a week. 1 units are easier, but 2-unit decals really aren't that much extra work. Maybe an extra hour a week of studying/assignments, but they're very lax.
Yes you can technically do both. The only thing you can't do is join more than 1 social sorority/fraternity.
Greek life is extremely time consuming I wouldn't recommend doing both even though it's allowed. 
you can do both, but make sure you don't pledge both in the same semester. 
i think you'll find both lower-div and upper-div chemistry classes in C0C to be decently difficult. for the most part (as far as I know) 4A might be a bit more in depth/harder and it would make sense logically that a chem major should i mean...like chemistry enough to major strictly in it COMPARED TO mcb which encompasses other STEM fields. So don't think about the education via which class might be better but think about your major. Chemistry and MCB-Neurobio aren't that similar so it wouldn't make sense to compare them based on prerequisites but rather on whether you wanna major in MCB...maybe go to grad school and do research or MD route OR chemistry life. Just my 2 cents. 
just compare this upcoming semester's 1a professors via berkeleytime grade distributions, ninjacourses, and rate my professors. also if you wanted you could look up each professors page and like if you find their math berkeley.edu page you can find out if they taught math 1a before. you can check tau beta pi berkeley exam repository to see if they have any past exams from said professor or the women in mathematics old exam database for math classes. this is a decent amount of information which if you comb through can help you decide. also take into account which class fills up first as that can indicate which prof might be better (can check in real time via calcentral or on berkeleytime or like on the course catalog page which shows how many remaining seats are left. if one prof has like 15% of his class filled and another 50%, you can assume the latter is prob better FOR THE MOST PART). ex. fall 2017 there were 2 math 53 professors (multivariable calc). one was leagues above the other to the point where if you didn't have the first enrollment time you couldn't enroll in him. he was FULL and the other had 300+ spots left iirc. talk about disparity. gl 

edit: forgot to mention. if you find a prof's math page and they taught 1a before, you can check how they grade..curriculum..textbook...and the like. some profs have diff grading so that may or may not matter to you. 
Take Math 1B
Data 100 is going to be with Hug so you know it's going to be lit, but the material in 160 is pretty cool so honestly you can't go wrong either way. Although if it were me I'd go with Data 100 because who knows when Hug might teach it again.
i don't think there are any hard prereqs for 1A; you can take it if you feel ready.
Yep, they're different names for the same class.

Not sure what your major is, but that schedule, while on the higher end of difficulty, isn't *too* bad. Math 53 is computation-heavy, so I recommend you practice a lot of problems and go to discussion/OH's regularly. Chem 1A is a lot of memorizing. Data 8 is an interesting class, but just beware that the workload and difficulty kinda ramps up in the middle, so stay on track. Lenient grading, though. So yeah it's a doable schedule but please make sure you stay on top of your work and not procrastinate.
related: how difficult is it to get seminars? my sign up time is 9:40 on July 18th
Fpf is kind of hit or miss - i know people who loved it, and others who were indifferent to it. I don't think anyone actively disliked it, though. 

Btw, when did you get off the waitlist? Just curious, since a friend from high school is on it
I took swimming and I absolutely loved it. The PE classes at Cal are utterly incredible and I'd strongly recommend anyone who has the time to do it every semester, or atleast for a few semesters - it's 15$ per semester only. It's great for your physical and mental wellbeing. My classes were in the morning so an added advantage was that I was fresh and energized to start off the day, whereas in previous semesters I used to go to class groggy and half-asleep. The instructors can be hit or miss but most are decent and many are genuinely nice. Attendance + effort is the main criteria; if you go to class regularly and not dick around you'll be fine. 
regents doesn't get priority first semester freshman year; your registration time isn't that bad, either (I think I had 12:45 or something last year??). this semester will make you especially appreciative for regents!!!
Don't worry, you'll get all your classes;you might have to be flexible in your choice of R1A.
You might want to look into [Transfer Edge](http://summer.berkeley.edu/special-programs/transfer-edge).
Same here if that makes you feel any better lol
Same! I think it'll change as we get closer to Golden Bear Advising/registration in mid June through July.
It's not that bad if you're competent with your math. I'd advise, if you were trying that, to switch R&C B unless you get an easy one, which is unlikely. Unfortunately freshman enrollment time is incredibly late and all the good R&C classes have been snagged already, and the not-fluff R&C classes can be *very hard*, or rather take a lot of work. 

Some of my friends said that their R&C classes took more time than any of their technicals...

Otherwise, you can swap Math 53 with a decal or something that satifies the engineering humanities requirement.
Seems alright if you know what you're doing. With three technicals first semester expect to spend most of your time studying (which may eat away at social life/extracurriculars), however, it should help develop a good work ethic which will make future semesters easier to handle, as well as help you complete major requirements sooner rather than later so you can have a chill time in junior and senior year.
[deleted]
Not necessary. But they're very low pressure, low time commitment and can be very interesting so don't automatically count them out.
I would definitely take one. Super easy to pass and a great way to get into the non-pressure part of Berkeley. I personally recommend CHM ENG 24, which is a 1-unit sci-fi class that was super interesting and really easy to pass (show up to 7/10 classes, and that's it). Also, he takes you out to a movie and pizza if you want.
it's just a thing you can do if you want to fill up units/get to know a professor/if it's interesting to you. i took one first semester freshman year and it was great; got to know the professor & other students in my class pretty well. they fill up fast, though.
[deleted]
If you don't want the PDF, check Berkeley's Free and For Sale on Facebook. Tons of people unload their semester-used textbooks for way cheaper than the student store sells them for.  
Also, never buy your stuff from the student store if you can avoid it. Math 53 via Facebook was $35 to own and Math 53 via Student Store was $120 to rent for a semester.
I'm not in that major, but I doubt it. You could *maybe* try to petition to replace E7 with 61B and CS9A (which covers Matlab), but at that point you might as well just take E7. Also, you can't have more than two courses overlapping between your two majors, so you might as well just have those be 61A and some other course which overlaps between the two.
My counselor told me it was not. 
dont take stat133 it's a bad class
>“substance free environment.”

Doesn't make a difference. Had some friends in a ""substance free"" floor, there were still drinking (a lot of drinking) and some weed use. 

It doesn't really matter which one you pick.
Tbh the ""substance free environment"" just means harsher penalties if you end up deciding to try something and getting caught. 
It's funny, I chose a substance free environment but my entire floor (including me) ended up smoking and drinking a bunch
That'll be part of Golden Bear Advising. You'll get a notification through CalCentral mid to late June :)

Check the class's info on https://classes.berkeley.edu. It should have a list of all the sections.
yes this is normal for a 4 unit class, 3 hours of lecture and 3 hours of discussion/lab a week

if you go to [classes.berkeley.edu](https://classes.berkeley.edu) and find your class you can see the official amount of time each class takes
seems fine, if not on the easier side.

dont plan too far ahead, your scheduling decisions become infinitely better after experiencing some number of classes and people here.
espm 50's a super popular class, so you probably won't get it.
not sure about the chem 1A situation, but you can take R5B without R5A with AP lit credit
Yeah, PM me.
i know it's late to respond but whatever choice you made i wish you the best - waitlists is always kind of a shitty situation.
In general they're low effort, low risk. Often taught by GSIs. I wouldn't worry about getting a P; even if you somehow get a NP, it's not like it effects your GPA, you just miss out on a unit.

As to whether or not it's valuable... that'll depend on you, and the course. 

If you're interested just try them out.
take 61a, but also why are you thinking about math 53? shouldnt you be taking math54 or ee16a for CS? i'm not too familiar with haas classes but i dont recall 53 being an important class for either haas or CS

also i would highly suggest you take prob140 over stat134 for your statistics requirement (in both prospective DS and for Haas). It's a better class for those who know coding, but you'd have to have taken math 54 or equivalent linear algebra. in your case you'd have to wait to spring to take it since it requires data8. data8 from what i hear is a fun class too, and not killer. might not be a bad idea to do data8/cs61a/(ee16a or math54)/breadth if you're looking for a challenge. sets your 2nd semester up nicely.
If you've programmed before and are comfortable with probability then you can do #2. Otherwise I'd do 1. I think 3 might be too easy for you depending on how much math/programming you've taken. 
In terms of data science vs CS, basically at this point the major difference is how much CS you want to do. If you're okay with mostly taking lower divs, then it's fine. Otherwise the problem is that right now DS students don't get reserved seats in upper div CS classes, which makes actually getting into them relatively hard.

As for job prospects, it's hard to tell, since the major is so new there's no real statistics. Can't imagine it'd be that bad.

Yes, you need to submit your high school transcript still as a transfer. On calcentral there's a task to submit your high school transcripts and AP scores.
You need 120 units to graduate. If you come into Berkeley with 0 units (no test or transfer credits) and take a standard 8 semesters to finish, this comes to 15 per semester. Of course, there's no requirement to split it up that evenly, and many people come in with additional units anyway. So don't worry about it.
Don't worry. 4 x 4unit class and 1-2 unit ""fun"" class are easily manageable. Because of so many choices here and the expense to live, most people take at least more than 15. I had say 17-19 is respectable. After that, it becomes a risk. Also, if you take less credits one sem, you can give a petition to take more in another. 
What? Because that's the minimum. The expectation is that you take more than the literal minimum to be a full time student. In particular, they are expecting you to graduate in 4 years rofl.

The minimum grade to pass is like a C, yet people usually don't aim for a C lol
[deleted]
Distance is never a problem. Check ""Berkeley time"" the 10 minutes before every class or discussion starts.
If you go through Module 4 of GBA, there are parts that talk about a-levels and ap exam scores etc. counting for random stuff. Might be helpful.
i've seen your post unresponded to twice now, might be better to make an actual post if it isnt answered in ~1 day
Although the vast majority of students who take the BART never have issues there are of course safety risks with not only taking the BART but walking to and from the downtown Berkeley station. Those issues are magnified if you go during obscure hours. 

Not to mention your commute will be 1.5 hours each way... ouch. And it's not like you're on a Google bus where you can bust out your laptop and do some work. For your first year I would highly recommend you live closer if possible. It will not be pleasant BARTing from Fremont to Berkeley several times a week.
I've only taken bart a couple of times, but it's definitely uncomfortable lol. You don't exactly feel safe.
If you really want to go to med school, don't be a CS major unless you're really really confident in your CS background and think you can ace the classes. Med school really values GPA and Cal is already known for deflation.

For sample 4 year plans to figure out your schedule, look under the Plan of Study tab in your desired major on guide.berkeley.edu.
>How doable is CS major/premed?? 

Not. Just doing CS and getting a GPA high enough for a grad school is hard enough, to take a bunch of unrelated techs *and* study for the MCAT pushes it even more.

Remember, the average for upper div CS classes is a B/B+. And they're all curved, i.e your grade is based on how much better or worse your score is to the average.

To get a 3.8-ish you need to consistently be better than at least 90% of your peers. In all of your classes. Not easy.

Premed or CS. Unless you're a genius, pick one. Even if you're a genius, pick one, because I don't see the point in doing both.
Only the credits.
For L&S, here is the policy page (might have other info you want):
https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/transfer-credit

and the other comment is correct by the first bullet point:

> For transfer course work from UC Extension (XB or XBW courses) and other UC campuses, both units and grade points are posted to the Berkeley transcript. For approved transfer course work from all other campuses, only the unit credit is posted to the transcript. 
Buses are fine, BART is sketchy af.
No, there's one proactive drop. The deadline for last semester was the end of dead week. It's too late now.
If it's a medical issue then there's a chance you could work something out with the department. Get in touch with your adviser, and the EECS department administrators
Nah you enroll in what you want. Don't plan too your schedule too hard regardless, half of your planned classes will be full anyway.
pol sci 5 is sadly full 
Just wanted to give you a heads up that Econ 1 is already full, and Art 8 is filling up too.
The SHIP waiver form is just a dumb form. Like, multiple choices + a few fill in the blanks. And it's obvious that they don't even look at what you put since if you put in the right answers you are immediately waived lol

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/68xuju/ship_2017_waiver_cheat_sheet/?sort=new

Just put the ""right answers"" and be done with it.
Start early. 
Get the book and look over another year's syllabus with whatever prof you have. It's gonna be fall so it'll probably be the Gordons. 
Doesn't really matter since by in large material is the same year to year. 

Unlike a lot of other courses here chem 1a starts hard and fast. Theres gonna be a lot of freshman (probably premed) and really quick it's gonna look like the D-Day scene from saving private ryan. 
People will drop the course after the first one or two midterms. The longer you can hold on, the easier the course gets. That's just to survive though. 

On a practical sense, start learning MO's (molecular orbitals). Your chem ap scores/grades gonna mean shit since this stuff isn't really covered in that course. For most people this will be the first they see it. Consider this the first and biggest hurdle in the course. Don't let it be a surprise. 

That's pretty much it material wise. The other material I'd say is relatively fair for everyone there; if you made it in here, everything you're gonna see is fair game. I wish there was a way to ""work smarter"" but this is just one of those courses you gotta put your back into and grind it out, imo. Work harder than the poor bastard next to you. Go over old midterms to see the bs questions he puts up. 

Lab is a massive time sink, but at least its relatively mindless. Try to actually do the prelabs and not just scribble something the night before. 
You just don't take them. There's no process for it. In general you don't need to have completed preqreqs to enroll in classes.

For L&S, you can skip 1AB with Calc BC, American History (but not cultures) with APUSH, R&CA with AP lang and R&CB with AP lit.


If you want to keep premed as an option, take the 10 series, since it includes stats and probability, which med schools require. Taking the 1 series will require you to take a semester of stats for med school.

You can find more details here: https://career.berkeley.edu/Medical/PrepPrereq
Don't take either.

> but I'm taking math again at Cal because *cries in premed*

That's even more reason not to take it. Taking calc at cal will only *decrease your GPA* if anything, and it's not going to help with any future classes.
You should spread it out. Better to have a consistently medium difficulty schedules than a bunch of really easy schedules then a bunch of hellish schedules.

There's no real reason to do only breadths. Just take like 1/2 breadths with 1/2 techs.
Yes--inherently easier because department doesn't set the curve in special topics courses 
Yes, all berkeley students are give an AC transit card which allows us to use the AC transit buses for free
The FPF building is on Southside so Units will be closer. Yeah you can stay during Spring break but not during Winter break
From what I heard, ColWrit may have interesting topics, but are the hardest of all R&C classes. Philos is not that good either -> check berkeley time. Best bet is to wait for 2nd semester sophomore year.

No it's too big
it's possible to fit one in, but you need to re-arrange the tables and re-structure the layout of the room to allow it. Ask you roommates if they'd be willing to experiment 
I think it is more useful to bring a 24 inch computer monitor and just hook it up to a laptop. It's cheaper and more versatile than a TV and you do not have to worry about cable or anything.
First, everyone that's not a prefrosh has already enrolled in classes. My enrollment time was like may 2nd or something.

Secondly, regents, athletes + a few more get early registration.
Sure, you're not beholden to prereqs when enrolling anyway (generally).

I took english r1b my first semester, really wasn't bad at all. It was taught by a really nice doctoral student, often decided to cancel some assignments he had planned in the syllabus lol. Really small class sizes for R1B are nice. 
I thought they were discontinuing FPF-SF..? I would just send a real quick email to your counselor though if you're still uncertain
Yes I have the same issue. I'm hoping that it means that instead of being disbursed, it will go to the school first to pay the costs and if there's anything leftover THEN it's disbursed to us. 
you'll be fine if you take one of 61a/b or 70 in the summer not taking any technicals in the fall
Teleman, I can't speak for Math 54, but I had him for 189, and his homework is going to be quite difficult, but his tests will be pretty straightforward. 

I found 61A to be incredibly easy as a math major, but I definitely recommend going easy your first semester, and then ratcheting it up later, rather than the other way around. You'll also want to be making friends and being engaged socially, I assume, and that takes time. 
If you are in L&S, no. You cannot cover any of the breadths with AP or IB credit
Should be pretty accurate, I've never had it change but I know peers who've had significant issues with it and had to take it up with the office. I'd suggest looking at the assigned cost of attendance and using the money amount allocated for housing (divided by 10) to figure up to how much you could possibly receive in aid for monthly rent. That would include loans/work study too though. What are you looking for, a shared triple, double or single room? I can give you numbers if you'd like. 
It should be somewhat accurate, but mine changed substantially after classes began. So it is possible it will change.
Cold emails. Feel free to PM me for more advice
Not gonna lie, not easily. Surprisingly, a fair amount of people I know have an internship but at least 90% of them (including myself) got them through nepotism. So, if you got the connections use them.

Otherwise it's pretty rough. The moment you say you're a freshman you can see the light fade from recruiter's eyes and you can tell they're only talking to you for courtesy's sake. Most applications will explicitly want sophomores+ or junior+.

But go to career fairs and events anyway, it's good experience. At first you may feel dejected but eventually you'll stop giving a shit, which is good: the job search ends up being a lot of breadth not necessarily depth.

If you do manage to get an interview, you won't really learn the necessary skills until 61B + 170. Probably won't do well, but you can get a copy of cracking the code interview and try your best.
[deleted]
yeah just be prepared to not have too much free time when midterms for 61a/16a come around
[deleted]
obligatory not EECS but I'm CS and i know a bunch of EECS:

Although I cant say how you will fare in these classes, and idk what your standard of doing ""well"" is, this kind of schedule for EECS freshman is normal, as well as adding on an easier H/SS breadth. I would generally recommend to add a 4th class, and drop if you feel like you dont have enough time.
You shouldn't worry about whether to P/NP classes now, you can figure out as late as 10 weeks into the semester. If the class is faceroll easy there's no reason to waste P/NP units on it (though it seems pretty rare for someone to actually max out on those).

Depending on your programming background and study ethic this schedule could be very easy, very hard, or somewhere in between; I've seen people with all three different experiences.
yo astro 10 was dope tho
[deleted]
R1A is a more intense 6 unit course that simultaneously fulfills the entry level writing requirement. If you've already fulfilled it then don't bother with that class and do R4A instead.
what major are you thinking of? stat20 might be redundant if you take data8 and later the stat88 connector course.
New Transfer as well, I think there's an American Culture course we need to take.
An American Culture class most likely, and maybe a language course. I know for those in an L&S major, you have to take at least a level 2 of whatever language you choose, and it has to be at Cal. You can also check your requirements on the Academics section of CalCentral, under the degree process part. 

Just realized I have to take an American History class and am kind of bummed haha
https://www.berkeleytime.com/catalog/

the filters are a reliable way of checking requirements. since it is a university wide requirement, i most likely assume it is the same for haas as others, in that any R*A satisfies R&C A, and same for B.
take your cluster whenever you want
are you CS? or EECS? math53 isnt necessary if you are the former.

4 classes is pretty standard, with 2 techs is a very usual amount for a STEM major. the berkeleytime thing likely has seats reserved for sophomores, meaning freshmen cannot directly enroll.
if you just want to minor in CS you can take it slow

everyones different and some people can handle 61a with no experience and some can't
1a/1b are total weeder courses though so it'll be annoying taking them with 61a but it's definitely possible esp if u keep a light workload otherwise and p/np easier breadths
I think the second schedule looks good to me.  My advice for new students is always to take it easy first semester.  University workload/life style is very different for most incoming students.  You can get yourself adjusted for classes/life at cal first semester, dedicate time to exploring clubs and other student orgs.
either are fine but think about saving r&c for a future semester because it's a time consuming prereq

if you opt for the first schedule probably p/np your breadth
I can't speak for Japan 1A, but the 3 technicals, while on the harder side for a first semester freshman, is manageable with an easy breadth. 61A and 16A are pretty hard; Data 8 is also tricky and deceptively hard, but far less intensive than the other two. 

It all depends on the difficulty of the Japanese class - if it's intensive, like most language classes, then I'd recommend against it. Else, it's fine
I’ve heard from CS61A students who took Data 8 later that it was a walk in the park, so technically I guess this is fine.

Do you have coding experience though? If so, I think adding a breadth would be fine. Maybe a little tougher than other similar schedules but arguably okay. If not, probably don’t add a full breadth?

I’d highly recommend seeing if any of the freshman seminars interest you. Or any other 1 or 2 unit class in that case.
recommend looking into stat88 connector to data8 instead of taking stat20. i am not qualified to comment on the other parts of the schedule
probably taking on too much.  Thats 18 or 19 (?) units you're proposing.  That is more units than I've ever taken during a semester at Cal.  I'd suggest either doing four 4-unit classes (16) or three 4-unit classes + (decal/seminar).  In your first semester you really want to be adjust yourself to cal and also reserve yourself time to explore clubs/student orgs.
I also went to two high schools so I just went to the school district and they gave me the transcript for my entire time at both schools.
You should be fine, you probably have more programming/math experience than most of your peers in those classes. 
Educ 130 AC is an enroll-by-instructor class, I think. If you just keep emailing people, and show up to the first couple of days, they should let you in if there’s space. It’s normally reserved for education major/minors, so you might want to have a back up :) 
I took it with Ryan McWilliams. Honestly, I've learned to improve my writing more with other classes i've taken at Cal. Prof's usually give out helpful hints of what they're looking for to help your midterm, essay, final writing project process.

I got a Unit 2 apt triple as well. Personally, I accepted it because it's the cheapest on campus option and from the things I've read it's pretty social and conveniently located. I used to work at a camp and the housing arrangements were so much ""worse."" I had 4-6 roommates in a tiny place, low pressure showers, no internet/tv, little privacy, etc. It was actually great because all the people I lived with were awesome so I figure living in a triple can't be too bad.
I just submitted mine, it's no longer down.
There aren't any. If you don't have ap calc/IB/dual enrollment credit, then you're free to start with calc or take remedial math.


Unless you're in the College of Natural Resources, ESPM 50AC is full. You can check reserved seating in the [Class Scheduler](http://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2018-fall-espm-50ac-001-lec-001). Other than that it looks good. If you can get into UGBA 10 this Fall, that might be worth switching out one of your breadths for.
I never had a task for h.s. transcript on CalCentral when I was admitted as a transfer last year.  Don't take my word for it but I believe we were eventually told if we completed IGETC that a h.s. transcript was not required. I would send it anyway. Just have your h.s. mail it.
Berkeley course catalog usually says.
Or just search the class and check a previous semester's syllabus. The prereqs 99% of the time are the same. 
Welcome to Cal!

Yes, 61A has a lot of students who are completely new to programming, and they offer a lot of help and resources to succeed in the class. But it is a very hard class, so expect to put in a lot of time into it.

For breadths, most people choose them according to their average grade and/or their interests. Breadths are meant to be breather courses, so take whatever you would feel the most comfortable with or something that you are interested in.
6.

For the first few months, it will feel fine. But as the year drags on, the dishes will feel repetitive and boring, and they'll start closing some stations early or not have food at some stations at all (namely the bear fusion one). Quality will also go down over the year. There were a few nights where the grill station had a single hotdog on a slice of bread. As less and less people come to the dining hall, they serve less and less food.

But there are definitely days when the food is good or okay, it's not always bad. I've been going there for the past two years and I really don't like it, but it's easier for me than cooking. 
I've done both with Kamala for econ and lucas for stats. What kind of advice are you looking for in particular?
It's not that you receive money for waiving it, it's more like they don't charge you for it. Check the costs and stuff in calcentral and they take it off.
Just send it with your other scores, they should give credit for all of them by December.
My advisor sent me an email through my berkeley account.  If you don't have one there I would imagine you haven't been contacted, though I don't know why that would be.
It's not by credit hour. If you choose to take, say, 13 units, you'd still pay the exact same as a student who takes 20 units.
I think that’s fine, though Math 55 is usually taken before Math 110. I assume you’ve already taken a proof class though so go ahead. I think 61A will be the highest workload. I personally think self studying gives people a false sense of understanding, especially for Math and CS classes. If you do all the stuff a regular student in 61A does like taking practice midterms and finals, doing all the assignments and projects, doing discussion sheets, and reviewing material again then I think you might be fine. 61A is a hard prerequisite for some CS classes.
I took ASAMST 128AC as a freshman and I thought it was a pretty easy class. The lectures got kind of boring since they were 1 hour and 30 minutes, but if you take good notes then you should be fine. You can just skim through the required reading tbh. The midterms were easy too; the questions usually asked about stuff discussed during lecture. If your workload isn't too heavy then I think you can definitely manage this class :)
both my roommates took it last semester and found it to be a relatively easy A. Not suggesting you do this, but they didn't attend lecture at all--for attendance they used a gps spoofer and signed in from our room, and for studying they got this huge document from their friends compiling the information they needed to memorize the day before midterms. So i suppose that by attending lecture regularly and studying regularly, it's probably pretty easy.
Friends who took it last fall as junior transfers found it hella easy.
Are you trying to transfer from a CC? If so, and assuming they don't change anything from last year, then no. There was nowhere on the UC transfer application for ACT scores, SAT scores, or high school grades.
It’s per semester/summer units. Graduating a semester early will save you money.
Your best chance is to figure out which classes you need to take, and then for each of those figure out if you can skip out of them based on your scores, which is easiest done from the course catalog.
Yep!
If you want to take math 1A and data8 at the same time, i recommend only taking 1 other 4 unit class and then adding a decal or seminar or something small.  What you have lined up seems like too much for a first semester at Cal. you're gonna want to ease yourself in 
If you have any calculus experience then that schedule should give you plenty of time to enjoy your first semester, but if not then it might take up more time but definitely still doable. Also, check the Academic Catalog to make sure all your classes still have space (classes.berkeley.edu)
Even if you're not in adjunct, take advantage of the SLC! Adjunct is useful but if you don't feel the need for extra structure/don't want the extra unit or time commitment, drop-in tutoring can be really helpful too - you can get  personalized help both conceptually and regarding specific problems that way.

In my experience, Math 1B isn't as difficult as it's reputed to be. It gets annoying at times, but conceptually it's not too bad - as long as you understand, for example, how/why the convergence tests work, you'll develop an instinct for what to do in each case. There's also a lot of resources out there, such as [Paulin's Spring 2016 website](https://math.berkeley.edu/~apaulin/1B_001%20(Spring%202016).html) for the course.
Yeah def adjuncts are lit
Take a look at this [final exam](https://math.berkeley.edu/~meiref/final/final1.pdf) from Math 16A a few years ago. If you feel shaky about a bunch of the questions, it might be a good idea to take the class.

But if you're willing to spend a bit of time on your own this summer reviewing the material you missed in Calc BC then I'd recommend going straight into Math 16B. 

Yes, you should notify your advisor about the AP tests you didn't end up taking.
[deleted]
As a recent BioE graduate, I still recommend taking BioE 10 (it’s a great class, and the professor is one of the best on campus).  MSE is cool, but there’s also a joint MSE-BioE major that is popular.  Also definitely save E7 for the spring.  In the fall it’s run by the MechE department, who makes it way harder than the CivE department, who takes over in the spring.  If you want to go further in CS, the easier E7 still does a good job, and I did that followed by 61B with Hilfinger and did great.
Reserved seats. For instance, if a non CS or EECS student tries to enroll in any upper division CS class they are automatically waitlisted no matter how many seats are open. 
Yeah you're allowed to declare CS regardless of your college as long as you pass the GPA cap for CS (3.3 in 61A, 61B, and 70)
Not sure about Econ but for Haas they look at your overall GPA and course schedule, so yeah they would look at both grades.
You're good, it'll transfer over.
pretty sure all your credits from CC transfer. whether or not they fulfill breadth requirements depends. Check [assist.org](https://assist.org) for more info on CC transfer to UC Berkeley specifically
Looks good, just make sure that all the classes you're signing up for have spots available (classes.berkeley.edu)
No, you apply to one and then apply for others later if you're double or triple majoring. Besides, apart from haas major acceptances are objective (i.e based purely on GPA) so you basically know whether or not you'll get in.
It'll be a bit tougher than your previous semester, but if you did good last semester then you should be able to pull through, just might have to work a bit harder or settle for slightly lower grades.
that is brutal man, then again I'm doing something similar next semester
What's your major? What bio class?
Yeah, you definitely can take 2 math classes your first semester. I recommend taking easier history/biology breadths so you can focus on getting a high GPA in your math classes (you can check the average grades on Berkeleytime.com).
Skip both of them. Its not suicide--in fact it might boost your grade. Calc 1 and 2 are weeder courses, they're artificially difficult. No reason to take them again if you don't have to.
If you're looking to maximize your chances for Haas, Option 1. 

But if you actually want to learn something which will help you in upper division econ and business classes, do either Option 3 or 4 and take Math 53 afterwards.
Option 5. There's no point wasting time relearning things if you already got a 5 on BC. 

53/54 aren't weeder courses like 1A/1B are, especially if you get a good professor.
option 1 is fine, astro c10 is fun if you can get it
Should be fine, I don't see how it'd be detrimental. 
you can also take a freshman seminar, they ""help"" you with topics depending on class because its a smaller class size
There's no checks or anything you just walk in, so

1) no

2) yes

In fact, many of the CS courses are webcasted so you don't have to go at all.
Usually not a problem but some classes (Lower div chem classes come to mind) have electronic questions that you need to answer in class, in the lecture you're registered for. Not all classes though!
From my point of view that seems pretty reasonable. That being said, I can’t really know what you’re actually capable of despite your previous courseload. From my experiences talking to other transfers, the first semester can be extra rough because there may be a lot of surprises (housing, financial aid, etc) and often you don’t really have a support network in place yet. Personally, I like to sign up for the classes that I’m interested in but also have a list or a mental order of which classes I’m going to drop first if things get too difficult. So, as long as you have an idea of what to do if things get tough, I’d say go for it. 

Best of luck! 
Assuming you keep your work ethic up, this seems like a fine schedule. you did well in a semester with 4 techs, and moving down to 3 techs should be still manageable.
They’re offering Phil 2 in the spring (you can check the philosophy course offerings on philosophy.berkeley.edu in the courses tab)  so I would probably suggest the seminars (unless the seminars are also offered in the spring). If it’s more important for your major to take Phil 2 (as in it will affect your gpa) I would personally hold off until spring when you’re better acquainted with the university. Especially if you’re thinking of being pre-law or getting a professional degree. 

Hope this helps!
By math 98, if you mean the SLC math adjunct course then yes - it is worth it. They essentially drag you through the class and make you do lots of extra practice problems along the way, so when you get to exam time you'll be more prepared than most of the other students. 
are you a CS major?

--

cs 24 may not directly help with cs10, as it is a seminar course, but you might get a chance to make good friends who are in a similar situation. also adjunct is really really helpful if you're not too confident with the math courses. you essentially get tutored :)

Contrary to what most people are saying here, it might be worth taking Math 1B (which is generally easier than Math 53) if you're looking to maximize your chances for Haas. But if you actually want to learn something useful for upper div econ and business classes, I would take Math 53 instead.
You’re from the UK?
if you can waive it i would 100% recommend waving it. speaking for the cs side of eecs (since i'm not sure if you're planning on being more ee focused or cs), i dont think i've used anything from math53 in any upper div cs class.
Yeah definitely skip it if you can. Only thing you need to remember is partial derivatives
If it's been a few years since AP Econ for you, it might not hurt to take Econ 1/2. It might also help you for getting into Haas since you'll probably get a nice grade.
if you thought ap econ was straightforward, you should skip econ1/2. it will be a waste of your time
I would find a different course, and keep an eye on this one just in case the seats open up. Usually reserved spots open up sometime near the beginning of the semester iirc, but honestly it's just best to find a course you can get a seat in.
It's just like any other lab. There are usually fewer students compared to other labs because of the inconvenient time.
Roommate assignments are typically released a few weeks before classes start. Not sure if you get a notification, but if you do, it's most likely by email. You can see your roommates on the housing portal.
Did you ever get to make a roommate profile? I was never given that option (the tab has always been locked), so I’m wondering if roommate assignment is supposed to random?  
Call the financial aid office and talk to them about it. They may be able to extend the deadline for you.
you're probably fine, it's just that it can be hard to focus on adjusting to college and trying to ace such a competitive class so people put it off until they develop good work habits, etc.
13.5 units max, yes waitlist counts
Either is fine. 53 gives you good a geometric interpretation of 3 dimensions which translates to 54. You could say the same thing about 54-> 53, but you might as well just get the calculus out of the way before you forget all of it. 
Content wise, you don’t really need one before the other. I could make some arguments for both sides, but they’re so negligible that you should really be emphasizing finding a good professor/class times.
doesnt matter too much, you could theoretically take them both at the same time lol
As a night owl, I personally really loved having one or two late sections (e.g. lab) during my first semester. Didn't really have any qualms about them (except maybe dinner, but it just meant that I had to eat relatively earlier/later on those days)
All I can say is that I would so much rather have taken night labs than the 8am ones I had. Also once you finish the lab and get checked off you can leave, so often you'll be done earlier than you think
be solid in your problem solving. for the 2nd half it helps if your calculus hasnt deteriorated (specifically integration), b/c that's one of the easiest points that students miss. a lot of 134 is recognizing problems, so just do the hw and understand the types of problems that are being presented.
i would say 126 for the rigor and pertinent eecs applications they integrate (basically more relevant to (ee)cs majors). cs188 is a lighter workload class but difficulty is pretty high on the midterms/finals compared to the regular hw, so people often miscalibrate. it's also not really relevant unless you're specifically interested in reinforcement learning part of AI
The Unit Academic Centers (below ground level) do have printers, yes, but I personally brought a printer and my dorm mates and I found it very useful. You never know when you have to print something last minute.

Bonus: floormates/friends on your floor may ask to use it, which was a great way to get to know them. :)
don't bring a printer imo. they have printers downstairs and the cost is virtually nothing. Whenever I had to print something I'd just go downstairs and print it in the ""academic"" center which is in unit 1. 
Nope. I took Tibetan 110 before, despite being an upper division course I spent about 0.5 hrs a week on it. The class only had 3 1 hour lectures a week (and you can def get away skipping all of them), and the only assignments were a 2 page double spaced essay every \*other\* week. 

It really depends on the course. Some will be very hard, some are stupidly easy. Just stay away from STEM upper divs since they usually assume more background knowledge.
the upper-div ""difficulty"" bias only comes into play with mainly technicals or major-specific courses like if you compare math 54 (lower-div linear alg) to math 110 (upper-div linear alg), 110 would obviously be harder than 54. But, they have upper div courses (in my experience some bredths) that don't really differentiate themselves from lower-div in difficulty or work-load wise. in your case, c160v is a very popular bredth, which means that 1) it should/may be an interesting course I mean the subject is literally happiness which is pretty unique and 2) it won't necessarily be HARD like other upper-divs might be. hope that helped
This is very dependent on the class . Sometimes discussion/lab is just an additional assignment that doesn't necessary align with the timing of the class.  Other times it's a review of the lectures that came before it. It might even be the case that your discussion is just behind the others, I.e if you had Tuesday Thursday lectures and there was a discussion class on Friday and Monday, the one Monday would likely cover the same things as the Friday's despite being in different weeks.
there's no one enrolling for classes in the spring right now.
It's typically people on and near your floor, but not necessarily your roommate. Mine wasn't, and most people I know didn't have their roommate in their groups. It might be intentional.
For me last year, they separated roommates and just group you with people in your building/neighboring building.
F
If you're able to physically go to campus at some point, then actually going into the financial aid office yields a lot better results than their shitty over the phone support.

You'll stay in the class. FYI you don't really need math 1B for EE16A.
Often, very popular classes like Math 1B will get additional discussions. If the lecture is closed, you may be out of luck.
That really depends on the class. I took an upper division Tibetan class (modern tibetan culture) and it was the easiest class I've ever taken. 

Would stay away from upper div STEM classes since those usually require knowledge from lower divs, but many of the humanities upper divs can be okay, esp. if they're ""weird"" classes.
usually upper div classes get to ""assume"" you've taken lowerdiv core, in this case you've passed through the reading and writing requirements, and whatever else may be necessary. if you really need it you can just try it and drop/pnp it later
there's a common rule for larger classes, 10% rule. meaning about 10% of the people will drop the class, allowing the next 10% on the waitlist into the class. I would stay in the 476 person class, but start looking around for the other one, unless you have high faith.

""Physics 89 is required for physics majors (replaces Math 54). Students who are planning a double major or a minor with Mathematics and Physics may use Math 54 in lieu of Physics 89. All other double majors and minors are required to complete Physics 89. Transfer students may satisfy the requirement with the Math 54 equivalent. Transfers admitted prior to completion of Math 54 will be required to complete Physics 89 at UCB.""

http://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree/the-major-and-minor-program

Yes. Only if you are a math double can you swap 89 with 54. Otherwise, you have to take 89.

IIRC astro will accept 89 in lieu of 54
They'll all be posted [on this page](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&semester=Fall+2018&start_time=&end_time=&sort=&button=) in the first few weeks of the semester - you can click around the site and look at past semester's DeCals to get an idea of what they're like!
you might have to pull back on taking significant roles in clubs or rec activities, but otherwise you're fine. especially if the classes aren't all requirements for your Major
it's usually fine but advisors for some reason recommend against it (this is true if you believe you will have a hard time adjusting to Cal, but 99% of the time it's fine)
It'll really depend on what kinds of classes you're taking. If you're taking 4 technical classes, it's going to be tough - but if it's two technicals and two electives, any maybe one is PNP, you'll have no problem at all. 
Way to broad to effectively answer, and everyone's going to answer it through their own biases. Professional frats especially have a huge range of different requirements for entry, the only way to find out is to visit any you are actually interested in joining and talking to the people involved, no real way of planning ahead till you get hede.
afaik generally not as open during the year compared to other schools i know (stanford, redlands, davis) in terms of going to like parties during the year. stanford you can basically go to a frat party most weekends. berkeley doesn't seem to be that way
I haven't taken this specific class but upper div BioEng classes are known for being easy. You can check the grade distributions on berkeley time to see what percent of people get an A/B/C/F.
Go to calcentral and look under the my academics tab. If you click on class adjustement on the right hand side it should say your place.
Hey I'm a history major so I can help ya out. Lower Div history classes are generally set up like this. Lecture covers the main history (I.e the events, facts, and overall just tries to tell you what happens).  Discussion section is where readings are important.  You'll be assigned, likely (in my experience), 4-5 Books, as well as a reader that covers additional readings. This amounts to about 200 pages per week, but will vary depending on the readings assigned.  This might seem intimidating, but if you can learn how to read you will be better off.  This means developing your skimming skills, looking to analyze the main idea and overall points quickly and efficiently. You will have to approach each reading differently, as some require more intense focus than others, but you'll get better.  Your discussion section will touch on these readings and discuss them every week. Then there are essays which will vary by class.  Spend extra time on these, giving yourself enough time to make an outline/thesis, email your GSI said thesis and then writing and editing. I start essays at a minimum of a week before it's due, but I think two weeks truly works best.  The essays are generally going to be you incorporating the readings into a prompt answer so it IS important you actually read and keep up.  Finally Midterms and Finals usually have some sort of method to ensure the readings are incorporated, so it's difficult to truly do well and skip out on them. 

I apologize if I made this sound difficult. It truly is manageable and fun if you develop skimming skills.  Open communication with your GSI is also vital to a good grade.  If you find yourself struggling to keep up reading wise, especially with a difficult schedule, I would drop one of the classes. I've seen people who just fall behind in readings and never recover, or slip in grades. Good Luck!
I’ve only taken 1 history class here but it had the most readings I’ve ever done in my life. My history major friend says he has to read at LEAST 500 pages per week and write tons of essays. That’s harder than doing math/CS assignments imo 
Japan 7a isn't a history class per se, it's technically a literature class, but regardless there's just a lot of reading. Often you get assigned a few hundred pages every week for just one class.

IMO the best way to handle it is just not to read anything until you get an assignment then cram the pages that matter if you don't want to put in the time.
Math 53 moves pretty fast and I'd recommend skimming the textbook before you start the class -- it'll give you a good idea of what you'll need to refresh yourself on before you take it. 
Just know everything from BC really well tbh. If you want, it might help to brush up on polar coordinates and parametric equations.
Very unlikely.
I'd stay on it. There's a good chance they'll expand and/or people will drop. Do you have a lab/discussion yet?
I mean theoretically you could sleep at labs/empty classrooms in Soda or Cory, or Moffit during the weekdays, shower at RSF, etc. 

But honestly not worth, you're going to be pretty miserable. Either get a job or take some loans. 

Is being homeless seriously better than working during the semester?
Man your quality of life matters more than saving a few bucks. Take out a small loan of like 4K/year and live at someone’s living room at least. You can easily pay off those loans when you get a job. Also try applying for scholarships and mention your circumstance. 

Scholarships may seem difficult or competitive but they really aren’t. Once you write a couple essays you can spend like 5 minutes on each application by copy pasting. I’ve received more than half the scholarships I’ve applied to. With just a few days of work I got more than $100k+. I am no means a bright student and your situation was worse than mine.
I personally opted to buy everything separately as it allowed me to vet every item I was going to use (and exclude things I didn't need). But if you're flying in, it may definitely be cheaper/more convenient to just buy a bundle. 
Some chain stores (I think BB&B is one) also have ship-to-dorm options for whatever you buy.
If you already have a printer you may as well bring it. You'll become the belle of the ball on your floor if you whore yourself out for printing. I see that as a plus since the dorm is about making friends.

I wouldn't go out and buy one though...there's lots of printing on campus.
I've always brought my own printer. I don't think many people asked to use it except my freshman year roommate.
I got by on a mix of using floormate's printers, printing at the Unit print center (5 cents per sheet I think?), and free EECS printing. OCF definitely gives (or used to give) free printing, which a lot of my non-CS friends used.

==

Also, if you're concerned about other people using your printer too ask them to pitch in for paper & ink costs.
I heard they depend on the professor. You could check out the class syllabus to check the workload, and the course catalog ([http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/](http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/)) to check if there is a final or not. 
Very bad idea
I am in the same situation as you. Don’t think we are ready for EE126, Math 55 only taught Prob for like 2 weeks whereas CS70 spends over half a semester on it. I decided on taking Stat 140. It is in between Stat 134 and EE126 in terms of content and difficulty
Tough but not crazy. 111B is way less of a commitment than 111A, 111A was ridiculously time consuming. for B I recommend doing the oral report for the first one. 112 has large problem sets, but it’s not too bad, though it is a solid challenge. 162 is supposedly pretty low key. 120 is that the optical lab? I took the radio lab last semester and it was a massive massive time sink, but I really liked the material. I assume 120 is going to also be a large time sink, but maybe less programming ?

Edit: also based on those classes you should think of adding Astro as a second major it’s only 3 classes if you do physics as well. 
There's no restriction as research is very informal and depends on your relationship with your supervisor. However, I'd advise against it because everyone I know who does research basically treats it as their full time job/internship.
As the other commenter said, definitely check with your mentor/supervisor to see how many hours they require you to work. Any restrictions should depend on what your mentor/supervisor demands of you. I know someone who takes a class (or two, not sure) while they do research, but they don't work full-time, so they're able to balance both. It's much harder and painful to take a class and do full-time work, but it's possible.
Doing research full-time and taking a class right now! Definitely helps that I get flexible hours for research so I can work around my class schedule. It's a lot of work but doable
You'll probably be better off contacting an admissions officer directly. Also, South Korea? My dad still complains about how crappy boot camp was back in the day haha.
[deleted]
Wada is pretty nice. The bedrooms are shared which sucks but they are large. The fridges are small, I recommend making sure you claim space in them ASAP with frozen food or groceries. My roommates would fill the fucking thing up if there was any empty space, with a ‘sucks to be you’ if you came back from the store and had nowhere to put anything. 
I lived in Wada as part of a triple & double set-up... so me and 4 other girls. The rooms are decently large and it never felt crowded even though I was in the triple. I had my own mini-fridge to combat that fridge space problem. The place comes furnished too. 
I took an upper div Latin class with 7 students enrolled and there were no changes. It probably depends on department and instructor constraints though, so I'd email the instructor to ask if it's likely to be an issue. (They might also change the time or try to combine is with other sections.
I signed up for a class that only had 2 people initially. Right at the start of class 30 people appeared lol
I took a language class with 4 people in it -- there were more but they dropped, and the class still ran!
Phase 2 is still going, the adjustment period is still coming up, and some people still sign up late for things anyways. Email the professor if you’re worried, but there’s still time for people to sign up. 
Very slim/little to no chances :/ Professor Wagner said that he has no plans on expanding the class for this fall semester and that it will be capped at 1296.
Yes, they do.
u can take 54 w/o 53 since they don't really cover the same material. 
Seems like a good plan, but also look into backup courses. The usual rule of thumb is 10%, but in your position I would definitely try to get lucky (and this rule of thumb isn't based on any evidence afaik, so assume big error bars). That said, looking into backup courses now can save you some stress later if you get unlucky.
It would be more helpful if you list the classes and waitlist position because the answer may vary.  If it's CS61A, you'll almost definitely get in, whereas if it's Wealth and Poverty, chances are you won't.
If you're EECS yeah you get the reserved seats.

I'm not sure how it is with not-Sahai, but 189 with Sahai regularly had **half** of the class drop. Not even exaggerating. So if you do end up waitlisted, by all means stay on, it's pretty likely you'll get in.
[deleted]
I don't think you can be on the waitlist for numerous sections at the same time. I'm guessing you're in that position for a single lab period -- there's a *lot* of movement in the first weeks of the class. Keep your eyes on the other sections, and understand you might have to sign up for a less-ideal course time just to make it off the waitlist at first. 
[deleted]
On your move in day, just show up at your assigned dorm, and the staff will give you your room number and keys.
You still get units for the AP classes you've taken, which count towards your 120 units for graduation. However, just as an example, for integrative biology, getting a 5 on the AP Calc BC exam doesn't get you out of your math requirements for the major. You'd still have to take math, but you do have a choice in either taking calculus again or higher level math.
I believe that GSI's teach those classes meaning they are different every time and with every teacher.  Don't think you'll be able to evaluate better or worse
Colwrit r4b is usually a research-style class revolving aroung a central modern topic, and is usually taught by a full professor (rare for r&c classes!!)  They seem like good classes and a lot of people recommend them for students in science (seems as though you're stem so that applies to you)    
Comlit r1b is generally considered to be one of the more obnoxious r&c classes, but they are more typical literature analysis classes.  They're not awful, but I would really suggest taking colwrit r4b.  That's what I'm taking this semester too!  
Check out the topic of the class you're in right now in the Berkeley Course Schedule, or in the Schedule Planner, or in the Shopping Cart.  See if you like it - if you hate it, consider enrolling in both and testing the waters for a few days, then dropping the one you like less after a week or so.  Drop deadline is the wednesday of the 4th week of classes, so DON'T forget to drop if you shop!
Yeah I have one tip: work hard and get into Stanford 👌
BBSnek has the right idea. Aim for Stanford and go to Berkeley once the Stanford rejection comes in.

If cost were an issue, if you didn't know already, summer tuition is based on units taken, not by sessions attended. So if you're worrying that you're not getting your money's worth by not taking classes/units, well, it doesn't really matter too much in this case.
Remember that summer classes cover the material twice as fast; a 4-unit class over the summer is like an 8-unit class during the regular term. Don't underestimate the amount of work an R1B will be; they are notorious for taking huge amounts of time. One class is fine for an incoming freshman, and you only pay for the units you take.
I took CS70 over the summer. It was a lot of work and I personally wouldn't have been able to do well in two classes at once, but I think someone handling a moderately heavy regular semester workload (say three techs + one other 3~4 unit course) probably could handle CS70 + R1B over the summer. It also depends on your relative strengths and preparedness for the classes. 

Also, you can do things besides classes to round out your summer -- research, part-time job (on campus or off), even part-time internships (I don't know how easy these are to find but I've seen people balancing time between internship and summer classes).
You could take the R1B in a different session than CS70 if you're okay with being in Berkeley that long. That way you'll have enough time to spend on 70 and still get two requirements done. (I'm doing this with an R1B and CS61B)
nope
Just call the financial aid office and talk to them about it.
I'm a (moderate) conservative stuent here and I can 100% attest that a lot of incidents are ridiculously exaggerated by highly partisan and biased sites. Around a dozen conservative speakers spoke at Cal last semester alone, and I attended quite a few of them - they were pretty interesting and attracted good turnout. Some of these speakers were in fact specifically invited *by the professors or adminstration themselves*, so Berkeley is definitely making an effort to diversify. There are many organizations that are Republican (largest college republicans in the nation I think), Conservative, Pro-Israel, Pro-life, etc. 

UC Berkeley is pretty apolitical, as far as the campus or the students are concerned - by that I mean they care far more about academics, research, clubs, internships, and all the other college stuff - most students couldn't give a shit about politics, tbh. Yes, most students are left-leaning, but they aren't gung-ho outspoken about their politics. Moreover, it isn't any more than any other school, particularly schools like UCLA, USC, Ivies, and so forth. 

I strongly encourage you to apply. I think literally anyone even slightly interested in Berkeley should apply, and then if accepted, should visit Cal day or spend a night, and make a decision then after speaking with myriad college students. There's so much 'fake news' about the school flying around; it's almost entirely exaggeration
It's definitely not. I can personally guarantee that it is 100% the media just blowing it out of proportion. Berkeley is of course mostly liberal like most colleges, but I've actually met a surprising number of moderates and even conservatives here.
Don't. Just skip it with BC credit. College calc classes are much more of a pain in the ass than BC ever was. It's not even close to the same. 
Korean 7A and Anthro 3AC are both not on the list of [early drop deadline courses](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Early%20Drop%20Deadline.pdf), which means you should have a good amount of time at the start of the semester to determine whether you can handle the workload. If you have any doubts, drop one of the classes a few weeks into the semester.
there's two gender segregated ones on the 5th floor, i'm assuming it's just easier for the plumbing to bevertically aligned? the 4th floor bathrooms are connected at the back so it's just one big bathroom with two entrances
It is doable but tough. In general it is best to go easy on yourself first semester as you figure out Berkeley. Go lighter on classes because even ""easy"" schedules can be tough at Cal. 
[deleted]
Probably because you're paying to store your stuff in whatever room you got. It's the same concept of if you rent from a landlord and you go on vacation, you still have to pay the full rent even if you're not currently occupying the unit physically.
Hard to do, considering grades make up a big portion of whether you will get into medschool.

That said the more things you have going on for yourself outside academics, the better. This is rather presumptuous, but the only reason you've tied stress to academics is because you fear the repercussions of a bad grade, or perhaps you have nothing going on for yourself outside academics. Make sure that you are still developing yourself as a well rounded person, not just a GPA slave. 

Also, it helps to major in something you care about. The most successful premeds/doctors I know are the ones who either loved chem to death so they actually enjoyed studying 24/7 (wtf?) or they majored in something they actually cared about like english, math, or philosophy. 
I have never heard of Saturday classes. What class is this?
[deleted]
depends who you talk to. 
Sounds like you picked UCLA. Good luck down there with the whole econ/music thing. Hope it works out.
not sure if this is a serious questions but if so : idk what you're worrying about? healthy rivalries are what make sports fun; what's the point of everyone around you supporting the same team. Shit-talking and sports banter is probably the most interesting part of watching sports and following a team so dw about that at all. It'll probably make you a bit more interesting, even


Yes! One thing I want to do is uphold the standards of Berkeley as a cc transfer student and to contribute to all facets of the university as other students do: research, student orgs, etc. I'm hoping to officially declare poliecon in my first semester and am exploring minors/possibly a double major as well. I actually met with a professor during his office hours last year, and he helped me figure out a feel for the polecon major! 
thank you!! i was honestly so worried 
Yeah just let them know, there’s a 0% chance they care
Do you know if there are any asian fraternities at UC Berkeley? I went to a school and live in a city actually being a minority (living in an area with mostly whites and hispanics) so I was wondering if there was an asian fraternity so it would be easier to connect with some asians. Do you happen to know?
Great post, but do any of these specify undergraduate education, or is it just implied?
Unfortunately, yes. However, in the US News Global rankings, many public schools do much better.
Thanks for taking the time to post such a detailed answer! That really helped.
It was a half joke, but I was tired of the constant emails.

I'll try this, and see how it goes, seeing as I can't block it normally. Thanks.
or ashby flea market. got a hat for $5 
To add to the last point: they expand the class size until it’s big enough to fit everyone, and post the lectures online because the class is too big to fit in the lecture hall.
[deleted]
If I don’t want to, could I just not take any math that semester or is it required? I’m trying to find ways to lighten my workload especially when I’m transitioning to Berkeley? And when you say I’m not sure it would go through, are you saying that because it would be too late or because roommates are not guaranteed in general. Thanks!
Third-ed. Maybe we should just all room together if things don't work out /s
Would also love to know about housing options for transfer students!
[deleted]
[deleted]
Thanks for your post- it’s very helpful! One more question: are you a transfer student or did you go there since your freshman year? 
Thank you so much for responding with so much info! You’re great, and I think I’ll be committing to berkeley :D
That's not true. Phase 1 is definitely during the school year.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Hey, thanks for the response! I had a couple more questions.

1. What's the vibe \(for lack of a better term\) of the new co\-ed Bowles? Like is it more lowkey/everyone minds their own business or does it have more of a social/party culture?
2. How hard is it to make friends outside of Bowles? One of my main concerns is that it's more isolated from the big dorms \(units 1\-3\).
The thing is That this task wasn’t on my dashboard before I accepted my admission. I formally accepted today and it just popped up. I’ve been using MAP to login. 
thanks for the input! I think regardless, if I really go and seek it, it'll be available.
this isn't sounding too great
As a counterpoint, most of the people I know found it very easy to get research, even as a freshman. If anyone's looking for research and can't get a spot, PM me and I'll personally help you get one.
okay thank you!
Oh shoot i see
Wow thank you so much. Exactly what I want.

[deleted]
It's not that rare. The course is designed so that people without prior experience have no gaps in knowledge.
Ok thank you. Btw do I need to take both of them or just one will be enough?
St. Louis is also not a fun place to be if you're Asian
thank you!
how is the declaring major process for L&S? :o and all the majors under the college are BAs? 
Well guess who's going to Berkeley then.
Very true, although there's a new dorm opening up on campus too for freshmen
If I'm not wrong, housing is guaranteed for freshman? Also I was kinda inclined to a more 'open' housing scene, rather than one building block like how the Units seem to be...Is Claremont or the other ones decent?
my roommate chose to do it and she really liked it!
Thank you for the reply! I have a few more questions if you (or someone else) doesn't mind:

- How's transportation? Can I walk everywhere? Do I need a bike or a car?

- How sketch is the area around campus?

- How hard it is adjusting to college life after high school?

- Will classes progressively get more difficult or is there a jump in between years?

- Any opinions on semesters vs quarters?
thanks for the reply!

may I ask about any pros/cons about Berkeley or what you like/dont like about it?
This comment is definitely accurate.

Happy second cakeday! /r/cakeday

(I'm here because I got a late comment reply, and then I was *really* late in checking my inbox for this account.)
hey now.  just cuz your school doesnt have as big of a name doesnt mean it's worthless!  college is what you make of it.

and... instead of being one of many super lit gifted students at cal, you get to be that ONE super lit gifted student at a school where youre BETTER than everyone else l o l  you'll be okay, bud
Wait, you couldn't get into 61B? I got into 61B and I'm a concurrent student...
[deleted]
Thanks!! Would you happen to know how I could make those aliases? (sorry if it's a dumb question)
> MIT is an outright better choice 

I think Berkeley CS is better than MIT. Berkeley's coursework is harder (Sahai can attest to this - EE 126 covers like 6.041 in the 1/3 of the time) and Imo their research faculty are bigger names in their field (especially in machine learning where everyone and their grandma wants to specialize in now)
I plan on getting a master's but not a PhD. I've also heard that Berkeley is a more fun place to be in terms of a normal college experience, but in some ways I feel kind of guilty choosing a college because it's more ""fun"" (probably has to do a lot with my high school habits and parents tbh).
>Berkeley's CS department is significantly stronger than Caltech.

Really? I'll agree for industry connections (definitely go to Berkeley if you want to head straight to industry after getting your Bachelors), but I my impression is that there is not much prestige difference on the academic&research side.
Thanks for the insights! How hard is it to prove I ""have what it takes?"" I would say I'm a pretty proactive student and I plan on continuing that in college. Will it still be extremely difficult? (I also plan on going to grad school for a master's so I assume doing substantial research is important.)
How would that affect me in practice?
makes sense
can confirm you make some amazing friends bonding with people over 61a!! there will be a ton of people in your dorm taking it at the same time as you, and there's no better way to make friends than to stay up all night debugging projects with them.
After declaring cs and making the gpa requirement,   can you also graduate in 3.5 years and take the same chill course load?
I have a question in response. Is Berkeley worth 40k more in debt? (I pay 10k more per year at Berkeley) 
lol yeah I was thinking that. Worried about quality of life at Cal.. from what I've heard it's in a bad area with high crime rates. How do u feel about living there? 
ok chill guess I'm taking it
Noted, thank you! 
Thanks for the detailed reply! Grad school is definitely in my future, but I’ve been so focused on trying to transfer that I haven’t put a lot of thought into it, and I have no idea what field I want to go into :/ I’m figuring now that having LBNL up the hill is a huge plus, but I will for sure look into each school more. 
Also congratulations! C.S is super competitive so you should be proud!
Hey I appreciate that! Good luck with your future endeavors regardless of what you end up deciding. 
Cooking is also going to be much cheaper than a meal plan.

I had the commuter meal plan the first semester I lived off campus, and I was very grateful that I could pop up to foothill for a hot meal a few times, but mostly it wasn't worth it. (And with hindsight I could have gone to the restaurants on Euclid, some of them are about as good for my criteria.)
Awesome! Thank you !!
Thank you!! what are the phases and why are there 2? Is BerkeleyTime a website or something, or is it in CalCentral? And ohhhhh so you want to try to sign up in phase 1 for the most competitive classes huh. Thank you sm this helped alot. Sorry with all the questions, I get confused on the internet easily. 
is golden bear advising like a sort of website or something? thank you! im just trying to figure out the system, and I'm really really bad at understanding this kind of stuff
who/what is reshall? I emailed them and they were very helpful but to clarify is it a group of people?
what do you mean my 2 techs?
Is CBE 40 also a lot of work? I don't think theres much room to movee CBE 40 even if I wasnt planning a minor or double major :(
Where do you add it to your cart?
i mean cs is competitive, but not cutthroat from what i've seen; you're more likely to find other people to commiserate with than you are to find people who will be petty or whatever. the kind of competitiveness i've seen here is more like ""everyone is so amazing that i have to be amazing too.""
do we have to bring our own lock for the lockers? sorry I've never seen and didn't know about bathroom lockers
Sure. Thank you. 
Lol alrighty looks like it's time for IB lol--less premeds and easier upper-divs, win-win for me :) but for now we're all sadly in the same pre-reqs 
Also which premeds don't worry about their grades 
So it doesn’t matter which one I take first? On the Civ Eng 4-year plan it shows 53 before 54. Thank your for your input 
Oh, I meant dividing the furniture between your roommates. Thanks!
there is a 2.8 gpa requirement to apply so hopefully it'll be okay
Thank you!
For L&S, you can generally take any course, upper or lower division, P/NP, as long as its not required for your major. If you want a course to count toward the ELWR, QR, or Foreign Language requirements, it can't be taken P/NP. Breadth and AC requirements can be taken P/NP and count. 

In my case, I can take this Major Elective P/NP, but it won't count towards my major now, so I need to take another elective. This varies by major and college though, so check Berkeley's site for your respective college and major to be sure. 
Thanks! In general how many classes would someone take in a semester on average? If it's only 2 days a week with 1.5 hours, then I'm guessing we take more classes than in high school? Also when you say labs, do you mean like a type of class?
Thanks for the comprehensive reply! I hope I like it because it’s what drew me to Berkeley originally, seeing how good their program is (rankings lol). The culture and rigor is what’s intimidating me rn tbh.

How is getting into classes? I know the Coc is relatively small but
what about ib exams? (not the full diploma, just 3 courses)
How different is learning in such a large environment and not having dedicated teachers compared to say high school or Cal poly slo?
thanks for the info!
Second sliver
Thank you, dude!
Is it possible to get “promoted” from Club A team to the actual NCAA team? I travelled a lot around Brazil for competitions and it has always been a big part of my life but my school counselor gave me bad advice about being recruited to colleges via soccer.
probably not difficult then lol
Yeah, you can't get into Haas directly as a freshmen. Generally people go undeclared L&S then apply sophomore year.
I can’t possibly visit; I’m an international student, and we can’t afford that :/

The reason I’m on the fence b/w Cal and UCLA is the academic rigor and research opportunities. 

Thanks for your help, though!
What exactly, in your opinion, gives Berkeley the edge over UCLA? (In Physics)
Ok, thanks!
^^ a professor emeritus just won the turing award
> Research is great but not common among undergrads. 

To expand on this a bit, its uncommon because most CS students aren't interested. Among my CS and engineering friends who looked for it, afaik all of them did research. It's not effortless to get research, but the opportunities are there -- you just have to be proactive about seeking them out.
Thank you so much! Thank you for the quick reply too.
+ I'm pretty sure by UC standards your grade is just the letter--so a C- is equivalent to a C (that's what they use in admissions grade calculations, at least)
Okay, that's a relief. Thank you so much!
Dude you're a god-send. Thank you so much.
They will send you the form after you try to enroll in conflicting classes. It will show up on calcentral
[deleted]
haas, or if I do not get in, then econ. in this perspective, which one would be the easiest but would also count as credit?? Thanks!
Thanks for your response! To my knowledge I thought Stat 133 is a requirement for the major, so I think I’m stuck taking it either way. Do you think there will be enough space in the class during phase 2?
i'd like to second the sentiment behind stat 133 - imo it's a pretty poorly structured class and stats majors are better off taking 61a + a crash course in R
It's on a separate transcript for the college, but I checked online and it looks like the credits should transfer over. Thanks!
I'd recommend this as well. 1b, regardless of previous AP Calc BC experience, can be challenging and not necessarily easier than 54.
You can no longer transfer into EECS from L&S as of this year. He can appeal but the odds are pretty much zero. CS and EECS share very similar classes, so I see no point in trying to get into EECS. 
Is this so? I only know (the post-grad paths of) a small number of people who did CS at UCI but they had roughly the same outcomes as my Berkeley CS friends -- some unknown companies, some at big companies. I don't know if they were standout students at UCI.

@Wikiman12 -- given your prior experience with programming, you probably don't have to worry about making the 3.3 GPA cap, *if* you put in the effort to stay on top of projects and lecture concepts. Most people with prior experience find 61A to be easy (or at least not very challenging), and 61b/c a step up in difficulty and workload. So if you can use 61A to build good study/work habits and get to know resources that might help set you up for the later courses.
I agree. if you have time and feel like exploring some CS stuff, it's great to learn more, but it's def not necessary though and enjoying your summer is also important
And CS10, it's why it exists
Would staying in the substance free hall idk limit friend making? Im looking into it because I’m literally allergic to alcohol but I would still like some fun and go to a few parties maybe. Does being in substance free like completely cut off that life? 
How much do your friends study?
>Don't listen to anyone else who tells you to avoid Berkeley because ""it's going to be hard to get a high GPA"". 

The med school acceptance rate is <45% (that's to a SINGLE medical school) and a lot of pre-med students really don't give a shit about the upper div hard Bio/Chemistry stuff. That you don't like quantum mechanics (but you have to take upper div quantum mechanics bc you're a chem major) is a terrible indicator for whether or not you are going to be a successful physician, but not doing well in that class can fuck over your chances of becoming a doctor.

Furthermore, a bio or chem degree doesn't really get you far in terms of job prospects. There is not much demand for bio/chem majors in the first place and you have to prove yourself better than the other half of med school applicants who get rejected.

Telling them not to worry about lower GPA is dangerously misleading and knowing people personally who got fucked by it (including one who graduated 3 years before you but finally was able to start med school last year) I would even say it is irresponsible.

>It almost makes me laugh when people want to compare Berkeley to any other UC in terms of STEM prestige

In terms of research prestige? I would even argue Berkeley > Stanford in several fields. 

But medicine is not the same as biology or chemistry. The most relevant hospital near Berkeley is UCSF, and it costs $10 on public transport (don't even think about crossing bay bridge at peak hours on car) + 2-3 hrs round trip. That's a huge commitment and a pretty penny when you have to balance lab time with classes.

At UCLA? Ronald Regan Medical Center is a 10 minute walk from on campus housing.
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but for prerequisite classes for declaring your major (cs61a/b, cs70), is it hard to get the class?
Thanks! I checked it out, but am still unsure about econ. Do you have any thoughts?
Black and white laser (cheap, fast, smaller) or color inkjet (more expensive, slower, but has copy/scan capabilities)?
yes! and seconding that, you could also try and get ta & ra positions to lower the cost of tuition and housing; however, they are time-consuming and difficult to get. I know many people who work jobs on-campus, and you could potentially work/get internships over the summer to somewhat offset the cost of Berkeley?

however, I will say that over 100k in loans is a huge amount, and I don't think it's particularly wise to take that much out.
Thanks!
are cellos particularly popular, or in demand? 
I got 5 on micro and 4 on macro, but I took it senior year. If I skip tho I’m going to study everything this summer to make sure I remember.
I’ve got no idea what classes to take tho and I’m scared:/
Yes, I did get in early — thanks for putting my mind at rest :)
I was looking at some EE classes and noticed one had a 7B requirement. If I wanted to take that class I would have to take 7B at some point but I want to take that without having to take 7A . Would that be possible? 7A itself isn’t a major requirement for cs in l&s
Got it. Thank you so much!

now I'm being flooded with new tasks
👌👌👌nice to meet u xXxnoykmbabua69xXx :3 😩😩😩
The chosen ones being all students and faculty? I am a student, no access, only login error.
Same here, so weird.  I heard Berkeleytime scrapes their data from CalAnswers and I wanted to go to the source as they update their grade distributions rather infrequently for some of my classes. 
I think so. I just got an email about it this afternoon. I don't know if it's engineering specific though. It sounded like other departments were going to be there but I was invited to the engineering one.
Cool! I might see you there then. Theres a thing in the morning too I think for the engineering transfers
Do you know where the event is on campus? I haven't gotten any information on that.

Oh yeah, I definitely agree! I’ve gone through the department website a few times and just wanted to hear about some student’s experiences in the program. I really just want to know what I have to look forward to from other students! Thanks for responding. 
I’m glad to know you like the program! People keep telling me that there are a lot more opportunities at Berkeley compared to the other schools I’ve applied to so that’s definitely something for me to keep in mind. Thanks for telling me about your experience! 
Thanks! That’s a relief.
Thanks! Is bike/skateboard theft common? And are the walkways too congested in between classes to ride?
Alright that’s nice to know, I think I am going to go for it. Thank you! 
I did choose Berkeley. Thank you for your response!
thank you so much! i'll look into it (:
Will do! Thanks!
Thanks for the response. Since all the EECS students enroll in it, is it difficult to get a spot in EE16?
Very much this. I think in some of my circuits classes there were almost as many MechE students as EECS. (Also BioEs)
Ah ok cool I’ll shoot them an email. Was it a hard interview process to be able to get to work on a show there? I wouldn’t want to have my own show, just do more behind the scenes stuff!

Thanks for replying!
SD has a pretty good scene for EE (Qualcomm etc -- a couple of my circuits oriented friends ended up in San Diego). But those companies also recruit heavily in Berkeley. I would guess that both schools have lots of opportunities to make industry contacts; Berkely might be a little better but I'm not very familiar with UCSD's career process.

Also the average EECS salary reflects that most EECS graduates go into software development, which tends to pay a better. But average starting salary for Hardware Engineers country-wide is around $70k IIRC, and California should be higher to account for cost-of-living.
rip am i too old already

on a separate note i heard gbo is worse than calso? any ideas?
Thank you this was super helpful! 
Thanks for the reply!

My linear algebra class was pretty proof based, and I feel like I have a good grounding in the subject. I'm just worried that this courseload will be too much to handle and may harm my GPA significantly. 

Would you happen to know approx. how many hours it would realistically take to do well in these courses?
I see. How has your experience been with math courses beyond 110 (e.g., Math 104 or 185)?
[deleted]
I see. I was thinking that 77 would be useful for research and labs as it teaches data analysis techniques and useful languages like Matlab. Is there an alternative class that teaches this better? 

Regarding my research plans–I'm planning on contacting some experimentalist professors in the plasma or particle physics departments to join their group (I have a bit of experience in that field). If I'm not allowed, I'll likely just continue in the mech eng lab I work in now. The units are just so I can keep a reduced courseload without going under the unit requirement. 
That one's good too but I found what I was thinking of:
The Berkeley List
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CQGuJs82CEx_9BC4JhvSZtxP0PEAxhoI_Gnoi_vGkI/edit?usp=sharing
How is theater r1a in general? It has an A- average in berkeleytime and seems to be the most interesting of the A- average classes
Yeah definitely depends on the Prof/GSI, because they'll be grading your papers
Ok thanks. So the housing office will send me an email or do I have to check in some portal?
>ransfer here. My class enrollment date is until July 15 but the two Physics 111A classes are already full and closed. Is there ser

I don't have to take PHYS 89. Any other recommendations? I see that PHYS 112 is open. 
Didn't know that 2xx means graduate. Good thing i checked
Hey, pnobel, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Perfect, thank you!
Also, contact Berkeley's admissions office and/or your assigned admissions officer.
contacted them, they told me not to worry about it (even though my L&S advisor told me to contact my previous hs). thanks!
Thanks so much for the thorough reply. Yeah, I guess some students tend to focus on the negative aspects for that relatable meme factor, but you make some good points about Unit 3 actually having some perks. It looks like I am going to take the offer, so I will be sure to make the most of my experience there, ugly buildings and all!
Okay thanks, makes sense.
Agreed. I had a much better time doing back to back classes with long breaks in-between than spread out classes with 1-2 hour breaks. 
thanks for the input!
Ahh ok...im waitlist spot 3, do you know what the odds are getting in for a specific lab?
I love watching the little robots get delivered onto campus. 
That's a good one, do you have others to recommend?
so i can get the bed/closet that I want haha. I know it sounds dumb
i've graded an exam with bloodstains on random pages before. guess the student prioritized their exam over their wounds...
I would also add that Chase's web experience is way above BofA in terms of functionality. BofA is pretty sloppy and their cards are laughable compared to Chase's. 
did you get the nixel alert of someone getting molested in the mens showers at RSF? apparently no where is safe now lol
astrophysics, physics, data science, science in general
Thank you. Follow up question: does the GPA deflation at Berkeley offset the effects of published research and access to big name profs?
Brevity is wit. Thanks.
Don’t even plan it until you’ve tried 3 techs first. Most people can’t do it.
It's my second semester...
also most of stem is not very cutthroat either--you're more likely to find people to work on (cry over?) coursework with than not, and it's truly wonderful bonding.
*drink with
So true. There is basically a world of difference between them and we can’t say which one would be better for someone. 

Although FWIW Caltech is in Pasadena which is.... ew. So much smog
Thanks for your reply!

That definitely sounds tough. Are there such strict requirements if say I did a CS minor instead?

Thank you very much. I'm very excited to work in a university lab.
I apologize for the late reply, but I thank you for your help. My only choices are ASU Barrett, U of A Honors College, Cal Poly SLO, and Cal.
True in general but is Berkeley very expensive compared to Westwood specifically? B/c that's where OP would be living unless they are planning on commuting.
I'm guessing it's also inconvenient because I've heard Berkeley has less supportive housing than other colleges (meaning fewer years of guaranteeed housing). Is this true? Is it hard to find good housing  after the 1st year? 

Also, how much does the high cost of rent and food affect you? For context, my current cost of living is pretty low compared to the rest of the country.
Oh thank you! I just now realized where to find that lol. 
oh rip
do you happen to have a source on that? It's just that I haven't heard that from anyone else.
[deleted]
ooo aesthetic interesting
haha thank you! i think imma go for unit 1 or clark kerr maybe
How are the other majors in biology like? Are they all the same academic rigor or are some easier than others?
Is it easy for freshmen to dive into research at labs or volunteer at hospitals? Also, how’s the food like?
How does the high cost of living impact your life on campus/outside of campus? Is it difficult to get and juggle a job to help pay for things?
Alright, thanks for the advice. I'll definitely take it into consideration.
So I should phase 1 it for sure? (i'll be a junior next year)
[deleted]
For upper divs: ee122, cs 168, cs186, cs162, cs170
It's not ""curved"" but the initial grading buckets are unrealistic and so they adjust them and it essentially becomes a curve.

Generally speaking they appear to shoot for 30% As and 50% Bs.
[deleted]
Ok thank you

[deleted]
thanks!
Awesome!
thanks!
I reread my post HAHA and I see what you mean. I think there's a lot of things that lead me towards UCLA, but they are non academic factors. I have always put education first and dreamed about going to a prestigious chemistry school since I was in elementary school so I think going to the #2 best chem e program in the world holds a lot of weight in my decision where as all these positive things for UCLA are smaller impacts that are not in regards to the education itself, yet they add up. I just can't decide which is more important to me, my college experience (socially and mentally) or my academic opportunity to learn from the best of the best. 
[deleted]
> Penn isn't prestigious 

Lmao
I appreciate your input! I have ultimately decided to attend Berkeley! Go Bears! :)
How are you so sure?
Thank you for your response! I'm not sure what kind of financial aid I got. All it says is ""UC Berkeley Transfer Scholarship."" It's a $12k scholarship. I also got federal work study for about $3k. 

As much as I would love to live on campus, it's better that I don't take on a bunch of loans. Also I'm used to living at home since I go to community college. 

And thank you for your last comment btw :\) It's good to know  
I'm just a bit scared because I saw so many prereqs I would have to start off with Data 8 I think? It was a lot and I'm just wondering how on earth would I be able to complete stuff on time if there so many prereqs
How can I contact an L&S advisor? 
Thanks man! That was super detailed and informative, definitely appreciate this comment! :)
I'm super interested in consulting as well.
Not 60 units at UC Berkeley, just 60 units period. That may include units(credits) from IB, AP's and so forth
thank you! do you suggest i go this week or is it too late to do it at the beginning of the semester?
Thanks for the response.
Thanks <3
Thanks for the prompt reply!! That makes me feel a shit ton better lol. And welcome fellow transfer student :)) Congratulations!!
I think I need to take EE16A, so I would guess if I were to do that with CS61A it might be best to do R&C B and an AC, or physics with no R&C or AC.  Also my school didn't offer Physics C so I'd be taking 7A.  I'm probably leaning towards taking the easy breadth classes since you can't really get an easier option for physics, and by second term I'll know what I can handle in terms of Berkeley level classes.
I'm a HS senior, does that change anything?
Thank you!
Yeah I'm pretty much only studying for chem and bio so that I can skip some of the requirements. Thanks for the reply! I was only stressing cause I got fucked over on the mathe exam
They replied to an email I sent saying that it's normal and should show up later in the process.  Hopefully that's true but it seemed to me like everyone else had access to it already which was what worried me.
But why is it a task on my calcentral? And the description says Please submit all official scores of 3 or higher. What if I don't get a 3 or higher? How will that task complete?
I am ok with doing a 10-15 min. walk to get to some classes, and as long as I'm able to get up somewhere between 7-8 in the morning I'll be fine. I like to have some size in my room but will be perfectly fine in a double or triple despite maybe spending some time in it. I would like to have more social experience due to being a recluse in high school but i do value some moments of peace and quiet despite wanting the environment to be active. I'm ok with functional but a little bit of upkeep would be nice. I want to go work out more often so that I can stay in physical shape, but the distance to such facilities wouldn't really matter it just means more exercise for me. I would like a nice or at least somewhat decent community feel to my floor/building so that I can build more connections and such. All around, I say I fit somewhere in the medium spectrum in terms of things where I want the best of both but lean more towards being involved more with my environment. I'm relatively adaptable, which is among one of my strongest traits. In terms of roommates, I would like to have one with some self-integrity in how they maintain themselves. Also, perfectly fine with all gender floors despite it being awkward at first.
Well there slightly different requirements, but mostly in the non-CS techs (math & physics). It's close to the same number of units total, and there's a lot of flexibility in which classes you can take.
Awesome, thanks! I've taken all the CS classes available at my current school and it hasn't been too bad \(obviously not comparable, but still\). Math definitely takes a lot of work for me, though. What are your thoughts on taking 61A/61B vs 61B/70 in the same quarter? 
Thank you for the response! I was looking through the site and it looks like it's pretty much what you said: EE16A and Math 54 are pretty much interchangeable? So I'll probably just go with EE16A instead then. 

I asked this same question earlier too, but what do you think about taking 61A/61B together \(first semester\) vs 61B/70 together \(second semester\)? And taking in account the fact that I probably have to take EE16A first semester and EE16B second semester too, I suppose... 

Thanks again! 
Hey! Great to see another CS-intended transfer here! Did you happen to take calc 3? 
Do you know if Bowles has any fraternity members?
That sounds like a really good schedule change. CS61A, Math 1B, Astro, and a R1B in a language department would be a solid first semester, and for spring 61B, Math 53, EE16A and a breadth would be a step up but achievable if you manage to establish a work ethic the first semester. I'm heading into junior year and am just starting to get my shit together course-wise, so don't be worried if you struggle a bit first semester. PM me if you want any other advice!
Uh does it change much if i say i was a transfer from a CCC 
Thank you for the help!
Thanks! I managed to get a 5 on the ap lit exam so I don't need to fulfill the composition requirements. but I'll look at other breadth possibilites.
Sup

Oh okay, as long as it's drinkable!
So basically I take those classes before attempting to double?
Do I still use Undergraduate Admissions Update form or will direct email be the best form of notifying them of what happened?
Apparently if you aren't traveling at peak times, Uber/Lyft is cheaper for a single person. Haven't tested it myself but passing along a tip from a friend!

(Also, BART should cost $8.65 one way: $6 for airbart + $2.85 for the regular bart from Colisseum to Downtown Berkeley station.)
[deleted]
Can you get a tv into a unit 3 triple? 
Ah okay, I'll have to take a deeper look into the schedule planner then.
So I'm planning on taking Math1A, Chem 1A/AL and a R&C course - that comes up to 12 units. I'm doing an IB course which is one unit and a seminar, again one unit. So as of now I'm at 14units.
The MCB study plan - 
http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/molecular-cell-biology-neurobiology/#sampleplanofstudytext

advises to just take Math10A and Chem1A/AL so feel free to fill up the rest of the units with breadth requirements or seminars.
I'm taking Math 1A for CS (also counts for MCB I'm pretty sure) and Chem 1A for MCB
Ok thank you. So did you take Asian American Studies R2B second semester? Or are you choosing to wait to a later semester? I think I’ll take an AC course first semester and figure out English later.
[deleted]
So is it fine for me to register for only 12 units and then save my last unit for a decal? I don’t want to get in trouble for not registering for the minimum of 13 before term starts 
How long did it take to become your new profile picture? I just submitted mine 
Oh, I was unaware it was an upper division course. I only need to fulfill RnC B, and a lot of the interesting classes have 'part A' requirements. Is there any designation on which are upper and lower division courses in the course catalog?

I don't see it but that makes sense. Thank you!
Is there a way to determine it from calcentral? I just see the amount and that's it, nothing in the description except a repeat of the title.
Damn how do you spend only $6 a day? Do you eat out or make your own food?
Why do they need to be upper division classes? Can classes like English 45c (literature from 1850s onward) work?
Ok so it’s better to have back to back even though buildings may be on opposite sides of campus, giving you only 10 mins to walk? Also, isn’t it helpful to have breaks to review material before going to your next class? Right now, half of my classes are back to back and the other half have 2 hour breaks in between.  
How about in terms of difficulty?
I plan on taking 3 other hard engineering prereqs.
I'm pretty sure BART service ends at midnight every day. And the earliest it starts is 4 am, so OP would have to wait 3 hours.
Well Japan 7a is a 45 person class, and I'm ninth on the waitlist. Only 35 people are enrolled but there are 10 reserved seats. It's a similar situation for anthro, except the class is much larger and there are only 18 free seats. However, I moved up to 67 in that waitlist, so hopefully I continue moving up.
uh ok uhh....

the other option is to take an 8AM lab and take math 54 instead of math 53... 

is it advisable to take 54 before 53 orrr
I'm in the exact same situation as you bro, if it doesn't work out I'll just switch to a less convenient lecture time, unless they're all waitlisted
got it, thank you!
heard its a little hard and i wanna make things as easy as possible for myself so i can focus on cs 61a
Well my primary objection with it is that I'm waiving the university's legal liability in all scenarios including negligence on their behalf in the event that something worthy of legal action occurs. It just read as very...suspect. I'm probably being paranoid tbh.

As for GBO itself, I don't like that it's mandatory, week-long, and still costs $475. I could have spent more time working to save up since I financially support myself, but since I'm under 24 my fafsa doesn't really account for that. But I'd still go if the waiver didn't seem so darn sketch.
purpose of the lab is to do actual hands-on coding practice with an instructor around to help you through, and to act as the smaller-group interface to ask questions/clarify concepts/discuss that isn't as possible in the massive lecture! you also do projects with a person from your lab
[deleted]
Thanks for the advice!
[deleted]
What if you're getting this warning message but financial aide is supposed to cover tuition? Should I be worried it won't disburse in time?
Got it! Thank you!

And for discussuon quizzes for lower div classes, are they usually told when they are given ahead of time and what to study for? Or is the material random usually? 


I'm EECS and I heard 54 lays a really good foundation for EE16A so I will probably do 54 if I can't get into 53
just those three
I am taking it for the bio L&S breadth, but I've been meaning to take a nutrition class so I can stop eating like shit and actually make knowledgeable food decisions. Does NST10 cover that sort of stuff?
[deleted]
I’ve seen a few of Barestage’s productions- they’re magical. I’m glad to hear you’ve enjoyed working with them! 
Barestage sounds amazing, I’ll definitely check them out!
Okay, thank you!
Also you can often get into upper div math classes as a CS major.
[deleted]
Thank you! To clarify, if you do a double major, the total number of required credits is still 120 minimum? Combining both the majors? I thought that individually, majors need 120 credits so if you do two, I thought it would be more because it would be 2 x 120, minus whatever overlap there is, making it maybe 160 or so. Is it still max 136 in that case?
Thanks for the detailed answer!
Which locks?
how do you contact your ""admissions officer""
Thank you!
Yea networking is one of the main reasons I was drawn to Berkeley. My friend who is currently in the ChemE department there said it's extremely competitive to get into a lab though. Do you think I could realistically get into a lab during the two years I'm there as long as I put myself out there? I can just imagine graduating from Berkeley with zero research experience is less appealing to graduate schools than UCI with some research. 
Okay! Are good grades that difficult to get in UCB? I heard the average GPA for my major is about 3.12 or something like that. I guess I'm sort of confused why anyone would go to UCB if they plan to go to grad school unless they are absolutely astounding students. 
Are you in the ChemE department?  Our classes overwhelmingly have a B to B- average.
[deleted]
awesome, just what I want to hear! by rearranging do you mean finding a different housing situation or changing up furniture placement in the room itself?
I did get a double in Unit 3, yeah.
RH Std Triple :(
Not OP but also an incoming MechE freshman; would you recommend taking Chem 1A/L over a physics class (7 series) first semester?
Thank you for your advice! It really makes me feel a lot better. 
My concern now is just that if I’m sure that I’ll transfer to MCB, do I pick the course according to MCB requirement or do I have to follow COC requirement first? 

[deleted]
Usually graded P/NP, multiple in one semester should be pretty fine. Not too difficult to get seminars since not as many people, in favor of getting some prereq out of the way, enroll in them.
you have a really early sign up time, so you should be fine--seminars tend to fill up closer to 12pm. seminars are great and I strongly recommend them! idk that many people who took more than one--I wanted to, but didn't have enough time in my phase 1 last semester. also, first semester freshman year is when you'll have the opportunity to take the most interesting seminars, so I strongly recommend you take advantage of that.
about a week ago
Trust me, everyone I know who took it hated it lol.
Thanks! Which instructor did you take?
What did they make you do at the swim classes? Where were they haha/was the water warm?
Okay honestly that does lol. I’m over here worrying like shit did I do something wrong or if Cal had a change of heart or something aha.
not op, but am an incoming freshman and am just wondering about what makes a good/easy R&C class and how i can tell in the course schedule 
do you think it's a requirement or a suggestion to get to the 13 unit minimum? (I have like 14 units planned without it)

edit: and I'm pretty sure they made a mistake, ChemE 40 is supposed to be in the fall making it 14 or 15 units and the spring 16 units...
I don't think CHM ENG 24 is a seminar next semester :\( it's not listen on the berkeley freshman seminar site list
How do you download the pdf from that website? Sorry for asking but I’m a bit confused 
Thank you!!
[deleted]
Alright thank you for the input. If I end up not being able to skip 1B should I still skip 1A?
Oh thank you! And will I be missing much w/o taking R5A?
Thank you for that. Yeah, it was annoying. 
I ended up choosing Berkeley, and I’m filling out housing stuff right now :) Just looking for good places for transfers.
Thanks for your help! But don't I have to take Math 53 before I take Math 54? I was planning to do 54 second semester of my freshman year.


> there's no real statistics

you can say that about the DS major too ;) 
Okay, I see where they got that now. I should have mentioned I’m a transfer with 70 units. The minimum will suffice. 
What is the advantage of taking more units? You said because of the expense of living, what do you mean by that? Just hypothetically, if I take 3x4 and a deCal class or two PE classes I’ll hit the minimum and graduate on time. Is there a disadvantage in doing this over taking 4x4? It looks like I won’t need the extra units. 
I’m a transfer 70 units. 50/4 is 12.5
I guess it might actually be kinda good, cause isn't discussion when you meet as a small group to clarify and discuss the content? 
Distance was a problem for me one semester, going to Hildebrand actually!

I had a PE class at the RSF, and chem discussion right after. So I had 10 minutes to run to the locker room, change back to day clothes, then run up the hill to Hildebrande. Not quite doable in 10 minutes.

Fortunately, when I talked to my TA about the problem at the start of term he agreed not mark me off for being a few minutes late. That said, I would not recommend scheduling a PE class and a regular class back-to-back.
I'm thinking of engineering science, and what GPA do i need to get to apply for grad school?
aka. ""first class honours degree in UK""
Thanks for the advice. If I'm stuck in between both, should I just take classes in a little bit of both fields in my freshman year? And decide idk, second semester freshman year/first semester sophomore year? It's just that I'm not 100&#37; sure on medical school ... And CS is kinda my #2 interest.

And yeah, that does seem like a bad idea now that you bring that up, whoops.
Thanks! 
I never had a problem taking BART late at night. (I wasn't doing this regularly, but probably arrived at my final stop after midnight at least a dozen times.)
thank you!!
Math is a premed req tho, I thought? Then what math classes should I take? 
+1. Breadth classes are usually kinda fun and provide some relaxation from technicals, too
[deleted]
summer break?
Difficulty generally depends more on the instructor (usually a grad student with no reviews online, so you can't really tell ahead of time). I definitely knew people who had relatively light R&C classes in the ColWrit department (and relatively heavy ones there too). Just try to pick a specific section with a topic you find interesting.
I agree, this does seem possible.
And do we lease the tv from Berkeley (kinda like with microwaves and minifridges)?
Awesome, thanks! My only college experience is from local cc's-- it's a whole new world, here.

Appreciate everyone on here!
I agree, Data 8 is the better/ more useful class, but is more serious than CS10
For the second half of the R&C requirement
It now says my CalGrant is estimated and 'will not disburse' but the other scholarships are 'not disbursed'. Did you see anything like this?
[deleted]
I'm in College of Engineering.
No, thank you though. I'm an older student, and my wife and I just found a house. I was putting together a preliminary budget and factored in my gift aid (less tuition/fees and insurance), for rent. I was checking to see if I might be forgetting something, but your comment cleared it up for me, thank you. 
Got it, I'll be ready. Also, I can do all of 47B over the summer so it basically won't be a course in the fall. Thanks for the advice!
this person is EECS, doesnt need to declare major
Any suggestions for H/SS courses? Honestly, I’m interested in everything, but of course I would prefer an “easier” class.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Thank you for the clarification!
I'm actually doing mcb on a pre-med track. I've taken a calculus course at SDSU so I only need to do a stats course for math... Data 8 is just something I'm interested in; I'm kinda considering doing a minor in Data Science if they eventually offer it.
I heard that math53 is necessary for a prereq of cs189, and i am CS by the way but I don't think that matters
What do you think about Math 1A, CS C8 (is this Data 8?), Theater R1A, and a P/NP breadth? I’m trying to major in Cog Sci too but I don’t think I can take Cog Sci 1 or the other major requirements because of full enrollment. 
Okay, I think I'll go with the second schedule. Thanks for the advice, I haven't really thought about that a lot.
I probably will end up saving r&c for later because I checked and most of them were already full :/ Thank you for your input!
I do have a lot of programming expierence. I currently intern for HP and have taken many comp sci classes in high school. I also am taking a Math DeCal class for CS70 so 
Fuck man that's not how it works here. I went to high school in 2 different countries. The school I graduated from sent over my transfer transcript from my old school, and I thought that was enough, but the task is still incomplete on Calcentral (even though it was completed for my current school). So I'm trying to get my old school to send my transcript but it's a pain in the ass cuz everyone's on summer break. Do you know how much of an extension they're willing to give me?
Thanks!
Hmm, so if I were to change my breadth to Nav Sci 3 that would work better right? That would still be a breadth, and It would actually work better with my schedule as well.
[deleted]
I went ahead and took it. Thanks for the info!
Thank you!
Ah thanks for the reply! Would you know if there is a deadline for sending if there is no task? I've been worried in case this might jeopardize my admission.
Found it. Thanks! Will you be stopped from registering for a class if you don’t have some prerequisites? I’m thinking of taking ECON 100A but I haven’t done any calculus.
I was hoping for specific advice on the professors teaching these courses especially since there was only so little information I could find about professor Carson. But for Stat 134, are there any specific resources you recommend referring to? I find the lectures hard to follow and the book a bit abstract for me to comprehend. But I'm grateful for any advice/things to look out for about the two courses in general!
Do you mean on cal central? And did you get any email notification?
Thanks guys, guess I'll take it! Also @jaroune imma need that document
Thank you!
[deleted]
Ahh that makes me feel so much better! Thank you so much. I will definitely check out all the resources and the SLC. :)
Is it fine if I enroll in E7 and try it out and drop it if I don't like it? I heard that spring is reserved for mostly civil and chem engr. students.
Also I don't have any real coding experience, just scratch.
 And how about the other classes I plan on doing?
Thank you! If a class has, say 50 unreserved seats, does that mean I'll definitely be able to sign up for it?
Planning on math, and human variation for that AC
Do you believe I’m better off in the long term taking Math 53 and/or 54 instead of taking Math 16B or Math 1B?  Why?  Sounds interesting but seems risky if my overall objective is to gain Haas admission. Math courses at UCB tend to be hard or at least that’s what many say. What good will learning new math do me if I end up with a B in either Math 53 or Math 54?
Solid response. But, in this scenario, I’m probably better off taking Math 53 after applying to Haas to guard against a possible GPA deflator hurting my admission chances. 
Thanks!  Also by detrimental, I was asking whether or not I'd have trouble with fulfilling breadth requirements by graduation. Judging by your response, I probably shouldn't have any trouble.
I see, thanks! 
Is that math adjunct class specific to Math 1A?
OK sounds gucci! Do you think that just going into 53 or 54 would be too overwhelming? I'm not a math person at all + it's been a while since I've taken a ""real"" maths class (took ap stats senior year n it was a joke lol) and I don't want to fuck up my GPA for if I decide to apply to Haas
[deleted]
Alright. I mean, I think I'm developing good study habits now during summer bridge, but of course, the fall is a whole different animal. Also, imo, my classes are on the easier side (may be underestimating Vietnamese 1a and Math 16a but we'll see). I heard the curve for UGBA 10 was removed a couple years back. Doesn't that mean the class would be less competitive now?
[deleted]
Whoops you're right lol, for someone reason I though Spring 2018 meant Spring for next year... my bad. Still, would you recommend doing Math 1b with 61a or 61b?
Got it, thanks. Do you remember when you found out which room you got btw?
Tysm!
Thank you!!
Alright thank you. What exactly do you mean by “weird” though?
Well I haven’t passed the reading and writing requirements 😅 so would it still be a bad idea? 
Thanks for the advice! I ended up dropping the larger class because of a schedule conflict with the backup class I was planning on taking, and I wanted to ensure I had 12 credits next semester. Thanks though!
Thanks for the info! I read that (which led me to think I still do need it) but I found schedules of past double major students and none of them took Physics 89. They took Math 54 instead. That's why I'm confused.

[http://kartp.astro.berkeley.edu/doku.php?id=curriculum:samples](http://kartp.astro.berkeley.edu/doku.php?id=curriculum:samples)
Thanks! Hopefully I'll be able to keep up, especially because I actually really like history and I really want to learn. Hopefully I'll develop skimming skills, because I can't fathom reading and retaining 200 pages of information every week. I'm definitely going to try it out though and see if I'm able to keep up in the first couple weeks of class before dropping one. Thank you so much, although I will concede that it sounds difficult, in a way its reassuring because I know what I'm getting into.


That sounds rough. DO you know if it applies to all history classes? The one i'm taking has a relatively high grade average, so I'm not sure if that means its easier. I'll probably end up dropping one of them and taking a few decals to get back up to the credit minimum then. Thanks!
Dang, I expected a lot of reading, but not more than like 100 pages per class. Thanks for the response!
will doing the hw sets from the probability be enough to catch up?
Damn idk how I missed that, thanks
It's a Slavic language class and there are no other sections of the class offered. I'll probably email the professor to see if it will be an issue. This class has run every year before this so I'd be surprised if it didn't but it seems like there's always been at least 7-8 people in the class before so not sure about now. Thank you for answering!
Thank youuuu

Well hecc, that is very encouraging. Thanks. 
What is consider reaching for Stanford 
Like everything I plan to do x2
Exactly. Honestly Yale is much more SJW compared to Berkeley, but Berkeley always seems to be the center of attention.
Thanks! That sounds like what I thought would happen.

not sure exactly, i’m not too involved in greek life! there’s a lot of asian interest clubs (KASA, VSA, TASA, etc...) and some clubs in general tend to have mostly asian populations though—you can always check them out!
How would you quantify ""good"" undergraduate education? What would be your methodology?
Your username certainly lends itself to a certain preference ;) 
yeah!! I didn't take any math last semester. as long as you're staying on track, you'll be fine. also, I say that because I'm not sure if it'll be too late. however, I do know people who managed to get roommates in after the housing deadline (since the housing deadline is right around May 1), so you could possibly be fine?

Is it really? I must have my dates wrong. I knew one of the Phases was inconveniently during the summer. Thanks for the clear up!

Edit: spelling
It's also sponsored by the Cal Transfer Center, which is Berkeley's official resource center for transfer students, but it is still much more low-key than Bruin Day. Still worth attending imo!
[Here](https://apply.berkeley.edu/portal/TR_receptions) 

There are events at Berkeley and in SoCal! Don't believe it'll be anywhere near the scale of Cal Day, but it is something
1. There's a bit of both, depending upon what you want to do, who you hang out with. It's certainly not at the level of a frat, but we do some big stuff.
2. As I said, I didn't make friends my freshman year. Bowles also wasn't open when I was a freshman. That said, I have seen people make friends with people from outside, and I do know people from clubs/classes. But you can get enough friends at Bowles.
See my above reply regarding research. As for housing, I know a bunch of people who aren't regents but still got on-campus housing. It's honestly not as bad as it sounds lol
I'll be honest, it's going to be more challenging than say Caltech. Many professors won't even reply to you. But if you prove you are ready to handle research - for example, maybe you've started working on a problem and come across a Berkeley paper and email that professor discussing their research, make a few connections, you will be able to find it.
blackwell is still in the process of being built, so it will be very new next year! and it's a p. good location because it's about two minutes from sproul plaza and right across from the gym.
CS 8 should be enough, it's a pretty cool course and gives a good introduction to programming. 

CS 10 has a bit more fluff, so I would personally just go for CS 8. 

Btw, CS 8 is more commonly known as ""Data 8"" when people talk about it. 
> how is the declaring major process for L&S?

It depends on the major. See [here](https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/degree-requirements/declaring-major).

> all the majors under the college are BAs?

Yes.
For Econ specifically, you just have to get a 3.0 in all the major prerequisites
eeeeeep!!!!!!  yay welcome to the family!!!!!!!!!
clark kerr is hella nice but hella far
do you mean clark kerr?
I can't answer all of your questions because I'm a transfer who commutes but:

-Parking is expensive. You can definitely get away with walking/biking/public transit. Many people don't need a bike.  If lock your bike on campus, you need two locks and nothing quick release, it will get stolen.


-Berkeley is an urban area with requisite urban crime statistics.  There are services to walk you home at night (Bear Walk) or you can walk in groups. There is plenty of theft, like there is in all urban areas, but don't walk around holding out expensive electronic items and not paying attention and you are unlikely to be targeted.


Adjusting to college life is difficult.  It varies in how difficult it is for each person, I certainly had a rough time when I first went to college waaaaay back in 2005.  If you have been sheltered by your parents you will have a harder time.  Make connections with other incoming students to start forming your support system ASAP.  Sleep more than you study, study more than you party, party as much as you can.  There are a variety of academic and psychological support services if you find yourself really struggling (as many do).


Can't really answer your last question because I came in as a junior... if you really try to build a strong foundation in your lower division courses you should be fine.  Don't try to just get through the classes, all your physics and chemistry and math you take are preparing you for upper div so take them seriously and you will have a better time later on.

things I like: 

+ student passion! you're surrounded by incredibly smart, incredibly passionate people. also everyone is rlly nice and a lot more mature than they were in high school

+ the variety of clubs (although tbh you only have so much time in your day and you can't join too many and it's sad)

+ research on campus is insane!

+ walking around campus and listening to acappella groups and looking up at the campanile and thinking, ""wow, I go here""

things I dislike:

+ finding off-campus housing (after freshman year) is a p. stressful process

+ it's very easy to let your commitments pile up on each other and d i e from the amount of work you have

+ dining hall food (you'll love it for the first week. then you'll avoid it.)

+ uh honestly not much else I love this school
I think of course ideally so many changes wouldn't happen but if it doesn't affect your IGETC pattern or doesn't count as prerequisite classes (you mentioned that they are electives that had no relation to your major) I can't see it being a big deal honestly. I am almost 100% sure it's not a big deal but of course you should try and reach out to talk to a counselor or something (or email the Berkeley admissions office) and ask them! Let me know if you need more help!

I mean its not like Berkeley is a recluse for un-motivated mediocre denizens who partied way too much in high school and aren't serious about academics and such - most people here especially in your majors are very smart and hardworking and were in the top of their high school. If you want an intellectual and academically driven community, you can find that here, even if our acceptance rate is twice Caltech's or our SAT averages are 100 lower. You can get every opportunity here not only in CS/Math but outside too. Don't choose Berkeley because ""it's more fun"", but because it has top notch programs and opportunities, while also having diverse classes, majors, people, opportunities etc. 

The kind of person who would pick and enjoy Caltech wouldn't have doubts or think twice about this decision. It's a monastery for science nerds  - and they wholeheartedly own and are proud of that description. 
Prestige difference in name? No.

Prestige difference in number of leading researchers in subfields? Definitely.

Just take a look at number of accepted publications at top conferences by university.
Do outside projects, take classes for no credit just to learn the material, start working on research problems and email Berkeley professors for help, demonstrate that you actually took effort to learn more about their research etc.
It would mean that your classes would be much more crowded and harder to enroll in due to high demand. Also it is much easier to maintain a high gpa at Caltech given the pass fail policies and the take home exams, as well as the fact that many professors there have no problems having the average grade in a class be 3.7+.  
Yeah definitely - many either graduate early or double major/minor in something else
with an EECS degree i'd say yes. general advice is to not pay more in loans than what you would make in your first year out of college, and EECS average salary coming out of college is pretty high
For which major? As other commenter said for most STEM majors, yes very easily. You can save 40k in around 10 months with a CS or EECS degree. This means you'll be debt-free in less than a year. I'd say it's a very good deal.
The CS job market is good enough that that’s fine. You can make 20k from your summers alone.
USC is also in a bad area with high crime rates.

USC has a locked down campus at night, tons of security guards throughout campus and the surrounding area, tons of security cameras, free shuttles/buses around campus and throughout LA, and free CampusCruiser/LyftLine to combat being in a shitty area.

Berkeley has some of that stuff but at a much smaller scale and time window... most of those safety measures will never happen at Berkeley for political/budgetary reasons. Also, you do have to keep in mind that USC was forced to do all of that stuff because they're in a very bad area and despite all those security measures if you look on [crimemapping.com](https://crimemapping.com) there are STILL tons of robberies right next to campus.

**TL;DR**

 In terms of attractive people and party life? Of course USC hands down.

For safety on campus and immediate surrounding areas? Berkeley is overall safer even with USC's more proactive approach to safety. Although I do admit USC has better options should you choose to commute \(Culver City, Marina Del Rey, DTLA\).
I've lived in Berkeley since 2013. One of my hobbies is walking around alone, I am a girl - it's really not dangerous.

The worst you'll see is homeless people screaming [at each other or at nothing] or hear about a break in or mugging MAYBE. It really isn't commonplace.
Berkeley is a bad area with high crime compared to suburbs but is really just an average urban area. The worse that would happen to you is a mugging, and even that is still pretty unlikely.
do your best to be smart\- get pepper spray, don't walk around at night texting and listening to music, don't aggravate people who look on edge ect. shit can happen anywhere and for the most part its completely out of your control but you can do your best to minimize your involvement. Going to Cal you will most likely know someone who knows someone who was mugged. Personally, I feel totally fine living here. Don't choose your education based on the city's crime rates, choose it based off of how happy you will be and the education you will receive! 
Thank you!!! They published the freshman waitlist stats I was just wondering if anyone happened upon the transfer stats. 

And I also feel really proud/lucky considering I have only a 3.6 gpa which for C.S. at Berkeley is absolutely terrible.  

I’m keeping all my fingers crossed and have recruited friends part time to also cross their fingers for me. 
Hey, orionisaorion, just a quick heads-up:

BerkeleyTime link: https://www.berkeleytime.com/

Phases are just specific times when you can enroll. There are multiple enrollment times so everyone can have first pick at a few of their most needed classes during Phase I, and then choose other not-as-important or noncompetitive classes.
GBA is a ""class"" you take around June or so online. It's pretty easy and walks you through choosing your classes. They'll send out emails and all that a few weeks before hand so you'll know when it starts.
GBO, or Golden Bear Orientation, is a week-long orientation program for incoming freshman students that goes over the enrollment process and other important things to get you acclimated to campus. The program is in August.

Edit: I did not know there was a GBA and was assuming you meant GBO. To tell you the truth, idk much about orientation since it changed last year. Sorry!
reshall is basically the UC Berkeley staff that handles housing/residential halls
res(idence )hall
A technical course, i.e a major CS course, or science, or math, or any kind of engineering.

As opposed to a random class you take for AC req, or breadths.
I don't know if it is, sorry :(. I can just say that taking four technical classes will be a lot of work. 
If you can, you could come to Berkeley over the summer before fall for freshman edge and take 61a or math 53. I did that and got to meet a lot of people before school started, which was really nice. 
Actually now that I think about it, it might not be necessary. I don't think I did anything for this past school year
yeah honestly CS is probably one of the most collaborative fields, while something like pre\-med is infinitely more cutthroat
Yes
[deleted]
depends on you and your roommates and your Unit number/room but I divided mines by one closet each, 3 drawers each
There might be an exception for first term freshmen? I don't know the details, but I do know you're welcome to apply in your first semester. Just make sure to start early on the app because it's due very early in the semester.
[deleted]
I think in general, people take around 4 classes a semester (some ambitious people take 5). It’s up to you how you want to balance the number of technical vs non technical classes you want to take. 

Also, each class isn’t only 2 days a week with 1.5 hours! It varies from class to class and department to department, but many classes have lectures, discussions, and lab sessions (that’s what he/she meant by lab). So for example, a typical computer science class might have three hours of lecture total, one one-hour discussion, and then a 2-3 hours long lab in the span of one week. It might not sound like much, but trust me it adds up, especially when you take into account homework/projects/exams!
Yeah it's definitely a fairly rigorous program, and a good fraction of the ChemEs do switch out of the major for one reason or another. That being said, the culture has been very supportive from my experience.

Getting into classes hasn't really been an issue for me. I know some classmates who were forced to take classes in different semesters than the suggested sequence, and you won't always get the exact electives and lab times you want, but this won't delay your graduation and it's really not something to worry about for ChemEs. Also, the CoC advisors do a really good job of helping you plan out your schedule.
IB exam credits are also accepted at most universities (check website for details) and as with APs, you probably won't be rescinded for bad scores.
lol go to berkeley over slo
CS classes are huge but a lot of them are webcasted and you have tons of GSIs and TAs to help with labs/discussions. AT SLO it’s  difficult to graduate in under 4 years (or even 4 years) but I know a bunch of CS majors at Berkeley that graduated early or finished their major classes early. If you want CS definitely come to Cal
You might not have that many personal interactions with professors, but there's a lot of dedicated GSIs and TAs as mentioned below. The major differences in learning I see between high school and college (not only Berkeley) are: lectures are longer / most things require a greater attention span, resources are more spread out (lecture, discussion, and lab are not in the same room), and the length of classes are shorter (so if you want to know your peers, you have to be more social).
Im in the same exact position as you bro. Torn between Berkeley CS and Cal Poly CS.... Super paranoid and stressed out about declaring. 
Cal’s soccer team is pretty damn competitive and highly ranked. They start recruiting people for years in the future. Honestly don’t think it’s possible to walk on or try out if you haven’t been recruited for the NCAA team, especially because I don’t think the NCAA teams are associated in any way with club teams (different staff, coaches) but you can always reach out to the coaches about it. 

The club teams still travel and compete a lot.
As has been suggested, the club teams are completely separate from the NCAA team.  Are you an international student?  Since our soccer team doesn't recruit from abroad, you were automatically overlooked despite your talent.  Because of this, you might be able to find a way to get a tryout.  If you've competed throughout Brazil then you must be quite good haha 
 definitely contact someone.  either find a way to contact a coach or you can talk to the [advisor for cal soccer players](https://asc.berkeley.edu/about/staff/derek-van-rheenen/) 
It's hypothetically possible but you'd need to talk to the coach
Where are you from internationally? In many parts of the world (especially Asia), Berkeley has a much better reputation than UCLA, if you're leaving open the option of going back home to work.
Education-wise, it should be about the same. It just depends on what environment you like better. Since you want to have cool nerdy discussions, Berkeley's probably better, since everyone here has seen Rick and Morty.
berkeley has the 2nd most turing award winners
Ooh I just pulled up the Fall 2017 website when Hilfinger taught it, and it does seem like the allow alternates (and doesn't say that that's only for midterms), so hopefully it'll be ok! I'll try to figure it out

Also, if you're still about thinking Math 55 too, I'm in it right now with Williams, and it's not too heavy of a workload or too difficult. I think it's also usually recommend before doing 110 unless you have experience with proofs. Idk if it's really that useful, but then again, I don't know what the proofs we'll have to do in 110 will be like 
the 16 series as long as you don't want to do really mathy econ (in which case you'd need the 1 series + more math). it's what most pre-haas and econ kids do.
whoopsie. My mistake. 
Hi!! The substance free building is wonderful (I live there rn)--feel free to PM me if you have any questions! There are definitely people here who go to parties and there's definitely a very social environment around.
[deleted]
You don't need to tell me what it takes to get into medical school. If you are driven by fear, you might as well give up now and do something else. I never said you need mastery of quantum mech to be a physician. And I definitely didn't say you need to take that class. Me telling them ""not to worry about gpa"" doesn't mean they get to slack off. It means come here, work hard, and achieve your goals. 

Once again, if you are going to be successful, you will be successful no matter where you go. I dont understand how you can take this and turn it into whatever it is you said up there.
For the cs61 series specifically they try very hard to get everyone in off the waitlist. Maybe this has changed in the last year but previously it wasn't a concern to get into 61a/b/c. CS70 has sometimes had more issues I think but typically everyone gets in.

Also for classes in general I think there are tools that show previous years' waitlist/enrollment over time. In my time there was calbearoracle but I think that's been defunct for a while.
I'm not any of those majors so I can't answer it completely. From what I've heard, 61a and b are pretty easy to get into because it's a part-online course and the lectures are all posted to watch, so there is no waitlist.
So piggy backing off of the other person's comment, Celli @ Berkeley does have auditions and is comprised of a lot of UCB symphony orchestra members, but not all. In fact many cellists quit the orchestra, but continue to play in Celli. Audition acceptance rates will depend on the directors.
Oh hey, another cellist!

I didn't get into the orchestra when I auditioned freshman year, but I wasn't particularly good. For the decal it really depends on who else auditions and what groups they decide to form. Not sure about other groups.

And for cello specifically, definitely check out [Celli @ Berkeley](https://celli.berkeley.edu/)! I don't know if they hold auditions or just take members of the USO, but even if you can't join their concerts are worth checking out! (They used to play outside on campus at noon on Wednesdays I think; can't tell from their website if they still do.)
7a isn't needed to really understand 7b. you need to know basic mechanics, of course, but not much beyond that.

The engineering one? Its from 12pm to 2 pm tomorrow at the Bechtel terrance. Thats what the email said. 
Hey, late to the thread but noticed it's been 5-7 business days, did you have the good news confirmed?
No, because all the undeclared CS students also have to take ee16
I was not the person who did any of the logistics for getting the show on air so I can’t tell you. Sorry!
Well, I don't know how calso was, but GBO is like 11 days straight? So imagine that, in the middle of August, and at least 60% of the time is spent walking to pointless meetings and places. And the dining halls aren't even open, they just make like one meal and force everyone to have it. So, not great. I skipped out on most things that weren't mandatory, and most people did the same.
i think that gbo is a mixed bag--i really liked my group/most of us actually attended the events; it was also a decently nice transition into college life + introduced you to people from other floors in your building (which is v nice because usually most of your friends come from your own floor). my feet hurt a lot though & the food was terrible. but i liked it enough that i almost considered becoming an orientation leader until i didn't.
Can't speak for the physics classes (I took 7A my first semester, spent maybe 5-10 hours a week on it and got a B+. would not recommend.) I also took 110 as a freshman and spent 4 hours/week in class and 2-3 hours/week studying (Zvezda didn't assign homework, I don't know if Sug Woo will.) This might not reflect your experience as I'd already worked through Axler and had a decent grasp on the material already.

ymmv on C10 depending on the time you want to spend on it. If you don't care about nonmajor GPA you can probably just flake and pass for little effort (I've done this for far too many classes...)
I haven't taken any other upper divs yet, but from what I've heard, they vary a lot depending on the professor.
That's right, I forgot about that. As a physics major, the 5 series is more helpful but I don't think any incoming freshman should take 3 physics classes and an upper-div math class.
If you want to really dive into programming, then CS61A would be your best bet. I haven't taken it myself, but many physics major friends have, and almost all of them have done very well. The material in 77 can basically be learned on your own in research/programming for other classes. Again, I haven't taken 77 myself, but that seems to be the general sensation from talking to people in the department.

As for research, if that's the field you want to go into eventually, that's alright. But as I mentioned already, the most important thing is learning to do publishable research, since you will be doing just that as a grad student. Many friends of mine have done research with experimental physics/MechE groups, and have really come to resent the work they did/couldn't get their name on any sort of publication. Of course, your mileage may vary, I'm just saying it's very easy to get lost in a large group and not gain anything out of it other than ""experience"". Re. research units, I wouldn't count on receiving them in my first semester to fill up units, so I would find some breadth to take instead.
Thanks for the input!
It'd require 3/20 people dropping out... my understanding is that getting off chem lab waitlists is pretty rare because they're required for so many people, but it's still very early, and departments sometimes add more class times at random. It's worth staying on, it's just 1 unit, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. That said, taking Chem1AL separate from Chem1A is very common and nothing to worry about really. 
I commute so I actually don't know but I assume UberEats, GrubHub, Eat24Hours all provide delivery in the area.  Most people just walk to get things because there is tons of stuff bordering campus.
All the major food delivery services (Uber Eats, GrubHub, Door Dash, Yelp Eat24, Postmates, etc) do Berkeley. What you choose depends on your preferences.

Personally I've found Uber Eats to be the most reliable. Not a bad idea to keep a couple of your favorites on your phone in case there are promos.
You should definitely make sure it's a conversation between you and your roommate(s), otherwise it can cause a lot of strife between you later on. I found out my roommates intentionally put me in the worst bed since I was last to move in. 
Rip I don't think there are any for those fields
Grade deflation doesn't matter because your competition is exclusively other cal students.

GPA is from what I've seen pretty important in selection though. Usually you won't get any consideration with a GPA below 3.8 (there are exceptions however) and there are certain profs (aka Pieter Abbeel) who are notorious for picking apprentices who have exclusively A+s.
I agree with the other comments. Basically all students on campus would agree that those 4 techs would be extremely difficult to take together.
The problem with the minor is that enrollment is difficult. CS classes fill up quickly and declared majors get a lot of priority. I think that non majors are waitlisted until adjustment period for upper divs.
It's fairly reliable. I don't know how close you are to the BART on your end, but the downtown Berkeley BART station is about two blocks away from the west side of campus.

Just be wary that it's almost entirely an uphill climb to get to anywhere else on campus from there, but you'll never have to go for leg day at the gym again.

The Bart is pretty good on speed/timing, might have to make transfers if you want to be efficient or depending on when you go, and it's fairly cheap if I remember correctly. I'd get a clipper card if you decide to go through with it.

I'd try out the trip on your own when you have a free day to get a feel for it, maybe get some of the good food or check out campus while you're there. 
Adding on to my last comment, you don't have to worry about parking or traffic if you Bart, and if you have morning classes, I've heard crossing the bridge can be a bitch. 
I still think it’s better to find housing close to campus if you can afford it. It makes everything far, far easier. Searching for housing is a bitch but it’s doable.

I’m from Oakland so my situation is relatively analogous to yours. I’ve lived on campus or near campus always, and I think it’s worth it.
no one stays in on-campus housing for more than a year in Berkeley. what we're talking about is living in an apartment near campus, which is what almost all non-freshmen do. If you can afford it, it's much better to live near campus, a lot of clubs and other activities meet at night, and those are much easier to be a part of if you live in Berkeley itself.
Take a look at [this](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/lower-division-requirements-applicable-all-students-admitted-fall) page.  It explains the lower div reqs for your major quite well.  Your 4 on AP Bio means you only have to take 1 of the biological sciences listed.  That course will satisfy the breadth.  Unless otherwise noted, all classes can be used to satisfy a breadth, including all of your lower and upper div psych courses.  
It's slang here to mean ""anything mathy/sciency (hard)"". They mean this to mean physical sciences, math, computer science, etc.  
[deleted]
definitely not
[deleted]
haha maybe, I'm thinking of Unit 1 but i wanna go to the huge gym. would that distance be much of a problem? espcially if i wanna go when its dark
[deleted]
[deleted]
nah, its a pretty lax group
CS188 is pretty easy, and I've heard CS161 is one the easier upper div CS classes as well. 
[deleted]
I would say look into off campus housing, but I think it's pretty late in the game right now. But if you *can* find something, it's likely going to be cheaper than the dorms.
Most people use 2 AP classes to pass out of two of the six H/SS (humanities/social studies) courses that is required for the College of Engineering. Either AP Lang or AP Lit for R&C1 requirement. AP Calc BC would be used to skip Math1A and 1B, but APCS is worth nothing as a CS major. Can also use Chem/Bio to fulfill Natural science requirement
No, most people only take the 2 ee intro classes.
You honestly can't go wrong. They are both prestigious programs.

To me it sounds like you should figure out where you would prefer to live and what kind of campus culture you want for your undergraduate experience. I can provide you with my opinions if you have any specific questions and I suggest reading about campus culture from previously answered posts.
1. That isn't even something I wrote.
2. I have lived in CA my whole life, I am aware I am biased.

UC Berkeley, **in my opinion** - you know, just as I wrote in my fucking comment -  has better name brand recognition than Penn. At no point did I even infer that Penn is a bad school (just because something isn't Ivy btw doesn't make it bad).


edit: I know Penn for this: https://www.thisamericanlife.org/396/1-party-school. 


All the lowerdiv CS courses start small-ish and then expand so that everyone gets in (but you might have to wait until week 3 or so). Not the same for upperdivs.
Is that $12k per semester?  

Also,  for what it's worth total cost of attendance is estimated to be $35k/year living in a dorm versus $24k/year living with parents.
Hey I got that transfer scholarship/aid thing too - but for a whooping 24k. 
Congrats to you too! You can look at the 2015 and 2016 data also, just go [here](https://career.berkeley.edu/Survey/Survey) and click ""what can i do with a major in..."" and then astrophysics. 

They list the grad schools being attended, and they all look great! And it looks like a pretty small program, only about 30 graduates a year so I'm sure the professor interaction is good :) 
[deleted]
It makes it easier because you have more time to finish your major pre-requisites.

I disagree with the other person who commented, I've never heard anyone here express that the units were home to a great social scene or community. If that's something that you're interested, I think Clark Kerr is a great call for you, since it also ticks all the other check boxes perfectly, being more social and active, being close to a gym, being right next to great hiking trails and nature to relax in. 
i recommend any of the units (units 1 and 3 are closer to campus and 5-7 min walk to the big lecture hall) - they are a little cramped but generates the most socializing out of the dorms.
It depends on what you're confident in: programming and more computer related CS theory, or math. 

I took 61b/70 in a semester, and I definitely performed worse in 61B as a result of having to focus more on 70. Thankfully, I had a good enough baseline skill in the subject that I didn't shift a to an A-, but it got uncomfortably close.

For me personally, 61b + 61a would have been easier, neither class was that challenging. But 70 was. 

On the other hand, I have friends who are extremely good at that kind of math (i.e if you did well in HS math competitions), and they found 70 trivial but a/b harder. 

Maybe consider CS61a/b + 16a, because 16b is considerably more cancer and the labs actually take the whole 3(!!) hours, sometimes rolling more.
Nope
There are Bowlespeople who are in Greek life. But being at Bowles you get a lot of the benefits from Greek life anyways.
like you mean if whether or not you will get accepted? i don't know what you're saying like what changes?
I don't think the stats part of data8 is very difficult, most people do fine. If you did alright in AP stats you should be ok! 

I think the people that have the biggest trouble are those who struggle with coding concepts like functions and return values, control statements (if/else, for and while loops), and syntax (esp object.method type stuff). By the second half of the course, you're expected to be familiar with how to use these, and the code gets longer and more complicated. I suggest doing some python tutorials on codeacademy or similar sites to get a feel for how quickly you pick up the concepts. 

Data8 is designed to be challenging but doable for those with no coding experience, so unless you want to take cs10 I would say try out data8! Wagner and Adhikari are really good professors, and the course is well run with good staff :) 
I believe we use [Oh China!](https://www.amazon.com/Oh-China-Elementary-Beginners-Princeton/dp/0691153086), but I am not sure if other materials are online.

and yea it is fast paced, but that's just by virtue of the number of classes you'll have per week compared to other courses. it's not going to be ""easy"", but i feel that in language classes it will be pretty easy to tell what you know and what you dont know, and adjust your study to that.
They’re really important to get good grades in
It's perfectly fine, but just be aware/set a goal of when you may want to declare the CS major. I know a popular first semester is to do 61a + ee16a + whatever else

The schedule many of the people my year took was Fall 61a, Spring 61b+70, or 70 in the summer. If you push back 1b, you may be delaying 70. (btw idk who the profs for 1b is, but it's preferred to wait for good profs, so if you ask around about the profs, then it may be better to wait)
I haven't taken my second semester of English yet and will probably take it my junior year.

You don't have to worry about AC either though. I haven't met anyone who's had trouble with fulfilling their AC requirement; there are so many classes that you'll end up taking for other requirements that also happen to satisfy AC.
All of the easy R&C Bs are already fully enrolled, i.e there are no seats left. In fact, most of them have waitlisted students.

EECS humanities are pretty flexible, just pick the easiest class. Denero and Hug run a neat ethics in computation class.

I wouldn't bother taking 54. The EECS department dislikes the class so much they made their own version, which is the EE16AB series. You'll learn lin alg in that class, and it's actually a requirement.
Yeah that's fine. Alternatively, if you want to be safe, just enroll in another class, you have 4 weeks to drop. Most people enroll in 20 units then drop one later because, why not? It gives you more flexibility for no cost.
Week or two I believe
Below 100 - lower div
Over 100 - upper div
200 & up - graduate level
[deleted]
L&S sent out a notification, the other colleges may have not. But yeah they're just slow.
Hmm I have a feeling it's need based. I would ask the financial aid office about it to find out.
Definitely wouldn't recommend my diet to anyone unless you work out a lot. Too much salt, sugar, and fat
Yeah^. Or is it still better to take R&C over lower division English classes like 45c? 
Yes. I had a back to back Soda to Barrows and it was fine. Sometimes you might be a few minutes late but that doesn't matter.

\> Also, isn’t it helpful to have breaks to review material before going to your next class? 

Not really. You don't have enough time for that anyway.

Hour long breaks just make you sad. Don't have them if possible.
[deleted]
shoot you're right I didn't see the 1 AM
53 and 54 aren't really related. Lots of people take 54 first.
Wait I think I misunderstood. Are you waitlisted for a lab in 4AL or for the actual class?
Just got off the waitlist! I’m glad it’s over 
I think they are all waitlisted. I tried enrolling in another lecture time that said it was open but I was still waitlisted so idk what to do anymore.. 
It's a typical liability waiver.  You're right, GBO is an incredible waste of time, money, and resources and you'll walk upwards of 8 miles a day and spend 12 hours a day with random people you'll never see again after GBO week but the waiver is fine.
that’s it’s 100% personal preference. I doubt you’ll end up reviewing in that extra time, so I personally would have chosen 10-12, but maybe you like skipping breakfast and eating brunch after class haha
[deleted]
Depends on the class. They should tell how it works on the first day of class or in the first discussion.
I wouldn’t recommend taking 54. Just take EE16A right away like everyone else. You’ll save a semester worth of work. If you’re interested in ML, you’ll end up taking like 5 linear algebra classes so 54 will have been a waste of time.
Unless you're a transfer you'll probably be fine (and if you are you most likely will still be fine but I don't recommend it), I assume you mean CBE 140 and not CHEM 140? 61b is supposed to be better than 61A.  Three technicals is difficult no matter what, esp w/ the 12A lab component.
I'd say it does, but emphasis is more on what certain micro/macro-nutrients do in the body (I would say)-- for example, what different kinds of vitamin deficiencies you can have, or what good sources of vitamin E are.

Simple way to stop eating like shit: stop eating like shit. Eat more fruits and vegetables, eat less processed foods, eat less things with the word ""refined"" on the package. The course will definitely help you understand *why* stuff like that isn't good for you.
Yes, that's right. Newer macs don't have an ethernet port though, so it is slowly going the way of the save icon.
Yeah I think the minimum is 120 and you can enroll until you exceed 130 units for single major and 136 units for double major/simultaneous degrees. So for a single major you can take up to 160 if you only enroll for 8 semesters and take 20 units each semester, or for a double major-180 units throughout 9 semesters. But that'll be a torture for sure [source](https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/enrolling/unit-ceiling) 
Edit:sorry for not quite accurate info the first time
To follow up on /u/ss219's answer: unit 1 and unit 2 are both one block from the main street of frat row, whereas Clark Kerr is on the same street but a block down from the frats. Also, there's Foothill, which is on the eastern end of campus next to the Greek Theater, and has a reputation of being primarily engineering students because it's right next to all the engineering buildings and far from the rest of campus.
Go to MAP, view your offer letter, and you'll see the name of your AO on there!
Everyone I know that has wanted research has found it, but to be honest, not everyone ends up working in their top choice lab. So when people say finding research is hard, they really mean that finding research in a lab that you’re really interested in is challenging. If you’re flexible with what lab you work in, though, there are plenty of opportunities. 

It can be hard for transfer students since most labs like to take younger students who can stay for longer. That being said, if research is something you really want and you really put yourself out there, the opportunity definitely exists. 


I mean, everything is relative, but you’re going to have access to some of the very best resources in the world at Berkeley, especially when it comes to any laboratory science. To me, it seems most people I know aren’t actually gunning for grad school, but the ones that are have pristine GPAs. Otherwise, good grades aren’t easy - I’ve had good marks so far, but that comes from going to *every* class, doing *every* reading, devoting *a lot* of time to studying each week, and **VISITING OFFICE HOURS.** I’ve also definitely gotten lucky insofar as I haven’t had a class way out of my comfort zone just yet.

If your aim is just to get into grad school, go with the cheaper/less demanding option. Berkeley is well-known for just being all-around tough as nails, especially when it comes to many of the high-level math and lab science courses.

I don’t know anything about Irvine to be perfectly honest, and I imagine it’s an incredible school as well, but I found my place comfortably at Berkeley. (Not quite in your discipline but hey)
Move the furniture. Basically, as is, you have the beds on two sides of the wall, and the desks are aligned parallel to them. That means that's there's basically just a walkway left in space. There's just barely enough space so that you can push both desks to the windows, which leaves you much more space around.

If you really want the TV you can also consider lofting your bed.
depends on your other courses and how difficult you think chem/physics are?? i only took 7b, but i really liked it. also, e25 is a 2-unit course but don't be fooled it's v. v. deadly don't take it very lightly.
if you are transfer you would obviously do prereqs for mcb. fuck c0c that ain't your life no more you mcb now. 

as far as im concerned taking the coc requirement would be waste of your time because it won't count toward anything. 
I found 54 way harder than 53. I don't think there's a consistent opinion though - different people are good at or enjoy different things.

54 is more theory/proofs/concepts oriented. I think 54 is the first class that gives an inkling of a taste of upper-division math, and many who enjoy 54 go on to explore more math courses. It's the kind of thing where if you haven't done it before, you probably don't know what to expect, since the way the proof and concept-based questions are asked is tricky. 

53 on the other hand is very similar in structure to the math we do in high school; it's computation-based(solving an integration or calculus problem, instead of proving a theorem or conjecture) and I was more comfortable with it. If you're not a math savant, I think 53 is a better start to college academics. If you're rusty on calculus, maybe brush up during the summer
Go on berkeleytime and check the average lol
Requirement. Below 13 units means you're part-time which means you have to pay for each unit individually, where 13 or more means you have to just pay for the semester.
everything in that class will become very easy to learn as a cs major. actually, even many stats majors dislike that class. you dont learn much that is easily self-teachable through trivial google searches or online tutorials.
[deleted]
No, you won't be missing much. And you don't need Chem 1AL to take Chem 1A.
There is no sequence between math 53/54/55 other than the fact they are consecutive integers! Nothing in math 53 is particularly relevant to 54, and I actually think 54 is a better class in general anyway.
You're in college, at least ostensibly, to learn. You learn by taking classes. Furthermore, you don't pay by unit. 

So someone who crusies by on 13 units and someone who takes 16-17 or even 20 spend the exact same amount of money in the end. The latter has learned a lot more for their money, though.

This is only time in your life you'll be a Berkeley undergrad, taking Berkeley classes. So for most people, they don't just fulfill the minimum possible schedule to graduate. 
I have not given AP's or anything so my advice might not be relevant. 
AFAIK, that is not how the ""minimum"" works. Of the 120 units, nearly 100 are used for filling your graduation worksheet. Most of those classes can not be skipped. Therefore, you will have to spend maybe 3.5 to 3 years anyways filling those requirements. But yes, then you do not have to take any Decals or PE unless you have a ""desire to learn"". If you want to graduate in that time (you know to take more time to get internships with more summers to spend), you can take less classes and chill.

I guess the number of units depends much on your graduation timeframe and the requirements already fulfilled. I want to graduate in 3.5 with no units coming in. Thats 17.5 units per sem (approx) but I usually take more. What I can say is that you can easily handle 4x4 (I usually take 3 techs and 1 humanities) plus more 1-2 unit classes without worrying much and reducing your social life and sleep. 
There's no hard limit, but I would say at minimum try to keep it above 3.5. 3.8+ is best if you're aiming at MIT/Stanford/Berkeley kind of grad schools. 

And, of course, GPA isn't everything--make sure to do research, the more the better, and that also makes recommendation letters easy to get.
Yes, there's definitely time to experiment. If possible, an even better bet would be to intern or just volunteer at a hospital (unfortunately not really any local) to better see what the medical field is like. Same for CS.
I don't know about premed prereqs. If that is the case, then you have to take 10ab regardless? Idk, but if you can test out of calc, *do so*. Don't take them again to ""refresh"" your ""reinforce"" your calc knowledge, it won't help and the class will be a pain in the ass.
You can use the card for BART, but you still have to pay, the card just allows you to transfer money to it.
No, summer isn't included
I agree there are exceptions. I am taking about the general trend though. 
No, Berkeley doesn't offer that - you either bring one with you, or buy one once you're here(from a nearby shop)
What he means is that there's tons more options that fulfill the requirement than just those two and those are generally the more ""english heavy"" classes.  All of the classes that satisfy R&C B have to have a certain amount of work, but the classes like english r1b and rhetor r1b and com lit r1b and such are generally perceived as harder compared to classes like Slavic R5B or Film R1B that also satisfy the second half of the R&C requirement.  I'm in the same boat as you, and my problem right now is that most of the ""easier"" (and to me more interesting) classes have been mostly filled up by sophomores that need to take the classes.  I would suggest looking at berkeleytime if you want to explore classes other than those two that can also fill the second half of the R&C requirement. Personally, I'm trying to stay away from the classes you listed if I can.
Yeah that's the same thing I have, but I think as long as it's awarded we should be fine. I'll try to call financial aid hopefully they pick up.
next summer, so you can take a CS requirement in the spring, summer, and fall and then declare

btw you can take classes summer before freshman year (i did) but most of the useful/interesting ones have already started

in fpf just try to finish as many breadths as you can and P/NP the ones you don't really care about
Oh okay! Awesome, welcome to Cal. 
https://www.berkeleytime.com/catalog/

filter by CoE ""Humanities and Social Sciences"" and look yourself. Anything reasonable with an A/A- average is probably fine. 

Music 26ac is a popular one, but it looks like it's filled up already :\ so look through for yourself (or if anyone else has actual recommendations, listen there)
I feel like this sub should probably have a FAQ, and the first question on there should be how to survive CS 61A. It's probably the most common question here, other than people whining about Milo...

Anyways, CS 61A is being taught by DeNero, so the class will be essentially the same as it was [last semester](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp18/) (and in fact as *every* time he's taught the class since 2011). If you have time to burn you might work through the lectures, homeworks, and projects, as the problems will be mostly recycled for next semester.

The actual difficulty of 61A comes from the complexity of recursion (which you should familiarize yourself with) as well as how bullshit the exams are. Luckily, *the exams are the same every time* modulo details, and you can slowly do all the practice exams (probably not during the summer, but during the semester when you actually know the material).

Alternatively, if you feel you could use more programming experience, find a personal project and work on it. Before coming to Berkeley I had a lot of experience in [Lua](https://finalfantasy.wikia.com/index.php?limit=300&tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&target=Catuse167&namespace=828&tagfilter=&year=&month=-1) and that was pretty helpful. If that project can feasibly be in [Scheme](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/), so much the better, but that's probably not possible if you actually want to get anything done.
General rule of thumb is about 10% of the size of the class gets in off the waitlisted so it's unlikely
you may want to look into seeing if data8 + stat88 can cover your math requirement, as it has been in the process being an equivalent courseload for majors in econ, haas, and some others. unfortunately i dont know too much about pre-med track, so hopefully someone else can chime in.
ah ic, i just wondered since 53 is required by eecs, but not cs.
sounds good
if you take a lax breadth too you probably won't have to p/np it but you get a while to decide anyways
no problem dude
Well in that case, I think you’ll be good. Beware in adding breadths though, definitely consult berkeleytime.com! You don’t really want to add something with like a B average. 

Maybe take it easy since you have time, but I also think you’ll be more than fine if you do choose to add a breadth. 
Probably! I can't say anything for Nav Sci 3, I've never taken it. 
You already made your decision but I wanted to chime in. I think you made a good choice! It can be hard to make friends at Berkeley because the campus is really large and, depending on your major, you may not see the same people in the same class. By living in a dorm, you'll see other students regularly over the course of a year and hopefully make some lifelong friendships. 
Take a screenshot showing there is no task.  Send the transcript ASAP.  CalCentral is a shit show - last year they ""lost"" my SIR even though I SIR'd way before the deadline and I had to prove that I did so by showing screenshots and proof of payment after all my tasks disappeared.  I also had important tasks show up far beyond their due date like Statement of Legal Residence that stressed me the fuck out so do all tasks you know of regardless of whether they are on your CalCentral and take screenshots for proof.
This school don't care. It's your grade at risk. 
Btw calling econ 100A calculus is an affront to calculus. 

If Kamala is still teaching it the math is a joke. The calculus is extremely simple and even if you can't do it, just memorize the result. It's always the same. There's more algebra than anything else.  
Econ's a bit of a toss up since usually Kamala's the only one who teaches it during the school year, so most people are used to her tea party. At the end of the day though, it's still econ 100a so its not a total back breaker. Give it some respect and it'll treat you with respect. It wasn't a very memorable class for me for whatever reason.

134 though, is an absolute beast. First, regardless of who's teaching it, they all rip of each other's worksheets and syllabus and stuff. This doesn't really matter too much it's just interesting to note. Also, 134 in my opinion is one of the hidden gems of difficulty at this school. Few people take it, relatively, since it's pretty much only needed for stat majors. Therefore not as much is known about it and it doesn't have the same notoriety as like the cs classes. You're goddamn right though the lectures are hard to follow, and the book sucks, Pitmann (the guy who wrote it) came in one day for a guest lecture and it was like an old man yelling at a cloud. 

Still, one way or another some people manage to do well in this atrocity. First, you gotta do the homework. And the bonus questions or whatever they call it. Next, post as much as you can on Piazza. Ask for help on the hw, answer hw questions doesn't matter. If you're fucked on a problem you need to quickly unfuck yourself. If you can unfuck someone else you won't get fucked by that question if it shows up again. If it's like last semester, the general rule of thumb is that the textbook is similar to the midterm and final. The issue is though, are the quizzes. I just checked and Yiming is back, looking for more victims. If you're about an average student, you absolutely need to do well on the first, and ideally the second quiz. Pray to the Virgin for mercy on the third and fourth.
Last semester our quiz averages were, in order from first to fourth:
21 > 18 > 14 > 10. Out of 25. 

I don't know if you're there yet, summer goes faster, but there's a nice kick in difficulty about halfway through the course. The beginning everyone's all ooh and ahh, oh look the birthday trick thingy, ooh jelly beans and socks. You're looking at their hands and not their eyes like a cheap bar trick when they start bringing out more and more distributions. They start off kinda cute with like binomial and whatnot. It stops being funny when when they get to poisson or so. 

Eventually that's all this course becomes. Memorizing and recognizing the distributions. Going from one to another, pulling them out of your ass in some cases. You have to know each one like the back of your hand, what they're good for, and the suspicious environments they can appear in. It's actually a lot like ochem, but few people take both these classes. 

134 made me remember what it was like to be bad at math. I never had nightmares about a class until after took this one. 

I got it from my advisor on my berkeley.edu email account (the one that opens if you click the mail icon on calcentral). I didn't get an email notification on any other personal email.  It showed up as an email from Olivia Chan (my counselor) with the subject line Fall 2018 Schedule Feedback and in it she attached some notes about my proposed schedule and said I was good to go.
No prob. You'll be hella gucci if you took AP Calc
[deleted]
Np. Yep, you should be able to sign up for it, but 50 isn't a ton (for big classes) so it's good to have a backup just in case it fills up.
Hmm if you have a solid background in math then that schedule looks ok, otherwise it might be a bit much for incoming freshmen because the problem sets will probably take a while.
Yes, they're hard but 1ab aren't exactly easier even when you know the content. That's why I'd skip them.

If you want to optimize for GPA, take 16 I guess. Otherwise just go to 53/54
if you're going into CS, you'll have plenty of time to complete breadth requirements. the number of classes required is actually more relaxed than i originally anticipated as a freshman.
yes - there's an adjunct class for almost every math lowerdiv. 
[deleted]
Weird...i never got to fill that out
Yeah those classes aren't too bad so it'll be fine. For a lot of classes, they aren't necessarily graded on a curve but they use historic test scores and all to ensure that not too many people get As. For a class as easy as UGBA10, this means that you have to get near perfect scores on most of the tests to guarantee a high grade.
Don't know anything about swaps, sorry. I guess if you're enrolled in more than 13.5 that way, that would mean it doesn't count. What I said earlier just came straight from Berkeley's enrollment FAQ.
do it with a professor whose ratings are good lol, if the fall one are really bad you may want to wait (i'm not too familiar with the standings of the profs but you can try asking around)
[deleted]
it's been done before but maybe sign up for it and ask around on the first day if any other freshmen are taking it w. you
I think most of them. My class had a B+/A- grade average which mislead me to thinking it was easy. It was set up in a way that we couldn’t really skip out on the readings. Probably most history classes you can get through by not reading everything though
Yeah don't underestimate your breadths. I took a classics class freshman year because it had a B+ average, and it had some of the craziest reading assignments I've ever had.

At one point they wanted me to finish the Iliad in a week start to end. That's 600 pages of weird ass translated ancient Greek english. I just bullshit it with sparksnotes.

It's not really ""hard"", it's just work and effort.
Having a CS70-level understanding of probability is very useful for EE126. If you think that you can learn and comprehend the probability by reading the notes and doing the homework, go ahead--everyone learns differently. If you're open to postponing 126 for a semester, I would suggest STAT134. That should give you a better understanding of probability than CS70 without having to repeat the discrete math part.
take 54 or 53. skipping 1b will do you more good than harm. I heard 53 sometimes opens up spots cuz ppl drop but unsure. Saw a post about that somewhere here. 
They usually open a week after class starts. Btw I would take Math 53 and not Math 54. You will learn linear algebra in EE16a and b
Skip 1B, I skipped it and my roommmates didn’t, they regretted not skipping. 
Winning some sort of international competition should be good enough
Yeah of course! But it just makes it easier since they're all congregated in one area ! But you're definitely right, I can still meet people!
Ahh I see. Thank you so much for your help! I am so excited to see what Berkeley has to offer ! :) 
I wouldn't, but hopefully they might. Employment numbers, graduate school matriculation, undergraduate research presence (that's harder to call an objective good, though), staff ""ratings"" of some kind, professors vs. GSIs. Basically anything to indicate high levels of industry preparation, and conceptual depth in classes. That's probably where I'd start, and eliminate things research shows to be extraneous.
Oh dang, hopefully I can just in case my friend gets off the waitlist. Thanks so much for your helpful answers!
im lowkey down! haha
[deleted]
Phase Two is in the summer. I guess Phase One is for incoming freshmen as well, but that doesn't apply to most of us, I assume.
For the original question, I swear I saw someone on this sub reddit say April 1. I'm personally hoping its so.
Thank you
thank you so much! 
I'm so excited!!
thanks for the replies!

- would you say that the atmosphere is more social or more on-your-own?

- do you know how it is (as an undergrad) to get classes / get research opportunities? I don't have any regents or anything like that...

- do you know about class curves or grade inflation/deflation?
oh I didn't know about dead week, thank you

do you have any insight on these:

- would you say that the atmosphere is more social or more on-your-own?

- do you know how it is (as an undergrad) to get classes / get research opportunities?

- is there generally curves in classes? or grade inflation/deflation?
Nice! Political Economy seems to be a more qualitative approach to economics, with a particular emphasis on international business and comparative government. Check out [this document](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/political-economy/political-economy.pdf) to see the full major description and course layout. Keep in mind that PE requires two years of college-level foreign language, which may take up as much as four courses.

Considering you're a CNR admit, have you thought about their [Enviro. Econ Policy](https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/EEP%20Major%20Snapshot.pdf) major? That seems like it would pair healthily with Society and Environment, while still standing on its own.
wait but they accept like... everyone off the waitlist? they definitely *opened up* extra spots for students by the time adjustment rolled around
Thank you so much!!!
And the easy way (in EE at least): go to office hours and ask nicely :P

(To be clear: this was office hours for a class that I had already been attending most office hours and busting my ass for, and it was very closely related to the lab's research, so in a way I was already showing dedication and interest.)
Is that actually true? I imagine Caltech would have a much stronger student body, which would drive grades up...
haha I'll cross my fingers for you too! Keep me posted about your admission ! 
is there anything you would recommend that would mean not starting off with three techs? Or in double majoring really that difficult? Also I have little to no experience with CS, will CS61A be death?
Alright, thank you so much! 
Does taking 54 before 53 make it harder?
If I were to take 54 1st sem should there be any prior reviewing I should do?
accurate description of labs
do they plan for you to graduate in four years or five ?
Thanks!
[deleted]
I...actually haven’t watched Rick and Morty. (Don’t kill me Reddit)
okay thanks so much! but if u just need to fill the prerequisite credits and get a certain GPA to apply to Haas or econ, why do many still take like the more complicated math?? does it look better when applying for a major or is it cauz they just wanna challenge themselves??
Thank you! Is the building a popular one? As in even if I put it on my form am I likely to get a room there? Also how's the view haha thats also a big part I consider
Ahh so all luck I see! I definitely don’t want to stay on a social dead floor so would choosing non substance free make it less likely?
I'm not a med student, but I know people who had the same idealistic outlook as you and ended up getting depression because they couldn't handle upper division chemistry classes.

>And I definitely didn't say you need to take that class. 

Physical Chemistry Lab is a required class for chemistry majors to graduate with a baccalaureate degree. I don't know what specifically is required for MCB majors, but I'm sure you have taken difficult upper divs that you don't use right now.

>if you are going to be successful, you will be successful no matter where you go

I can assure you no matter how hard I try, I will never play basketball in the NBA. Nor will I sing like Taylor Swift. Nor will I win a Fields Medal.
thank you!
 I meant more in terms of being allowed. Like would I be allowed to take 7B without 7A even if I don’t take the AP physics c test?
I did. I already requested global access and used CITRIX and yet it says failure to authenticate when I attempt to login.

jeez, calso was only a couple days of crap and they just rushed you thru everything. guess this is where the tuition is going towards now :(
It turns out that there's a scheduling conflict between 77 and C10, so I'll probably just take an easy breadth in its place (probably History 30 or Nusctx 10).

I think I should be fine with regards to 110. I took one of the [linear algebra midterms for Math 54](https://tbp.berkeley.edu/exams/3854/download/) and got an A- on it, so I think the class prepared me well enough. Though, I am really intimidated by Math 104, with profs like Ratner failing 50% of the class. Is there a class you recommend I take in the spring to prepare for 104?

Also, I don't need to take 89, as those [double majoring/minoring in math may use Math 54 in lieu of 89.](http://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree/the-major-and-minor-program) I also feel that Physics 99 won't be a huge deal academically or time-wise, especially as it is variable-unit and is graded on a P/NP basis.

Thanks for your help!
I appreciate the help and advice, thank you for your time. 
What is the worst bed? Is there one that is preferred?
I just got accepted to a graduate program at Berkeley and am feeling pretty overwhelmed by trying to find housing. Do you have any recommendations for 1-bedroom apartments near campus? I’ve been told to look on Craigslist, but I would love any specific recommendations you might have!
whats wrong w unit 1 compared to 2
I just sent my statement of intent to go here, so I’m really grateful for your advice. Any general freshman tips you could offer me?
188 exams are not easy
they are, but from what I hear ee122 tends to be more math-y and theoretical (weekly psets) while cs168 is more hands on (programming assignments/projects)
Other commenter is correct, 122 is more mathematical . It's also not a very good course so I'd advise against taking it.
however, if you would *like* to, you could take a decent # of courses in both and gain skills from both.
Not the same Penn 😬 that’s Penn state and he’s talking about University of Pennsylvania 
It's 12k per year. That $10k difference is $10k I def don't have, unfortunately.
You are the best. Thank you!!
Alright thanks.  Now that I think about it it's also probably a good idea to get out of the ""STEM bubble"" and maybe meet different types of people in my first term, so unless anything changes I'll probably go that route.
could you further elaborate? sorry, i'm really ignorant to this kind of thing
thank you! also, why is the bConnected task still there? It says my .edu account is already created and I am able to access the GMail so why is that task still there?
Are you sure? I've seen plenty of other posts and replies that have spoken well of the Units, also my friend had resided in Unit 3 and she recommended me to stay in that Unit or the other 2.
I'll probably take up on those options, but I also placed the blackwell double as one of my choices as well.
Getting Cs in community college classes. I might be getting Cs and i’m worried that i might get off the waitlist, just to get rescinded for having a Cs on my last semester
[deleted]
Oh ok. So do you think taking an R&C course first semester or an AC course is better if I test out of R&C? 
[deleted]
So if Rhetoric1B requires rhetoric1A, that doesn't mean I can't use it to fill the RnC B requirement? Awesome. 
That's interesting, do you know if it's normal for need-based financial aid to just show up in the middle of the semester? I remember I got it a bit after I received the rest, which is what confused me.
Most pre-meds take the R&C classes even if they're eligible to pass out of them, simply because they usually have less of a time commitment than other English classes.
Thanks, will it be manageable with 3 other hard engineering technicals? Especially since my background in english or history is weak.
for the lab

it seems like there's space in the class, but since I cant get the lab I'm not in the class yet
Sorry for adding on here but I also got that message and am confused about financial aid in general. Does it disburse before my payments are due, and reduce what I owe, or I am supposed to pay the full amount listed and later get a refund? Will I get the full amount listed under ""Gift Aid"" for 2018 Fall, in your experience? Thanks for any help lol!
Yeah, exactly why I want to take the course. I want to know the *why* of things. Thanks!
There are USB-C ethernet adaptors. Saved my ass multiple times in the dorms last year.
Thank you! 
>  I’ve had good marks so far, but that comes from going to every class, doing every reading, devoting a lot of time to studying each week, and VISITING OFFICE HOURS.

Very much this! Especially the office hours! Wish I could upvote more than once!
I didn't take AP Chem in hs, but did do Physics C (Mechanics and E&M) as two years so I definitely feel stronger there. My other courses would be Math 53 (saw this material in a calc 3 class), E25 and probably the R/C requirement.
I would have more than 13 units without the seminar though; this is what I'm planning:

Chem 4A \(4\), Math 53 \(4\), ChemE 40 \(2\), ASAMST 20A \(4\), for a total of 14 units

a seminar would get me to 15. I'm not concerned about the unit minimum, I just don't want to take the class if I don't have to.
Okay, thank you so much!
But I'm not paying... I have a scholarship. I'd instead use the time to research/intern/get the best grades... Also, if a graduate school doesn't care how many units you take, why take more? Why not just put the extra effort into getting the best grades possible in the required number of classes, and using the extra time to research/intern/gain work experience. I'm majoring in PoliSci so I could see the additional courses being a benefit to someone in STEM, but that's not the route I'm going.
Okay thank you! I'll keep this in mind and see how things go!
just so you know, r1b difficulty depends on gsi, not course. i took film last semester and had significantly more work than two of my friends in (separate) complit r1bs. i wouldn't avoid a class for the department, but for the subject matter. you're going to have to write a 10-page paper related to your class's topic; you can find individual section descriptions on department websites.
Hey! Forgot to update but a couple days ago the CalGrant status changed to will disburse for me. My cousin's status was recently updated as well. Hope the same is true for you!
[deleted]
Interesting to know... I'll email my mcb advisor about this. Thanks for the help!
Ok I was planning on adding either History 7A or Astro C10 which both have B+ averages
Whoa I had no idea it would be that bad. Okay will send and take a screenshot.
Thanks buddy! I think I should be cool then.
Thanks for the help! (Btw you have successfully scared the living shit out of the me for 134 especially when you mentioned Yiming, she's my GSI) 
Thanks! Also do you know how difficult Physics 7A is, especially since I didn't take AP? I took regular but it was pretty hard.
Also should I do any reviewing before taking the classes. I have a tight summer schedule, but I'll try to make time.
Also if more engineering students take it in the fall, would the curve be harder and wouldn't the class be harder to get into?
If I have no programming experience will I struggle a lot?
Sounds like a better option for me, I'll look into it! Though it seems it's only offered in spring, and I'm not entirely sure what to take as my fourth class >_> rn I have Data 8 + 2 breadths (astron c10, ib 35ac) and I've already fulfilled all my R&C reqs. Should I just tack on another breadth?

Thanks a ton btw
I'll keep that in mind and tryhard this upcoming semester. Thanks!
Do you at least get a floor or even a building before? Or is it all on the day?
Alright I’ll think about it, thank you so much!
That's a major oof. I guess I can always drop one if it proves to be too much on top of my technical classes. Thanks for the advice though, I'll be a little more careful next semester.

> Employment numbers

These are next to impossible to obtain beyond student surveys, which often have <50% response rate.

>graduate school matriculation

Ditto above, and we don't know how many people applied to grad school (or what is a good grad school? If I go Harvard -> U Iowa should that be penalized?)

>undergraduate research presence

We can objectively measure research strength through like citations, publication performance, awards, etc.

>staff ""ratings"" of some kind, professors vs. GSIs

How exactly? Student surveys?


hello future roomies

[deleted]
I will! 
>is there anything you would recommend that would mean not starting off with three techs? 

Take more random classes. Do more of your engineering humanities requirements, or a decal or elective. 

>Also I have little to no experience with CS, will CS61A be death?

It'll be pretty difficult. Though the class assumes no previous knowledge, many people coming into it already have significant CS and programming experience, and the class is graded such that the average is a B/B+, so inevitably people without experience come in at a disadvantage.
[deleted]
Four years. (You can see the suggested course schedule on the CoC website if you're curious.)
Oh, can you tell me a bit more about this?
Oh shit, I take everything back. UCLA you go
in econ especially, a lot of people will go for a more math-heavy track in their upper divs (helps for grad school) so they'll do 1a/1b and then econ 101a/101b.

i don't think it looks better when applying for a major, a lot of people i knew in haas took the 16 series since it's easier. totally depends on the person. for you i'd def recommend the 16 series.
the view is rlly nice from the top floors (but probably not from the lower ones)!! like i can see the golden gate bridge from my room (& some of the lounges, i think). (the sun sets over the bridge and it's one of the most beautiful things). some of my other friends have nice views of san francisco. most people who put down the substance free environment get it, from what i understand! + unit 1 is a really good location.
[deleted]
Please stop taking my posts out of context. You know exactly what I mean. 
probably? i don't think they enforce prereqs very strictly for lower div physics
I guess maybe its just MechE? But idk
Awesome!! Glad to hear, hope you're excited!!
Oh no, they made us all pay an extra $800 once GBO was done.
[deleted]
It’s up to you, every room is different. I’m just saying that you shouldn’t try to screw over someone you’re about to live with for a year. I had two roommates who picked beds close to each other because they were already friends, and moved desks around so that I’d be as isolated as possible. 
Overall I'd say 188 is an easier upper div class in terms of workload, and I don't think 188's exams are any harder than any other CS exam
[deleted]
L&S majors have 130 units to finish their major and graduate (unless you petition). Once you hit 130 units you can no longer register for classes. Those 130 units are split between your major and your GEs (and if you don't hit 130 units through those, electives).

Some of your major requirements are pre-requisites to declaring your major (and thereby getting priority for your major). The MCB pre-reqs are pretty light:
 
> 2.0 overall UC Berkeley GPA earned a minimum average GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken for the major,
> 
> earned a minimum average GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken for the major,
> 
> completed or are currently enrolled in Biology 1A/1AL and have a C or better on the first midterm exam (typically the 7th week), and
> 
> completed or are currently enrolled in Chemistry 3B after the 2nd week early add/drop deadline, and
> 
> decided on an emphasis (if you haven't come and talk to a peer advisor for advice/planning suggestions).

Transfers come in with ~1/2 of their 130 units completed, so I just meant freshmen have more time to finish pre-reqs, declare, and finish major requirements
Actually, sorry, I should clarify that this is in regards to units 1 and 2, and also that generalizations definitely aren't accurate all the time. Unit 3 does have a good social scene, though so does kerr, but my experience with unit 2 and also what I've heard of 1 have not generally seemed super tight-knit. Could totally change on a year-by-year basis tho
you need a 3.0 gpa, afaik. 
i highly doubt you will get rescinded unless you commit a crime or fail a class, and even failing a class who knows if they really care enough or not. don't worry about it that much just finish out the year as best you can you should within all reason be FINE :o
Haha sorry for the information barf! 

The python codeacademy tutorial should cover most of these concepts, it's the same one recommended for students to do before taking 61a! You can also take a look at data8's actual lecture material at http://data8.org/sp18/ (this is last spring's course site) and see if it makes sense to you. 
I guess it depends on what kind of class you'd like in your first semester. Most AC classes are pretty big, with hundreds of students in lecture and a discussion section that meets once a week. R&C classes have thirty-ish people each and meet about three times a week. It was much easier for me to get to know people in AsAmSt R2A than in ESPM 50AC, which may or may not be a goal for you in your first semester?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a difference academically which one you take first, since you'll end up taking both probably by the end of your freshman year. Personally I liked having taken R2A before my AC class, but ultimately, either is fine.
Yeah it is a bit strange, haven't seen anything like it before. Usually aid comes at the beginning of the semester
Oh then yeah I don't think you'll get in. Labs are pretty small, and if you go by the 10% rule, it's just not likely.
[deleted]
Cool! I wish you luck, then. Hopefully the professor is what you’d expect. I can’t imagine he’s worse than the guy I had, though, who would play sad videos of emaciated children before lecture started and then not say anything about it. 
Is the wifi pretty bad at the dorms?
i'd say to do 7a, if only because you'll have a slightly easier first semester then. you can always take 1a next semester when you have a better gauge of how classes here are.
Does that cover rent as well? Otherwise you're still investing bay area rent money.

Research if done through URAP counts as units anyway. Internships typically aren't done throughout the semester.

>Also, if a graduate school doesn't care how many units you take, why take more?

Again, to learn from the classes? 

If you just want to minmax and graduate then by all means just take the minimum. But you asked why other people typically don't, and that's the answer: to learn more for their money and time. 

Again, even if money isn't a factor you'll never be in this spot taking these classes again in your life. If you don't care, then that's fine.
Just checked and mine hasn't changed, but thanks for letting me know! Hopefully it's just a matter of time.
they don't factor into your GPA so if you do poorly in them but pass its fine
you can p/np all your breadths
I’ve heard Astro C10 was an amazing course for many students! Not too sure about History, but either should be okay. Preferably find some breadths with a A- avg or so but if not, don’t worry too much about it. 

Word of caution though, this schedule does look quite a bit more difficult than the standard schedule. My main concern is having 3 technicals. That said, given your high familiarity with coding, perhaps you’ll be good? Still a lot of work but if both CS/Data courses are like nothing new, I don’t think it’ll be that bad. 
Yeah np.
Oof. Sorry about that. May have been over-dramatic. But seriously though, that was one of the hardest classes I've ever taken here, fitting into my top 3 of bio 1a, chem 3a. Maybe I'm just dumb or something but that was the most amount of effort I've ever put into a class and gotten so little out of (grade wise). At the very least just don't ever give up. It's a pretty demoralizing class and I've even seen grad students get taken down by it, but you always gotta believe that you can do it. That somehow you can get to the answer. 
Usually you can explain the situation with the TAs and work something out. [Edit: for math, that is. For CS61* the TAs usually don't check attendance so you can go to any discussion section.]
IS THIS HAPPENING????
[deleted]
thanks for the reply!
 
may I ask about any pros/cons about Berkeley or what you like/dont like about it?

[deleted]
ok im considering shifting all of the CS courses down a semester (and maybe even take come over the summer)

how does this look?
Chem 4A / Math 53 / CBE 40 / A 1 unit seminar / Breadth

Thanks! Also my math skill isn't that strong, I did get a 4 on AP calc. However I have no knowledge on linear algebra so I think I will struggle in the course. 
😂 noooo don’t forsake me, Cal! 
oh wow! that's good to know! thank you! I'll definitely consider unit 1 then! 
Alright haha thank you I guess I can just hope for a good floor then
I do know exactly what you mean, and I would also say it is only rational to give some thought to whether going to UC Berkeley and potentially taking a lower GPA + fewer hospital opportunities is really worth the prestige behind the university's research which is only somewhat relevant to medicine.
ya GBO was kind of wack. A solid week between convocation and classes starting, they had some mandatory and optional events on days. People have diff experiences based on their groups some much better than others so hopefully it isn't too bad for you. Enjoy the time to acclimate and walk around and attend like the talks they had during the day. Lots of info (although probably pointless but still interesting). Also extra fees is also pretty wack. 
In that case, could you recommend a good introductory scientific programming course? I feel like Data 8 could be pretty useful. 

Also, how does auditing work exactly? Because I don't really know much about the applications 89 covers (e.g., tensors, solving PDEs), but at the same time, I'm not sure it's worth taking an entire course for.

113 looks kinda interesting actually. Depending on how I do on 110, I may take that in the spring. The curves look better, anyhow. And yeah, I think 99 is just a way to get credit for research once you have the position. 
I can agree with that
No, you’d just have to forgo taking more electives, and you’d have some heavy workloads.
thank you so much, this is really in depth and informative
Thanks for the answer!
[deleted]
Ok thank you for all your insight. I was actually planning on taking ESPM 50AC if I were to do an AC first semester. Did you take it second semester? How was it? But why did you choose to take an AC before doing R2B?  And I think I’ll pick whatever has more openings, since the R&C classes with the most openings as of now are ones I am not really interested in like English/comlit/rhetoric. 
Ok yeah I'll try to get clarity from the fin aid office. I did check out Cal's financial aid site, and there they list Aug 13 as when they start disbursing funds. If I do get it on that date or soon after I should be good, since the first payment deadline on Cal Central is not until Aug 17. But for sure I'll give them a call. Thanks anyhow!!
LAN was always faster and more stable, but there were definitely times where wifi would go down but the LAN would still be operational. 
Hi again sorry to bother I just had a question about 134's midterm/final. Is there anything you recommend to do/prepare? What to expect? And if possible do you remember the stats on the exams. Thanks!
[deleted]
The only thing that's 'yikes' is that you deleted your old reddit account just to start posting on a brand new one on the exact same sub. 
I suggest avoiding taking Chem 4A, Math 53, and CS61A in your first semester since there's a lot of adjusting to college you gotta do, and Chem 4A is hard enough on its own (esp since saykally doesn't really teach, you have to self-study all the material). 

The new schedule you suggest definitely looks very doable though, I'd aim for something like that (i took nearly the exact same schedule)!
[deleted]
Also currently a Freeborn resident and I'm really glad I got this building personally. I didn't choose it for religious regions, just that it kinda fit more with my lifestyle. Regarding the socially dead part, I wouldn't say that's true. I guess it could be considered quieter, but in the good way - people (mostly) aren't focused on getting lit and tend to have more conversations. Personally, some of my closest friends are on my floor. Also, a lot of people actually still go to parties if that's your thing. Message me if you have any questions!
Np, good luck with your first year at Cal! If coursework gets too busy, remember that you can pass/no pass your breadth courses.
I did take ESPM 50AC second semester. There's a lot of reading throughout and a lot of writing for the first month or so. I don't think it's exactly a chill class, but it isn't hard to do well in it. It's pretty enjoyable and pretty typically ""Berkeley.""

I'm in CNR, so ESPM 50AC fulfilled one of my lower division requirements and also happened to be an AC class. You really don't have to go out of your way to take AC classes, since they'll sort of just come to you through other requirements. I didn't do R2B because I wanted to take introductory classes that were prereqs for upper divs.

Even if you don't take an R1A this semester and don't end up passing out of R&C (AP scores aren't out yet, right?), you'll still have a ton of time to do everything. You'll for sure figure it out so dw.
No worries. Love the 134 questions. More people know about that hellhole the better imo. 

I'd give you the copies of my old exams but I don't think I have them. Try looking up some old exams. All the profs rip each other off. If you're really desperate, and this only really works for the midterm/final, I recommend looking up probability exam soa practice test. This is a pretty notorious test for actuaries and the material is almost exactly the same as 134. God knows why Cal doesn't have its own actuarial science department but whatever. Look up probablity exam soa stuff. I'm sure you'll find something useful, though you may have to dig around a little.

Expect fairness I guess. It'll be easier than you think, but harder than you can do. 

Regarding stats yeah I remember.
Our midterm mean: 21/30, don't remember median or std.

Our final median 55, mean 53. Std 21. Out of 92.
PM'd!
The other yikes is that this isn't the first time they've done it either.
Ok thanks!
Yeah AP scores aren’t out yet, so that’s why I’m in this dilemma. To take R&C or to take AC? Lol I still have no idea but I’ll figure it out. My other classes are Math 10 and Chem 1a so I want a more chill third class. Part of me wishes I don’t pass out of R&C so I don’t have to worry about this haha. But thanks so much for all your detailed advice, it was very helpful :) 
Thanks again! Would you mind if I PM-ed you more about 134? You've been more clear than most of my friends who just say 'lol it was hard'
yup she's been doing it for months. her other deleted alts are /u/chaitea8100 and /u/brainlesspos (same mentality, same class schedule, same roommate and class troubles, same method of deleting all her posts after a dumb thread)
Ooh yeah, you'll be p busy with Math 10A and Chem 1A, but I think you'd be able to manage either a R&C class or ESPM 50AC on top of that, whichever one you end up in. No problem, I'm glad I was able to help :)
Yeah sure. Ask anything.

[The Parousia] Chancellor Christ is doing her second AMA in our subreddit! Here are the rules and guidelines I'm enacting in order to ensure a successful AMA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cxir/the_parousia_chancellor_christ_is_doing_her/,2019-09-23 14:06:36,"**[Link to the AMA from last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/)**

**[Link to the AMA coming this Wednesday, Sep 25th](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/)**
-

-

-

Our last AMA went so well, Christ is coming back for another!

The Chancellor's reddit account is /u/carolchrist. This is not the actual AMA thread. The actual AMA is pinned to the top of the subreddit, and Christ will start answering questions in two days' time. You will have these two days to think of a question and post it in the thread. 

Please read the [previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/) to see which questions were already asked.

-

-

**THE ACTUAL AMA**
-

* **No questions are off-limits. But keep it respectful and formal.**

Christ does not want to limit any sort of questions *at all* for this AMA. Nothing is off-limits. However, you must stay respectful and formal. Make sure you remain respectful and your question will not be removed. 

Joke questions *are* allowed. 

* **The AMA thread will be in contest mode until the actual AMA start time.**

This is because I don't want people to start long discussions before the AMA has begun. We also need time to promote this event on different channels and make sure everyone affiliated with the campus has time to create an account and post their questions. 

The Chancellor will start answering questions this Wednesday at 5:00PM. 

* **Parent comments only**

The Chancellor does not have enough time to read through chains of comments. We want original questions posted as *only* parent comments. If you want to piggyback off of another parent comment you liked, you may refer to it in a parent comment of your own. 

This may seem odd, but we want people to have as many chances as possible to get their questions answered, and we want the AMA to feel like an actual back-and-forth discussion between our community and the Chancellor. 

**All children comments will be deleted until Christ starts her actual AMA. After which children comments will be allowed.** 

Once the Chancellor comes in, I want her answers to be the only child comment to each parent comment. That way, even after this two day delay, you won't have to go hunting for Christ's answers, and you can follow-up on her answers more easily. 

In a future event, we may be able to have the Chancellor answer question that arose from discussions, but I don't want those long-winded discussions to start prematurely.

Again, please be on your best behavior. We may have even more events in the future, and maybe the Chancellor would be open to coming to a subreddit meetup. This will only be possible if this AMA goes well. 

Stay respectful, ask your best questions, and

Housing Application Addendum,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hb33kb/housing_application_addendum/,2020-06-17 16:45:02,"As an incoming freshman who doesn't have family in the US, I will be virtually homeless without a housing offer from Berkeley. Carol Christ announced today that housing will prioritize ""students for whom living in Cal housing is their self-elected best option."" However, the Housing Application Addendum only asked me yes or no questions on if I'd still like to be considered for Housing in fall and spring. I don't see anything asking about my current situation that could prioritize my position. Is there anything I could do? Should I contact them?","Wasn’t there a comment about whether or not you lived in California too? I assume that would help with prioritization.
""If you have received the communication from the Housing Office this morning regarding the housing application addendum related to COVID 19, please respond to the email indicating that you are interested in Fall housing, if this is the case. **You must complete this addendum by Jun 24 indicating that you are interested in housing to be considered for housing in Fall 2020.""**  


""The Housing Office will be collecting these responses from all students with submitted applications, and will be determining based on the chancellor's working groups recommendations which students will receive priority for housing offers. However, whether the Housing office can provide all members of the prioritized groups a housing offer will depend on the amount of demand they still have based on the responses to the housing application addendum and the continuing recommendations for public safety from health officials.""

""The housing application addendum is for all students who have submitted an application and have NOT received or accepted a housing offer.  Freshmen, transfer and late continuing student applicants who have a submitted application on file, but have not accepted a housing contract all received housing app addendum instructions via email today and must complete it by June 24 to be considered for a housing offer.""

You can contact CalHousing directly for even more information at  [reshall@berkeley.edu](mailto:reshall@berkeley.edu)! Hope this helps!
You probably should be ok.  Berkeley looks to be running at 75% capacity, around 2000 less beds than before.  From all the informal surveys, it seems like at least half the incoming freshmen will be choosing to stay at home, so that more than makes up the difference.  Of course, we’ll see in a week or so how the offers goes.
I’m a US citizen residing in South Korea, which has a 16hr timezone difference. Staying here isn’t really an option for me.
You can also clarify your personal situation via emailing them! They have staff that look and answer those questions, especially more unique ones or situations! Best of luck!
Yeah for sure, that definitely makes sense. I’m just saying that as about [67% of cal students are from California](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance) , they will likely give extra priority to people who live outside of California, meaning people outside of California might not have to worry too much about getting housing, as they won’t be close to the cutoff. At least that’s what I’d assume. You could always email them, I haven’t seen anywhere to enter additional information into about housing.
I emailed them, thanks!"
A New President for the University of California,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hn72g2/a_new_president_for_the_university_of_california/,2020-07-07 17:50:10,"Dear Campus Community,  


I am pleased to inform you that today the Regents approved the appointment of Michael Drake to be the next President of the University of California. You can find more information here, in the announcement that was just released:

[https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/michael-v-drake-become-21st-president-university-california](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/michael-v-drake-become-21st-president-university-california)

I am thrilled to welcome President Drake back to the University of California and look forward to working in close concert with him to advance the cause of public higher education at a time when our mission has never been more important. President Drake brings with him an extraordinary degree of experience, an established record of accomplishment, and a proven capacity for effective leadership. I believe that President Drake can and will usher in a new era of excellence, access, inclusion, and true equity for the University, for our campus community, and for the people of California who we serve.

Sincerely,

Carol Christ  
Chancellor","Fun fact: In 2007, President Drake (then Chancellor of UC Irvine) fired Erwin Chemerinsky (our current Berkeley Law dean), who just got appointed at that time to be Dean of the UCI law school. The firing [caused a ton of controversy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/University_of_California,_Irvine_School_of_Law#/Chemerinsky_hiring_controversy), and eventually Drake rehired Chemerinsky back on after meeting with him at Duke.

The two have since reconciled, so there's no lasting repercussions. Just an interesting piece of history between two now-prominent figures of the Berkeley community back when they were prominent figures at UC Irvine!
Hopefully this one doesn't embezzle millions of dollars into a slush fund and then have the audacity to increase tuition.
This guy's all about equity/inclusion. With the rage for AA, the hispanic enrollment quota of 25% by '27, and this new prez who'll probably mandate certain ethnic/race-based-quotas, AA is going to happen whether or not it actually passes in November. Tl;dr: Asians are screwed :(

Edit: I know explicit quotas aren't allowed; I meant the fact that URM's would get a boost in their admissions scoring/evaluation, which might mean that Asians are disadvantaged - best case scenario they have NO boost, and worst case scenario they're actually knocked down a peg or two.
anyone else not surprised he's black?
all love to uci! zot zot
The quota thing is way overblown. It's not a monumental leap in Hispanic enrollment, and it's not a hard quota, it's a goal. While the term ""Hispanic-serving institution"" may be distasteful, it's the name of the legislation. Repealing Prop 209, however, is quite worrying.
Why would Asian people be screwed?
Race based quotas are unconstitutional per Supreme Court UC Regents vs Bakke decision.
I am not surprised that Dr. Drake is black, given that he has (presumably) been black for his entire life.
Well, specifically, it’s a federally-defined goal with the Department of Education.
Under a ""demographically-representative"" regime, Asians are ""overrepresented"".
Only explicit quotas. A point system, which achieves roughly the same effect, is not.
Can confirm: did my undergrad at OSU, and he was Black there, too.
Yes and that’s what this comment thread is talking about, quotas. I was correcting the commenter on the error, which I stand by.

There are many different ways to execute AA. Quotas and point systems are the same only in that both are mechanisms of AA, but they’re vastly different. What evidence is there that they have roughly the same effect? There are no studies that demonstrate this. I mean in a way you could argue that all AA methods have “roughly the same effect.” Because the goals are the same.
Can confirm. Met him my senior year at OSU, looking back at the picture I took, he was black then as well.
Yep. I agree with you. I'm just qualifying your statement. As for evidence, Epenshade and Radford from Princeton did an excellent study. I highly recommend you give it a look."
Culty Christian clubs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/19aandp/culty_christian_clubs/,2024-01-18 20:35:18,Should i be wary of all those bible club recruiters on campus? I’ve been incessantly approached by them and I’m easily swayed so i end up promising to come to their meet ups 😭 Are any of them sus and should be avoided at all costs? Don’t wanna end up joining some theologically wayward club lmao,"gracepoint/acts2 is a legitimate cult, so please stay away from that
definitely be wary, but ngl I went to events for the free food
If you want to join a church, you can look into that by going to churches. Do not join anything because of annoying tabling.
anyone preying on vulnerable college kids is sus, if you're having a crisis of faith do your own research, these groups are well trained in manipulation
Has anybody just gone to their stuff for free food?

t. a hungry bear ;__;
Yes they quite literally invited me over for some snacks at this girl place and a Bible study, freshman and had no car so they gave me a ride to their place in Oakland. Told me to be baptized to their non denominational church the following day when I said no they proceeded to have me there for 8 hrs reading me the Bible until I said yes and they took me back, I blocked them and did not go. Sounds crazy but even my roommates were asking where I had been.
Had the same mf approach me like twice today askin bout some church shit
Sometimes I just want to let go and join a cult just so I can fake smile more and pretend things aren't what they are.
[ Removed by Reddit ]
Stay away from Thrive at Berkeley. They are part of the International Church of Christ, ICC, which is a Christian cult. If you’re looking for a Christian club to join I’d recommend Cru!
College campus are PRIME recruiting areas for cultists of all kinds. Free meditation classes are another hook. Beware anything free -- fliers and rented space cost money. Eventually you are expected to pay :) 


  The Cult Education Institute website has a first rate Group Information archive.


 https://culteducation.com/group.html  


Their message board is crammed full of info. Message board is also searchable.  Just be sure to select ""all dates"" so your query covers all 20+ years the message board's contents. 


  A common sleazy trick for cult recruitment  is for the teacher to show up later than the scheduled time. People with self respect leave. Trustful people stay. Then the event keeps them awake past scheduled bedtime. 


  Recruitment through friends is very effective. You already trust them. 


 Do background checks on any group -- fact checking makes you sexy.
stay away from a2f.berkeley
First off they're hella judgemental and all about 'teaching you' instead of learning the Bible together. To avoid them just don't talk to them or do the more extreme option and tell them to fuck off. Or do I what I do and have a slightly angry ish face and walk semi-fast.
Yes
Run for your life 🏃‍♀️
Welcome to Berkeley! 😂 Be polite, keep your distance, and you won't have problems. If they give you problems, tell them you're an apostate.
Just don’t go?
It's wild. I walked through campus bawling my eyes out, and one of them approached me, asking to join their worship group. Please read the room, clearly now is not the time to solicit. They continued to try to get me to join the group as I dabbed the tears out of my eyes.
I’m not gonna lie
I’ve had two moments where I’ve found some corner on campus and just cried my eyes out 

And both times have been discovered by someone, who then says something along the lines of “you need Jesus” and then invites me to their fellowship 

The first time it happened they seemed offended that I wanted to be alone and told me all my problems were because I was rejecting God 

The second was a girl from Gracepoint and every time she would spot me on campus from that point forward, she would approach me and keep insisting I come. 

It got to the point where she would walk across the street even if we were going different directions, and I’d run into her multiple time a week, even after I asked her nicely to stop. I still see her around campus sometimes and actively avoid her at this point over a year later. 

TLDR, just don’t engage with anyone trying to get you to join their fellowship, even if it seems like they have good intentions, and DEFINITELY don’t talk to anyone from Gracepoint. 😐
Avoid Unification church (aka Moonies), unless you are desperate for excessive brain washing.  They were a huge thing back in the mid-70's, had a compound in the wine country they'd drive you to for a ""dinner""...getting back was your problem.  I mention bc I hear they are back in town, and definitely about as deep into ""Christian cult"" territory as they get.

PS: Should have mentioned Scientology, although it's not even pseudo-Christian.  They are also well practiced at grooming and mind control leading to in-church marriages and hoards of next generation revenue generators.
All religious groups are cults \s

But really when I was a freshman I would take advantage of free food but I was constantly bothered by them afterwards so it wasn’t really worth it
going against the grain here. most clubs seeking new members table, and many of them (religious or not) are very in your face about it. i get approached a lot by the TEDxBerkeley group and they’re very aggressive. but i bet no one thinks they’re a cult based off that alone. 

“cult” has been used so loosely. you should really look up what distinguishes a cult from other belief-centered groups.
Hey op:
You got a lot of advice. Some of it even substantive. 

I think you asked a good question that hits something lots of us Christians at different times are weary of. I can imagine for non-Christians it’s at least as wearisome. Not  100% sure which you are, no offense, but sounds like you are a follower of Jesus Christ.

You mentioned you’re easily swayed. Something like that resonates with me-I’m not easily swayed but I tend to give people the time of day. I mean, sometimes I have a clear peace to avoid or shutdown people/places, but often times I hear/feel it out and pray.

I’ve engaged with and prayed with a lot of brothers and sisters in Christ at Cal. If their theology is off and you know it, it’s still sometimes nice to have that conversation. If you don’t know it, often times those conversations have encouraged me to seek Truth more, in the Word, in further study, in fellowship.

Don’t be afraid. Thats a commandment we have from one of the more popular Bible verses, the ones that folks love to put on our coffee mugs and t shirts.

God bless you in Jesus name 🫶
If you’re trying to get engaged before graduation, (non-cult) church groups are the way
Stay away from Thrive. They invite you to a “Bible study” but they ignore all your previous beliefs and try to convert you to whatever they think is right. They also use different names to make people join them.
And gracepoint has a ton of groups under different names: https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/n6ce20/church_plants_and_current_groups/

That post is old so I wouldn't be surprised if there's new ones now as well
it's not a cult if you have a disclaimer on your website that you're not a cult tho
Exactly going to your local denominational church and meeting students there is the safest bet, the two actual non culty ones I’ve seen tabling before have been orthodox and Catholic but I’m sure if you go attend one of the many churches near campus you’ll find community
Do you know of any good (aka not-cultish) churches near UC Berkeley? I’m a freshman and I would love to find a church community, but I’m scared of all the stories I’ve heard about these kinds of clubs/fellowships 
Me I left a comment about it further up, I did it for about a week until they went crazy on me
This was thrive btw also have heard bad things from Christians on Campus
You can say that again.
why? I've met with some of their members last year and they're really nice, warm people.
>in Christ at Cal

Carol?
dat christianese
St Mark’s Episcopal or any Episcopal or Methodist church
how crazy😳
I speak as a former member of Christians on Campus.

They are also often called Christian Students on Campus.

They are also sometimes called Christians at “University Name.”

These groups are associated with a denomination/sect founded by Witness Lee known as The Lord’s Recovery (a.k.a. “The Local Churches), and they often try to hide who they are. As a former officer in one of their clubs, I can testify that they would take us to trainings where they would explicitly teach us to avoid talking about Witness Lee to freshman and new members because we might scare them away and people would think we were a cult. 

They design the process of recruitment in such a way that the leading ones will probe the new students to see if they are open to Lee’s strange teachings. If they are, they’ll reveal more and more of their strange teachings. If these young ones dedicate themselves to Witness Lee’s ministry, they are considered “remaining fruit” and whoever worked on them is said to have great rewards waiting for them in heaven.

Those who are not open are not as much of a priority for very long. The strategy is to “love on them” until they become open, but after a year or two not much time is given to them if they are not interested in the teachings of Witness Lee as most of their church activities and meetings are designed to bring people into his ministry.

[Here’s the testimony of a student from Austin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/s/y2hg6X40OJ)

If anyone is interested in reading or sharing about this particular group or seeing the testimonies of others, [there’s also a forum online which has a thread](http://localchurchdiscussions.com/vBulletin/showthread.php?t=6043&highlight=Deceptions) where a few more former members speak out about the college groups associated with The Lord’s Recovery (a.k.a. “The Local Churches”).
[ Removed by Reddit ]
Thank you so much
The staff get very friendly with you and ask for your contact to invite you to more events. Some events become “invite only” so you can’t just find a flyer. They’ll give you more food, do fun activities, and do more food after that. Eventually they start to ask for more commitment and begin pressuring you to sign up for their courses or programs. You can refuse/ignore, but they will get very very persistent about it. Eventually to the point that’s the only thing they’ll bring up with you while they have normal conversations with the others who have committed. They’ll sometimes even text/call you multiple times a day or ask to meet up for coffee/lunch/dinner 1 to 1. 

The reason why the pressure so much is because they have quotas. They keep an excel sheet to track each student’s “progress”, and staff members get pressure from their “managers” to get a certain # of students into the pipeline. 

At some point, they’ll just give up and stop inviting you to events. You’ll still get newsletters and can still show up to their open events, but don’t expect them to greet you with the same level of friendliness they first showed. You’re a lost cause to them. Most students who become “lost causes” switch to another church that isn’t as predatory and fake.

From my observation, they tend to be successful with kids with a lot of trauma or are very lonely. All of a sudden you have a bunch of people who care about you and treat you like family/best friends. You get a ton of attention and have many ears willing to listen and cry with you. Also a lot of these events tend to overlap with other popular student org events like info sessions or first meetings. They’ll even do major outings on game days such as going to an amusement park or taking you camping. These kids eventually become isolated from campus life, and it becomes more difficult to leave because you have no one else if you do. You barely know your roommates, have no other friends on campus, and aren’t part of any other clubs.
If you or anyone else who stumbles upon this thread would like to know more about The Lord’s Recovery (a.k.a. “The Local Churches), there are several ex-members who have given their testimony.

Some former elders in the group:

[John Ingalls wrote a book: Speaking The Truth in Love](https://bibleread.online/all-books-by-Watchman-Nee-and-Witness-Lee/book-Speaking-the-Truth-in-Love-John-Ingalls-read-online/) where he shares regarding Witness Lee’s abuse of power over the churches through a publishing arm known as Living Stream Ministry.

[John Myer wrote a book: A Future and a Hope](https://assemblylife.com/a-future-and-a-hope/) where he laments the spiritual elitism and exclusivity of The Local Churches (a.k.a “The Lord’s Recovery). He aims to help guide ex-members in finding/forming a healthier church life after leaving that denomination/sect.

[Steve Isitt posted his testimony in an online forum called Local Church Discussions](http://localchurchdiscussions.com/vBulletin/showthread.php?t=360&highlight=Steve+isitt) where he was demonized for trying to reconcile with disillusioned ex-members and discovered that the current leaders were not giving everyone the truth about why people were leaving.

[Steve Isitt also provided a history of the group that is often hidden by current leaders](https://artemisbelt.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/a-history-of-the-lord’s-recovery-in-the-united-states1/) where he recounts financial improprieties and prominent events in Local Church history that the current leaders don’t like to talk about.

Other former members have spoken out recently, such as:

[Jo Casteel](https://www.facebook.com/44007346/posts/pfbid02wtd1xX3Dc7Es46YXAsAcskf97i7jS8QHMurqrBv9X82jovi8VSwNf9qPhvs5Fdwjl/?d=n&mibextid=qC1gEa) who raised concerns about abuses in the church and the hiding of Local Church history.

[Andrea McArdle](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1fgvANGubnVRfq-K81vH5hQmvTydLdzwsE9uO8HI0Ci4/mobilebasic) who was asked to cover up abuses in her locality.

[Here is an article](https://thecuriousfellows.wordpress.com/2023/07/21/greg-and-joanna-casteel-part-2-the-special-fellowship/) discussing Local Church leaders’ response to Jo Casteel’s letter where they demonized her for speaking up about abuse in The Local Churches. A link to the conference audio posted by The Local Churches on their website “Living to Him” is included in the article.
You’re so welcome. Lutherans and most Presbyterians are cool too, it’s basically style differences. If you stick to a well-known denomination it shouldn’t go too off the rails!
Classic predatory grooming...what happens after that?  They get you married, find you a job and milk your bank account (like scientology)?
In fact… they actually do. There’s a lot of alumni/staff who have good positions in top companies in the bay area. You keep sticking with their program for 4 years, and they’ll help you with interview prep, refer you to all your favorite companies, and ensure you get internships and find a job after graduation… but there’s obviously a catch.

Once you graduate, you get put into an “internship program”, which is *totally* voluntary (almost 90% of their graduating class signs up for it), where you live in a dormitory for a year. Everyone is assigned to “police” eachother, which means no social media, video games, using the internet outside of work, etc. Every evening you go into further training and testing, where they’ll see what your strengths and skills are. The more outgoing, friendly, and loyal graduates get sent to other franchises across the country to either support or create new ones at other campuses. The average ones get assigned to go back to campus as staff and will continue the cycle of recruiting more freshmen. The more introverted and less sociable ones play support roles such as making food, doing custodial work, driving, etc. 

Once you’re assigned, you begin to get pressure to marry to your fellow classmates. Your daily evening classes switch tones and begin to go more into marriage, relationships, courting, etc. Within 2-3 of graduation, practically the entire class has gotten married, with the church organizing and funding the whole thing. Now even though you’re married, the church comes before your spouse/family. In fact, the whole point of intermarrying was so that each spouse can police each other. Your hefty six figure salary? You better be donating all of that to the church. Your spouse will make sure of it. Want to buy a car that’s anything but a mini van for transporting freshmen? How could you be so selfish and ungodly? Start having doubts about the legitimacy of the church you’re attending? Your spouse is reporting you to church leadership, who by chance also happen to be your landlords, and they will barge in immediately for disciplinary counseling. 

You’re practically trapped into the ecosystem for life. Your whole social life, career, marriage, identity, etc. are all baked into this organization, and leaving it means becoming an outcast. Want a divorce? Well be ready to pay child support to the day you die because the church also happened to have encouraged you and your assigned spouse to have a bunch of kids early. Oh, and you’re likely not seeing your kids again because there’s many witnesses willing to say you’re an abusive parent. Want to find a new job away from your cult coworkers? Good luck finding any referrals and you better pray the next hiring manager doesn’t happen to be a member too. Maybe go back to your family back home and take a break from it all? Oh well it also happens that this cult made you break ties with your family if they weren’t 100% on board with this program. It’s likely the last time you saw them was at your wedding and you were forced to ignore all calls and messages from your distractive family. If they were 100% sold on this cult, you’re going back to more rebuke.
Sounds like you've been there did that and got the fuck out.  FWIW, it' not just Christian cults,  Same thing for Buddhists: Falun Gong...Shen Yun (buy tickets) and media channels Straight Times and NTD (check your local cable).

So many total control cults...egad."
Stories about Croads,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/il207b/stories_about_croads/,2020-09-01 23:58:14,"Since we're all stuck inside, let's share stories about the worst experience you've had at Croads so we can feel like we're not missing out on much.

Story 1: The salad bar had caterpillars (or silkworms or whatever) in it. Extra protein! This is not the worst story, because apparently it happened in New York [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/f1fz146?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and that makes it okay!

Story 2: During late nights, methinks a rat scurried across the edge of the kitchen, by where the desserts/cookies usually are during normal hours. To be fair, I was watching Ratatouille beforehand, so I might've been hallucinating that as well as the food tasting good.

BTW if any of you say ""there wasn't enough caviar"" I will kindly point you in the direction of stanford.","I got near instant diarrhea from trying out Croads porkchops. As a freshman, I didn't know they had a bathroom, so I power-walked back to my Foothill dorm and nearly gave up on the third flight of stairs it took to get to the locked gates. Stomach cramps were unbelievable.
Waiting for 40 minutes to get a burrito on burrito night which was so poorly wrapped that it fell apart by the time I brought it back to my table. 

Also there was one time the milk tasted like chemicals. And the employees refused to believe my friend and I (we both tried it) and wouldn't replace it. Somehow didn't get sick. 

As a side note, do they still make burritos? This was back in 2016.
Waited 20 minutes that evening to get into Croads and in the food line. Get to the front of the line and see they are serving baked potatoes topped with cheese and beans. The issue is...they ran out of potatoes. So, they gave us a scoop each of the cheese topping and beans topping. Did not eat a single bite and headed over to Thai Basil that night
You know how the bowls at the salad bar are all stacked on top of each other? One time I picked the top bowl off the stack to find that the next bowl underneath still had a half eaten salad in it despite somehow going through the entire washing process and being placed in the “clean” bowl stack.
There was a Mediterranean wrap and I picked one that looked like it had a fat, juicy chunk o' meat. I took a bite and there was nothing but veggies. I opened the wrap to find out that the only meat in it was a small piece hanging out of the wrap that made it look hella good initially.

I don't have a picture, but it was comical. Like the person making it lw went out of their way to bait whoever picked it ahaha.
My gosh does this only happen at croads or also at cafe 3? Alr know I’m not walking over to croads again 😳
Taco tuesday was so good i know not a roast but damn

Also got chocolate milk once that was like brown translucent water not like milk at all
I literally shitteded right after every meal.
Say what u will but at least cafe 3 has those BOMB ass tater tots
I saw a cockroach running around on the floor
you’re a soldier. i can’t even imagine doing that
Noooo we didn’t have burritos :(( was a freshman last spring semester
my worst experiences have been at cafe 3 so YMMV"
Universities that generate the most startup founders.,https://i.redd.it/vga8kupqjfx91.jpg,2022-11-01 17:11:10,,"Starting a startup is really easy cuz 99% of them fail
What is a “startup” and “founder” being defined as?
OP is with the admissions department. Applications are due this month and you know the University wants the $$$$$$.
I’m not sure I like the methodology used to calculate this. It’s easy to say “I’m a founder” and not actually have much worth writing home about.
found the founder pounder
Same picture as ""Universities that admit most people with rich families."" Easy to start a start-up with a safety net and 500k investment from family.
Now divide it by number of graduates.
As you can see, Stanford takes the cake for highest number of failed startups. Go Bears.
Not a flex, the other schools are ants compared to us in terms of student population.
Fuck yeah
Curious thing about this is Babson is not listed. It's #1 on US News list [https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-entrepreneurship](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-entrepreneurship)

That's either indicative of US News rating is crap or this listing is irrelevant.

(Leaning towards the former as I can't think of a startup founded by Babson College alums)
How many of those actually made it big?  Thousands coming out of Cal with almost nothing to show for it.
Ok so the most prohibitively expensive educational institutions. Would it be fair to say that these campuses are most likely to host students who's parents can afford a small 5mil loan to get a business off the ground?
Imagine thinking start-ups are the end all be all.
meaningless statistic
[deleted]
Can confirm current job is founded by 2 Stanford and cal alumni and my last couple jobs were founded by umich alumnis.
Correlation is not causation come on guys. Can think of a million reasons why the list looks like this that aren’t because of the university. Also jesus normalize by something?? Like at least divide by the size of the schools.
Universities with students who have wealthiest parents who can seed round their child’s whacky idea.
My onlyfans is popping off watchu mean ?
THIS. 

Thousands of startup founders and like a dozen are actually successful. Most of the people who list themselves as “startup founder” are just rich kids pissing away mommy & daddy’s money on a stupid idea so they won’t have to get a real job.
optimal methodology would be only including companies that have hit a Series A.

That’s kinda crazy, I had figured California would be investing more in public higher education than any other state, but Texas is #1 in the nation. Private schools obviously dwarf us as well. Harvard, Yale, and Stanford are #1, 2, and 3


Edit 2: the total endowment between UT and Texas A&M is $60bil, which is 5x more than the endowment of the entire UC system ($12bil) 👀

Go bears
If you are factoring on the college of engineering, Berkeley's is about 4k undergrads, which is ~2,000 less than UT Austin and ~3,000 less than Michigan. 

Apparently Stanford only has ~1,000 engineering undergrads, which is akin to Caltech. MIT has 4,600 undergrads, of whom ~70% or ~3200 are engineers.

Any division undermines the fact that there really aren't a lot of engineers in America, especially for the outsized impact that they've had on the world.
On the other hand, it's actually incredibly impressive for a **public school** to compete across the board in all categories like Berkeley does.

Being as big and inclusive as Berkeley is while still delivering Nobel Laureates, being a premier research institution, and having students going out and starting up new companies is literally incomparable. The private schools at the top can do it precisely because they are small and have incomprehensibly huge endowments, that Berkeley still competes at the top across all metrics is frankly astonishing.

I don't really think this particular stat is amazing or anything, but I also don't think that dismissing it because the other schools are smaller makes much sense either given, for example, that HBS has an MBA class that is nearly four times larger than Haas, especially considering that Business is the most common background for startup founders.

Sure, but we are small compared to access to family/alumni wealth and capital.  I think we compete pretty well for a public school…

University of Michigan, and University of Texas are public as well
Also, UC system endowment is basically mostly UCB and UCLA (each ~5B) with the rest being significantly lower. Absolutely dwarfed by other universities but providing similar outcomes, which is very impressive.
Oil
do you mean billion? you should break it down per school rather than group them together because a lot of UCs don't bring in that much money. Also divide population by how many schools are in that system and you might have more students in Texas and Michigan per University than California.
agreed. i'd like to see the source and methodology for this. Does it include the graduate level schools, MBA or just undergraduate only?
Exactly, it’s all about ratio. It makes no sense to rank them by count as they’re all different sized schools.

So students can just lie on college applications 🤔,https://i.redd.it/reu3wn2g1dz91.jpg,2022-11-11 09:53:19,,"I lied and said my passion was cycling when in fact it was Oski hentai.
A girl that got expelled from my HS for cheating THREE FUCKING TIMES in exams got into UCLA and Cal.

How? She paid her new school to make a fake transcript that covers the years she was in my HS and lied a couple more things on the applications so she looks like the best dancer in the country.

She ended up choosing UCLA because of course she wouldn’t be able to survive Cal. If she did in fact end up here I would’ve notified the admissions office. There’s no way that the admissions office can notice such lies.

Edit: my friend back in HS reminded me that she got CAUGHT 3 times, which means she could’ve just been cheating in every exam she’s ever taken
You just found out today OP?
Yes. And students always have lied. They used to get away with more outrageous shit than this. 

Club leadership is about the most minor fluff around. Most on admission committees believe it's mostly completely baked lies, unless you have tangible experiences or something that is material that came out of it, it's not that impressive. What's more impressive is what you did with that leadership.

Transfer students don't require an SAT for entrance either. I don't see the issue.
Not guna lie. Berkeley not accepting SAT is the only reason I’m here. Bombed the test couple years back.
When I was young I got really stoned and took my SAT, got a 1080. Dumb choice I know.

The past few years I've had a 4.0 in community college and got into Cal. I also currently have a 4.0 at Cal.

Did I not deserve to get in? If they based it on the SAT, there's no way I would've.

I'm grateful for Cal's holistic approach.
SAT has strong correlations to wealth. I went to a not so well off high school where the SAT was not emphasized( pre-pandemic) and was shocked to hear some schools in better areas go all out for this exam. 

https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2021/9/28/is-income-implicit-in-measures-of-student-ability
That's a fucked up thing to say
IRS don't even audit corporations.
I’m not sure about now, but when I was applying to colleges, UCs definitely audited random people. I knew 3 people who applied to UCs that were audited and asked to prove a specific part in their application (it was for a high leadership position in an organization)

yeah u def shouldn’t be in😭😭😭
does any evaluation not correlate to wealth? Wealthy people have more resources/$ to invest in their kids (school, tutoring, expensive hobbies/clubs/extra curriculars/etc). This is one of the primary reasons people strive to earn money.
GPA is even more correlated though. At least smart poor kids used to have the chance to make up for their inability to be completely devoted to a million APs(like their rich peers can) by doing well on stuff like the SAT since its just a 4 hour interval instead of a semester long one like GPA.
""but the SAT correlates to wealth""

Like extracurriculars don't correlate to wealth? The social and cultural capital of being born into a privileged family means more early professional opportunities, more selective internships, more time and money for sports/music/startups/hobbies. Congratulations, these factors all matter more now.

Like studies don't show literacy and writing ability correlates to wealth? Maybe the student whose family can pay thousands of dollars for reviewers to revise their kid's essay might be able to spin a pretty damn compelling personal statement? Maybe the student who went to high quality school systems from kindergarten to high school might have had better education and guidance on writing well? Congratulations, these factors all matter more now. 

The standardized exam is a strawman people want to eradicate to feel like they're addressing disparities, but it's going to do more harm than good because now *everything else* matters more. At the end of the day, you have to take the damn SAT yourself. Much of the disparity around preparation for standardized testing lies with the failure of public education systems to recognize their role in addressing this need. If so, standardized exams can be a better equalizer among applicants. However, we're throwing away objectivity because it makes us *feel better* about our refusal to articulate the true underlying differences in the lives of students with privilege and those without.
That’s good I guess. I’ve never heard of such a thing, though I didn’t apply to super selective colleges.

I know, fucking horrendous.
Well clearly admissions disagree and my current 4.0 would as well.
That is true! You are right, and that’s why admission officers take into account socioeconomic factors when looking at activities and extracurriculars. The issue is that the SAT was seen as “standardized” to the general population when in reality it was not.
I am only speaking from personal exp though so I'm going to see what stats are available on that.
Bingo.  This is how I got into Cal with an abysmal GPA.  90% of SAT prep can be had from a book at the public library.  If you can’t be bothered to prep at all then you suck too much to go to a good school.
Yes I agree with your points period. I cannot change the public education system myself and I’m sure if we want to improve the quality of the education it was take several years. For now, remove the standardized testing for the undergraduate level to make it fair for those who have had the public education system fail them. 
I think it’s great their is more judgment based on the individual in addition to grades without the standardized exam all socioeconomic backgrounds take that skew towards higher scores for wealthier people. 
I think it’s great that hobbies are factors that matter more, it promotes people to seek out new opportunities they may have not and I believe that is what makes a well rounded individual for applications and for life.
Also I do not think selective opportunities is correlated to success. As someone who is apart of a group on campus for underrepresented students who are low-income, there are so many opportunities for us to advance and in my opinion its almost handed to us in order to make us equal to those who have had those early professional opportunities in HS! I am so grateful that Cal has this program( think in the lines of underground scholars…, programs similar to those on campus…), I do not think I would have made it into this school without the removal of the SAT because of what I mentioned earlier about how it is skewed toward the wealthy.
I said it once, and I’ll say it again, Oski onlyfans when????
Google search, that's cute. You're gonna need Tor, a triple layer VPN and an iron stomach.

Bro ur probably a gender studies major 😭
admissions prob got a 1080 too then💀💀💀
Well, at the risk of sounding pedantic, the SAT *is* standardized. That doesn't negate the fact that wealthy people have more money to dump into tutoring/prep.  But judging scores earned on the same test that everyone took is very different than the vagaries of judging extracariculars and GPA, the later of which is highly dependent on the school/teachers/classes.

The entire point of standardized tests is to even the playing field. Unfortunately, there is no way to perfectly even the playing field, as wealthy families always have more resources to throw at whatever the judging system de jour is.

I understand your point and I don’t agree with it but I understand everyone comes from different backgrounds. I came from a poor background and will never see that exam as fair, never even was shown the generic methods of doing well on that exam like reading the questions before the passage and all that. I seen how it impacted my community negatively in the past, so I will always view that exam as unfair.

U act like ANTHRO 2AC isnt ur hardest course this semester 😭😭
Oh boy I wonder if you'll think it's *less* fair than rich applicants being born into safe and privileged communities with stellar school systems, ample extracurricular opportunities, vastly superior social and cultural capital, and more. Think outside of the SAT. Their advantages span far beyond being shown to read questions before the passage. Think of wealthy applicants being allowed to shadow in their family's clinics at an early age. Or interning at a family friend's business since childhood. The standardized exam is a strawman people want to eradicate to feel like they're addressing disparities, but it's going to do more harm than good because now *everything else* matters more. And when adcoms look at applicants' personal statements, do you not think the privileged kid who spent thousands on essay-writing assistance might do better? Or that the wealthy kid who has the time and money to do any sport, any club, any extracurricular, might have a better resume?
Those generic methods like reading the questions before the passage are usually just clever sounding but actually useless tricks prep books or prep classes teach you to seem like they're helping you, at least from my experience. I performed the best when I ignored all the dumb prep book tricks and literally just focused on understanding and being interested in the passage. I did well on my PSAT without any practice at all (I literally thought a question could have multiple correct answers) and honestly I kind of resent people who spend so much time studying for the exam.
\-\_- well now i know what it is, thanks for making me google it multiple times, you cunty cunt.
True, you need to have connections at least. But trust me it’s EASY and cheap, don’t ask me how I know( (
Yawn, it's like having a conversation with my 11 year old nephew.
U can talk all u want to abt admission rate bro, who gaf. People like u aint makin NO CHEESE. U talk all this “berkeley number 1 public school” when in reality we are a shithole thats getting rid of meritocracy. Who tf cares what the admission rate is if its lottery. All u care abt is name brand, go care abt urself first and grind and get urself ready for the real world. Look at u bro 😭
Oh boy, if you only knew, if you only knew. 

So lemme guess, leetcoder CS major that failed the CS 61A midterm?
Wrong again.
I don’t really understand your point since I know that many admission officers take into account socioeconomic factors when judging the applicant. Did they do their best despite a low income? Did they find a unique, personal, impressive EC that their well off parents not find for them? 
I don’t think that test is necessary and will always be unfair. I don’t mean to offend you if you personally dedicated a lot of time studying it in the past but I do not see the point of it. All students from all socioeconomic backgrounds being judged off 1 test that is black and white. It should not be like that and causes unnecessary stress for what is a “high score” and “low score”. Those types of exams should not matter at an undergraduate level.
I agree with your points but the main argument is that not everyone can answer those questions fairly even without prep due to not having previous exposure to these types of timed and long exams, not having access to a PSAT(my school did not have one), and like another comment said failure of the public education system, and then of course the students who can afford to get the prep for those exams who score very high
Lol, my pleasure.

Why build a wall around People's Park?,https://www.berkeleyside.org/2024/01/05/peoples-park-berkeley-wall-shipping-containers-history,2024-01-05 16:17:23,,"Protesters :: Constantly attack construction crews, tear down fences, illegal occupy and camp in the park, threaten cops, loudly proclaim they will never stop doing these things ::

""wHy DiD tHeY bUiLd A wAlL?!?!?!""
If you’ve been paying any attention at all to the past two days youd see why lmfao
We should all make comments on these ridiculous berkeleyside articles about people's park, maybe this will incentivize them to hire real journalists
Because you lot keep setting shit on fire every time the school tries to build 125 units for former homeless people and 1100 beds worth of student housing.
Is this a bot account?
That’s Fort Carol T Christ to you!
It's funny how the framing in comments like these is always that protesters and the community at large can (and implicitly should) just stop at any time but the university and their development/investment partners are just naturally and unavoidably responding to external circumstances, like a dropped object falling under gravity. 

The selective assignment of agency is a great rhetorical strategy for the selective assignment of responsibility in a conflict.
So a mass demonstration with the intention of forcing an institution to behave in a way you like better? Interesting strategy.
It pretty much is. This guy posts nothing but Berkleyside articles. Basically a return of Samses
who does the land belong to? The University.
Yeah, I think protests are great! What I don't like is when a very, very small minority uses force to try to overpower the wish of the majority.
Says the same handful of dudes showing up to spout the same handful of developer talking points on every post related to the park
Are we just using, ""I've got state backing for this piece of paper which says I can do what I want,"" as an argument here? I know it's Reddit but shit, I figured the discourse on this sub would be at least a little more sophisticated than that.
You'd think if the university was so confident the majority was on their side they wouldn't need to launch their 1000 cop operation by surprise in the middle of the night in the couple week window when the vast vast majority of the Cal community is out of town. It gives ""Friday night news dump""
“Developer talking points” lol
Really?
Who?
Uh yeah that’s how it works
Shut up before I come over to ur house and claim it’s mine
Do you know how the world works or are you a literal baby?
wtf? Are you using a state baked paper as money? Or is it not sophisticated enough for you
It takes a few violent people to make things go ugly very fast. The university tried to do it repeatedly but the bunch of animals destroyed the fences and attacked the machines.   


Very similarly to Jan 6th, a small number of sore losers cannot stand the fact that the majority do not share their opinion and decide to destroy things.
Hey, only one side has an entire PR team full of professionals making 6 figures
I mean, you can go look through all the recent park posts and see for yourself
I assume you'd be one of the midwits talking about the Magna Carta a few hundred years ago as a reason why liberal republicanism is impossible 🙄
😱
See my response to the other midwit
Well it definitely sounds like you're coming at this from a dispassionate, objective perspective so I'm sure your analysis of the mood is sound. 

Also the election was never in jeopardy from those handful of loons. They made a scene and a mess. But it's hardly as if they were in anywhere close to a position to change the actual outcome. Because they didn't represent anything close to a majority position.
Whoa! Six figures? Where do I get my check, bud? Do I have to like submit a form or what?
I can?
What are you even trying to argue? That written contracts are inherently not valid? 

You sound like a middle schooler going through a rebellious phase. 

You think you’re making some deep points that us normal folks can’t understand but you’re just coming across as an ignorant, pretentious child who doesn’t understand the way the real world functions.
Yes I'm passionate about it. How does that change anything?  


Same thing happened with people's park - that mob did not achieve anything besides breaking stuff. The ""park"" is being torn down and housing will be built. I guess they are very similar situations after all
Six more figures than the people you seem to assume are expertly and with ulterior motives manipulating the message from the other side. Curious how that works
So once again, if the university was so confident the majority was on their side, you'd think they wouldn't need to keep their plan secret and wait until the tiny window when the whole population that mostly supports them according to you was out of town.
Hang on, so do I get paid or not? Are you paying me or is someone else? I'm thoroughly confused now. 

Just tell when I'm getting that six figures!
Again, they are having to do this because of a small minority of violent protesters, not because of the majority of the student body.
This makes no sense at all. You recognize that a small but violent and vocal minority can cause issues and damage - Jan. 6. Yet at the same time you believe a small minority can never cause any damages or holdups because, if the majority supported the university, then the construction should go on without a hitch?
I understand that's what the official narrative is from the extremely well trained and compensated PR professionals. I don't believe it necessarily reflects reality. 

I also think you/the university PR team and I probably have very different definitions of the word ""violent.""
Lol, I guess you do not go to berkeley. I have never met a single person that doesn't strongly support housing being built there.   


Is this not violent to you?

""but they reached a peak shortly after 12:30 p.m. after protesters began tearing down fencing erected around the park’s perimeter.""  


""protesters had ripped down most of the security fencing, reoccupied the park and halted construction efforts before they began smashing windows and mechanical components on several bulldozers and earthmovers. Multiple vehicles and pieces of equipment had wires clipped, spark plugs removed and unknown materials dumped into gas tanks.""

""University police said they received reports of aggravated assaults related to activists throwing objects such as rocks, bottles and glass at workers trying to set up for construction.""
That's not a ""narrative"". You and your friends keep doing violent crap because you don't like what the school is doing, even though it's perfectly within its legal rights. So the school took measures to make it harder for you and your violent friends to do damage and you're mad about this.

Let's not pretend like we all don't understand exactly what's going on here. You know that we don't support you or your cause. You know that we are the overwhelming majority of both Berkeley residents and Cal students. (I happen to be both.) You don't have the support of the community. We don't want you and we don't want your ""park"".

So why are you trying to shove your hippie paradise down our throats? What makes you so special that you can decide for us what should happen to this plot of land? Even if you assume that this is a ""community resource"" and not private university property, why do you think that you know better than us - the community in question?

We don't want your open air drug market and homeless encampment. Leave us alone with this bullshit and let the school build a dorm for 1100 students and housing for 125 formerly unhoused people. Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Not anywhere near as violent as what the police did to actual people, as opposed to objects, no. And even still a far cry from anything happening right now. 

And I'd suggest maybe this sub/your friend group might be a bit of an echo chamber? Check out insta for the opposite side of the coin. Something tells me you'd have no problem labeling that an out of touch echo chamber.
>you don't like what the schools is doing, even though it's perfectly within its legal rights. So the school took measures to make it harder for you and your violent friends to do damage and you're mad about this. 

So I suppose you support, for example, the Putin government tracking down and punishing draft dodgers? Since, after all, the draft is completely legal under Russian law. 

>You know that we don't support you or your cause. You know that we are the overwhelming majority of both Berkeley residents and Cal students. 

So where are you? I see supporters of the park online and in real life. I see supporters of the developers on Reddit and wearing cop uniforms.
I love that you think reality is an echo chamber. I don't have instagram, so I won't be checking that, but my claim was always that the majority supports building housing there, not that everyone does, so if I have to go to a specific place to find people who don't support it, I think my claim stands.   


The police did not start the violence, the police responded to violence. They are 100% on the right.
I passed by your ""protest"" today. The same 20 burnouts from 20 years ago plus 20 new Cal freshmen that you all managed to con into being there. 

Come on, dude. You know full well that your numbers halve every 5-10 years. No one believes you anymore. You lied too many times. 

The school is funding 125 beds for the formerly unhoused and 1100 acutely needed student beds. Almost everyone in this town and school support this project. Every time you all throw another fit and burn or break some shit around that ""park"" you turn another 5-10% of Berkeleyans from passive supporters of this project into ardent ones."

Disgusting! They exceed their requested amount and thank the donors by asking for more. This genuinely craps me out!
What’s this?
Was boutta say
I’d blame Google as well. Can’t they just cut us a better deal given how much they benefit from Berkeley’s graduates and research 🤷🏻‍♂️
They're building that new CS and DS building. That's estimated to cost like $200 million or something. And maintaining all the buildings on campus costs millions a year. Also, professors and many administrators have 6-figure salaries, and there's hundreds of them at Berkeley. So that's where all that money goes. It's why all these schools have massive endowments.
New faculty positions is good for students - helps reduce the ratio of teachers to students which in many cases is very very high.  This gives students better access to their teachers and it gives faculty more time to pay attention to individual students.
I took that to mean new professors which to me is exactly what universities should be spending their money on. Even non teaching positions bring better research
New CDSS building is $550 million
https://sfyimby.com/2023/07/construction-progress-for-uc-berkeleys-gateway-building.html
Well they didn’t  say adding CS faculty positions.
I don’t think that number of high-level faculty is the biggest issue, they’re not that involved in the daily education anyways
I mean of course we need new professors, I just didn’t think we need to bring more at a faster rate than we currently are
Exactly, makes my pointer even stronger
Ok, but I don’t think it makes them dickheads? Like if they’re gonna spend the money instead of save it this is probably the best possible way to do it rather than admin raises or football or whatever else they could spend it on
Campus cleaning/beautification, better/more teaching assistants, housing, etc
Campus cleaning/beautification: I don’t really see the need. If you’re talking about people’s park they’ve had funding for that for ages. The campus proper is very pretty? I don’t really see any issues.

More TAs: I actually rather disagree with this. Grad students sure, but that would count as more funding to graduate programs which is already in the list. Hiring adjuncts to do the job of full professors for half price is really abusive, & the whole adjunct system in general tends to be abusive.

Housing: again, the issue is land not money for this. We already have the money for the people’s park project. Where else do you want to build housing? Should the size of the student body really keep going up?
Yeah as in TAs I meant grad students

The campus imo relies too hard on its architecture bc that's the best part, but it definitely feels a bit messy/disorganized compared to other top schools I've seen (cracks in the road, stained concrete, etc)

I would also prefer that more money is invested in our education to allow more space in courses but that's a separate problem. 

I would be in favor of cutting size of the student body to manage this"

Oski isn’t so much a mascot as he is a force of nature. He is Berkeley made manifest. Much like trolls being crude and imperfect mockeries of Ents, the UCLA Bear is just a material,  powerless imitation of the symbol of true depth and meaning. Oski vs Joe Bruin is like Pericles fighting Achilles: a mortal fighting a greater being from a greater age imbued with divinity. 

So no Joe Bruin would not win. 

>But honestly, Oski has that crazy/loco vibe and might just go ape shit on his opponent.  

You know Oski mad schemin and has a Campanile dagger hidden in his ass. Don't fuck with crazy people, Oski will fuck everyone up. His lower center of mass and fat ass would box out Joey Bruin 10/10. 
Oski would dad-dick Joe Bruin

Why are they in an auto workers union 😂🤣😂🤣
What happens when a PI runs out of funding? Say a PI has 8 employees being funded, and grants etc expected to cover expenses for the next 2 years. They are hoping to get grants in the future, but at least there is a plan for 2 years. Now in the next few months their expenses will go up perhaps 20% to fund what the union wants. Do they fire 2 people now to ensure the rest get 2 years, or does everyone lose their job in 19 months?

Unlike industry, this is a zero sum game, as income is dependant mainly on NIH grants

The UC-AFT strike last year didn't even end up happening because the university caved the night before, but there's no way of knowing. The more pressure on the university, hopefully, the shorter the strike will need to be.
My bet is the UC system will oblige on Monday and latest by Wednesday. I think this'll be done by the week which shows the power of unions and striking.

I'm a ugsi here that's going on strike.

I'm fairly sure you should still go to class/ continue learning. You are also not protected by any law or policy from the consequences of not going to class, unlike us not going to work.

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yqasww/how_should_undergrads_approach_the_strike/
Undergraduate reader here who's also going on strike. In our whole department pre-strike meeting, I made it clear that all the undergrads will have no choice but to attend classes if the instructors insist to do so, especially if attendance is part of our grade. All of my graduate/postdocs colleagues agreed that we are in a totally different and more vulnerable situation and even crossed out the portion of the letter to the faulty that says that all the workers in the department will skip all classes. 

Don't get me wrong, I stand in solidarity with my colleagues (and myself) 100% and voted to no have classes in every class whose instructor chose to respect a vote from the students. However, I will say with confidence that if you must cross the picket line to keep up with the class and save your grade (especially if you are actually struggling in a particular class), all of us will
understand. 

It means the world for us the academic workers if all of you can convince your non-GSI instructor to cancel classes, and we cannot thank you enough if you stand in solidarity with us to not attend, but if skipping classes means getting an unsatisfactory grade for you or causing undue hardship in keeping up with the course materials, allow me to ask you to not do that. You should definitely always take care of yourself before you take care of others.
I think it depends on the class. At least two of my classes are cancelled in solidarity but I haven't heard from the ones without a GSI
from what I've heard yes
Because they’re about to drive UC campus’s crazy
I think in the short term, GSIs are unlikely to be fired. 61% of NIH dollars go to fund overhead costs, rather than the specific grant. I’m guessing the extra costs could come out of that, if it came to it.
Ideally the university would find ways to cut overhead on grants to make up the difference. In any case, it's not the GSRs' job to find the money to pay them; it's the job of university management who get paid 6 figures to manage the budget and make sure they can pay all their suppliers. 

If university management cannot find ways of paying the people who actually write the grants and generate that income a living wage, then they have failed as managers and administrators. PIs and groups will leave, and Berkeley will slowly lose its status as a top research university.
The idea isn’t to harm the students. It’s to put pressure on the university. If you’re a tuition-paying undergrad who’s mad about the strikes, you should be mad at UC for relying on exploitative labor practices rather than at grad students for demanding a better deal. You can express that anger by writing to campus administration, but expecting us to just keep taking a raw deal isn’t the solution you think you need.
“We’re bargaining in good faith, the union is just being outrageous” honestly just got me so angry
And it is the UC’s choice to rely so much on graduate students labor. If they can’t afford to pay all their workers fairly, they are taking advantage of them which ultimately harms the quality of undergrad education.
Go back into the fucking hole you crawled out of.

It is within their rights to fight for higher wages and better treatment through collective bargaining. This wouldn't be an issue if the UC system didn't neoliberalize and race to the bottom in their grotesquely unfair labor practices.
Then don’t go here. It was your choice to apply to a UC that underpays their graduate student workforce.
Don’t be lame you dingus. You dont switch phd programs like you switch a software engineering job.
I also hope the strike is short, impactful and ""successful"", but what does it mean?

oblige on what? Raising the ""floor"" pay for TA/GSR from $27K to $54K? (All grad students in STEM depts. already get $30-35K, by the way). Or raising it to $28K? Or is it just coming back to negotiating table, whatever that means?  
Just wondering what does ""victory"" look like to everyone?
this\^
Cool. My prof originally canceled class on Monday, as he needs the GSI to set up the screens and PA, but then told us today that he's not allowed to cancel the class and he will be there on Monday. A fellow student told me afterward that the school was expecting us to cross the picket line then. So, I wasn't sure.
GSI's or UGSIs aren't paid by research funds / grants for their instructing, they are paid out of department budgets.  Each class has a budget to hire course staff.

GSRs are paid by grants, so that part is correct.  

Overhead does not  go to fund GSRs whose PI ran out of money.  It is a mystery (to me) where that money goes, but definitely not towards funding undergraduate education.  Overhead rates are set by the gov't and are meant to reimburse the university for costs of doing research (buildings, admin, etc etc) NOT for teaching.

In the case of a GSR whose PI ran out of money, they would have to find a PI that has money, or be a GSI and teach, or they will be ""fired"".  During the '08 recession, I know some grad students (GSRs) that were asked to take pay cuts due to their PI not having enough grants.
or the PI can just fire a couple of postdocs, have a smaller lab, and everyone continues on as before. Knowing human nature, what do you think will happen?

A lab is essentially a non-profit small business, and PI's are given little, if any training in the business side of managing a lab. And there is little oversight and mentoring
I’m not a student and support the cause don’t get me wrong, I’ve also just dealt with American organizations enough to know that they never get screwed, they screw the little guy. Students should make it clear they also aren’t footing the bill for this I wasn’t trying to be a naysayer
well, the union is being a little outrageous. If you read through the examples of what union calls ""unlawful behavior"", its just multiple examples of departments trying to \*increase\* GSR steps or provide additional fellowships/bonuses for their graduate students and postdocs over the past year or more, and UAW objecting that it undercuts their attempts at negotiation.
[deleted]
Meeting in the middle.
Yea, you can face academic consequences for not going to class. However, I do want to note that Senate (ie tenure track) faculty ARE allowed to respect the picket line. See guidance from the Council of UC Faculty Associations: https://cucfa.org/2022/11/faqs-for-senate-faculty-about-uaw-strike/.
Thanks for clarifying... and you're right, I was thinking of GSRs, not GSIs. I also agree that the overhead is a mystery, but I guess I was thinking/assuming that presumably some of that overhead could be moved around to bail out a PI if he/she really got into trouble and was going to have to lay off people... but maybe that's too optimistic?
I think part of the overhead does go towards funding the researcher (e.g. towards health insurance and all the other benefits the union is asking for).
How do you think a lab is funded? Fewer postdocs + fewer grad students = fewer proposals, fewer grants. You'd lose the ability to cost share on expensive and specialized equipment since you have fewer projects to use them. It's the start of a death spiral.

But yeah, I separate the PIs from the ""admins"". You'd be surprised at how many PIs are either on the side of the strike or just view it as an annoyance - usually, they just want the research to get done, and for the GSRs and postdocs to have the necessary work environment to do their work. It's HR and upper administration who actually want to exploit labor and pay poverty wages.
Yeah, it’s unlawful. All grad students deserve the same compensation, we work the same and put in the same effort. Moreover, the university is giving raises to non-unionized employees as a union busting tactic.
Other schools pay even less in most cases. My PhD program at Berkeley pays about 35K, my other offers elsewhere payed 25-30. “Just go somewhere else” isn’t helpful commentary
You’re quite stubborn about bootlicking to the UC administration. Do you even go to this school bro?
>https://cucfa.org/2022/11/faqs-for-senate-faculty-about-uaw-strike/

technically, instructors/faculty who are not represented by UAW are obligated to continue their professional responsibilities and are do not have any protections in case of joining ""solidarity"" strike. Sure they have tenure, but not performing your teaching obligations is ""dereliction of duty"". I doubt anyone will lose tenure over refusing to teach classes for a couple of weeks, but just like TAs,GSIs, GSRs should not be paid if they decide not to do the work, faculty can lose their pay if they decide not to perform the duties that university is paying them for.   


Undergraduates (and their parents) pay tuition and expect a high level of educational experience in return. UC administration insists on ""educational continuity"" - ask faculty if they are willing to forego their salaries - or tenure for the sake of ""solidarity"", or if undergrads are willing to accept ""F"" grades in their classes (or losing financial aid or delaying their graduation), while paying tuition, for not showing up to the quizzes/finals for the sake of ""solidarity"" with TAs?
Benefits come out of the base budget (grants for GSRs or department for GSIs) just like salary and tuition remission.  Then for gratns, there is overhead on top of that.
> offers elsewhere *paid* 25-30. “Just

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Man I remember when I was going to Cal one guy died at initiation or whatever it was called due to alcohol poisoning I think. They carried him out and put him on the neighboring lawn bc they didn’t want to get a strike and get their frat revoked. I wasnt there but students blew it up on social media so I did see the video of someone getting dumped on a lawn. This was around 2015/2016. Pretty crazy stuff be careful out there y’all

They prolly made their pledges drink raw sewage or something idk frats be crazy sometimes
Someone who is not me in SAE was there in summer 2020 when COVID was going around. admin was pretty pissed about the parties, understandably. some sort of warning. Fast forward to Fall 2021 when a new pledge was at a party super late, everybody pretty wasted. someone dares him to drink beer through a garden hose in his butt idk, like a smaller diameter hose with the metal part cut off (!!!???). i wasnt there. anyway, long story short he did it but got minor injuries and had to go to tang or alta bates or something which must have been the stupidest most embarassing shit in the world. promised not to tell anyone but later told like his still in high school gf (i think) who was super pissed and somehow kicked off a whole investigation. given the whole covid thing plus this new infraction there were all these hearings. ended up not being able to prove anything about the weird hose thing, but got nailed on alcohol for minors lol, like tax fraud for drug kingpins.
When I was running around 6:30 am midweek last week I saw a group of guys running in normal clothes, with some obvious leaders telling the rest to kick it up a notch. My first thought was that it was a pledge class
Yeah, if we could just phase out hazing to join these ridiculous fraternities. That’d be great.
I am willing to bet that someone got dropped and then snitched on the hazing (as they should)
Butt stuff
If Berkeley was truly serious about upholding its image as a paragon of liberal values they would do away with the frat system entirely.  Frats around the nation have an extensive track record of rapes, sexual assaults, hazing deaths, bullying, and racism.  Berkeley frats are no exception.  Every year there's a protest outside Fiji or similar frats with women exclaiming they were assaulted there.  For a school that prides itself in being anti-racist, pro-feminist, and progressive in general, it's completely ironic that it allows institutionalized bastions of everything they purportedly stand against to continue operation.
As a former frat boy myself, glad to see this happening. Clean up the hazing and make frats more inclusive.
All Berkeley frats haze so this is not a surprise to me
Burn down all the frats already
Yea apparently it was over a limp biscuit. Not the band, what the band was named after. A bunch of frat bros sit in a circle and jerk off onto a cracker. The last one to bust their load needs to eat it. Sometimes it’s played with a wheat thin
What does it even mean to be ""recognized"", and how does a uni ""revoke recognition""? 

I personally think frats are silly, but if a group of dudes want to live with each other in a house, and call themselves a club (named using a few random greek letters), what business is that of the university? How does ""not being recognized"" effect them?
[removed]
You typically need to do much more than drink to get banned
There are few things in life worth drinking raw sewage for... joining a frat is absolutely not one of them.
Former cal Greek here, fuck SAE I thought they were already suspended
Lmao this story is just 100% fake. Someone kicked out of SAE snitched on the hazing
username checks out
Sounds like ROTC lmao
Rush hasn’t started yet. So probs not

Edit: pledging starts after rush so it’s very unlikely it’s pledging
Lmao last week was New Years. Everyone is off.
[removed]
I mean, frats like Fiji aren't recognized by the university. They can't recruit on campus or get sponsorship, but its not like the university can do anything about them owning a house.
> If Berkeley was truly serious about upholding its image as a paragon of liberal values

The campus and the University itself are, like most institutions, quite conservative because it helps with avoiding risks.  While the student body may want the University to stand for something politically, the campus stands for education first, innovation second, and survival third.

As noted by the article there are only 11 Greek groups that are not recognized by the University, but there are 58 that are.  Those organizations help the University by providing benefits to students including mentorship, networking, and socializing that the University itself cannot provide in the same manner.  Those networks and mentoring allows for more graduates of the university to not only be successful later in life but to have positive feelings about the University and therefore to encourage them to keep contact and to donate in the future.  In a world where the state has abandoned its responsibility to properly fund the higher education of the youth of California, the Greek system has tangible benefits for the University and therefore the greater student body rather than shutting it down.  Hundreds of students are a part of the Greek community every year, but the donations and fundraising that comes back from the thousands of Greek alumni help support initiatives and student experiences for thousands of Cal students every year.  It would be short-sighted, foolish, and ignorant for the University to take such steps.

On the other hand as others have noted, the University has no real power to do anything about these unrecognized fraternities.  This is not a private university which owns all the land, this is a public university and the Greek groups own their own private property in the city.  They all exist physically off-campus, and the City of Berkeley is not going to do anything about them because the national organizations pay their rent on time and have a lot of legal support to protect them.
I never thought I'd defend frats in my life. If a frat has a culture that encourages rape, then it should be nuked off the face of the earth. The problem is college campuses are strife with sexual assault. Rapists will still go to college even if frats are eliminated.
You’re right, Berkeley is a paragon of Liberal values, not leftist values, so they will never take any substantial action on any of the real issues with frat culture you list
I was in a fraternity with many lgbt brothers that didn’t do any of that shit and stayed in good standing. You know that rape happens at Co-ops too right?
does cal really try that hard to portray itself as liberal?
[removed]
you’re absolutely correct. being recognized just makes it easier for the organization to do things on campus and use campus resources - people wouldn’t want to join some random group of kids in a house, but if it was recognized as a legitimate community by berkeley, maybe a little more so
Tons of other student and athletics orgs throw parties... They aren't locked behind Greek life.
> I just wish there was an easy way to make friends in college and have fun

Snooroar, you know you have serious work to do if you want anything like this to happen.
True, also parents are not allowed to enter rooms in the dorms unless accompanied by the student. They can’t just walk in without the students knowledge.
What are those things in life worth drinking raw sewage ? 🤔🤔
I believe that is the point of the story. They are mocking frats.
Maybe but they were wearing jeans and shit. And not running well. And doesn’t ROTC usually require the people that get the group across intersections to wear reflective jackets?
This is probably due to long ongoing investigations though
 Ok thanks I know nothing about the timing of Greek life
It was on the 5th or 6th. There are definitely people back, just not everyone
I mean…as far as I know fraternities offer connections and networking so there is some good to them
Non-sequitur on the co-ops.  Has nothing to do with frats.  And the incidence of sexual assault is nowhere near that of frats, I can guarantee that.
Except that some frats were started to be inclusionary as a reaction to the exclusionary ones. You’re ignorant.
The first thing people do at Uni is live with a bunch of random people in a big 'house' (i.e. dorm). A frat is basically just an off-campus version of that living situation. If you'd like to keep living in a big group subject to strict and constant university oversight, why not just keep living in the dorms. For those who enjoy the group living situation without the same level of university supervision, an unrecognized frat seems like the way to go. What 'campus resources' are available to recognized frat members that are not available to UCB students not in a fraternity?

Good statement, don't see the issue. If the issues were reversed, there would be a different reaction coming from students reading this who may feel this is bs.

Disclaimer: I am in no way stating I support or do not support this speaker, their history, their message, etc.
Me from halfway across the globe: the fuc dey doin over there
Deeply strange that the statement suggests the protesters violated the first amendment rights of the speaker. I understand that the popular meaning of “free speech” works that way, but this is the head of a university - you should speak precisely and accurately.
Can you share the full email? (Alum not current student)
Yes, a good response.
I agree with Carol’s statements in the email. She didn’t say that students’ aren’t representation of school. She just addressed that they support First amendment, but the violence in the name of protest on campus violates others free speech as well.
She doesn't say if there will be disciplinary consequences for those involved.
A speaker from Israel should not be allowed on campus atm. Israel is committing genocide. The speaker is a member of the IDF. He is a murderer. He should not be allowed on campus. Hypocrisy at its finest UC Berkeley. Fuck you.
Honestly, I'm ashamed to be associated with this school. At least it helped me land a great job. That's all I got out of this place.
the students who protested and broke down doors just because the speaker was israeli… are not a reflection of the school’s values. or even basic values.
I'm too lazy to google it, so I'll just ask here. Wtf does she even do besides writing half-assed emails that she often has to self-correct by writing another one immediately after?
“please i really wanna keep my job” headass
Hopefully this president also resigns given clear mis handling of situation. Where was the police. I don’t buy anything regarding to delayed response. What if this was an active shooter incident. Do student groups need to hire their own private security. What if they did here and lethal force, which would be justified, was used against an aggressive protestor. 

University is in part to blame here

Dear campus community,  
   
We write to you today with great sadness, concern, and dismay in the wake of an incident on our campus last night, an incident that violated not only our rules, but also some of our most fundamental values. Our purpose is not just to inform our community about what happened. We are writing with the hope that we can and will come together in defense of our Principles of Community that safeguard free speech, diversity of perspective, and the ties that bind this community together.  
   
Last night an event was scheduled featuring a speaker from Israel, who had been invited to campus by some of our student organizations. Minutes before the event was to start, a crowd of some 200 protesters began to surround the building. Doors were broken open and the protesters gained unauthorized entry to the building. The event was canceled, and the building was evacuated to protect the speaker and members of the audience.  
   
We want to express our deep remorse and sympathy to those students and members of the public who were in the building, fearing for their safety. Today, like last night, our colleagues in Student Affairs are reaching out with offers of support and we are urging students to report what they witnessed and experienced to UCPD and/or our Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination. We share your anger and concern, and we understand that we must do all that we can to prevent anything like this from happening again.  
   
Due to safety concerns, we worked with the hosting organization to move the event to a different location, one that was believed to be more secure. We also stepped up security and sent a team of UCPD officers to the event. We approach events like this with two priorities: to do what we can so that the event can go forward, and to do what we can to safeguard student safety and well-being. Last night, despite our efforts and the ample number of police officers, it was not possible to do both given the size of the crowd and the threat of violence.  
   
We are committed to responding to violations of our “Time, Place, and Manner” rules. We deeply respect the right to protest as intrinsic to the values of a democracy and an institution of higher education. Yet, we cannot ignore protest activity that interferes with the rights of others to hear and/or express perspectives of their choosing. We cannot allow the use or threat of force to violate the First Amendment rights of a speaker, no matter how much we might disagree with their views. We cannot allow the use or threat of force to imperil members of our community and deny them the ability to feel safe and welcome on our campus. We cannot cede our values to those willing to engage in transgressive behavior.  
   
We will in the days ahead decide on the best possible path to fully understand what happened and why; to determine how we will address what occurred; and to do everything possible to preclude a repeat of what happened.  
   
The attack on the building, and on the event, was an attack on the fundamental values of the university, which are also essential to maintain and nurture open inquiry and an inclusive civil society, the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation. We are now, and will remain in the future, committed to Free Speech as essential to our educational mission, our institutional identity, and the strength of our community. We hope for your support as we seek to protect and preserve our Principles of Community.

Oh stop. You do realize your little reply is half assed
You realize she's retiring at the end of the term, right?
Tbh UCPD are always very slow at responding. A while ago (maybe last week?) there was a guy shooting randomly on Sproul Plaza and WarnMe didn’t even send a message until that shooter was caught. Gladly no one was hurt. Also, there was a mentally disabled guy smashing everything at that Shuttack Target. When I called 911 they said they weren’t available. It took them more than 30 min to show up. The police is apparently not as efficient as what we think and an active shooter will definitely screw everyone up💀
…what do you mean lethal force was justified…
Where were the police? One of Bears for Palestine’s complaints in their Instagram post is the police presence that was already there. Also saying lethal force was justified here is insane
*looks around for the government*


What are you talking about?

Free speech does not deny you any consequence. If you say, “i hate coconuts” and a bunch of people show up to protest you hating coconuts…you all exhibited free speech.

The government didn’t intervene. The people did. The people are free to tell you to eat hog shite. : /

i would suggest you do a quick check to see who your right to freedom of speech defends you from.
I would also suggest you realize that EVEN FREEDOM OF SPEECH, LIKE ALL RIGHTS, HAS IT’S LIMITS.
I wouldn't put it past them...
They may reflect the school but are in no way representative of it
If you call 911 from a cell phone, you'll typically get routed to a CHP or regional call center, who then routes you to your local jurisdiction. Even then, the Target is BPD jurisdiction, not UCPD. UCPD can respond, but they're not necessarily primary, to my understanding. 

The shooter situation, UCPD and BPD were on site in less than 3 minutes and apprehended the guy immediately. Most departments aim for around a 5-6 minute response time, but that's still generally not achieved or realistic, with many major cities having response times in the double digits. Being on-site any faster than that basically requires an accident of happening to be in the area.
UCPD literally arrested the shooting suspect within 2 minutes lol. The Shattuck target is BPD jurisdiction too, not UCPD.
Do you know that the police apprehended the suspect immediately? The warnme timing does not reflect the police response time to the emergency. UCPD did a great job.
Do you know that the police apprehended the suspect immediately? The warnme timing does not reflect the police response time to the emergency. UCPD did a great job.
Why? If you have an angry mob charging after you. Then yea if you end up cornered you are entitled to use lethal force to defend oneself.
[deleted]
Oh I see. That’s good to know
Clearly lethal force was nowhere even close to necessary in this scenario, since we can see there were only one or two injuries with none being used
Yes, you’re right, let’s all sit down with out hands together and demand decency…in the face of genocide. 


:S. I really need you to understand what a protest is. The government is limited in what it can do. I’m sure you’re one of the imbeciles who believe protesting is you running to get a sign off from the local police department to do a protest in a specific area with cute little signs and police escorts.

""UC Berkeley is employing a war criminal"".

Whether someone is a criminal is determined by a court. Did a court try him?  If yes, did a court find him guilty?  If yes, did he appeal and lose that appeal, determining it to be a fair trial?

My understanding is that the answers are ""no"", ""no"", and ""no"" respectively.

Your post should read ""UC Berkeley is employing SOMEONE WHO I THINK SHOULD BE TRIED FOR war crimes."". It's great that you have an opinion.  Thankfully, in the US today, someone's opinion is not enough to convict a person of a crime.

To read an account of the methods used in the interrogations of the Guantanamo Bay detainees

And to read about the content of the so called “Torture Memos”
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Memos
I would the invite you to think on what freedom of thought, expression, and speech mean, especially in the context of a public official, whose words and decrees shape policy. Did Lincoln free the slaves? Did Stalin kill hundreds of thousands of Poles? Did bin Laden topple the World Trade Centers? Or was it the pen in their fingers, giving direction to those who carried out the act, which has made each responsible for those things?

I think that there is a material difference between a law professor in a journal, writing an opinion on torture, which one might disagree with, and a Deputy Assistant Attorney General who is writing *the* opinion which will become *the* policy.
I don’t think he should be removed for the charge. I think that he should be removed for his actions. Actions which lead to the torture and death of people detained in Guantanamo Bay and other US detention sites around the globe. 

I think that your example regarding a person being proven innocent begs the question. He hasn’t been “proven innocent.” There are documents and reports you can read for yourself. He gave recommendations in an official capacity, those recommendations were followed, and people suffered. I don’t think those actions should be protected, by the courts or the university. But I think I can more effectively petition for a change here than I can petition for a war crimes tribunal."
Tragic Student Passing - Email from Chancellor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hcpnus/tragic_student_passing_email_from_chancellor/,2020-06-20 09:59:23," Dear campus community,

Some of you are aware of the tragic death earlier this week of third-year UC Berkeley student Seth Smith. Seth was walking near his off-campus apartment on Dwight Way on Monday evening when he was shot and fatally wounded. 

Seth was 19 years old, majoring in economics, and was due to graduate in spring 2021. He came to UC Berkeley from Clarksburg, CA.

This is a senseless tragedy that affects all of us as a campus where the growth and development of our students underpins our entire mission. We offer our deepest sympathy to Seth’s family, friends, teachers, fellow students, and our community. 

This news will undoubtedly raise concern about community safety. UCPD and the Berkeley Police Department (BPD) have responsibility for patrolling campus property and the city, respectively, and share a deep commitment to public safety. BPD is investigating the incident and is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of all responsible suspects. BPD asks anyone with information about Seth’s killing to call the Homicide Unit at (510) 981-5741 or the department’s 24-hour non-emergency line at (510) 981-5900.

We realize this is a difficult time for those of you who knew Seth. It is important to know that individuals may express their grief differently and we need to respect the different ways people react and support each other in the days and weeks ahead. Many of you may have had a close relationship with Seth and are feeling a sense of loss and disbelief. Others, like many of us, are experiencing stress, grief and anxiety related to the coronavirus pandemic and the recent murders of George Floyd, Riah Milton, and other Black Americans. 

Many of you will get comfort from your friends, family, spiritual leaders or other student groups. We also invite you to talk to a counselor at University Health Services (UHS) if you are concerned about yourself or anyone else in your community. There is also information online regarding grief and loss:[ http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/home/news/copingwithtrauma.shtml](http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/home/news/copingwithtrauma.shtml). 

Counselors at UHS at the Tang Center are available for urgent concerns: Counseling and Psychological Services[ website](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/caps) or 510-642-9494 (after hours counseling line 855-817-5667 ).

Please also reach out to the[ Dean of Student office](https://deanofstudents.berkeley.edu/about/contact-office-hours), and see the Dean of Students[ well-being resources](https://deanofstudents.berkeley.edu/well-being), should you need any additional support or have questions. 

Sincerely, 

Carol Christ

Chancellor","I wish they had included some more information about Seth and included a short obituary to honor him, perhaps with some comments by loved ones. As a human being Seth is more than his age and major and this email was an opportunity to share a piece of him with the campus community.

I feel like they didn't need to bring up George Floyd in an email honoring a Cal student. The two are completely unrelated, and frankly I think it is pretty disrespectful to bring him up.
I don't understand all the administration hate. There is a reason to point out it was off-campus. This is because the school and UCPD is not responsible for the events that happen off its property. It is also not the responsibility of UC Berkeley to make Berkeley safer; that is the responsibility of the City of Berkeley. As clearly stated in the email, the Berkeley Police Department, not UCPD is taking point because it was off-campus. You want to make your voices heard on public safety? Then send emails to the Berkeley City Council and sit in on their townhalls and meetings.
What a terrible response from Chancellor Christ.....they completely ignore concerns about public safety
What happened to Seth was devastating and tragic. Such a senseless death. I really hope there's justice in this. I know it won't bring him back, but the POS who did this is still out there somewhere and that isn't right.

:( Rip Seth Smith
Just LOL that she feels it necessary to mention George Floyd and the murder of black Americans when we're talking about a white kid who was needlessly and randomly shot in the back of the head. And everyone knows it's 99% likely the murderer was a black fella moved to rage and violence due to the relentless George Floyd media campaign. I mean that's really something else when you have to pay fealty to the very thing that caused the murder.
>Seth was walking near his off-campus apartment

Of course they emphasize this.
Fuck you chancellor for disrespecting Seth smith by bringing up others.
I sometimes take a break and stop at that location doing uber on the side. to get some walk time in.  Its so hard to believe that this area would have this. lets face it. our country has changed and threat of violence is everywhere.  though I do this in the day, I notice at night if im driving (like winter) there is such a lack of street lights.  

has anyone started a memorial site for him? if not, why?
>We realize this is a difficult time for those of you who knew Seth. It is important to know that individuals may express their grief differently and we need to respect the different ways people react and support each other 

Fuck you carol. Are you insinuating that the attacker reacted to the death of george by doing this? The attacker needs to be hung by a noose until dead and left to rot. The chancellor needs to resign in shame.
[deleted]
True. They've already sent an email about BLM; I was hoping to to hear more about Seth than just his major/year :/
Really shows where the priority of our admin lies. Somehow, the murder of a person on the other side of the continent who is outside of their jurisdiction is far more important than a murder of one of the students that they are directly responsible for. I guarantee we will not see a similar near-daily barrage of emails and messages about this murder.
Yeah, it was irrelevant to his death. Frankly, admin just wants to save face from this incident. Notice the emphasis on ""off-campus.""
I concur. While this incident is indubitably tragic, I don't really see how the school could of done anything to prevent this. Unless the school takes over the admin of the entire city of Berkeley, this is a issue to take up with the city, not the school.
[deleted]
What would you have preferred they wrote?
The City of Berkeley did that...not the university...
I *definitely* do not support disbanding the police, and I don't think any rational person does either. I do, however, support a system in which the police still retain a reasonable majority of their budget, while the rest is diverted towards social services such as mental health centers, education, after-school programs, and drug rehabilitation. In Berkeley specifically, some of that could be used to help reduce the homeless population and increase the safety of the student body. As far as the rest of the police's budget goes, I think it should be spent on community involvement/patrolling, like you said (staying focused on the ""protect and serve"" model). 

It is worth noting that I don't have any concrete percentages or amounts of money that should be put towards some of the services that I mentioned. I just think that these are good ideas. Regardless, something certainly needs to change (I don't think anyone is arguing against that).
Just saying its an oddly specific phrase that is obviously there to emphasize that the campus area is safe.  

""walking near Dwight way"" would have been fine.
The reason they emphasized it was because they want to shift blame over to the BPD, to ""save face"", so to speak. I would have preferred if they took some responsibility for keeping their students safe, and work *with* the BPD to ensure student safety both on and off campus.
[deleted]
You’re really reading into something that isn’t there.
...or it's just the most succinct way to accurately describe the relevant high-level details of his death? Not every detail is PR-oriented.
Is the school supposed to keep its students safe at all times throughout the year? I thought most students were aware that they'd ultimately be left on their own to deal with shit. I don't think any of us are always 100% cognizant that we can get jumped or mugged when we're walking around in the area. From my experiences, the school doesn't really do much outside of offering BearWalk and the transit.
It is worth noting that when most people say ""defund the police"", their views align with ours. I don't see how people can call for complete defunding/disbanding of the police!

Then again, I'm not a minority (I hold a significant amount of privilege, being a white male) and have only had positive experiences with the police....UCPD/BPD included.
Could be ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I think the administration has gotten a lot of undeserved criticism lately and I'm generally not inclined to add onto that, but that part of the statement just rubbed me the wrong way.
If you read the rest of the email in context with that statement, it seems to me that they are trying to save face. Coupled with the fact that it took 6 days for them to respond, and that the response was ultimately lack-luster, in my personal opinion.
[deleted]
Perhaps they were in contact with the family about what details would like the university to release.
Have any students made actual demands in terms of percentages/amounts (i.e. take x% of UCPD's budget away and put $y towards mental health programs, $z towards helping the homeless, etc)? I haven't seen any, but I'm curious to see if there are any specific demands.

A lot of reforms, though, don't have anything to do with budget. For instance, getting rid of qualified immunity, stripping police unions of some of their bargaining power, and enforcing a ""whistleblower-esque"" policy would all increase police accountability, which I think is a smarter, more direct, and more specific way of reforming the police.
[deleted]
I actually think a hybrid of increased accountability and reducing their budget would be the most effective!

But wow, that is truly scary. I don't know how these students can justify decreasing police budget (and therefore presence) to zero. That is shocking to me, and I'm curious as to what their arguments are. I'll have to seek one of these people out 😅"

But they did say there will be another round of housing coming out in July
Cal does this kind of shit intentionally so they can downplay the amount of demand for student housing and use that as an excuse for never building enough dorms when they expand enrollment.

Cal has been increasing student enrollment by about 1,000 new students every year for the last 20 years and they've built zero net new units of housing in all that time.
condolences ☹️
Check your dm
I filled out my application ages ago but realized that on my financial aid forms i put “off-campus housing” and just changed it last week. I’m hoping that doesn’t put me in the back of the line.
You sound like my mom
At this point, they’re about out of spaces. Off-campus is the best bet right now.
That would be incest
Blackwell, Enclave, Panoramic, Intersection and Maximo Martinez are all relatively new. Housing has been added but enrollment increases have been crazy (hence the freezing of enrollment legal battle)
As much as housing is a shitshow

>  the last 20 years and they've built zero net new units of housing in all that time.

is just incredibly objectively false statement that would be evident with even a modicum of research.
Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by incompetence.
Join the waitlist anyway. They always get some scream-and-runs at CZ.
New student enrollment has outpaced new housing units at a rate of > 10:1 every single year. Total number of housing units that's been added relative to the enrollment increase has been less than zero.
The student admissions are mandated by the state while the city blocks new housing.
I got into the co-ops at the last minute, off the wait list. It was one of the best parts of my college experience.
I second this! I signed up and got a spot last Spring and waited only 1 month.
The State does not mandate enrollment increases at Cal.   
Cal includes new increases in enrollment that massively outpace the number of units being built every time they propose new housing.   
Cal largely refuses to build housing on their current campus and keeps trying to expand. 

Yes, the city is a problem, but Cal is absolutely a bad actor in these interactions."
Data Science approved as an L&S major!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8cy6ti/data_science_approved_as_an_ls_major/,2018-04-17 10:09:25,"From the Chancellor:

""Dear campus community,

We are writing with updates on Berkeley’s active engagement with the burgeoning and exciting field of data science, which has the potential to shape numerous fields of study and practice.

Our undergraduates will have many options for studying data science in depth. Of note is a recently approved Data Science major in the College of Letters and Science, effective in Fall 2018, and one in Engineering, which is currently undergoing design and review. A minor is also under consideration for students in all colleges. Even now, more than 3,000 students a year are enrolled in data science courses.

Efforts are also afoot at the graduate level, where we already have three successful masters programs in data science, designated emphases for PhD students, and soon a graduate certificate. Particularly exciting is the student community that has formed, assisting faculty throughout campus to develop new data science-related curricula and discovery experiences.

Data Science is also having a major effect on the creation of new knowledge in nearly every field and profession including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), arts and humanities, and social sciences. Reflecting this evolution, this year we have asked that academic units consider, in their faculty hiring plans, the connections to Data Science that may exist in their fields.

Advancing our efforts in the field of data science was the motivation for our appointing an interim Dean of Data Sciences, David Culler. He is working closely with us and the rest of the Berkeley community on the question of organizational structures for Data Science that will best meet our needs. We anticipate that during the coming academic year we will continue to engage the campus community in broadly inclusive discussions to move our plans forward. We will keep you posted as opportunities to engage in this discussion develop.

For more information about transformative work underway in data science, please see data.berkeley.edu.

Could the percentage be higher? Duh.  Also, a lot of people tend to glow up from fresh-senior year, so there’s hope for y’all. 

P.S. exercise + a good fit that works for your body shape can make a 5 to an 8. Hubba hubba.

Y'all talk as if you could pull said baddies anyway
Some people say I'm both. I really do think it comes down to your lifestyle and eating choices. It's hard to manage that when you're academically focused, especially if you're not wealthy to afford healthy foods that can be made quickly. Rn I feel pretty ugly bc I didn't get to focus on myself while I was finishing an intense semester.

Wtf.

You’re both a baddie and an element?
Lmao
bro what? 

Literally just buy protein—cheap rotis chicken, chicken tenderloins, or protein powder. As long as you get in 80gs of protein and stay under your daily calorie intake you're good. It's lack of discipline, not lack of wealth that's causing bad eating habits.

It is the embodiment of bureaucracy: there are no flourishes in the design, no space left unused, the lack of windows in most rooms is a constant reminder that you are there to accomplish a goal, not to enjoy your stay. Painting it any color other than grey would convey emotion to the observer, which was the one thing the architects set out not to do. It is a melting pot of different departments, advising and large classrooms, and to accommodate all of its uses it lacks any personality. Just a big, old, seismically unsafe grey building imposing itself next to the beauty of the campanile, the green of the glades and the grand library, reminding us that for this university to function someone must be doing the unpleasant work without any of the accolades.
All I know is that the Amazon locker at ASUC is our Seattle.

I vote Dwinelle Hall, since it has a big population every day + it’s near the historical landmark of sather gate
As a conjecture, Dwinelle is basically Seattle to US and Hong Kong to China---- rebellious, chaotic (Vis a Vis their own order), full of humanistic stuff, and turns out has a nice small wildlife (that might have had a horrible past to it).

Evans Hall is the building most representative of the Brutalist architecture which is predominant at the newer UC's.
I heard they were planning to tear it down next Summer, right? That building is rank. There was blood all over the bathroom floor last week. Like straight up looked like someone was stabbed in there or something. 💀😵‍💫

And the bathrooms are all super hard to find.

I guess, but there are some absolutely amazing brutalist pieces like the Mothership at UCSD. But essentially I agree, they have no place at Berkeley and Evans Hall is a fucking eyesore.
There are tons of bathrooms but you have to *not* be looking for them in order to find them.

Professor Shao not replying to my email,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10ew4w2/professor_shao_not_replying_to_my_email/,2023-01-17 19:02:14,"I have emailed Professor Shao regarding my EECS 151 LB grade, which is a C-, on Jan. 6, but she didn't reply yet. My classmates said that I will be fine regarding grad school, but my family insisted that I email her to find out exactly why I got that grade. They were surprised I got that since I spent a lot of time with the final project debugging.  They expected a much better grade like a B-. Since I did a lot more debugging than my partner, I feel I deserve a better grade. I know that for the project grade, 70% of it was for functionality, 5% for checkpoints, 15% for optimizations, and 10% on the final lab report, which I got full credit on. The TA who checked me off suggested that I email the professor, who determined the letter grades. My partner and I was able to finish checkpoint 1 and pass the CPU testbench and two of the three built in assembly tests. All other ckpt 2 tests failed because of the file not found error. We tried fixing the error by asking multiple students and posting on Ed, but their suggestions for some reason didn't work. For checkpoint 3, we implemented the code for the branch predictor, but didn't have time to test it. For checkpoint 4, we choose to do the 5-stage pipeline for optimizations, but didn't have time to implement others. Despite my partner and I staying up late on most days, we couldn't finish it on time.

To make matters worse, I tested positive for Covid the day before the EECS 151 midterm, which I was supposed to take on campus. But instead, I took it online. It was really stressful given I sometimes had a headache. I had to setup my table for Zoom proctoring and had to sacrifice time used for the project to sleep early. A few days after the midterm, my partner had flu like symptoms. It look longer for me than her to recover from my illness. The strike made matters even worse, when there were limited office hours for help on the project. Most of the hours didn't work for me. If the strike didn't happen, then I would have came to my regular lab sections and get help much faster. I even posted my questions on Ed, but some of them were unanswered even during the day of checkoff.

I know 151 staff tried their best to accommodate students by making the submissions for ckpt 2 and 3 Gradescope submissions and making ckpt 2 a soft deadline. They also made ckpt 3 a branch predictor for FPGA. But I feel like the professor wasn't accommodating enough regarding letter grades given the challenges posed by the strike and the sickness we faced. I am not saying it's not my or my partner's fault for not finishing the project. It's the UC administration's fault for not meeting the demands of TAs and GSIs. I am pretty sure that I got full credit on all 5 labs before the project and wasn't deducted points for late work since I have one slip day left.

JESUS CAROL CHRIST!",">All other ckpt 2 tests failed because of the file not found error.

Despite my partner and I staying up late on most days, we couldn't finish it on time.

To clarify, you didn't get the CPU working by the end? I don't know if the policy has since changed, but in my semester we were told that we'd get a zero for functionality if the CPU didn't pass everything since a CPU that doesn't correctly implement all instructions is unusable. Whether or not that policy is fair and reasonable from a pedagogical standpoint, it does make sense why you'd get a C- if you, at most, got a 20% on the final project. They may have honestly already bumped you up to a passing grade since such a grade on the final project would definitely put you well into the F range.

I suspect you'll have a very hard time with trying to shift your grade because the grade isn't *wrong*. You may have better luck arguing for an incomplete rather than a better grade because while instructors do have freedom in how they assign grades, I've never heard of a full letter bump for extenuating circumstances.
I agree it doesn’t sound like C- work. I would definitely talk to the TA who checked you off and also the head lab TA from that semester. Maybe they can give you more insight until Professor Shao has the chance to respond.
I got all of the forwarding and all RISC-V instructions working correctly. The assembly tests accessed the BIOS, but somehow we weren't able to make it work correctly. I implemented the UART, which was required in the project, but wasn't working correctly. I was only told about the rubric, but no zero policy on functionality. To clarify, I didn't get help in a timely manner because of the strike. An incomplete wasn't an option for me because the lab class was taken in my last semester at Berkeley. I will start grad school at SJSU this spring.

Checkpoint 2 has the following test benches: CPU, assembly, ISA, BIOS, UART, and mult.

I know someone who got a C+ in the lab class and passed CPU, assembly, ISA, and BIOS. Everything else for him failed.
I already contacted the TA who checked me off. As I said, I got full credit on the lab report, but he wasn't the person who determined the final grade. The professor did. The TA said that the project grade relies heavily on functionality. He said he believes the professor bumped up grades for effort. I know that 75% of the lab grade is project and 25% is for the 5 labs before the project. There is no head TA."

The UC did just put together a working group and pay a bunch of consultants to come to the conclusion that every chancellor needed raises...

https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/jan22/g1.pdf
https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/
So this is what consultants do, as much mental gymnastics as possible to justify taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich
Honestly this pay isn’t even THAT much for beong the chancellor. And reducing this pay will not solve many problems.
I don’t think comparing salaries to a relevant peer set is “mental gymnastics”. The report showed that relative to chancellors at other schools, those at UCs were underpaid.

This is exactly the same argument the UAW is making: relative to graduate students at other top universities, we are paid less. Or is that “mental gymnastics” too?
$500k/year is hardly “rich” in the Bay Area, unfortunately
1) My comment was mostly a joke about no one knowing what consultants do and their work not actually being productive

2) They chose to specifically compare against only universities in the AAU and did no other analysis on broader trends within american universities

3) There is no analysis of the role or comparison of responsibilities that would justify such a high pay at any of the universities or might explain discrepancies between universities. And with her current pay what does Carol Christ do that 20 of the brightest PhD students couldn’t accomplish?

4) This one is the most important. People making 500k don’t have to worry about having a place to live and food to eat. The UAW’s requests are much less about comparing to other universities but rather about necessary support to continue being able to work and support all of the successful research and students that are produced by this university."

Doesn’t sound too unreasonable. I imagine the course structure would be like:


Unit 1: Social perception of Flatulence (stereotypes, depictions in media, etc). Have the fun section up front to get students engaged. Watch some clips from movies and stuff to keep people interested.

Unit 2: Genetic Factors of Flatulence. It’d be cool to have a guest speaker from one of the bio departments here. Maybe do some literature review here.

Unit 3: Dietary Factors of Flatulence. Would be a good way to teach a little nutritional science that students may not be exposed to otherwise. Also would be good for introducing people to foods of other cultures.


Spend 1 month on each unit, and it’s seems like enough content for a one-semester class.

New Changes being made to Counseling and Psychological Services,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14mh7ge/new_changes_being_made_to_counseling_and/,2023-06-29 14:32:56,"Dear Campus Community,
 
The UC Board of Regents today voted to establish the Virtual Reality(VR) center and include it as part of the Counseling and Psychological services.
 
The college will provide a realistic, high-quality, and ethics-oriented Virtual Waifu & Femboy experience to a diverse student body in stressful, high-impact majors such as CS and EECS. It will also enable faculty to conduct groundbreaking, multidisciplinary research that capitalizes on Berkeley’s excellence across campus. 
 
The founding units of the new revolutionary program include the Department of Statistics, the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (jointly with the College of Engineering), the Data Science Undergraduate Studies program, the Center for Computational Biology, the Computational Precision Health program (jointly with UCSF), the Bakar Institute of Digital Materials for the Planet, D-Lab – the Social Science Data Lab (jointly with the Social Sciences Division) and the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. 
 
We are thrilled to announce this new program at Berkeley, one that connects our excellent research and education in computing, data science and psychology with the need to help our hard-working stressed students. Infusing the power of Virtual Reality and its applications to the realm of psychology and human behavior will help us to fully realize the potential of waifus and femboys to benefit society, help address our world’s most challenging problems and achieve our most visionary goals. 
 
At Berkeley, we have both the opportunity and responsibility to educate our students from diverse backgrounds to become the ethical leaders we need in this sphere, whether they pursue careers in industry, the public sector or education. You can read more about the college on Berkeley News. 
 
We’d like to take this moment to thank and congratulate the countless individuals who worked for years to make this day possible. We are especially grateful to the many generous donors who have made this dream a reality. Additionally, we’d like to thank u/Cal_Aesthetics_Club for presenting us with the unprecedented and ambitious idea.
 
For over 150 years, Berkeley has been empowering engaged thinkers and global citizens to change our world. The creation of this program is a testament to the fact that we continue to innovate to prepare students today to solve the challenges of tomorrow.

We Support Our International Student Community - Email from Chancellor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hn82uo/we_support_our_international_student_community/,2020-07-07 18:53:22,"Dear campus community,

Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security issued [new guidance](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during) to universities related to international students and fall instruction requirements. The guidance is deeply concerning: it could potentially force the return of many international students to their home countries if they are unable to find the appropriate balance of in-person and remote classes. These requirements run counter to our values of being an inclusive community and one that has a long tradition of welcoming international students from around the globe. International students enrich campus life immeasurably, through their participation in classes, research collaborations and extracurricular activities.

We will explore all of our options, legal and otherwise, to counter the deleterious effects of these policies that imp act the ability for international students to achieve their academic goals. It is not only important for UC Berkeley but for all of higher education across the U.S. to take every step possible to mitigate these policies that send a message of exclusion to our international community of scholars. We will partner with our professional associations to advocate for sound legislation that continues to support international educational exchange.

More immediately, we are working with colleagues across our campus to identify a path that will allow us to comply with these requirements while ensuring a healthy learning environment, and paying attention to the needs of our international students. We recognize the concern and anxiety these new rules have created, and we are moving quickly to ensure that we offer the proper balance of online and in-person classes so that our students can remain in the U.S. and satisfy their visa requirements, and that those students residing outside the U.S. can maintain their enrollment status.

We expect to announce more details soon. Should you have any questions, please contact the Berkeley International Office at [internationaloffice@berkeley.edu](mailto:internationaloffice@berkeley.edu).

Carol Christ

Fucking ridiculous, this is intrinsic to providing a university education and should be covered by tuition.

Like sure, Zoom Pro for all students and Kaltura have greatly expanded in their use only recently because of their cited reasons, the pandemic and wildfires. But Google Workspace, Microsoft Office apps, and Gradescope? These have been in use for years.
Libtardism and greed. Some will say it’s repetitive.
REsilience fee is basically to see how tough you are and to test you to see if you can manage paying it. It makes me so mad to pay fees like that, especially when I'm shopping for food. Why do I have to pay for something that just grows right out of the ground like broccoli? My best bud harry sometimes takes one bite out of a bunch of apples until he find the right one. He doesn't have that many teeth so he needs to find the soft ones.
I understand this is for folks that needed access to devices and software during Covid. I’m being facetious here but can I retroactively charge the university for my wfh items needed during Covid? Because there were a lot and without them I surely would have been not in compliance for ergonomics.
AKA one of the most useful fees lol
These used to be included with tuition though…
Would you rather them increase your tuition by this amount and then not include it as a descriptive line item?
Microsoft and Adobe definitely weren't.

I’m sure if gets to that point the school will have an answer, not reddit.
they might change the structure of the final exam to be graded by computer ex: multiple choice or smn.

I assume they’ll administer exams though bCourses since those quizzes have an automatic scoring function. Obviously idk what they’re going to do for humanities classes that require essay writing.
One of my professors hinted she might give out incomplete grades for now and then post grades sometime next semester. My other professors haven’t made any announcements and I’m getting nervous because one of my classes requires a GSI proctor to be present so idk how that’ll even work.
It won't go on till then. Final exams will be graded in December, and some even in January.

Chancellor Christ's email about Free Speech,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6vlitd/chancellor_christs_email_about_free_speech/,2017-08-23 12:51:30,"> Dear Students, Faculty and Staff, 
> 
> This fall, the issue of free speech will once more engage our community in powerful and complex ways. Events in Charlottesville, with their racism, bigotry, violence and mayhem, make the issue of free speech even more tense. The law is very clear; public institutions like UC Berkeley must permit speakers invited in accordance with campus policies to speak, without discrimination in regard to point of view.  The United States has the strongest free speech protections of any liberal democracy; the First Amendment protects even speech that most of us would find hateful, abhorrent and odious, and the courts have consistently upheld these protections. 
> 
> But the most powerful argument for free speech is not one of legal constraint—that we’re required to allow it—but of value.  The public expression of many sharply divergent points of view is fundamental both to our democracy and to our mission as a university. The philosophical justification underlying free speech, most powerfully articulated by John Stuart Mill in his book On Liberty, rests on two basic assumptions. The first is that truth is of such power that it will always ultimately prevail; any abridgement of argument therefore compromises the opportunity of exchanging error for truth. The second is an extreme skepticism about the right of any authority to determine which opinions are noxious or abhorrent. Once you embark on the path to censorship, you make your own speech vulnerable to it. 
> 
> Berkeley, as you know, is the home of the Free Speech Movement, where students on the right and students on the left united to fight for the right to advocate political views on campus.  Particularly now, it is critical that the Berkeley community come together once again to protect this right.  It is who we are. 
> 
> Nonetheless, defending the right of free speech for those whose ideas we find offensive is not easy.  It often conflicts with the values we hold as a community—tolerance, inclusion, reason and diversity.  Some constitutionally-protected speech attacks the very identity of particular groups of individuals in ways that are deeply hurtful.  However, the right response is not the heckler’s veto, or what some call platform denial.  Call toxic speech out for what it is, don’t shout it down, for in shouting it down, you collude in the narrative that universities are not open to all speech. Respond to hate speech with more speech. 
> 
> We all desire safe space, where we can be ourselves and find support for our identities.  You have the right at Berkeley to expect the university to keep you physically safe. But we would be providing students with a less valuable education, preparing them less well for the world after graduation, if we tried to shelter them from ideas that many find wrong, even dangerous.  We must show that we can choose what to listen to, that we can cultivate our own arguments and that we can develop inner resilience, which is the surest form of safe space.

Really happy to see this.  Sometimes it feels like US politics has turned in to a big playground scuffle among children, and Carol Christ is the only adult on the playground.

I think Berkeley may end up being the turning point for the second time in the history of US politics.

For those of you who are worried about extreme views being given a platform, I recommend [this Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-the-UC-Berkeley-protest-against-Milo-Yiannopoulos-Feb-2017/answer/Richard-Muller-3) by Berkeley physics prof Richard Muller about how that played out during the 60s.  Knowing your shit is the best way to humiliate extremists.  Research the opposition, understand history, etc. and you will make them look like fools.
I agree with the sentiment, but there is an argument to disallowing certain speakers on campus---not because they offer a point of view that is dissenting or even disparaging, but because many of the things they say are simply fallacious. There's a difference between having a differing opinion and being outright wrong. If a speaker wished to present clear falsehoods, I would say that an intellectual and academic institution like Berkeley would be well within reason to ignore such requests.

The school will never allow Shapiro or Milo to speak there. Not in a million years.
Wow she is incredibly well-spoken (written?) and did a mighty impressive job with a topic that's been widely controversial at Berkeley in the recent past.

Have high hopes about Chancellor Christ.
Blah blah blah charge Ben Shapiro 16k security fee what a joke.  Lots of lip service...
If the free speech is of 'value', then it has a positive aspect: new ideas, cooperation, research, debate in good faith, etc. Christ is dishonest to include Milo in this. He provides no value, he's only invited because BCR's composed of pathetic daddy's boys who can imagine nothing better in life than being a nuisance to others.

Free speech isn't the issue; Ben Shapiro's idiotic Zionism isn't the issue; opposing views aren't the issue.
A speaker who exists only to attack  views (especially with the knowledge that his cabal of followers will enforce his otherwise innocuous offensiveness) and not to offer any coherent message, a club which invites him, and the university which pays for and condones this attack on its student body. These are the problems.
**Fuck** Carol Christ. 

>The law is very clear; public institutions like UC Berkeley must permit speakers invited in accordance with campus policies to speak, without discrimination in regard to point of view. 

Americans blindly use the constitution as a premise for all ethical debates. The law does not dictate morality nor does it dictate what is good for particular communities or humanity as a whole. Blindly appealing to the constitution, rules penned down by rich white men hundreds of years ago, as Carol Christ does in her opening paragraph is not even worth bringing up in a philosophical debate. 

Christ admits this and goes on to quote the poorly formulated and blindly moralistic defenses of free speech that John Locke came up with.

> The first is that truth is of such power that it will always ultimately prevail; any abridgement of argument therefore compromises the opportunity of exchanging error for truth.

The truth did not prevail when Nazi Germany perpetrated the holocaust. In every in every instance where hateful values have been put into practice the truth was only ever realized by the victims as they were led to their deaths. Nazis didn't come to power because there was a violent opposition from leftists that made them look like the good guys, which is current liberal narrative surrounding the rise of the far-right figures like Milo. Nazis came to power because a lot of people felt like Nazism was a good idea given Germany's humiliation after WW1. Hitler himself stated that the only way to defeat Nazism would have been to smash the very ""nucleus"" of the movement, a view corroborated by holocaust survivors. Similarly, there is not truth the views being pushed on the right, the current epidemic of fake news is symptomatic of that- current political discourse is very much removed from facts and figures like Milo play into this. 

Of course one might ignorantly press the argument that the far-right in America is constrained to speech, that they'll never be able to put their ideology into practice. This is wrong, the events of Charlottesville were a cut and dry example of far-right praxis. Nazi commentators lauded the violence and mocked Heather Heyer and recent leaks show that violence was planned in advance- no platforming these individuals would have prevented some of the escalations seen at Charlottesville. [**73%** of terror attacks in America since 2001 have been perpetrated by the far right according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/opinion/finsbury-park-terrorist-attack-far-right.html?mcubz=0). Antifa hasn't killed anyone.

Houser was said to have been a misogynist and praised the actions of Adolf Hitler on online message boards.

Nazis, white nationalists and the alt-right endorse violence in some form against minorities. They openly advocate for mass deportations, racial segregation and ethnic cleansing. Giving a platform to far-right views provides them with the ability to recruit more people and bring existing members together in an open physical space, which in turn allows them to consolidate resources and plan for the future. It's how movements are formed. Giving the far-right a platform gives momentum to their organizational efforts, which in turn harm people. Contrary to liberal notions, free speech has consequences.

On a different note, hate-speech can lead to serious emotional trauma. A jewish person should not have to intellectually debate a Nazi on whether or not they should be gassed. A black person should not have to defend the ideas that they're not a different species or not mentally inferior to whites. A trans person should not have to validate their existence. An undocumented individual shouldn't have to argue that their life is that just as important as the life of someone born in America. Mental health is a real issue and the claim that speech cannot be violent ignores it's importance. On a campus with a history of trivializing mental health concerns, this comes as no surprise. Hate-speech regardless of its rationale, is highly damaging to individuals. Moreover most hate-speech is in-fact emotionally grounded and irrational. 

Currently in America the truth is certainly not prevailing as the President calls all news sources that fail to serve his own regressive narrative ""fake.""  The truth doesn't necessarily prevail, materially or rhetorically. Locke's first premise is wrong and dangerously naive. 

>The second is an extreme skepticism about the right of any authority to determine which opinions are noxious or abhorrent. Once you embark on the path to censorship, you make your own speech vulnerable to it.

This point falls prey to the fact free speech is in-principle, logically incoherent, which is exemplified by Karl Poppers Paradox of tolerance. Imagine a society where the state enforces free speech, now imagine a group that explicitly opposes free speech poses a real threat to the status quo without the use of violence; the state now has two options, to allow itself to be dismantled, which would end ""free speech"" or to restrict free speech. In Popper words:

>Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.

Rawls too, pointed out that a society must preserve itself in the face of intolerant, hateful views like the ones that will be provided with a platform here at Berkeley.

>While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.

Locke doesn't have the final say on free speech.

Some of you might be surprised to find that speech is already curtailed in the US, the principle is already compromised—it does not exist. There are laws related to “obscenity, incitement to violence, copyright infringement, press censorship during wartime, whistleblowing” and “restrictions for the incarcerated.” Why not add one more restriction—curtailing hate speech—as many European democracies do? Hate speech is as damaging as many of the items I've listed. 

Locke's second premise is logically inconsistent.

>We will not tolerate violence, and we will hold anyone accountable who engages in it.

Fascists use violence as a means to take power and Anti-Fascists use violence not to take power, but to oppose the Fascists taking power. Violence isn't wrong in itself, this is another blind appeal to law and order without considering the consequences and the context.

> Free speech is our legacy, and we have the power once more to shape this narrative.

Hate Speech isn't free speech. Hate speech can generally defined as far-right views, which have caused enough damage to humanity and should be quashed in order to make room for a civilized society. Hence the principle (hate speech isn't free speech) won't be used against anyone but the blindly hateful. Carol Christ can go to hell. 




Yeah, it was a good read. Now, I only hope that our spineless mayor will actually get the police to enforce things during protests that get violent.
Yeah, if US politics has taught us anything, it's *definitely* that well-reasoned debate solves things. Like British rule, or slavery, or whether German Nazism warrants war, or Civil Rights, or Vietnam (and myriad other wars), or who should currently be president. Oh...
What I want to know is why milo, an admitted pedophile, is being allowed to speak. 
Seems like the burden falls on the student groups. If someone wants to dirty their name by inviting an idiot, so be it I guess.
Sounds good.  Maybe we could have a Ministry of Truth to determine which statements are falsehoods?  That way we will know which speakers are acceptable to invite.
If a speaker presents poor arguments with no evidence, they're an awful speaker and you'd hope that few would attend such a talk.
This dumbfuck Chancellor might just let it happen. Apparently freeze peach is more important than student safety. Prepare for tear gas, lots of fucking tear gas.
This comment existed only to attack views and not to offer any coherent message.  It did not debate in good faith or provide any value.  theuncleiroh is a problem and they should be banned from /r/berkeley.

(in case it's not obvious, I'm being sarcastic)
If only the members of BCR would get lives and stop being trolls for the sake of trolling...
really happy Madison didn't listen to an 18th century version of you and feel pressured to add an ""as long as it doesn't make anyone feel bad"" clause to the first amendment. 
I'm not so sure.  Both Milo and Shapiro ""attack"" views using evidence (some questionable) and are willing to engage with the audience at the end of their usually fairly brief presentations.

Questioning the validity of commonly held beliefs when there is evidence and explanation for why they may be incorrect is valuable.  How many of our politicians talked about the wage gap?
Woosh...

[Note: I have been making some hotheaded comments on this sub recently, but I am trying a different tone for this comment.  So use your calm voice when you're reading aloud to yourself in your head, I guess :D]

Blindly appealing to the constitution, rules penned down by rich white men hundreds of years ago, as Carol Christ does in her opening paragraph is not even worth bringing up in a philosophical debate.

Who says it's a philosophical debate?  Maybe it's a *legal* debate?  Have you done any research in to what the legal consequences of defying these laws would be?  If you want to practice civil disobedience, you should at least understand the consequences and be prepared.  If right wingers sue UC Berkeley for violating the First Amendment and win, that will be a major victory for them in the eyes of the public and they will grow stronger.  How long have you spent thinking about this possibility?

>Nazis came to power because a lot of people felt like Nazism was a good idea given Germany's humiliation after WW1.

So what you're saying is that we should avoid humiliating right wingers if we don't want them to turn to Nazism?

>Nazi commentators lauded the violence and mocked Heather Heyer.

Would you mind linking to some examples of this?

>Nazis, white nationalists and the alt-right endorse violence in some form against minorities. They openly advocate for mass deportations, racial segregation and ethnic cleansing.

It's how movements are formed. Giving the far-right a platform gives momentum to their organizational efforts, which in turn harm people. Contrary to liberal notions, free speech has consequences.

So Berkeley has invited Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos to speak.  Ben Shapiro is a conservative Jew.  About Milo, the Anti-Defamation League [writes](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/milo-yiannopoulos-five-things-to-know):

>Although many media outlets refer to Yiannopoulos as a leader of the alt right, the white supremacists of the alt right reject him due to his alleged Jewish lineage (he actually identifies as a Catholic), his homosexuality, and his promotion of inter-racial sex. Nonetheless, he is part of the alt right orbit, since he agrees with its views against immigration, globalism, political correctness, and mainstream conservatism. In turn, the alt right views him as part of what they call the “alt light” –people who accept a lot of the alt right’s views but reject white supremacy and anti-Semitism. Yiannopoulos may, however, serve as a gateway to the alt right for his fans.

And here's what Milo himself [says](http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2017/01/26/milo-white-nationalism-is-not-the-answer/):

>“White pride, white nationalism, white supremacy isn’t the way to go,” he continued. “The way to go is reminding them and yourselves that you should be aspiring to values and to ideas.”

>“You should be focusing on what unites people and not what drives them apart,” MILO concluded. “You shouldn’t give a shit about skin color, a shit about sexuality… You shouldn’t give a shit about gender, and you should be deeply suspicious of the people who do.”

I think it's possible that the ADL is right about the gateway thing, but I also think it's possible that by giving Milo a platform, it will allow him to suck up more of the energy swirling around the dissident right in to a movement that is **not** neo-Nazism.  A neo-Nazi talking point is that the left calls practically everyone who is opposed to political correctness a Nazi, so you might as well go ahead and join them.  The more we make this talking point true, the more we play in to neo-Nazi hands.

>Why not add one more restriction—curtailing hate speech—as many European democracies do? Hate speech is as damaging as many of the items I've listed.

I actually agree with this.  People are already taking private action in response to ""hate speech"" like getting folks fired and so on.  The problem with private action is that there is no due process, just mob justice.  I would rather we use the legal system: punishments that fit the crime are way better than haphazard vigilantism.

>Fascists use violence as a means to take power and Anti-Fascists use violence not to take power, but to oppose the Fascists taking power.

You've got a list of examples of people on the far right committing violence.  When you read about acts of violence they committed, does that make you more or less inclined to support them?

For me, it makes me less inclined to support them.  And this seems to be true in general: social scientists [have found](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/21/people-are-in-the-streets-protesting-donald-trump-but-when-does-protest-actually-work/) that nonviolent movements are much more likely to succeed.

So according to social science, Anti-Fascists are actually undermining the resistance to Trump through their violence.  If you want the opposition to Trump to be successful, you should discourage violence on the part of antifa.
What are your thoughts on the idea that far left speech in favor of ideologies like communism espoused by people like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and the communist leaders of the USSR causing the death of millions of innocent Russians. Or that of far left leaders in China like Mao that brought upon the deaths of millions of others. 

Their speech convinced people to attempt to put communism into practice and keep it going despite the huge costs it had in causing the deaths of millions in both countries. It can be argued that attempts to bring about a communist state and the speech that convinced people has caused enough damage to humanity and it would be better for the world if was quashed so we can engage and make room for civilized society. 

The problem with adding more clauses to the doctrine in free speech comes when situations like the one I mentioned in a previous discussion.
> 
> Since they can easily be a tool to silence unpopular opinions and ones that are politically convenient.
> For example, Germany is a country for the longest time hailed as an place that had limits on free speech but they were limited to a situations like holocaust denial and such. A few months back though, a German comedian decided to mock/insult the president of Turkey. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Böhmermann_affair
> Germany has laws against the using of speech for ""abusive criticism of a foreign state leader."" Normally a country like Germany would not bother making a big deal or using their speech limiting laws over a comedian mocking a world leader who has a number of horrific skeletons in his closet. They wouldn't define his insults as hate speech/abusive criticism.
> That said, if I remember correctly, either the EU was in talks with Turkey or had just signed a deal where Turkey would block/slow down the number of refugees it was letting into Europe.
> In this political background the German government chose to take into consideration the fact that Erdogan felt personally insulted and the Turkish government demanded criminal prosecution of the comedian. They filed to prosecute the comedian on the charges of abusive criticism of a foreign state leader.
> Now thankfully the German public was fairly against this, and the government later dropped the charges against the comedian. That said, do you see how this could have a negative affect on society? For a while I am sure many people felt like the need to self censor and not speak their mind since the government was cracking down. A chilling affect was created.
> As long as hate speech laws exist they can easily used to target those that are politically convenient. They might first just be used to kick out the horrible, horrible neo nazis and such. Wait long enough though, it's not too difficult for anyone on the political spectrum to use it to their advantage. Communists/socialists peacefully rallying in Berkeley? Maybe a person who had escaped a terrible, terrible situation in the USSR files a complaint. They say that the use of the Soviet flag is a direct attack on them and ignores the huge number of their family that was put to death by an oppressive government and the fellow millions that also died. It might not be as good of a case like silencing neo nazis, but given the opportunity, do you not think that a sufficiently right wing president/government would not support that?
> There's a lot more too it, but this is what I was able to think off the top of my head about. Let me if you're still unconvinced/have questions.

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6txgwc/any_of_yall_hear_the_new_chancellors_piece_on/dlpaemy/

Reiterating some of what I said in the previous comment now, but I think in a way that is better phrased. For the longest time people have pointed to Germany and European countries for examples of how they manage free speech and restrictions without going too far. The Bohmermann affair is a basic/direct/straightforward example of an instance where a extremely stable European government was unable to keep from using their restrictions to attempt to silence politically inconvenient speech. 

If I believe that even though far left socialistic/communistic ideologies/doctrines are dangerous since they convince people to pursue policies that often lead to hugely horrific situations like death camps and ect and that it is better to simply silence that speech so we don't let that possibility happen again. 

Even if you don't believe in this, could you not see a situation where a right wing government that is competent in pursuing it's policies/directives push this pov forward? If we make it illegal for Neo Nazi's and similar people to espouse their views I doubt that it would take much time that people attempt to silence communists/socialists/ect arguing with the same/similar rhetoric. 
agreed. hope there's actually some tangible bite to the ""we will not tolerate violence and we will hold anyone accountable who engages in it."" I'll be shocked if it actually comes to fruition with the passivity I've seen from police in the past. 
Meh. The guy allegedly has links to antifa. I think the cops should not be under the mayor's thumb.
The winning team always constructs rationalizations for why they were in the right.  To take one of your examples, for the British rule thing, there's an [argument to be made](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8884885/american-revolution-mistake) that we would be better off if America was part of the Commonwealth.  To take another, there's an [argument to be made](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/opinion/the-right-way-to-resist-trump.html) that reasoned debate is the right way to replace Trump the same way it was the right way to replace Berlusconi.

As soon as you replace words with violence, you are in the world of might makes right.  You are a fool if you think the right will stand back and be the bigger person in the face of leftist violence, and you are [also a fool](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/11/you-and-whose-army.html) if you think the left is in a position to win a civil war.  Is might makes right really the world you want to live in?

Also, why are you citing Civil Rights and Vietnam as *failures* for free speech?  You are aware that Berkeley was the home of the Free Speech Movement around that time, I hope?
Please provide citations.
Fair enough, but I would say that the school as a whole is somewhat invested, as well. I mean, let's say some Mormon student group wanted to invite someone to preach in Wheeler auditorium on how African Americans have dark skin color because their ancestors sinned. I'm sure this hypothetical student group wouldn't be very admired, but the administration has some responsibility to the rest of the intellectual community at Berkeley, especially because it's being held on campus. Just my two cents.
Fortunately, many statements that are fallacious can be identified by basic logic and rationality. If you accept that logic and rationality should be universal axioms, then a statement that is false logic can be identified as such, regardless of what anyone says.  
For example, I recently came across an article on the Daily Wire (founded by the aforementioned Shapiro), claiming that gun control should be relaxed rather than tightened. This article cited that gun-free cities had a much higher crime rate, so therefore allowing guns lowers the crime rate. Regardless of your opinion on the gun control debate, this logic is clearly incorrect: gun-free zones occur in large urban areas, and areas that allow open carrying tend to be very rural; the causal factor for the higher crime rate is almost certainly related more to urban density rather than the allowance of open carries. It is not uncommon for Shapiro and his organization to present correlation as causation, no matter how spurious.  
We don't need anyone to tell us that this is incorrect. Don't forget, you can use a basic knowledge of logic, statistics, and reasoning to identify lots of incorrect statements. There is no need for a 1984-esque ministry, if we think about it for ourselves.
unfortunately for some reason a handful of rich frat boys still want to hear them
Well, I'd say it is important to give ample opportunity for the mayor to demonstrate that he is willing to purposely endanger the students by telling police to not intervene and keep the peace. People need to understand that that is the true intent and values of the mayor of the town which the school is embedded in.

Then there's also a great opportunity to allow a demonstrate of truly how violent the liberal left is, that they'll be willing to burn down buildings, and maim and kill people, possibly even some students, just because they are upset by words.

Of course, any harm is tragic, but that can and will still serve as a critically important teachable moment to the rest of the city, state, and country.

That's not what Zionism is, fool. The Jewish people should, like all people, have a homeland: one which cannot be founded on racism, imperialism, and exclusion. I have no problem with Jewish people in Jerusalem. I have a problem with Israel.
Not if they treat the Palestinians like that.
So you support legal restrictions to hate speech but simultaneously oppose direct action to confront it, that view isn't going to address the issue. At this time we don't have legal restrictions to hate speech, so should we just let flourish it? Should we allow Nazis and the alt-right to organize in public spaces and form momentum while we lobby congress to amend the constitution? Of course not, if history has shown one thing it is that the far right political threat cannot be addressed through due processes. In the current political environment we can't rely on a state that equates Nazis to counter protesters to crack down on hateful rhetoric is laughably naive. 

The article you linked is liberal nonsense with a clear bias. Non-violent protest can only ever be successful when outcomes are exclusively contingent on state intervention like gaining civil rights. Shutting down Nazi rallies isn't really contingent upon the state because passing laws that prevent Nazis from organizing is practically impossible. History has shown that directly confronting the far-right right, from the battle of cable street, to the massive anti-fascist movements that developed in Europe in the post-war period, is the only way to defeat them.

Furthermore, what exactly elevates law above direct action, public conscience and rigorous and rational argumentation? The answer is codification, which is in itself meaningless and unnecessary. Mob justice, is nevertheless justice. Notions of justice should be determined by through rational philosophical discourse, laws don't necessarily have to enter into the equation. Whether that justice is carried out be a mob or by cops doesn't make a difference.

> When you read about acts of violence they committed, does that make you more or less inclined to support them?

Violence isn't bad in itself. Only deluded liberals thing this way. When I see an instance of violence I try to gage the context that surrounds it, I don't blindly jump to conclusions. Anyone who does, doesn't have a valid point of view.

>Would you mind linking to some examples of this?

There were many cases like when the [daily stormer called her various names](http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/daily-stormer-heather-heyer-white-supremacist-neo-nazi-hosting-provider-1202526544/) and when the organizer of the rally Jason Kessler made [this statement](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/jason-kessler-twitter-account-insults-heather-heyer-article-1.3424813). Far right discord channels also leaked images of celebration over the killing. Here on Reddit a sub called /r/physical_removal was banned after making fun of the victim and applauding the killer.

>Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos to speak. Ben Shapiro is a conservative Jew. About Milo, the Anti-Defamation League writes:

I have no issue with Ben Shapiro speaking. His views are idiotic, but he isn't alt-right. Milo however, was going to dox an undocumented student, which would have resulted in them being forcibly deported (violence). Calling for mass deportations is hate-speech.

 






Except that the horseshoe is an oversimplified farce that doesn't apply to the antiauthoritarian left.
You're oversimplifying a fairly complex issue. Far-right views explicitly call for violence against minorities, they're overt calls to ethnic-cleansing, genocide and mass deportations. I in principle oppose authoritarianism, death camps and would be perfectly happy classifying calls for dictatorial rule, *death camps* and throwing people out of helicopters from right and the left and as hate-speech towards various ethnic groups and humanity in general.

Its important to note that authoritarian leftist rhetoric is primarily a tendency towards centralization and revolution. These aren't explicit calls for the deliberate disenfranchisement of certain groups or the murder of innocent civilians.

Marxist-Leninism-Maoism caused millions of deaths in its implementation- however to explain those failures one must look to to how said ideologies were implemented because nothing within Marxist Leninist texts explicitly calls for genocide. In China for example, it wasn't collectivization that led to the famines, but other policies enacted by the state namely, shipping out food to support other socialist states despite the shortage at home, poor crop yields owning to locust swarms that came about because the state mandated that their natural predators (sparrows) be killed en-masse to protect crop yields, news of the famine was suppressed because figures of authority didn't want the state to find out they hadn't achieved their quotas and there was a drought. There are very specific policies that led to atrocities under authoritarian socialist governments that aren't necessarily tied to the ideology itself but to undue bureaucracy and centralization.

Furthermore, if one must implicate an ideology solely violent potential of its proposed policies, then one must implicate capitalism, which is solely responsible for poverty in the 21st century. Currently, under the free market our so-called ""wants"" are destroying the planet, result in a huge amount of waste while millions all over the world don't have their basic needs met. Capitalism creates poverty, 18 million die every year from poverty related causes, the world produces 1.18 times the food required to feed everyone yet 868 millions people go hungry, there are more than 5 vacant homes per homeless in America. People in developed nations are trapped in a cycle of starvation and poverty because their labor isn't valuable enough to the market and therefore don't have opportunities for advancement, if their labor isn't valued they lack access to services, if they lack access to services they can't develop skills. Labor that isn't valuable to capitalism starves; we produce more than enough food to feed the world and possess the means to transport it over thousands of miles. People living in poverty should be able to access resources to develop though their own enterprise, not through foreign exploitation.

Would you propose that calls to expand globalization and free the markets also be classified as dangerous, seeing as many more would die without the government reigning in the market? Your argument is rife with double-standards. 

**Explicitly violent ideologies should be censored, implicitly violent ideologies can at-least be engaged with in rational debate.** Its not difficult. The German law you cited ""abusive criticism of a foreign state leader,"" has nothing to do with hate speech or explicit calls to genocidal violence and profiling. Its a pretty absurd restriction to ban abuse of foreign leaders. Principles must justify themselves, they aren't self justifying and free speech, as I've already pointed out, is logically incoherent and doesn't exist in practice- two points you've conveniently ignored. 
Yeah. I think regardless of what side you support, violence among protestors is just not okay. I think the mayor is afraid to police the antifa protestors because of their association with Blm. We've seen he said he was going to be firmer with the white supremacists, but I hope overall they'll make all groups more accountable.
The mayor followed BAMN on Facebook, a group who's name implies violence is an acceptable way to achieve political and/or social goals.
> Also, why are you citing Civil Rights and Vietnam as failures for free speech? You are aware that Berkeley was the home of the Free Speech Movement around that time, I hope?

Regardless, ""well-reasoned debate"" didn't actually end up solving those issues.
""Google is hard""
If they presented something so stupid I'd hope that nobody shows up.  In that case, who cares?
Pretty much all speakers are often fallacious for rhetorical purposes, and you can't ban them all. Plus, ""basic logic and rationality"" doesn't really mean anything, unless you want all speakers to structure their arguments like formal proofs.

Also just because Shapiro uses a fallacious argument doesn't mean that good arguments for gun deregulation don't also exist, and it doesn't mean that he is wrong. If you enforced what you want then all speakers would be dry, safe academics discussing opinions backed up by years of consensus

Yeah I guess, but what's the harm in that?

For example if some flat earthers wanted to speak at Cal why ban them?  In fact I would find it to be interesting and funny to see what the Q&A would look like.
> telling police to not intervene and keep the peace.

During BLM protests in 2014, the cops tears gassed peaceful students. They also beat people over the head with batons, some protestors suffered brain damage and the injured filed a class action lawsuit. Thats why the police didn't escalate at the Milo protestors, because they end up hurting people and further antagonizing the crowd.

>maim and kill people

Last time I checked Antifa had killed zero people. [**73%** of terror attacks in America since 2001 have been perpetrated by the far right according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/opinion/finsbury-park-terrorist-attack-far-right.html?mcubz=0).

> In June 2015, Dylann Roof was inspired by the “hate facts” posted on Daily Stormer and Council of Conservative Citizens to murder nine people at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina.

> In July 2015, John Russell Houser, a far-right former bar owner, shot and killed two people and injured nine others before committing suicide in a Lafayette, LA movie theater which was playing Trainwreck, due to its feminist themes and characters, as well as its lead actor's Jewish background. Houser was said to have been a misogynist and praised the actions of Adolf Hitler on online message boards.

> In November of 2015, a group of well-armed 4chan regulars attended a Black Lives Matter camp in Minneapolis, harassing them with racial slurs. They opened fire on activists attempting to chase them out when they returned a second night, wounding five.

> just because they are upset by words.

Nazis, white nationalists and the alt-right endorse violence in some form against minorities. They openly advocate for mass deportations, racial segregation and ethnic cleansing. Giving a platform to far-right views provides them with the ability to recruit more people and bring existing members together in an open physical space, which in turn allows them to consolidate resources and plan for the future. It's how movements are formed. Giving the far-right a platform gives momentum to their organizational efforts, which in turn harm people. Words have consequences. 


Most political violence in this country is right wing.  Stop being thick.

>You support legal restrictions to hate speech but simultaneously oppose direct action to confront it.

Clarification: I don't oppose direct action.  I oppose _violent_ direct action.

Anyway, I don't see a contradiction here.  It is logically consistent for someone to say they oppose private murder in response to private murder, but favor capital punishment.  The difference is due process and rule of law.

>In the current political environment we can't rely on a state that equates Nazis to counter protesters to crack down on hateful rhetoric is laughably naive.

That's why our goal should be to oppose Trump as effectively as possible and not [shoot ourselves in the foot](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/thinking-strategically-about-free-speech-and-violence).

>massive anti-fascist movements that developed in Europe in the post-war period

So you are claiming that antifa defeated Nazis in Europe **after** WWII was won by the Allies?  Forgive me if this sounds a little bit like taking credit for someone else's work.

>Furthermore, what exactly elevates law above direct action, public conscience and rigorous and rational argumentation? The answer is codification, which is in itself meaningless and unnecessary. Mob justice, is nevertheless justice. Notions of justice should be determined by through rational philosophical discourse, laws don't necessarily have to enter into the equation. Whether that justice is carried out be a mob or by cops doesn't make a difference.

I'm impressed with your faith in the ability of _mobs_ to operate based on rational arguments.

Let me guess: Left wing mobs always operate based on rigorous, rational arguments, whereas right wing mobs are always driven by xenophobia and base emotions like racism.  Did I get it right?  I suppose the reign of terror was a rational left-wing mob operating based on rigorous arguments?

Fun fact: The right makes the same claim, that they are the rational ones and you are the emotional ones.  I think both sides are full of it.  Mobs are mobs.  It's not all that different from fans at a sporting event.  The underlying psychology is the same.

Ingroup bias is a human universal.  My group is always better than your group.  The line you're peddling is the oldest one in the book.

https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/851263248344905

Didn't read anything in his statements where he ""admitted pedophilia"".


I imagine that such a ridiculous talk would draw little genuine interest, indeed. But I'm questioning if an intellectual organization like Berkeley should even deign to respect requests to have talks like these. In a similar vein, if certain students on campus wanted a class that preaches that climate change is a conspiracy perpetuated by all scientists, I would say that it would be more than reasonable for the school to deny such a request. As one of the top academic and intellectual locations in the world, why should Berkeley cater to those who cannot think or speak coherently? We are here to spread knowledge, thought, and different world views. It is a waste of resources to include those that are very clearly flooded with fallacies and inconsistencies.
I don't think all speakers are fallacious. In fact, I've seen many political speeches that are well-reasoned, and do not make the same mistakes like those I've mentioned above.  
I maintain that basic logic and rationality mean *a lot*, especially in identifying incorrect arguments. If I were to say, ""Because both great apes and humans exist today, it is absolutely impossible that evolution happened"", you could immediately identify where my logic is wrong. Namely, the assumption that evolution is purely linear. There was no need for you to formalize exactly why I was wrong.  
Similarly, there is no requirement to make all speeches formal proofs. One can convey his/her point very well without such rigorous academic language, and do it so that it isn't fallacious. I would argue that's what I am doing here (at least attempting to), and in my biased opinion I think this reads quite fluidly, not like a formal proof.  
Regarding the gun control argument above, you're absolutely right in that there are some good arguments  for gun deregulation. However, the point is that Shapiro's publications *did not* use them. Instead, his article appeals to clearly incorrect logic. Even if his final point might not be actually wrong (a point that is at least debatable), his statements are individually wrong. It's like arguing, ""humans and chimps both like to eat plants, so they must be closely related evolutionarily"". Even though the final conclusion is correct, forgive me if I find the person saying this to be an unfit speaker. Instead of inviting Shapiro, let's invite a gun deregulation advocate who actually understands and uses rational arguments.  
I'm not encouraging speakers who are dry and require years of consensus. I'm only encouraging speakers who are able to formulate arguments in a rational and logical manner---again, not as a formal proof, but in a way that clearly isn't fallacious. We don't need consensus to recognize an argument as being well-reasoned or rife with inconsistencies and fallacies. As a final thought, if you can't even formulate a coherent argument, and anything you say is immediately identified as being poorly reasoned, what gives you the right to speak at the number one public university in the world?
t. has never taken a class in these disinclines
Sounds like you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

I can give you *lots* of citations of the left being super violent recently.

Even if what you say is true (it isn't), my comment would be be entirely relevant: this is an *excellent* opportunity for people to see how violent the left can be and is.
[deleted]
Lmao, what is there to not understand about that? I support Jews in Jerusalem, just as I support them in New York, Buenos Aires, and every other city. I'm well aware of the history in the region, and well aware why many Israelis and Jews support a country whose very establishment was to create an ethno-state. They're endangered, around the world and especially in the Middle East. That doesn't make their actions right.
>Clarification: I don't oppose direct action. I oppose violent direct action.

Peaceful direct action does *nothing* to prevent Nazis from organizing and developing momentum especially when the state is constrained to be complacent.

>The difference is due process and rule of law.

Which doesn't provide any support in the face of far-right organizing.

> That's why our goal should be to oppose Trump as effectively as possible and not shoot ourselves in the foot.

This isn't really about opposing Trump. As far as antifa is concerned its about purging far right organizing from their communities. 

>So you are claiming that antifa defeated Nazis in Europe after WWII was won by the Allies? Forgive me if this sounds a little bit like taking credit for someone else's work.

I didn't really claim that, don't put words in my mouth. Antifa effectively addressed nascent Nazi movements in the post-war period, there's a whole book about it [by Mark Bray](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-intimate-history-of-antifa).

>I'm impressed with your faith in the ability of mobs to operate based on rational arguments.

This is a matter of labels, ""mob"" has a pejorative connotation. I have faith in the ability of individuals to organize horizontally and act in mutual aid and solidarity based on rational principles like they do in Rojava and did in revolutionary Catalonia. 

>Mobs are mobs.

I wouldn't say that. I'd take a left-wing mob over the state and capitalism any day.

>This is the problem with mob justice.

As long as it gets the job done. Honestly, since we're pretty far down the thread I'll have you know that as far as I'm concerned, being able to label anyone on the political right a Nazi and then dispose of them accordingly is an ideal state of affairs. White genocide is the right genocide. Unlike my political views, my praxis is fairly unforgiving. 







Comparing the position of lawful protestors from one extreme to the other might be apples and oranges, but it's not really relevant to this. Comparing a *violent* Antifa protestor to a *violent* KKK protestor is a valid, 1:1 equivalence. They're the same problem, solved the same way.
Must be hard to hear things right from that high horse you're riding, friend.

To be clear, its a joke. White genocide is an exaggerated term white nationalists use to describe high levels of immigration and interracial sex, which they claim is replacing the white race. Literal white genocide isn't the way to go. I'm using the term in that context, no need to freak out. 
Still waiting for that white supremacist article...
> Illegal immigrants should be prosecuted

Why? Stop bootlicking and come up with a real argument. 
The far right claims that the use of Nazi salutes and so on is just a joke.
Nazi salutes have a fair bit of serious historical significance. The term ""white genocide"" has been a joke since its inception. 
Sorry dude, joking about mass murder makes you an asshole either way.

Former Chancellor Berdahl once said that Chancellors (or university presidents) were generally only effective for about five years. That was because each time a chancellor did something some people were against, s/he made permanent enemies who would then be suspicious of or opposed to the administration in the future. But each time s/he did something that some people liked, the response was usually *""well, that was the right thing do anyway, why should they be given credit for doing what was the obvious right thing?...""* Essentially, it's easy to accumulate opponents; less easy to accumulate strong supporters. After about five years the number of actions / enemies / opponents builds up to a level that makes it increasingly difficult to accomplish anything meaningful.

Also, the responsibilities of a chancellor today are vast, the demands on their time incessant, and they burn out after a while.

Good riddance, one of the most disrespectful people I've met.
Thanks for the list!

A century ago in 1923, after President Campbell was appointed, the UC Regents also approved two UC vice-presidential appointees for the first time. Walter Morris Hart was the vice-president focused on academic programs; Robert Gordon Sproul, was vice-president for business operations.

When Campbell announced his retirement, both Hart and Sproul were strong contenders for the Presidency, and Sproul won out, despite the fact that most UC presidents had come from distinguished academic backgrounds. (Sproul was a Cal alumnus, but basically all of his work experience was in business operations / alumni / governmental relations, not in academic administration.) 

Sproul remained president for an unprecedented 28 years--longest tenure by far in UC history, and something that is likely to never been repeated, unless we end up with a physically immortal cyborg or AI Chancellor someday. 

Sproul maintained really strong, direct, personal control over all UC operations but as the institution grew (particularly with UCLA, and other campuses) Sproul was forced to appoint Provosts, who were supposed to have a lot of autonomy in running the campuses. The Provost at Berkeley was Monroe Deutsch (yes, same guy as Deutsch Hall), who was also an alumnus, a respected member of the faculty, and also the first senior administrator of UC who was Jewish. In practice Sproul continued to run things, but in the early 1950s The Regents insisted on Chancellors for each campus, which led to Clark Kerr being appointed the first Chancellor at Berkeley. Still, Kerr wrote in his memoirs that when he became Chancellor he essentially had no assigned duties and no staff--Sproul continued to run things.

Finally, when Sproul retired 6 years later, Kerr was picked as his successor as president and began the allow Chancellors a lot of campus autonomy, which has grown considerably ever since.
*""...Think they'll name anything after her?""*

She's the 12th Chancellor. Of her predecessors, only two (Tien and Kerr) have a significant Berkeley building or property named for them, so the chance is probably somewhat low. (some others have programs, or centers, named for them, but that's lower profile).

Most of the UC Presidents up through Sproul had buildings named for them, in part because those buildings were built with State money, so UC didn't have to take into consideration honoring big donors when selecting a building name. 

Of the ten Chancellors who don't yet have something named for them, the two most deserving are probably Heyman--ten years of service, and a huge amount accomplished, including reorganization of the biological sciences, first campus master plan in decades, construction of a lot of new housing--and Berdahl, who also pushed ahead a lot of student housing development despite indifference from most of the UC leadership. 

If I were in charge (ha!) I would name the Foothill Housing for Heyman, at least.

 * this is somewhat reasonable, but also a logistic nightmare; possible to force, however, if it must come to it.

If you mean literally end the semester

* This is an utter disaster. All the seniors who thought they were graduating? Rip them. All the students wasted rent money, money which they might not be able to replace.

Do they refund tuition? Because people spent a whole lotta money on zero credits. If they do, then can the university even afford that? They've already spent a lot of that income on employees, equipment, utilities, etc. 

If they don't, then tens of thousands of people are left having spent money on nothing.
With Stanford and UW, they're on quarter so it's easy for them to cancel the rest of the two weeks they're supposed to be there. It's harder for us because when do we end this? In May?
""If they die they die"" - Carol Christ
>The administration have already got our money

Believe it or not, the administration doesn't only care about money. They do in fact care about education (otherwise they would just run the budget into the ground with debt, and leave the mess for someone else to clean up).

Anyone who paid tuition, signed a lease, etc. will get completely shafted by class cancellation. If you refund the semester, the University will not have enough money to operate (because the funding from other sources, such as the state of California, is not enough).

Also, we had this situation previously with the ""public safety"" power shutoff. The administration closed campus in anticipation of a planned power shutoff by PGE which never happened. That wasted precious time. I think the administration is understandably reluctant to close campus again and lose more time.
Carol Christ have a good excuse to do nothing: basically administrative people are deferring to their higher ups to avoid any personal responsibility. Why cancel classes now and bear the logistical costs when you can just say ""i was only following orders (suggestions) from the CA health dept."" when shits goes down hill and people start going sick?
[removed]
Because they aren’t life or death for most people, people pay a lot of money to attend this school, people like having physical classes, you learn better in physical classes, there’s no evidence of an eminent threat to the campus community, a lot of people will probably be mad. Just to name a few
>this is somewhat reasonable, but also a logistic nightmare; possible to force, however, if it must come to it.

wouldn't this be forceable by just shutting down campus, like during the blackouts? 

I'm 1000% not in favor of just pretending the semester didn't happen though
[deleted]
""Weaklings die, big deal""
you're right, but there are some things that must be done in (or preferably before) the case of emergency...
Well, yeah. The administration could just say ""all in-person classes canceled; you gotta use zoom/record videos + take home midterms"". 

It would cause mayhem on the other side, because 1) many professors have no idea what the fuck they're doing with technology

2) Setting up take-home assignments which can't be trivially cheated on can be really hard for some classes

3) How the fuck do you teach a lab, or musical performance/theatre class online

4) Not a problem for probably the majority of students, *BUT* there are students who do not own a personal computer and can't afford to do so.

Like, it would be a clusterfuck; possible, but a clusterfuck. You can clearly see why the administration wants to use it as a last resort.
Eh it's different because we would go in knowing it would be for much longer than just 3 or 4 days. We'd have to try to get classes and exams online, which is difficult for some classes. That said, it is much more difficult to explain to hundreds of parents why their kid got sick and why the school didn't do anything to stop it. Especially with other schools (even those on semester systems) taking more serious steps to move classes online, we prove to be in a pretty bad spot if things go south.
yeah exactly. But it's easy for stanford and uw to say for now that they are suspending classes for the rest of the quarter. There would be an uproar if Cal cancelled classes for the rest of the semester, when we're not even halfway through it.
those are good points, especially the one where students without access to technology at home would be disadvantaged
Ee16a is moving labs online
Thanks for this - got a lot more info. But it still seems pretty stupid that this isn't what the campus has already done. Sure it's a lot of work, but as adminstration, I feel like they have a responsibility for the health and we'll being of students. Every day they delay implementing online classes is more people possibly infected.  Sure there are drawbacks but it seems like a no-brainer when the alternative is coronavirus...

It's just really frustrating to see no response from the Chancellor's office apart from a note to profs...

Can’t we do the same using spring break as our timeline? Suspend all in person activities until after spring break and reassess the situation then?
I'd rather have an uproar over online only classes than just let everyone get sick and spread the virus
EE16a can do so because, well, the labs aren't that involved. In this case, they're basically chopping part of the hands-on part off, like all the parts where you need a soldering iron. Instead, you just do the jupyter notebook part. EE16a is half linear algebra, so you can do the theoretical parts.

However, you can't do the same with, say, chemistry classes. If you remove all the hands-on part of a chemistry lab... then it doesn't even exist anymore.
I'm curious as to how they will do that, seeing as people don't have oscilloscopes and stuff at home.
bad fucking bot
I agree it’s much easier with EE, but if it comes down to it other classes might be able to salvage something with this method.
From Piazza

Hi everyone,
 
Starting with Touch 1, a remote lab option will be offered for any students who prefer to complete the labs without coming to the lab in Cory 140. Regular in-person labs will continue for the foreseeable future, at the usual times.
 
For each week, you now have the option of attending either your regularly enrolled section in person, or completing a remote lab. You will receive the same credit for completion for either option. 
 
In-person Sections: Lab staff will still run regular 3 hour lab sections. In order to protect everyone, the lab staff will minimize contact with equipment when debugging students’ circuits. Instead, we will verbally guide you through any questions and bugs you may have. We all would like to provide this hands-on lab experience for everyone, and will do so as long as it is safe and controllable. For this week’s lab, Touchscreen 1, we encourage those doing in-person labs to bring their own laptops, as there is no additional software needed.
 
The lab (Cory 140) is regularly cleaned by the department, and we have requested additional cleaning as well as more disinfecting products for the lab equipment (computers, power supplies, cables, and other machines). As all authorities are suggesting, please wash your hands as soon as you leave the lab, and take all normal health precautions that you feel comfortable with. If you are not feeling well, please do not attend labs in person, and complete the remote lab. 
 
Remote labs: The remote lab for Touch 1 should be released by Wednesday (we are developing it right now). For all that choose to complete the remote lab, you will have one week from the release date to complete and submit the lab. For questions and support, please email the TA for your regularly enrolled section, ask on Piazza, or tune into remote call sections. (More information below)
 
Remote labs for each week will consist of a Gradescope quiz (that can be done multiple times), and videos, supplemental exercises, and other resources. Make sure you have your lab kits as you may be asked to build breadboards in the remote version. Checkoffs will be done through the Gradescope quiz, although we have not confirmed the exact details of this yet. You will receive the same credit for completion for either the remote or the in-person versions of the lab. Obviously, the remote version of the lab will not have access to many important machines in the actual lab room, so it will unfortunately not provide the exact same hands-on experience. However, we are developing the content to simulate as much of it as possible, and provide the same learning outcomes and ideas.
In the past, the touch module has been the favorite module for many students. We will keep providing an in-person option for as long as we can to give all students that are interested the opportunity to use the lab equipment. The skills you learn in the labs are beneficial for future classes, including EECS16B, and we are doing our best to replicate the experience for those completing remote labs. 

Remote Call Sections: Seiya’s Wednesday 8am lab will be a remote video support lab section, where interested students will be able to call in for a lab presentation, in-person lab walkthrough, and with questions about the remote lab, as well as receive a walkthrough of the lab. The link to this lab section will be announced by the evening of Tuesday 3/10. All students in the Wednesday 8am section should have already been contacted with their options for this transition. This is the only remote transition section for now, more sections may be added in future weeks depending on demand and updates.
 
If you have any questions, please follow up.
 
TLDR: 

You only need to either complete an in person lab or a remote lab. The in person lab is the same as usual, but the remote lab will be completed solely on your own on your own laptops, similar to homework, but more interactive.

If you want a similar in-person experience / lab office hour style engagement, you can join Seiya's 8am Wednesday section (from 8am to 11am drop in style through Zoom). There will be a presentation and walk throughs for various parts of the remote lab
The same method with, say, ochem would be, well, a joke tbh. The actual experience of doing the experiments is very important. It would retain like 20% of the original experience.
I mean 20% is better than 0, again, if it absolutely comes down to it.
The main issue is if they even deserve the credit if they only had ""online lab"".

If they had to go online, Id imagine the preferred solution would be to straight up cancel the lab classes (you take lab section as separate classes in Chem and bio), because the department couldn't in good faith give people the credit.

In any case, it's a pretty rough choice to make."
bye bye LSCS?,https://i.redd.it/qo4ukwns1q0b1.jpg,2023-05-18 17:11:26,,"They forgot to include Reddit studies
God, the way PR people write... 🤮
Very interesting but makes sense
Whats gonna happen to people whos undeclared right now and trynna declare ds in lns?
“As part of this transformation, the undergraduate data science major and computer science major that are currently within the College of Letters & Science will eventually move to the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society once academic and student support systems are created.”
It would make sense that CS and DS eventually move out of LS entirely and into CDSS.

No school that I know of that has a dedicated school/college for CS/Computing still puts CS in LS college at the same time. NYU is probably the only one but Courant isn’t a college just an institute, and even then it’s very autonomous

Some school like Georgia tech even takes CS out of engineering college and leaves only EE/ECE. But I don’t see Berkeley breaking up the EECS department so CoE is probably gonna keep its share
Uh, will this cause problems for someone trying to double major in economics +CS/DS? I’m CS+Econ and I’m trying to minor in math and philosophy, having to do a simultaneous degree would make my life hell.
true tho
I don't think anything will change for major declaration purposes.
I don’t think anyone knows yet. There doesn’t seem to be any announcement. Anyone’s opinion on here is likely to be speculative until the university makes an official announcement.
“Eventually” feels like the changes are at least a year or two away.
oooo so it’s gonna *really* be gone then
ur forgetting umich. CS and DS is in both LSA and COE.
guess it'll be CDSSCS
I meant a dedicated school like the college of computing at Georgia tech or school of computer science at CMU. If a university has a school like this they mostly take CS out of LS entirely and put it in the aforementioned school

Lots of universities have CS in both LS and CoE like Cal and Umich do. Or is Umich establishing a new college for computing that I am not aware of?"

classes canceled Monday and Tuesday,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9yazqj/classes_canceled_monday_and_tuesday/,2018-11-18 15:24:15,"Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,

I am writing to provide today’s update on air quality conditions, as well as news about decisions regarding classes and campus operations during the days ahead.

Over the weekend we have been closely tracking air quality data, as well as forecasts for Berkeley. Throughout the day today readings from the closest monitor, located in Aquatic Park, indicate that the Air Quality Index (AQI) has remained below 200, the level at which we, in concert with our medical and environmental experts, consider the cancellation of classes. (According to the EPA, a 200 AQI is the level at which everyone, not only those who are medically sensitive to degraded air quality, may experience adverse health effects.) According to current forecasts for tomorrow from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and the National Weather Service, it remains uncertain as to whether current conditions will persist.

After consultation with the Academic Senate, we have decided to cancel all classes for Monday and Tuesday. (Wednesday is not an instructional day.) Many students have already left for home, and we want to provide those who remain on campus with predictability and adequate time for travel planning prior to the Thanksgiving break.  Tomorrow we will provide additional information and suggestions for how students and instructors will be able to compensate for lost class time this semester. It is already clear we will need to take time from Reading, Review, and Recitation Week (12/3-12/7) to make up for missed classes and are therefore encouraging students to plan accordingly and use the days ahead for reading and review, if possible.

For students remaining on campus , please be aware that the following buildings have the best air filtration systems, with air quality that can be 20-40% better than outside conditions: the East Asian Library, the Bio library in VLSB, the stacks of Doe, the Haas Business School complex, the Law library, and the Hargrove library.

Given current conditions, the campus will otherwise be open and operating. However, our medical experts continue to urge those with existing medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality to remain indoors to the extent possible. Staff with individualized health issues and concerns should consult with their respective managers. I would also like to express my ongoing appreciation for the staff who have come to work to provide services essential to the campus community.  

For additional information about how to protect yourself, indoors and out, from wildfire smoke, see this guide provided by the Centers for Disease Control.

Even as the heroic efforts of firefighters are containing and controlling fires burning across the state of California, the death toll continues to mount, the number of those unaccounted for continues to increase, and the scale of loss and suffering continues to grow. Now, as we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, I know we will all consider how, in our own ways, we can express and provide support for our friends and neighbors across the state who are struggling to cope during the most difficult of times. If you are interested in helping out, the state of California is providing information about qualified volunteer opportunities and vetted organizations that are collecting financial contributions. That information is available on the state’s website.

I wish everyone a safe and healthy Thanksgiving.

 

Sincerely,

Carol T. Christ

Spring 2022 instruction update,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rym5hd/spring_2022_instruction_update/,2022-01-07 16:10:16,"Dear Campus Community,

With COVID-19 cases surging and positivity rates on the rise, it’s clear we’re in for a challenging January. As we navigate the omicron wave it’s important that we be especially flexible and patient with one another. In this spirit, we’re writing to share some updates to our instructional plans for the spring semester.

After consultation with the UC Berkeley public health committee, input from students, staff and faculty, and much deliberation, **we have decided to begin the semester with a two-stage process, with most courses being offered fully remote for the first two weeks (Jan. 18-28) and then moving to fully in-person instruction in the third week of the semester on Jan. 31.**

Some courses such as lab sections, studio courses, fieldwork, clinical courses, and graduate seminars may be taught in-person Jan 18-28. For these in-person courses, instructors may require in-person attendance but must offer appropriate make-up arrangements for students who are unable to attend because they have symptoms or are in isolation/quarantine. 

Instructors may teach some courses in hybrid mode (where some students are in-person and others are participating remotely via Zoom) or allow their students to attend their lectures in-person during the initial two-week period. Hybrid is not a desirable modality for many courses; instructors are not required to teach any course in a hybrid mode. 

More details about these plans are available on the [instruction page](https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/instruction/) of the campus [coronavirus site](https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/).

We have chosen this approach for several reasons:

* We believe strongly in the importance of in-person instruction and in providing an in-person experience for our students. Starting on Monday, Jan. 31, 2022, we plan that all classes and sections will be delivered according to their approved modality as listed in the [schedule of classes](https://classes.berkeley.edu/). But, the plans described here are subject to change as pandemic conditions evolve.
* We expect many students, faculty and staff will not be able to come to campus because of the rapid spread of the omicron variant. While we expect this surge to peak in January, we anticipate current pandemic conditions continuing into February. We will use the two-week period of remote instruction to plan for how best to meet the operational needs of our campus with so many students, staff and faculty unable to be on campus because they have symptoms, are isolating/quarantining or have family care issues resulting from omicron. 

The campus will remain open; students, staff and faculty are welcome to come to campus for all other research, administration and operational purposes. Normal campus operations will continue, though we anticipate disruptions resulting from people not being able to come to campus.

As we embark on this latest phase of our response to COVID-19, we ask that you exercise compassion and extend grace to one another. While the pandemic impacts everyone, our individual experiences are deeply personal and unique. We hope that all members of our campus community will find it in their hearts to treat each other with kindness and understanding as we navigate this challenging moment together.

I'm guessing discussions may be allowed to be either in person or hybrid—based on their wording, it's hard to tell.

The latest air quality readings from the most reliable source, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, indicate that the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Berkeley remains below 200. That is the level at which campus guidelines indicate that class cancellation should be considered.

However, campus medical staff are advising that all of us limit our time outside and refrain from heavy exertion when outdoors. In addition, medical staff advise that those who have underlying medical conditions that could make them more sensitive to the current air quality should consider staying home, particularly if they commute by foot and bike. In that context we ask faculty and supervisors to be as accommodating as possible.

> Dear Campus Community,

>I am writing to update you on the latest air quality readings, decisions regarding tomorrow’s class schedule, and the status of Saturday’s Big Game.

>As noted in previous messages, we have been closely tracking current air quality data, as well as forecasts for Berkeley. As of 3pm today the reading for the closest monitor, located in Aquatic Park, indicates that the Air Quality Index (AQI) surpassed 200, the level at which our guidelines require consideration of class cancellations. In addition, the forecast for tomorrow from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District now indicates that conditions are expected to deteriorate. In that context, and based on the guidance of experts on campus, we must assume that the 200 AQI threshold will be exceeded tomorrow. As a result, we have decided to cancel all classes for the remainder of the day today, and on Friday.

>While the campus is now essentially closed, there are a limited number of campus operations that must continue. They include University Health Services, dining halls and residential facilities, the optometry clinic, UCPD, OLAC, and the Office of Environment, Health & Safety. This is not a comprehensive list.

Class cancelled through end of semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fi4uiu/class_cancelled_through_end_of_semester/,2020-03-13 12:02:51,"Dear campus community,

We are writing with updates about the delivery of instruction and on-campus housing.  

We have decided to continue to offer instruction remotely via Zoom, teleconferencing and other virtual platforms for lecture, discussion, and seminar courses (as well as other types of courses such as laboratory, clinic, and studio courses, that have already successfully developed strategies for remote learning) through the end of the semester. We are doing this in response to guidance from public health authorities to implement social distancing in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Protecting the health and safety of members of the campus community remains our priority. We also are committed to preserving our academic mission. We are working on solutions to offer alternative modes of instruction to more students in non-lecture courses and settings. For the small number of courses that do not have a remote option, students will need to get guidance from their instructors on how they are adopting social distancing practices, which ideally leaves six feet of space between individuals. More information to instructors is forthcoming today. 
1. We will support students and families in their decisions about where it is best for them to reside during this public health emergency. We recognize that some students may want or need to remain on campus through spring break or return to campus after spring break. They will be allowed to do so. It is possible we will close one or more of the residence halls and relocate students into fewer locations, as well as adjust our operations to improve social distancing (e.g., spreading students out, delivering box meals, scheduling use of common facilities, etc.).  
2. Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees if they decide to move out.  The campus will approve all requests for relief from further payment obligations of campus housing contracts from students who decide to move out of campus housing and Blackwell Hall for the remainder of this academic year.  The campus will provide these students with a prorated refund of any campus housing fees that have already been paid by these students, based upon their effective move-out date. Students will have the choice to receive relief from payment obligations based upon an effective move-out date of April 1, April 10, or April 20. Students who want to move out must complete their written request and move out prior to April 20.  The amount of the actual cash refund that a student receives after being released from the student's campus housing payment obligations may be dependent upon the degree to which the student's housing costs are covered by the student's financial aid package. FAQS, further guidance, specific details, and online forms to complete to obtain housing refunds is being developed and will be published no later than Monday, March 16.

Bowles Hall, International House (I-House), co-ops, fraternities and sororities, private apartments and other housing facilities not owned by the campus have their own housing policies. Please contact your building/house manager for details. In the event your current housing will close down and you do not have other options or would prefer to stay in Berkeley, please contact Cal Housing for assistance in securing a university housing contract.

Depending on the guidance and direction of public health officials regarding COVID-19 in the coming weeks, it is possible that the campus may generally resume in-person instruction at some point during the semester. If in-person instruction resumes, in-person course attendance will continue to not be mandatory for the rest of the semester. Students who are able to make a decision now to finish this semester remotely are welcome to do so. 

We understand that some student workers may need their student-employee wages to cover their basic needs yet would prefer to leave campus and the local area. Supervisors are encouraged to explore work assignments that these students could perform remotely over a number of weeks. If such arrangements cannot be worked out, under UC systemwide policy, students may receive two weeks of paid administrative leave. Many students work a few hours a week, so such a leave could cover many weeks.

Given the dynamic nature of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we advise students leaving campus for spring break that they take along any course materials they would need to keep up with classes that are being taught remotely from an off-campus location. We strongly advise students to refrain from non-essential travel during spring break.

Despite this decision regarding instruction, critical campus functions, including our research enterprise and student support services, remain operational, some with adjusted service hours. We will rely on individual units to communicate any changes with your constituents. We have advised that managers and supervisors offer flexible work arrangements for employees when possible, yet we recognize that many of our operations require employees to be on campus.
Currently there are no positive cases of COVID-19 related to any members of our campus community. Through the work of our dedicated University Health Services professionals and in close concert with local public health colleagues, we are monitoring the situation closely. 
Please take care of yourselves, do your part to “flatten the curve,” and slow the spread of COVID-19, respect those around you in accordance with our Principles of Community, stay up to date on COVID-19-related developments on campus, and be well. 


Sincerely,


Carol Christ

Chancellor

 ","Title is a bit misleading. Attendance is no longer mandatory through the semester, but classes may resume after spring break for those who'd prefer to attend (depending how things evolve in the coming weeks).

Massmail: Update on plans for the spring semester and new booster and testing requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rme5xh/massmail_update_on_plans_for_the_spring_semester/,2021-12-22 12:35:47,"Dear Campus Community,

We write to update you on our plans for the spring semester. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and have been meeting this week to consider changes to our response. Our decision-making is guided by science and the expertise of our own public health experts. We will continue to monitor the situation throughout the break and communicate any changes as needed.

As we write, there is great uncertainty regarding the omicron variant. Our campus public health committee advises that omicron is much more infectious than prior variants, that omicron will be the dominant variant when instruction resumes on Jan. 18, and that even people who have obtained a booster can be infected with omicron. They remain especially concerned about the impact the pandemic has on those who are immunocompromised or otherwise at higher risk of complications.

Our campus public health committee also advises that people who are vaccinated and have a booster usually have mild or no symptoms after infection. Is the infection also mild in unvaccinated people? Will the coming surge in infection also result in a surge in hospitalizations? We do not yet know. But we expect to know much more in the coming weeks. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, our plans are subject to change based on the latest public health information and guidance.

Presently, the plan is for all classes to be in-person, including those that begin before Jan. 18. Based upon the recommendations of our campus public health committee, and consistent with public health mandates and guidance, we plan to emphasize three primary strategies during the spring semester for responding to omicron: increased vaccination (which includes obtaining boosters), increased testing, and continuation of the indoor face-covering mandate. We do not expect to rely significantly upon remote instruction or large-scale cancellation of in-person activities.

Vaccine boosters
Yesterday, the UC system announced that the current UC COVID-19 vaccination policy requires faculty, staff and students to obtain a booster shot as soon as they are eligible. Our campus expects all faculty, staff and students who are eligible to get their booster no later than the start of instruction on Jan. 18 (or the first day they are on campus if they are in a program that starts before Jan. 18).

Students are reminded that compliance with the vaccination policy is a condition of being physically on campus and that non-compliance can result in discipline. Faculty and staff are reminded that compliance is a condition of employment. Please review the instructions for how to update your vaccination record in eTang with your booster information.

Please note that eligibility for the booster has been expanded. If you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you’re eligible for a booster six months after your last shot. If you got the Johnson & Johnson/Johnson vaccine, you’re eligible two months after you got the shot.

If you were vaccinated abroad with other COVID-19 vaccines you are most likely eligible for a booster as well. See the CDC booster shot eligibility page for more information.

Increased testing
We expect everyone to get tested before returning to work, study, or to live on campus. If you have traveled away from the Bay Area for the break, then we recommend that you get tested before travel; additionally, we expect you to get tested when you return to the Bay Area and before you come to the campus. If you test positive, you must isolate in accordance with the city of Berkeley public health order. 

We are working to greatly increase the options for getting tested on campus. You may also be able to access testing through an outside health care provider, through your local health department or by purchasing an at-home test kit. We are attempting to procure tens of thousands of antigen self-tests for you to use to test at home as part of our overall testing strategy.

Our focus will be on making tests easily available and we will not generally require everyone to demonstrate proof of a negative test in order to come to campus. We will however continue, for the time being, all of the mandatory testing of faculty, staff and students that was required during the fall semester.

Face coverings
The expert consensus is that face coverings effectively reduce transmission. We therefore will continue to require their use after curtailment and when instruction resumes. These requirements will be the same as those that were in place at the end of the fall semester.  The campus will continue to seek advice from the public health committee about when to relax this requirement in accordance with the City of Berkeley health department’s requirements.

With regard to ventilation: In order to provide the most inhospitable conditions for transmission, we plan to continue ventilating buildings with the maximum possible amount of outside air for the present time. This means it could be very cold inside during January; we, therefore, ask that you plan to dress accordingly. We appreciate that this is a hardship for many but believe this is the best approach when balancing all of the risks.

Instruction
We’re continuing to plan for fully in-person instruction in the spring. UC Berkeley is a residential campus and our students have repeatedly emphasized their expectation to be able to learn in person. We will make every effort to continue to offer in-person instruction to the extent possible.

We do need to be prepared for the possibility that we may need to pivot to remote learning for brief periods during the semester. For example, if a very large number of faculty, staff and students are all required to isolate at the same time, it may not be practically possible to operate our facilities. 

If we find that a remote start to classes is necessary either operationally or due to public health guidance or requirements, we will advise you of that as soon as possible.

Events
We also presently plan to continue to permit in-person events to the extent consistent with CDC guidance and state and city health department requirements. We will consider limiting or canceling large campus events at which vaccination status is not checked as a condition of entry.  We also continue to urge event planners to consider holding events remotely and to enter into contracts that anticipate the possibility of events being canceled or moved online. Event organizers should regularly check for updates to the campus coronavirus events page.

Looking ahead
The return to in-person instruction this past year has been a source of hope and revitalization for many. We are committed to doing everything we can to continue operating in person while taking evidence-based measures to protect our community.

We are incredibly grateful for the efforts of our community to protect one another and are optimistic about the future. We hope you have a restful winter break and wish you a happy new year.
