"Graduate students led by David Wagner, a computer science professor, demonstrate how intelligible noises can be used on voice-identification programs like Siri and Cortana to hack into smart phones and tablets. These noises can also be maliciously used by advertisers to send spam and spread viruses.","http://www.tomsguide.com/us/voice-command-hijack-google-now,news-22942.html",2016-07-07 21:06:14,,

I won’t shit on berkeley but like i’ll explain how exactly the lack of TAs has put a huge burden on my shoulders and made it harder to learn material
Miss Hilfinger.
All indicators are showing that the EECS department will approve PNP by 5pm tomorrow. No need to spam faculty.
I sent one to the EECS chair!
Not for EECS majors.
ok bet i’ll send one to eecs chair soon too
LSCS falls under EECS. CoE EECS majors will have to wait for the engineering college to approve it before they can give it the go-ahead.
Looks like from David Wagner that this is not happening for COE... WTF...
All depends on the college of engineering. I think now that L&S approved it, engineering ideally will approve it soon but is taking their time because they have different requirements. Instead of spamming EECS faculty, try spamming the engineering dean lol.
I did. Look at my other post; this post if from a few days ago.
Nah bro cause in Fall 2020, L&S got P/Np and CoE students were screwed over by the college
Didn't notice that. Good luck bro"
