"Cal doctoral student Eva Hagberg Fisher whose academic career changed dramatically after architecture professor Nezar AlSayyad placed his hand on her upper thigh and proposed they become ""close friends"" agreed not to sue Cal after $80,000 settlement. AlSayyad ($211,000/year salary) remains employed.",http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/UC-Berkeley-settles-sex-harassment-claim-against-12442973.php,2017-12-19 21:08:41,,"[deleted]
Hell I'll let you guys touch my thigh for $80k
Horny professor
I need to get a professor to touch my legs. I'll even split the settlement with them since they'll be able to keep the job I don't see how I can't figure this out.
Human interactions are complicated and I think any effort to enumerate exactly which actions are and are not appropriate would ultimately fail.  So much is context dependent or dependent on the existing relationship between two people.  I mean, your hug was just fine, but if a professor you had never met was trying to hug you in the hall - that would be super weird.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't punish actions that definitely cross a line, though.  Just that there will always be some cases that fall into some gray, hard to define, area.  
>Again, this is more of a stray thought; in this one instance, a line was clearly crossed and the professor should have to be disciplined.  

A great rule of thumb is that people should not request intimacy of people they are in charge of. They should also usually decline this intimacy in private or when it goes beyond casual. However, these weasel words (private, casual, intimacy) are not definite and are very different in diffwrent cultures. Ask a professor from France what an appropriate greeting is - You'll get a very different answer than from German or American cultures.
I'd let someone shit on my face for $80k. Honestly I'm amazed at how juicy some of these harassment settlements are. What he did was gross and creepy but not to the tune of five figures.
Agreed - so given how much ambiguity there is, should we really be as harsh as we're being as a society toward people like this professor? 
Imo the $80k has more to do with 1. sweeping the problem away as fast and possible and 2. not getting embroiled in huge legal fees. Having said that, what is the correct price to pay someone for sexual harassment. Esp. in an educational environment that person (may or may not) be paying 5 figures to attend.

Yes we should. Every system is perfectly designed to produce its result. If we have a system that abuses students and fails to correct problems, it must change in a way that scares the complacent.


This speaks to the really terrible preparation we do for professors. A friend of mine did a rigorous survey of graduate students in a different part of America and found widespread neglect of responsibilities, abuse of grad students, and psychological manipulation. It was not designed to find illegal abuse, but plenty of grad students being 'asked' to mow lawns.
It's not like these faculty can just claim complete ignorance here - the university does make employees go through sexual harassment training and it's (likely) made very clear that hitting on your students is not allowed.  Even in this case, the professor hasn't been fired. And for the many other cases where the transgression is more ambiguous (most of which probably aren't ever made public) punishments are likely just a slap on the wrist.
Yes. The onus is on these people to adapt to our culture and laws. Germany has an age of consent of 14, but we don't make exceptions if a German adult tries to have sex with a 14-year-old because of ambiguity. Our cultural expectations are just different.
Rip inbox"
Dozens of Cal graduate students sent a starkly worded petition to campus leaders demanding professor Nezar AlSayyad be suspended for sexually harassing grad student Eva Hagberg Fisher. Petition signers are refusing to attend his classes and are asking for another way to finish the semester's work.,http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/UC-Berkeley-students-demand-professor-s-10614425.php,2016-11-14 23:37:46,,
