thoughts 8 units over the summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nk770f/thoughts_8_units_over_the_summer/,2021-05-24 13:14:46,"Sorry, I know these posts come up on this subreddit often but I wanted to get some more opinions. I'm planning on taking PS1 w/ Thomas Kent (Session D) and Hist7B w/ Sandra Smith (Session C) this summer. Both are 4 units and basically during the same session. These classes also both have around a B+ average on Berkeleytime, although I don't know much about these two professors. 

I know its doable, but I was kind of looking forward to a more chill summer where I can still go out and enjoy summer break. I don't want to be super stressed trying to get A's like I was during fall and spring sem. Anyone have any idea what the workload will be like? Both these classes fulfill really useful requirements for my major and will get me ahead, but I don't mind subbing one for an easy 2 unit class (I need at least 6 units for fin aid) although I'd really like to take these 2 if I can. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!","Idk abt PS1 but Ik History 7B is hella easy and totally doable to get an A. It’s asynchronous so you don’t even have to attend lectures and the work in the class is minimal compared to other social science classes
I took history 7b this spring semester and the work was pretty chill. Also a pretty solid and relatively easy class to get an A
Took ps1 this spring and it was ok (ended with an A-). The midterm was pretty easy but the rubric for the essays were kinda vague imo. He’s lecturing is kinda dull and I enjoyed it more when it was Van Houweling lecturing, but it’s still a pretty good class. Decent amount of reading. No class or test curves tho
I took PS 1 with Kent last summer and it wasn’t too bad. There’s a midterm, final, final paper, group project, and weekly quizzes, so it’ll definitely keep you busy, but grading’s pretty good and lectures are completely asynchronous, so it’s manageable overall
OP, since these are lower, transferable courses, I highly recommend just taking them at a community college and saving money. You don’t have to submit any extra forms to Cal; just enroll in the ccc system
hi I know it's been a while since ur original post LMAOOO but did you ever end up taking hist7b w/ smith? if so how was it?
awesome thanks sm!!
sorry ik it's been long while since but who did you take hist7b with?
this is actually great advice! im still able to cancel these two classes and get a full refund right? im going to look into this more, don't know why i didn't think of this
LOL yes i did, it was super chill workload def wasnt too bad at all and all the assignments were related to lecture/reading so no curveballs. honestly i really enjoyed it!
i think you should be! check with the financial aid office"
