you have a major course, your math course, and english. i'm assuming ugba 88 is there as part of interest in haas? that's cool too. your schedule totals to 14 units which is good to get comfortable for your first semester
Hopefully your dorm is close by and not in CK, and hopefully your 8am class is not far from your dorm. Your Tuesday is going to suck if your dorm is far away, as you’d have to either go back to your dorm for 9 hours, or figure out how to kill 9 hours.
Thank you my eng course on science fiction was the only one available and it seemed cool compared to the regular R1B like significantly better so I thought it doesn't matter the time rather my enjoyment although I may come to regret it yk
im in unit 3 is that close by?
That’s not too far, so you’re ok there.
Got it is it bad that i do UGBA over maybe some breadth course for L&S?
Your sched looks fine to me.  Your Calc and Data 8 lecturers are certainly top-notched."
