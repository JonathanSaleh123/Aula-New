"Conner Smith: Why we shouldn't (and should) allocate funds to athletics. I have a vivid memory of reading my first ever UC Berkeley syllabus in fall 2013 for Michael Watts' class. In the section for his contact information, the final line read, ""I no longer have an office phone due to budget cuts.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/02/26/superbowl-taught-us-shouldnt-allocate-funds-athletics/,2016-02-28 00:04:30,,"Kids that spent their lives in private schools learning that public schools have budget problems never fail to make me laugh. On subject though, I'd be interested in learning about academic vs. athletic spending, if anyone can enlighten me.
>For my UC Berkeley comrades who didnâ€™t know me before my westward journey, learning that I am an avid follower of an organization encouraging blind loyalty and masculine glory probably came as a bit of a surprise. 

Yep this is the Daily Cal
Why is he talking about the Super Bowl? 
I think the athletic department ran at a surplus this year, except for the fact that Berkeley is stuck with the huge bill for the Memorial Stadium renovations...which the Regents required the campus to do.

This bashing of athletics is tiresome. The best example? Look at The University of Alabama. Since they have basically been the kings of college football, academic spending AND performance (read: rankings) have been rising dramatically.
Mildly relevant side note that I was thinking about earlier: Title IX is actually a pretty notable issue on the topic of collegiate athletic department finances.  Universities (UCLA among others, not sure about Cal) have been known to start new women's sports teams to fill the 85 scholarships that Title IX demands (corresponding to the 85 scholarships for football).  Sounds great, until you realize that pretty much all collegiate sports bleed money besides football and men's basketball.  In fact, football made ~$150k in 2014 IIRC.

So no, we're not using ""university...revenue to subsidize big screen sports,"" the big screen sports revenue and university revenue are actually being used to subsidize the small sports that no one gives a shit about, much of which are unnecessarily large in the name of equality.
Alabama is part of the 1%.  They spend a lot but bring in more than they spend.  They brought in 140 million dollars 2014.  Indiana on the other hand, does not spend more than they bring in.  They do not have a top tier team.  In the end it seems that many of these programs are poorly run big businesses, the people who run these programs are addicted to lavish spending, as some may put it.

Edit: Looking at the NCAA info, it does seem that UC Berkeley Football had $154,119 in what I assume is profit, and received $4,982,173 in subsidies.  Seeing all the numbers from 230 schools is overwhelming.
That NCAA info sounds interesting. Could you please link to it?

although upon looking at this again it might be the entire athletics department (in which case football makes a lot more than $150k, because the other sports are money pits)
Yeah that was my reaction too, since they do not cut up the finances for each portion of athletics.
