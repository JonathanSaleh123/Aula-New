could anyone help with some psych upper div questions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12mnhj2/could_anyone_help_with_some_psych_upper_div/,2023-04-14 19:55:34,"hey! i'm a junior planning to take a bunch of my upper divs next semester and i'm wondering about how some of the classes operate. if you have recently taken any of the classes below could you tell me if they upload lecture material online (like ppts, study guides, etc)? i have some pretty big sleep issues and don't know if i'll be able to make all lectures since these classes are relatively early. it would be so so helpful if anyone here could shed some light on any of these classes for me, thanks so much!!

Basic Issues in Cognition (PSYCH C120, Davina Chan)

Psychology of Personality (PSYCH 150, Oliver P John)

Developmental Psychology (PSYCH 140,  Jan Engelmann)

Developmental Psychopathology (PSYCH 131, Qing Zhou)

Social Psychology (SOCIOL 150, John W Kaiser)

Leading People (UGBA 105, Brandi Pearce)","I took Personality with Oliver, it’s still my favorite class I’ve taken. I had an 8am, but he records lectures and posts the slides so I’d skip and watch the recordings in the afternoon
i took 131 w zhou! she recorded all lectures, posted all readings and slides ahead of time, and tests were based purely on lecture, so it was fairly easy!
I agree with the two comments about 150 & 131! I also took 140 with Jan and he does upload slides but they are very plain. He does not record lectures but even though I did not attend lecture I passed the class with an A by downloading the textbook and going to sections.
thats super great to hear! thanks for the info!!

"Unknown UC Berkeley professors who deserve an award: Joyce Carol Oates (she teaches the short fiction course in the creative writing department), John A. Dracup, Randy Schekman, Laura Nader, Saul Perlmutter, Oliver Williamson, Judith Butler, Yuan T.

Yeah, those unknown professors like Michael Pollan who has given a TED talk, been on national television numerous times, and authored 5 New York Times best sellers. Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.  Truly, he deserves some sort of award to signify the important contributions he has made.
Most if not all of these are extremely well-known and have won many awards.
Robert Hass is excellent. He writes a lot about human connection with our environment. So does the other poetry professor next semester (John Shoptaw).

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47553/meditation-at-lagunitas 

is good, as well as 

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/06/27/the-problem-of-describing-trees.

His poems also have themes of semiotics, for the linguistics/philosophy/literary theory people out there.

> Or the other notion that,

> because there is in this world no one thing

> to which the bramble of _blackberry_ corresponds,

> a word is elegy to what it signifies.

That is, (my interpretation), if we see a blackberry and describe it as a ""blackberry"", as in ""I saw a blackberry today,"" we've essentially destroyed that blackberry's uniqueness and identity, unified it with all the other blackberries in the world. Just saying the word ""blackberry"" at once marks the funeral of that specific blackberry and sings its final elegy. There is, I think, the value of silence: in appreciating some Thing without putting a name to it, that clouds our judgement with our memories of all the other Things of that name (ever met a girl with the same name as your ex?).

That last line just struck me as particularly beautiful when I read it, as a sharp upper bound on what humans are able to communicate with each other.
What a BS article. That is not a list of *unknown* people.
At least as famous as a critical theorist, especially one focused on a field as specific as gender theory, can hope to be. I think all of us humanities people pray to be even half as notable as her.
> Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.

Perlmutter too.

At least article writer can take solace that the Nobel committee agrees  with them that these guys ""deserve an award""? :P"

* CHEM 3A - Peter Marsden
* Theater 25AC - Angela Marino
* BIO 1B -  John P Huelsenbeck, Michal Ilana Shuldman, Benjamin Wong Blonder, Benjamin K Blackman
* R1A
* Decal","This is a reasonable schedule in my opinion! Marsden has optional HW (you would still want to do it because the HW mirrors the exam) but if you don't feel like doing it you'd always have the flexibility!

BIO 1B is not set up like a weeder class compared to BIO 1A, but it is still a difficult class because of the memorization. The labs are fully done in-lab, so there's no lab report or anything like that due after class.

I haven't taken the rest but this seems very reasonable
Marsden is the best professorv
OMG! THR 25AC is going to be an absolute blast! I had a different professor for that class, but I had Angela for THR 119 and she is the absolute best! She’s really understanding about mental health, time conflicts, etc and just wants to encourage discussion :) Of course THR 25AC tends to be a bit bigger than the upper divs, but I’m sure it’ll be the same in terms of vibes :) Hope you have a great time with her!
hi! no advice but i wanted to say im also taking similar classes w bio 1b:) also pre med! we got this fr
Marsden is amazing! Have fun
The only note is that I believe the BIO 1B and CHEM 3A finals are usually back to back on the same day, but if you’re alright with that, then it looks good!
thank you so much!
what were your thoughts with THTR 119?
yes yes!!!
My class experience was a bit interesting for THR 119. Because of the events in October, our class discussions turned away from actual reading material. A lot of my friends in the class disliked it, but I previously felt like she made a safe space in the class and it was very nice to be able to talk about whatever. The only bad thing is she randomly drops assignments on you. Our final felt like it came out of nowhere. However, I had a lot of fun in the class :)"

Choosing between Physics and Bio,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hbvvfb/choosing_between_physics_and_bio/,2020-06-18 23:50:20,"Hey, if you had to choose between taking Org Chem 3B alongside Physics 8a or Bio 1b, which would you pick? Bio 1b being with John P. Huelsenbeck and Bruce G Baldwin and Physics 8a with unknown.

Also, are either of those classes likely to fill up with freshmen or anything before we can Phase 2? Bio has 200ish seats open now, Physics has 100ish.

Go bears (and tigers obvs)","I’d go Physics for three reasons. 
1. 3BL and 1B both are 4 hour labs. I took 10 hours of lab my freshman year — that shit HURTED. Physics “lab” is like 2 hours and only 5-7 labs, the other labs are just discussion sections during lab time. 
2. Physics is a series — assuming you’re IB/MCB or some other bio you’ll likely have to take 8B. If you don’t take 8A fall, you’ll push back the series to 8A spring 8B fall. Rather than bio 1B spring with physics 8b and being done w lowerdivs by spring.
3. Idk if you’re premed but Physics is pretty heavily tested in one of the sections, especially basic 8A and some 8B concepts. Bio 1B on the other hand? Completely nonexistent. Delay bio if you need to take the MCAT."

Answer: They can't even provide computing education to everyone in Berkeley, that's why they require a 3.3 GPA to declare CS and EECS is the hardest major to get into(with 6-7% acceptance rate).

Thinking about taking Philosophy 138 with John Searle,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4de4k4/thinking_about_taking_philosophy_138_with_john/,2016-04-04 18:00:39,"I have never taken a Philosophy class at Berkeley, but I have gotten recommendations to take a class with John Searle. My question is: how doable is it to take an upper-division philosophy class (P/NP) without taking any philosophy classes before?","It's really not that bad, I'm taking Philosophy 132 with Searle right now. I haven't taken any other philosophy classes and it's going well. PM me if you have any questions 
I'm a philosophy PhD student here. I would recommend against taking Searle's 138. In short, some people find Searle entertaining, but his classes don't teach you how to do philosophy. You will, instead, hear Searle rant every lecture about his own (often confused) interpretation of the reading.

There are far better philosophy classes here at Berkeley.
The key to succeeding in Upper Division Philosophy courses is understanding how to write Philosophy. Regardless of what field you come from, you won't have written a paper in proper philosophical form before. That's not to say Philosophical writing is more difficult than other non-fiction, but its much different. Before taking 138, I'd read some Philosophy and familiarize yourself with how it presents ideas.  When you have a grasp on that, the material comes easily and won't be too challenging. 
Don't we read Searle's own work, though? That's why I was particularly interested in taking 138; *Construction of Social Reality* is a good book. 
What's frustrating about Searle's classes is that you'll get force-fed Searle's highly-idiosyncratic views no matter what: either he assigns his own work or he gives a highly Searle-ified presentation of others' work.

I'll be blunt - he's neither a good teacher nor a good philosopher.
Thanks for the info. I was strongly considering taking 138 in the Fall, reconsidering now.  My gut tells me that I'd be remiss not to take at least *one* of Searle's classes while I am in the program (undergrad).  Would you say that it just isn't worth it? Or is mind (132) better than society?
I'd say it just isn't worth it. There are too many other good philosophy classes."

Miss-advised by an L&S Counselor last spring.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xdt9bo/missadvised_by_an_ls_counselor_last_spring/,2022-09-13 22:16:24,"Maybe this is not the place to post this; if it's not, please remove it.

I transferred to Berkeley in 2020 and started during the fall semester. I have done well enough in my courses, but my mental health drastically declined and because of this, I had to force myself to switch all my classes in the fall of 2021 to P/NP. I needed to step away and get myself into a better headspace. Spring of 2022 I did well and only needed two lower div courses to graduate. I made an appointment with a counselor and asked if I was clear to take the last two classes at my local CC and she told me that it was good and that I could knock out these two and be ready to graduate. I was excited and ready to go. I knocked out one class in the summer but then my depression tanked, and I had constant suicidal ideations. About a month ago I attempted to take my life 3 times in 2 days and in my following therapy session I was 5150ed. I spent time in Martinez PES and then at John Muir in Concord. I came out of that situation a little better and tried to focus on short-term goals. 

Now that the fall semester started, I decided to reach out to my counselor but was unable to get in contact with her, so I made an appointment with someone else and was told that I was not on track to graduate this fall. I was told that the courses would meet my course requirement but not my unit requirement. I told the new counselor about the advice I had received before and he seemed skeptical but said he would check in with her to see what she had to say.

Since then she has confirmed that she had misadvised me and promised to do everything she could to try and fix this situation. Today I was told that I have 4 options to insure I graduate. However, none of them are good (or fair). This situation is due to a mistake on their end but I'm the one forced to bare the burden of that mistake because the school is too rigid.

This situation has completely upended my plans for after graduation and I feel like I'm sinking. I'm 35, and I've spent the last 8 years in school; I'm tired and just want to continue the next phase of my life because I'm not getting younger. Those suicidal thoughts have come back in force and I'm just about ready to call it quits. I don't know what more I can do...

Thank you for reading and I apologize if this is an inappropriate post.","This is not an inappropriate post, in my humble opinion, and I completely understand your situation…..more than you know! This situation is a difficult one and I would like to ask, who gave you your 4 options? Is there anyone above this person that you can go to?? Maybe the Dean?? I would also say that you should fight this as it is not fair and they should do something more than “try” their best to fix it! Please, do not give up! I keep telling myself the same thing, as I am 36 with two young kids, doing things with no support…just my kids and I here at Cal! My mental health has deteriorated and I am supposed to be in my last semester as well but feel like I cannot complete a senior thesis! I really have no choice though because I do want to be able to better provide for my kids. Try to take it one day at a time, this may sound cliche but any small progress counts!
One thing I've learned is to ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK WITH OTHER ADVISORS. I had someone give me absolutely wrong information that made me go into complete breakdown, just to reach out to two other advisors saying that that infomation was wrong!  plz double check!
This is my first semester at Cal and I feel completely overwhelmed by my classes already. Kinda feeling like a fuckup. I’m also an older transfer student. I really hope they sort your graduation requirements out. Best of luck to you!
I received the 4 options from the counselor who made the mistake. I've been told by both her and my Major advisor that they have been talking to people ""very high up"" to see what they can do.

I have been fighting and being patient with them about the process. I'm not angry at anyone. I know mistakes happen, but I just want for them to not place the onus of their mistake on me. Still, I'm not sure what more I can do.

I'm so sorry that you're in a similar situation. I'm sure if you can push through this than I can as well.
My first semester was hard for me also. I took on too much and refused to quit. My sleep and mental health took a real beating. Feeling like a fuck-up is normal. Just keep doing your best; you'll find your rhythm.

What are you studying, if you don't mind me asking?
I’m planning on majoring in Applied Mathematics. I had to drop math110 because the counselors didn’t mention that experience in proofs would be required to do well in the course lol. I’m taking 55 and 74 this semester in which I’m learning to do them, but I wouldn’t have wasted time on 110 if I had known prior. Im having trouble getting assignments done on time since the homework has been much more time consuming. I’m hoping I’ll be better prepared for the spring, knowing which classes to take and being able to self study over break next time
That's pretty cool, I'm terrible at math haha. So the counselors dropped the ball with you also huh; I'm sorry to hear that. You will be better prepared in the spring, I did incredibly well in my second semester. Better time management, and focused on mental health when I need to.

My brother is super into math also, except he went the engineering route. What does Applied Mathematics do exactly?
Their system of not allowing incoming transfers to speak with a general LNS counselor is really odd to me, like you could be setting people up for failure by wasting their first semester taking the wrong stuff. Applied math just appealed to me more. Academia is cool, it just doesn’t pay as much. Applied math is better for industry, tech, data science, actuarial science etc. More flexibility and options for careers. What is your major, OP?"
UGBA 10 as a freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cd9yua/ugba_10_as_a_freshman/,2019-07-14 16:38:03,"Hi! I'm an intended CS and Business major! I am pretty certain I want to take LS 25 and CS 61A, but besides that, I'm really lost. I was thinking of taking UGBA 10, but lots of people don't recommend it? Could someone explain?

Otherwise, it'd be awesome to get some advice on how to choose classes. I know EE 16A would've been great, but it clashes with LS 25 which has a really cool topic this fall! There's so many good courses out there, but they don't work because of schedule conflicts, being full, etc.

In context, here are the requirements I have to fulfill:

* Arts/Lit (fulfilled by LS 25)
* Bio (eww... )
* Philosophy and Values (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Social/Behavioral Science (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)
* International Studies (I'm planning on satisfying this req with GPP later)
* Reading and Comp B (None of the ones that still have spots sound great and I don't like writing essays...ideas? Spring?)
* American Cultures (I'm planning on satisfying this with a course on Islamophobia in Spring)

And the courses I'm considering. Thoughts on courses/teachers appreciated:

* Intro to Human Nutrition (Marc Hellerstein, Joseph L Napoli)
* Human Biological Variation (Leslea Hlusko)
* Psychology of Sleep (upper-div) (Matthew P. Walker)
* Principles of Business (Judy Hopelain, Omar Romero-hernandez, Daniel G Mulhern, John Briginshaw)
* Seminar on Social, Political, and Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine (David Malcolm Potts, Darlene D. Francis)
* Design and Activism (Greg Castillo, Achvabenzinberg Stein)

&#x200B;

But I'm conflicted because I have a lot of requirements to fulfill, and I can't do most right now, but I also don't want to take extra classes and get behind...","Just do Econ 1 or UGBA 10 so you can knock out one of the business pre reqs alongside one of the CS pre reqs. I'm guessing you passed out of Math? Olney is a great Econ Professor and the course isn't too demanding/hard but I also wouldn't take it easy and push it to the side.
UGBA 10 as a freshman is totally fine - I commented on another post about it but it’s essentially a consistently medium-load class. Exam every 3 or so weeks, different professors so different style to get used to every 3 weeks. Multiple choice exams which are fine as long as you use the past practice papers available to you. I don’t think it’s that bad but if you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

In terms of the bio breadth, you could consider MCB C61 or C62. C62 is offered in fall and is called Drugs and the Brain while C61 is in spring and is about Brain, Mind, and Behaviour. I believe both are crossovers with Psych so they’re both very interesting classes, but may be a bit heavy on the neurobiology part with diagrams and technical terms and everything that goes along with that, in case you’re not super interested in that. Lots of memorisation but not super difficult classes. I found C61 was quite interesting even though I’m not a STEM major, and Dr Presti is definitely very interested and dedicated to the topics covered. If you’d like to know more about that course, I’d be happy to discuss it in greater depth."
FALL online ONLY instruction,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hvcrhe/fall_online_only_instruction/,2020-07-21 11:23:46,"Called it lol

Dear Colleagues,

As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, show that infections continue to increase.

The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.

Although we have repeatedly noted that all fall plans are subject to public health conditions, we understand that this news will be disappointing. Many of you have worked diligently to develop plans to provide in-person instructional activities for almost one thousand classes across the campus. Many faculty and students continue to look forward to resumption of some element of in-person instruction. We will continue to work hard on our plans, and to learn from the setbacks as well as the advances. 

Learning to switch between remote and in-person

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow.

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to providing guidance and support. 

If previously approved in-person instruction returns later in the semester, students will not be required to attend classes in-person—they can continue to attend classes remotely through the semester. 

To the degree that operational logistics and public health conditions permit, we will prioritize offering in-person instructional activities for Tier 1 and some Tier 2 courses, depending on instructor, classroom, space, and facility availability. Tier 1 is defined as instructional activities that, by their pedagogical nature (e.g., labs, studios, fieldwork), are significantly preferable to offer in-person or partially in-person. Tier 2 is defined as instructional activities that, if offered in-person, would substantially contribute to cohort-building for entering students, to academic engagement for students who are underrepresented on campus, and/or part of a capstone experience (e.g., freshman/sophomore seminars, first-year cohort-building courses for graduate students, capstone courses for seniors, etc.). 

The Office of the Registrar will continue to assign general assignment classrooms as needed for courses provisionally approved as Tier 1 and Tier 2 in the event that we can return to some hybrid or flexible instruction later in the semester. At this point, it is less likely that we will be able to offer Tier 3 in-person instructional activities, those in which the instructor strongly prefers to offer instruction in person—even later in the semester—so we are holding off on Tier 3 room assignments for the time being. 

Current fall planning

For now, as we plan for the start of the fall semester, faculty should implement their contingency plans for fully-remote instruction. Waiting for conditions to improve would not provide us with sufficient time to prepare for the start of instruction. If it is not possible to offer a particular course remotely and the course needs to be canceled for the fall semester, please work with your department scheduler to update the schedule of classes at your earliest opportunity. It is important that students have the most up-to-date information. For questions, please contact the Office of the Registrar scheduling@berkeley.edu.

Whether or not public health conditions allow us to return to some in-person instruction as planned, we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for our students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. Please also take a look at the following FAQs:

Looking forward 

We acknowledge the challenging times for our community with regard to childcare, dependent care, personal health, and other responsibilities through the fall. Our instruction planning and operations recovery management teams are working to develop plans to support instructors, GSIs, and staff who require classrooms or office space to prepare for and/or deliver instruction. We will send more detailed information about these plans in the near future.

We will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester.

As the public health situation continues to evolve, we will keep you updated as additional information regarding fall plans develop. We will provide regular updates leading up to and throughout the fall semester.

For your information, a message about fall plans that students will receive later today is appended below. 

We are immensely grateful for your incredible dedication to our campus community in the face of this pandemic and for your remaining flexible to our ever-changing environment. 

 

Sincerely,

Letter to be sent to students today

 

Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students -


As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, continue to increase.


The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.  

 

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow. 

 

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students, but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to continuing to communicate regularly with you regarding these matters.  

 

Regarding Thanksgiving, we will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester. 

 

Whether we are all remote, or mostly remote, you should know that we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. 

 

We realize that these changes may be frustrating and make it difficult for you to choose what you want to do for fall. This may also be confusing for incoming undergraduate students, including first generation college students (students from families in which neither parent has a four-year college degree). Please know that you belong here. You are an essential part of the UC Berkeley community and we will support you in having a rewarding college experience. We have numerous offices, groups and services at Berkeley and the Educational Opportunity Program is a great place to start. This incoming undergraduate class also marks our most ethnically diverse freshman admitted class in more than 30 years. We are committed to encouraging and supporting all underrepresented students through programs like The Office for Graduate Diversity and the Centers for Educational Justice & Community Engagement.

We’re hoping this email can provide more information to help you make your decision. In general, if you can reasonably live and learn where you are right now, staying there may be the preferred choice for you. However, you may decide to reside in the Berkeley area if you have on-campus housing, critical in-person classes (depending on public health conditions), in-person research or work, or other specific directive to come to campus; or accessibility, accommodation or other needs. Fortunately, the federal government has rescinded the rule that would have harmed our international students. They can now make the decisions that work best for them.

Learn More

We are hosting a series of “conversations,”live-streamed events where you can learn more.

 

Student housing (including on and off campus housing): Tuesday, July 21, 12-1 p.m.

Instruction: Wednesday, July 22, 12-1 p.m.

Newly admitted undergraduate students (for freshman and new transfer students): Wednesday, July 29, 5-6 p.m.

Student experience (including professional offices and student groups and events): Tuesday, August 11, 5-6 pm. 

 

Help Us Support You

To help us better understand how to support you, we will asksurvey you about your plans for fall and your public health habits so that we can create a program to support COVID-19 prevention practices. Your feedback is important. Watch your email for more details. 

 

Instructional Support

For graduate student instructors, the Graduate Division has created FAQs about fall instruction. 

 

We will begin by providing remote access to academic services such as academic advising, tutoring and peer advising and will assess other options as public health conditions allow. We are exploring how technology can enhance our services, creating toolkits for staff, and following guidance to support equitable access including adhering to ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) best practices and ensuringstudents have the technology they need to succeed.  

 

The Campus Experience

 

The campus experience will begin remotely. There will not be opportunities to gather with groups of other students on campus at the start but we hope to switch to a more flexible approach should public health conditions allow. The State of California is currently drafting guidance for universities and colleges, we expect to share that soon. We will provide more information at sa.berkeley.edu/covid19/Fall2020. 

 

Students who do come to campus, including living in the residence halls and apartments, will be required to adhere to public health and safety requirements. 

 

Financial Aid and Scholarships

 

We are committed to offering financial aid to support students in covering the estimated total cost of attendance, including tuition, housing, books, food needs, and more, whether they are living on or near campus or outside of the Bay Area with their family. 

Students not living in on-campus housing are encouraged to update their “Cost of Attendance” information in CalCentral as soon as possible. Click on “Update Housing” and select “Living Off Campus.” Please review Financial Aid & Housing Updates for Fall 2020 for more detailed information. Should the standard allocation not match your actual living expenses, you may request a cost of living adjustment in mid-August.

On-Campus Housing

 

On-campus housing for students in the residential halls will be single occupancy only; you’ll get your own room. We will be able to accommodate all students who have received housing offers. Occupancy levels in apartments for undergraduate and graduate student and student family housing (University Village Albany) remain the same. All housing complexes will continue to have residential life, housing, custodial, maintenance, and other critical staff on site. Additional information is available at housing.berkeley.edu/fall2020covid. 

 

Off-Campus Housing

 

We remind students that off-campus housing (including private apartments and houses, fraternities, sororities, and the co-ops) is not owned or managed by the university. You are more likely to contract and/or spread the virus if you live in crowded, congregate living environments. We advise that if you are living off-campus in Berkeley you have your own bedroom and you not socialize in person with anyone outside your household (the people sharing your apartment). For group living environments with large numbers of residents, we encourage students to create smaller social bubbles like we will have in the residential halls. 

 

Preparing for Positive Cases

 

While we are working diligently to mitigate the spread, we will reserve space in the on-campus Foothill housing complex for students who have tested positive and are in isolation; are waiting for the results of their test; or have had close contact with a known positive and need quarantine under public health orders. We will make sure students have meal service and other resources they may need during the isolation/quarantine period. Students living in on-campus housing will be given priority but University Health Services will also oversee a small number of spaces at Foothill that will be available to house high risk students who live off campus, as appropriate. Students who are experiencing symptoms or think they have come in contact with a positive case should call the 24/7 Nurse Advice line at (510) 643-7197.

Final Thoughts

 

Our plans will, by necessity, evolve as we receive direction from public health officials. This is the case all over the country with cities, counties and states easing and then reintroducing restrictions. We are grateful for your patience and flexibility. These are challenging times but we continue to invest in a robust remote experience - both instruction and student engagement - to ensure students can have a full and meaningful university experience no matter where they are learning. The campus remains as resourceful, determined and resilient as our students. We will get through this together, and our shared journey through these difficult times will make us stronger. 

 

Stay well, Bears. 

 

Sincerely,

Please do not reply to this message","yo why do I have a course materials fee if I can't actually take labs for the course...
bamboozled
Does the school have any thoughts about people living off-campus and can't cut their leases? Seems super unfair for us to pay \~4000$ over the semester for rent if everything's fully remote and not making the announcement until midway through summer
What does this mean for athletics?
how the fuck are they going to justify charging people 25k a semester when none of the facilities are open on campus lol
\*will begin fully remote
Tldr? 

I can't read this.
It's possible that you will be mailed a lab kit, at least that is what 16A is doing this summer.
Berkeley released a city ordinance that allows any student to cancel their lease with 30 days' notice. This is a city policy so it would supersede anything written in the lease not allowing this. Landlords have already gotten in trouble for trying to stop tenants from doing this.
 I foresee the Big Game played in April
[deleted]
If you think that they can still hold anything in person after starting and ending the semester fully online, I want some of whatever you're smoking.
The title
Imagine going to a world-class university and not being able to read.
Classes in fall start online, might go back in person if things get better, if you have a housing offer you can keep it but you can cancel it, and a couple other things for students to know.
seriously doubt I'm going to be doing 143 stuff at home tbh
You are still on hook for the rent until a new person takes over the lease, so it’s not really that helpful.
The issue is that leases are signed way in advance - finding housing is such a shit show that most students (me included) sign leases in like March, because if we wait until June we’d literally be living a mile and a half out from campus.
At least we get to keep the Axe?
He's probably including rent, food, alcohol, textbooks, condoms, and event tickets. Either that or he's out of state / international
I know leases need to be signed way in advance in berkeley (I'm actually the house manager of a \~40 person house). But even if you signed in March, you can still give them 30 days notice today. It will be a little annoying with Spring leases \*if\* classes are in person, but even if you signed a long time ago, you can still give 30 day notice today.
oos rise up
I see, this changes everything. Let me look into it, thanks."

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There’s a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don’t do that. While I’ve visited many times, I’ve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It’s mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we’ll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you’ll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it’s remarkable how many people I know who haven’t ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley’s best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won’t be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you’ll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don’t think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you’ve ever taken the 51B down University though, you’ll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I’ll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>• Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>• Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>• Visit the Little Farm (it’s a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>• Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris’ favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There’s also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you’re here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you’re there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven’t ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha’s hand. Don’t get cherimoya fruit though—I accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can’t even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it’s the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area’s fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don’t think their parties are exclusive? I’ve never asked. It’s a tradition though, and they’d probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn’t substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you’ll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there’s no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it’s a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn’t stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they’d let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn’t interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they’re much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it’s surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day’s moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you’re further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you’re trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn’t need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer’s markets** *You’ve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There’s a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine’s Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you’re looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley’s indie bookstores:*

>• Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>• Moe’s  *If you’re looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there’s also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>• Pegasus  
>  
>• Mrs. Dalloway’s  
>  
>• Half-Price Books  
>  
>• Eastwind Books

* **Stop into a store you’ve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they’ve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you’re closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I’m going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn’t a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the “Hell Summer” that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, “the poetry reading is out of control,” uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here’s*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I’d begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It’s hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it’s now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it’s good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There’s a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber’s Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he’s inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can’t walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I’m unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you’re looking for something wholesome, this Cal student’s** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it’s so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don’t exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he’s accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country’s history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it’s spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it’s haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don’t need to listen closely.*
* Oakland—Mountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some… mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it’s worth the trip. It’s a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can’t believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they’re filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It’s gothic, but it’s also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany—Albany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I’ve ever taken--I’ve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you’re willing to do a little bit of exploration. There’s a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It’s a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany—TEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland—Lake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There’s a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children’s Playland.*
* Oakland—[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I’m mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland—Jack London Square *I’d sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you’re into that. There’s also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London’s Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There’s also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don’t be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You’ll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill
* [Mark’s Yard Art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mark-oliviers-yard-art)
* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you’re lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There’s a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren’t an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire’s before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it’s near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I’d call it romantic.)","I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:

Check out the archives and the Bancroft Library. There's a bunch of really cool old and rare books and a lot of Cal related historical documents. You can't check anything out of the building though, you can only look at it in the reading room.
To add onto the bit about fire trails:

This section in particular (starts from the stadium, goes up to Grizzly Peak) is my absolute favorite hike in the entire area. It's a pretty steep climb but if you're a good hiker or runner then it should be very doable. 6ish miles roundtrip. When you get up into the hills you can see a huge chunk of the East Bay and into SF - and then you realize how small Berkeley is compared to the rest of the world. It's also a great place to meditate.

Walking across the Golden Gate, and looking at Berkeley/Campanile tower is an amazing perspective! Then go up the tower, and look back at the Golden Gate.
1) stay up all night watching stars at Fire Trails contemplating just how big the universe is

2) storm the field after a Big Game victory


3) eat a Top Dog after a long day of classes. As you order, think about how you’re standing right where Steve Wozniak would have ordered his first Top Dog. Don’t think too long, or the cashier/chef might yell at you 

4) Build something cool. Even if it’s stupid and you’re the only one that will ever appreciate it. It’s worth it
The pier trespassing is dangerous... Could end up with someone dying. I don't recommend.
You know, I feel like I'd appreciate this a lot more if I wasn't stuck at home for my last semester :( 

great list, though, and maybe I'll just have to come back after I graduate...
Find someone who has a code to the Essex Baths.

See a concert at the redwood grove

Meditate at the Berkeley zen center (can combine with a trip to Berkeley bowl)

Attend the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary Easter celebration hosted by the Nuns of perpetual indulgence.

Find the concrete slide in the Castro. Take a walking tour while you're at it.

Swim at the hearst women's gym pool at least once - it's covered in marble and old statues, and has a great view of the campus.

Catch the art students' semesterly print sale days. Extremely cheap awesome art.

Speaking of art, you can check out a priceless piece from the University - and switch it out every once in a while for something new.

Not quite Berkeley specific, but gaze at the stars while taking a late-night cliffside swim at the Esalen center.

Go go Land's End. It's beautiful.

Take advantage of the SF museums. They're fantastic. They also do free days every so often, if you don't want to pay ridiculous admission fees. Just get there early.

Children's Fairyland is not creepy! It's cute, and it's over 70 years old, which is cool. Rumor has it that it inspired Walt Disney when he was planning Disneyland.
A must do for any EECS undergraduate

Spend an all nighter in the depths of Soda Hall working on cs project due the next day
Wow I grew up in Berkeley and gotta say you've hit practically every spot I can think of! I personally also enjoy Panoramic Way as a walk up to a nice view, and would add Point Isabel to the list of places to visit if you're into dogs.

Really enjoyed reading this and extra thanks for sharing the 1999 blog
It's a very minor point, but ""find a strange fruit"" might be better worded ""find rare fruit"" or ""find unusual fruit"".
this is very helpful for people who havent visited campus yet cuz of covid, thanks!
Watch a football game from T1GHTWAD HILL!
Thanks for these excellent suggestions! I just checked out *American Heiress* on your recommendation. As an undergrad, my friend John used to live in that apartment - I think he said they still had bullet holes in the wall.
Adding on:

\- Read a book in Morrison Library

\- Visit Cheeseboard Pizza at least once (but probably 100+ times).

\- Get sushi at Kirala

\- Take BART to SF on a free weekday and explore the city, visit the de Young or Legion of Honor, get lunch, go to Blue Bottle Coffee at the Mint

\- Visit the Old Rose Garden at the Botanical Garden in May -- all the roses are in bloom and it is stunning

\- Swim at Strawberry Canyon pool in spring/summer

\- Visit a coffee shop so many times that the staff know you

\- Take grad pictures around campus; cliche, but as an alum, I LOVE having these
As a 2020 transfer, this is very sad. Hopefully I can stay in the area after graduating and doing some of these next year.
22. Not get rejected

~ An applicant preemptively crying over my rejection this thursday
Should have included attend the Big Game!
Underground steam tunnels should be there too
Mostly food related—

Get some food from the Buddhist temple in South Berkeley, Vik’s Chaat, Ethiopian food (Addis; might be in Oakland).  

Tilden—play golf/whack a bucket of balls at the driving range.  It’s a pretty course and the three-tier driving range is pretty cool.

Bike the bike trail along 580 to Richmond and check out the Rosie the Riveter installation.  If you are lucky, a park ranger will be present to answer questions.

Ride your bike around town at night.  It’s fun!

Frolf.

Do the sake tour (if it’s open).

Berkeley Bowl—best grocery store EVER.  Get the Odoriko tomatoes if they have them.

Kirala—chawan mushi is like an ocean French kiss.
This is the coolest post ever, thank you

-freshman at berkeley
For now, I've got one that you probably know too well by now:

Your home. 


Stay home, please? 
We need this thing to go away.
Hey, I love you and this post
This is so beautiful. Tysm <3
god i miss trawling through urban ore on a sunny day 

the south berkeley farmer's market is also amazing too and if u have calfresh u can get $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce!!!
While you're at the Rose Garden, go through the tunnel by the tennis courts to Cordonices Park and ride down the concrete slide on a piece of cardboard. There are usually a few pieces lying at the bottom. (Do not attempt sans cardboard.)

You should add in some stuff in San Francisco since it's easily accessible to us. Great list for Berkeley though- both the campus and the wider city.
Have ramen at Marufuku in Japantown :D
this is late but what’s wrong with cherimoya?
This is one of the best posts I've seen on things to do, ever. Thank you stranger! Making me reminisce on so many positive memories of Berkeley + the Bay area. Truly unlimited things to do. I feel so thankful. If I do even teeny fraction of these things, I will be happy<3
Isn't Bancroft closed to people without special access? I tried going in during 2019 but they didn't let me :(

&#x200B;

Will add to check out all the Berkeley libraries, Doe itself has at least 4 smaller libraries within it.
I adore that trail, but good god that one slope midway though is terrifying
hope you'll be able to visit someday; most of these things will probably be here once you do (: and I hope your last semester goes as well as it can!
the heart women's gym/pool is a fascinating and beautiful old building!! i had no idea it existed until i took a final in there lol
the man's had a glorious career, there is no doubt! didn't know about his involvement in UC directly though (beyond the work in Claremont), most of my knowledge only goes as far back as John Galen Howard. very cool!
children's fairyland was my childhood. no disney could ever attempt the beauty of that place tbh.
not just a rumor, that's a fact! and I should have corrected that by now haha my Oakland neighbor who reads my newsletters said the same. unfortunately I can only speak from my experience walking around it when it's closed due to covid, and that's a bit eerie. always wanted to go inside, maybe someday /:
That place is terrifying and it made me scared as shit of puppets. So I have to disagree with you
Previously WEB. Previously 260 Evans.
I hate that I did this, but also glad I did for the experience lmao. CS projects and all-nighters mix well together
updated; is ""strange fruit"" used as a euphemism on the regular? I haven't ever heard it outside of the context of the song
Because of the association with the protest / anti-lynching song?
oh whoa that's wild!! cool that they preserved the history, but also kind of disturbing, but also I'd totally pay to set foot inside and see (': and I hope that you like American Heiress! Toobin is fairly well-respected, but it's clear that he's got a certain angle and sometimes the way that he editorialized to that was annoying.  Kind of reminded me of listening to Serial honestly--good storytelling and the character of the people really comes through, but you also have to wonder what they're leaving out. I'd love to read Patricia Hearst's memoir if I ever come across it!
I also recently learned that Morrison Library loans out original artworks to students! If I were a student again I would definitely take advantage of this.
Wait how do you find these?
many of these are fine to visit in a mask, I think we all agree that we need this to go away but depriving your life of all pleasure until then is not the way to go about it
it was $11 for one fruit lol
Haha yeah - I remember the first time I went there and tried to run up it. Even to this day I still remember how difficult that was!
It's a commonly understood phrase, yes. The song was capturing a phrase used at the time, and it is used sometimes now.
Because of its association with lynching, of which that song is part. The phrase exists beyond the song.

Who was actually behind the protests?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/65z1un/who_was_actually_behind_the_protests/,2017-04-17 16:02:35,"I have spent a significant amount of time researching and investigating twitter, instagram, facebook, facebook live, 4chan, mainstream media, youtube, reddit to try to piece together the true narrative behind the protest. My investigation yielded some shocking results, there is much more to these protests than can be seen at first glance. This might sound crazy at first but stick through to the end and trust me. These protests and the ensuing fight did not small organic locally organized movement but one of international conspiratorial origins. There are big players in the world who want to interfere in our politics, beliefs and lives. They don't care about us or anything other than making sure their beliefs and ideologies ""win."" This protest and clash was simply a battle in their war to spread their ideologies and beliefs further down our throats. They want us to accept their viewpoint and disregard everything else. 

Not just that, I have another shocking revelation that I have discovered. I'm fairly confident that the university itself is in on this. They have been spreading this ideology for many years by radicalizing these young and malleable people by disseminating unethical concepts and beliefs that have caused this situation. The most shocking revelation I have uncovered is that these protests are not caused by the people you might have heard before. I believe that it was not caused by George Soros, Charles Koch, President Trump, **John Oliver**, Steve Bannon, Jorge Ramos, Milo, Anderson Cooper, The Illuminati, The **Easter Bunny Spicer** or Shia LeBeouf.

The real people manipulating the media and society to help push, create and encourage protests like this weekends and future ones? **PepsiCo.** 

Now, this might be confusing for you. Why would PepsiCo want to be a part of doing such crazy acts? And how the hell has the university been working with this corporation? Continue reading to further understand the truth.

Pepsi is the official drink of UC Berkeley. In 2011 the company and the the university [signed a ten year deal to sell Pepsi products on campus.](http://www.dailycal.org/2011/08/21/campus-signs-letter-of-intent-for-new-pepsi-beverage-contract/)[ Pepsi paid for this dirty deal with the univerity with a measly 15k a year in donations for ""sustainability.""](https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/beverage2.pdf) As we all know **Daddy Dirks** is an amoral neoliberal shill. After joining as Chancellor in 2012, and noticing that we were in bed with Big Soda. Thinking that simply spreading our legs wasn't enough, he wanted to let them take our cornhole. He came in during a period terrible budget shortfalls. The UC system was put in a tough spot with the state cutting funds and so they turned to alternative avenues to find funds. They tried all sorts of paths, including attempting a secret plan to take the public universities private. See [columns like this in the Daily Cal](http://www.dailycal.org/2012/04/23/who-said-privatization-was-bad/) in an attempt to try to sell the idea of corporate (Pepsi) takeover of the UC system as a smart idea. [Their botched attempt to make a corporate logo.](http://www.aiga.org/the-uc-logo-controversy)

They chose to cut a secret deal with their already strong sponsor Pepsi to try to close the funding/budget gap. The deal was to subliminally manipulate and spread Pepsi's message to all students and general Berkeley residents. Dirks is the person who was able to run away with our public funds. You think if he was able to brainwash the UC Regents and the IRS he wouldn't be able to do the same to us? Wake up sheeple! Cal's most recent marketing hashtag is #InThisGen. Pepsi's most famous slogan? The Choice of a New Generation. There are no such things as coincidences. 

Pepsi's interest in this is to take global market share from Coca-Cola. Being #2 for so long has been rough on the company culture and morale. The current CEO is [**Indra Nooyi**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Indra_Nooyi) a person with esteemed credentials, but like Pepsi, are from the number two private university. (Yale) not the best causing her to always strive for number one. She decided, along with the rest of the PepsiCo board to push forward an ambitious plan to change the world as we know it. 

Pepsi knows that everything is advertising. Modern culture is dependent on the intersection of two things, place and people. For place, everyone looks to **America** to dictate the world's culture. America looks to California to dictate the country's culture. For people everyone looks to the young since they're the most important group there is. Where are large groups of young people located in California? **Universities**. PepsiCo believed if they took over California Universities they could overtake the world. In 2014 [Pepsi signed a deal with UC Davis.](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/pepsi-deal-bring-10-million-university/) In 2015 they [took over USC.](http://www.dailygamecock.com/article/2015/08/pepsi-wins-usc-dining-contract) 

PepsiCo deliberately released the **Kendall Jenner** ad last week because they knew people would be outraged. They times the releasing of the ad so that enough time would pass that people would get the pop culture reference it would still be quite apparent in their minds. They timed it so that it would all come to head at protests this weekend. They spread their **message** because of the ensuing publicity. From now on, whenever protests occur their brand will be associated. The reason they chose to release this in time for the Berkeley protests? 

Even though Pepsi was gaining a stronghold in California and our state's universities, our residents strongly fought back. Berkeley fought against big soda and won. [The soda tax was passed in **2014** and in 2016 proved that big soda was wrong.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/23/491104093/berkeleys-soda-tax-appears-to-cut-consumption-of-sugary-drinks) They saw that their allies, neoliberal shill Dirks, California, and Berkeley were turning their backs on them in favor of more righteous progressive agenda's and enacted an attempt of malicious revenge. Think how people were wondering if there were paid protestors? THEY WERE RIGHT! Just that these people were paid for by PepsiCo. It's definitive.

[This piece of high quality independent journalism is the kind this country and world needs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u3uhKxNPNg&feature=youtu.be) This piece of independent journalism shows how even in a time with the country so divided on what we can believe and what we cannot because of biased and lying media, we can count on ordinary citizens documenting and showing us the truth. An **inspiration** showing us the journalism of the future.

That said, watch it twice if you don't catch the bias in there. Though on first watch the video might seem like a fully independent citizen journalist documenting **the facts**, he has actually been advertising for Pepsi the whole time! Pepsi has attempted to take over the last bastion of our democracy. The integrity of all independent citizen journalists are now under attack. It is even possible that after watching the ad he himself has been brainwashed into advertising for Pepsi without knowing it. Kendall Jenner implanted subliminal messaging into his skull! The horror! 

Knowing that there will be protests in Berkeley and elsewhere for the next couple of years they have positioned themselves in a very profitable position. They are encouraging these events that undermine our democracy and way of life in an effort to sell us sweet soft drinks. PepsiCo has been planning and playing fourth dimensional chess similarly t how our president played **7th** dimensional chess and won himself the presidency. Wake up sheeple! Don't fall for Big Soda's game! If we do not wake up in time our entire way of life and world might burn because of big soda's greed!

Zoom Proctoring has been disallowed by the Chief Campus Counsel,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fprgkx/zoom_proctoring_has_been_disallowed_by_the_chief/,2020-03-26 22:35:08,"The following message was recently sent to all EECS instructors from Professor John Canny, who was asked to forward this message from Dean Tsu-Jae King Liu:

> Campus leaders have been (and still are) working to find an acceptable way to help ensure academic integrity on exams. **Chief Campus Counsel David Robinson has made it clear this afternoon that presently there is no acceptable remote proctoring option.** Instructors should either allow students to take exams unproctored, or postpone exams until an acceptable proctoring option is communicated from campus leaders.
> 

Several departments (including the EECS department) are going to hold emergency meetings to determine what to do for the remaining midterms in the coming days. This information was just released a couple of hours ago, so nobody really knows what's going to happen.","would final projects be a viable option for cs classes(particularly upper div)? I can't see self-proctored exams working  out well for them from my experiences taking cs61 courses....
Emmmm can someone explain to me why Zoom proctoring is a bad idea? Of course it's not perfect but I think it at least discourages people from collaborating during the exam.
Thank god
>I can't see self-proctored exams working out well for them from my experiences taking cs61 courses....

To be fair, I think that's why the entire university has been pushing P/NP so hard. It's going to be a clusterfuck, there's no way for it not to be. So they want everyone to be cushioned by PNP at least.
We have been considering a take-home project-like final for CS 61C. 

>I can't see self-proctored exams working out well for them from my experiences taking cs61 courses....

Yeah– most of the head TAs I know agree with you that self-proctoring will not work out well for CS at all. This email puts everyone in a rather tight corner, with deadlines for upcoming midterms coming up really quickly. :/
Really depends on the class. If it's not already set up that way, I think it'll be pretty tough. You'd probably have to release very flexible specs and just let people do whatever they want. Not sure you could build the kinds of projects EECS classes often use, which tend to be very thoroughly developed. I have no idea what you'd do for more theoretical classes like CS170.
It's certainly an option for some, but it might also be more work for students?

Damn, I hate exams so much....
Not all students have a quiet room in their house, nor now in public such as library, cafe, etc to take or proctor the exam. Also, timezone issues, internet connectivity for some students and lack of a laptop for students, privacy, class/assignment/midterm overlaps, its a bit of a mess; while I understand the need to combat academic dishonesty
Well, I have a desktop without a webcam, and am living with my mom who is in an at-risk group so I'm not about to go to Best Buy and get one. I was going to order one on Amazon, but it was delayed until April 22.

There are also a lot of students in the positions /u/asucisevil101 mentioned. I just don't think the university should make any decisions under the assumption that all students have a reliable way to use Zoom.
Idk but it feels like a weird invasion of privacy ig? Because normally you don't feel like there's a watchful eye staring at you while you take exams in an exam hall, but zoom proctors are kind of a constant thing to consider in your mind while taking an exam and that can be quite distracting and intrusive in and of itself regardless of if you are being academically honest or not (hopefully the former ofc).
i wish mandatory p/np was implemented :( this feels like an unideal half-measure rn
Hackerrank challenge?
While definitely some of the things you mentioned were valid concern However, I do feel that the benefit of discouraging cheating outweighs some of the drawbacks. I feel that most students benefit from the curve that's not affected by group cheating. I mentioned this before but I know personally there are people in one of my classes that are thinking about collaborating during the take home exam. I don't feel that this is fair for other students at all.
Privacy, definitely. Likely accessibility, though I think this should be mostly OK. But also just what it means if we are storing recordings of students in their own homes... that's not really data the university wants to protect.
I was thinking along the lines of 1 GSI proctoring 30 students. It's more of a symbolic deterrence that will hopefully discourage blatant collaboration during the exam. I get where you're coming from but I don't see how that's different from taking the exam in a lecture hall while the GSI is proctoring the classroom.
Rao says ""perhaps don't think of the TA's watching you as monitoring you. Think of TA's as rooting for you.""

""Unideal half measures"" is apparently the title of the nation's playbook for dealing with this pandemic
How does that prevent cheating and collaboration?
You gotta remember that this is an order coming from the school's legal department. This mandate was sent out not to ensure academic fairness, but rather to protect the school from potential lawsuits in the future regarding privacy and accessibility issues.
Honest thought, but how much cheating goes on under ""normal"" circumstances that we can't really catch? I'm afraid to know sometimes... I am fully aware that some students cheat, but most students are honest people, and a lot of attempted cheating (at least the stuff that I can catch) doesn't even have significant effects on people's grades.

I wish we had better solutions for *detecting* cheating rather than trying to find everything to prevent it...
Take the classes p/np like the university suggests and a wonky curve shouldn't be so much an issue it pushes you into failing.
lmao love it
this is why p/np should be mandatory this semester imo. it accounts for a lot of types of cheating by not allowing anyone to get a letter grade.
It was actually a combination of both. Mostly because of accessibility issues and academic accommodations, which does encompass academic fairness. That and privacy as you mentioned, in addition to lawsuits in regards to tuition, FERPA, and right to academic choice.
Ah that's good point.
I think actually carry out harsher punishment such as expulsion for severe cases could definitely deter most people from cheating. I think part of the reason is that even when some of the cheaters get caught there are rarely any consequential punishments, most of the time it's a slap on the wrist, it doesn't set a good example.
If Zoom is supposedly accessible then I'm curious how much of a concern the accessibility angle is... though, I imagine that quite a few different accommodations are exacerbated by home conditions aside from proctoring options.
I think a lot of the cases are pretty severe penalties... Slaps on the wrist do happen, but that's usually for fairly insignificant cases of cheating. 

Things like expulsion are usually reserved for 2nd offenses."
