Lost Hydro (i was emotionally attached to it),https://i.redd.it/nffiu1zvydta1.jpg,2023-04-11 17:04:49,"Hey Yâ€™all this sort of a dumb post but I lost my yellow hydroflas. I last had it on Saturday April 8th around 9:00 pm. I was at Haas Pavillion with my AFX group. ðŸ˜­
It has a yellow cap, a redish rubber butt cover thing. Its also the Yellowstone National Park edition and has a drawing of a geyser. I included a pic in the post but idk how reddit works so idk where itâ€™ll show lol.
It had a Tacos Sinaloa sticker, back to the future sticker, a joshua tree sticker.  It has a dent like at the top above the hydro flask logo.

I cant offer much as an incentive for giving it back other than like a meal or boba and my eternal gratitude ðŸ˜–","Damn that sucks, thatâ€™s a sick bottle. Anyway, I found a yellow hydro at Haas Pavilion that has a cool design of Yellowstone on it! Finders keepers!
Ur sick!!
