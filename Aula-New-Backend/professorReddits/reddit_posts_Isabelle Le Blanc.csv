MCB 110 and 140,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qrtvsk/mcb_110_and_140/,2021-11-11 12:12:03,"I'm planning on taking MCB 110 and 140 in the Spring and it will be with  I. Le Blanc, E. Park, Q. Zhou for 110 and  A. Dillin, N. King, H. Roelink for 140. Do they take attendance and grade it? Can I get away with not attending in-person? And is there crossover between the material for those two courses?","Lots of crossover between the courses, I’m taking both this fall. I have different profs for 140, we have participation points that can be gained via asking questions in lecture or on piazza, so you wouldn’t need to attend lectures. Both classes do have attendance for in person discussions but the points aren’t much overall."
MCB 110 with 140 too much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/r7fh4c/mcb_110_with_140_too_much/,2021-12-02 11:42:05," I was planning on taking MCB 110 and 140 in the Spring and it will be with I. Le Blanc, E. Park, Q. Zhou for 110 and A. Dillin, N. King, H. Roelink for 140.

However, an MCB advisor said that she strongly advises against taking 110 and 140 together and said I should take an elective instead. I know that there is overlap between 110 and 140 material but is that not enough to make it reasonable to take them together? Are they both really that hard? Aren't electives just as difficult?","In 140 right now, its not too hard. Exam 1 (mendalian  stuff) averages low but I don't think many are challanged by the content. c100a is murdering me though. I think if you passed the pre reqs for 110 without too much struggle, 140 will seem like a comparatively easy course.
Both classes are dense with information and memorization-heavy. I don't think there's enough overlap to make either of them a light class, an elective would probably be lighter. 110 and the last 2/3 of 140 both don't really involve math. There’s a little bit of math when 110 revisits twist and writhe.
I took both this fall, it was pretty reasonable. I had LeBlanc and Zhou, LeBlanc was super nice and cool but wrote a tough exam (pretty fair though), Zhou imo was easy (and I knew nothing of the material going in). Park will probably teach the last section, which I liked the best, but there’s a lot to learn there—however, I’ve heard hes pretty cool so I guess it’ll be okay. Didn’t have any of those 140 profs but to echo the sentiments of other comments, 140 overall is a fairly light course.
I'm having a terrible time with c100a too. I don't like this stuff it's full of physics and math.. I like bio and chem more. So would you say 140 or 110 are similar to c110a?
I dont know yet, I just miss unit 1 so much"
MCB 110 and 140 Study Advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9e2wso/mcb_110_and_140_study_advice/,2018-09-08 01:49:19,"Does anyone have any advice on studying for MCB 110 and 140? I have Le Blanc, Zhou, and Hurley for 110, and for 140, Koshland, Rokhsar, and Darzacq. Does anyone know how difficult their exams are and what resources are the most helpful in studying for their exams?","Rokshar and Darzacq are both kind of dry and hard to follow. Try to look at old exams and quizzes if you have access. IIRC, Rokshar wasn't too bad...and Darzacq's was mixed with the final.

I had none of those people for 110, so can't really help much there. 
Zhou has a portion on his exam that emphasizes knowing the usage, mechanism (in broad strokes), and expected results of various lab techniques. It's not too hard since he spends a good chunk of time explaining them. If you understand what is happening it's fairly intuitive to predict the results. 

 Hurley has a separate required reader but I didn't find it necessary for his exam. He does iClicker questions and being right is worth points, so stay alert and be friends with your neighbors (or be neighbors with your friends) so you can talk about it before answering. IIRC, he does not make the clicker answers available after, so be sure to write it down if you didn't get it. Although the answer is in the other slides, it might save you some time. He also has this thing where he doesn't allow laptops, so be prepared to take notes by hand if you don't normally do so.

For all 3 sections (but particularly the first if it's anything like when I took it), I highly recommend getting flash cards and going over the named proteins. Knowing their name, function, and what they interact with is pretty important on all the exams. It's unfortunate that brute memorization is a part of the experience but at least it's manageable as long as you don't procrastinate. Trying to cram it all in the night befoe is not fun or effective. Otherwise I'd say that as usual good notes and practice exams are sufficient for the course."
