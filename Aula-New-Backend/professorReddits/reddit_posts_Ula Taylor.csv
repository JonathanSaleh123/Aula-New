professor ula taylor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14snv9v/professor_ula_taylor/,2023-07-06 15:21:58,"has anyone taken a class with professor ula taylor? i am confused b/c on one hand berkeleytime has her classes at a b- average. on the other, rate my professor has extremely positive reviews of her (4.6/5, 100% would take again).","rmp is good when there's a decent amount of reviews. this prof seems to have 21 reviews and only 3 of them past 2018. berkeleytime would be the more accurate indicator in this case.
She's great, currently in her class. The grading is hard tho, 40% final, 30% discussions, 30% midterms. 
Will update at end of session D.

I don’t understand why you are confused.  There’s no contradiction between being a great teacher and being a tough grader.
I have a 97% in her class rn. Perfect score on midterm. You have to be able to explain and understand how and why people craved self-determination during the modern civil rights era. What led up to that, what was happening during, and explain the legacy/ admiration of how we benefit from actions of that movement everyday.
Thank you!! Really helpful. How did you find the difficulty of the midterm and final? Did you think it was fair? I’ve taken a few classes with grading schemes like hers, but they’ve all been with very fair professors. Based on berkeleytime I think that’s the main thing I’m wondering. 

Also, any advice on doing well on the midterm and final? Thanks again!!
Well yeah, but most students are not going to rate a professor super highly if they thought they were an extremely harsh/unfair grader. Combined with the fact that college students act in their best interest, it is definitely confusing that 100% of rmp reviews say would take again given a b- avg when the other classes have a b+/a- avg"

“People know about Rosa Parks. People know about Martin Luther King Jr. — and they should. And they know that it was the Montgomery bus boycott that ignited a certain kind of Southern civil rights movement,” says Ula Taylor, a professor in the Department of African American Studies at UC Berkeley. But, what they might not know, she says, is that it was actually the behind-the-scenes organizing effort by the Women’s Political Council, led by Jo Ann Robinson, that made the boycott successful.

"After announcing a $98,000 grant to UC Berkeley for research on the Black Panther Party, the National Park Service has since decided not to fund the project amid backlash.

The BPP should be an inspiration to anyone fighting for equality. Anyway: I though right-wingers were all about preserving history, not censoring it?
History doesn't change. It's a fact. No need for new books. That's why we build statues to educate future generations. Things like ""history research"" or ""history books"" are part of the lying liberal agenda. Statues should be enough.

I mean, does it not strike you as a little odd that the funding came from the NPS?

It does, but I imagine it's one of those weird departmentalizations which seem common in government. My point is that if researching and making grants for research on influential public figures falls under their domain, it shouldn't be blocked because some people don't understand the subject or disagree with it."
