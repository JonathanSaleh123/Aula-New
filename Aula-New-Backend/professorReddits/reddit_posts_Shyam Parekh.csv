Has anyone taken EECS126 with Shyam Parekh?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fxtd3p/has_anyone_taken_eecs126_with_shyam_parekh/,2020-04-09 07:27:06,What is his grading like? Is he a good lecturer?,"Heâ€™s fine, imo. Nothing too notable, either positive or negative. He mostly lectures out of the books and tells you the relevant parts in case you miss something.

Grading is what you might expect out of an EECS class: small percentage homework, small percent lab, big part exam. Homeworks take a lot of time and labs introduce interesting applications. Exams are tough, but itâ€™s curved."
Anyone else finding Shyam Parekh impossible to follow in 126?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/im04ve/anyone_else_finding_shyam_parekh_impossible_to/,2020-09-03 12:19:54,Am I the only one or is it really hard to follow along with Parekh? I feel like I learn much more by reading the textbook.,
Ok wtf was today's cs70 lecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mv3p6x/ok_wtf_was_todays_cs70_lecture/,2021-04-20 16:50:08,"its literally shyam parekh reading off of the slides and not explaining anything.

&#x200B;

s h y a m my dude

Cs 70 + Math 53 + Physics 7A doable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kllr8y/cs_70_math_53_physics_7a_doable/,2020-12-27 23:22:03,"Hi fellow bears!

I was wondering if you thought this combo  (Cs 70 + Math 53 + Physics 7A) is reasonable/doable. (I also don't need to declare)

* Cs 70 with prof Rao and Shyam Parekh
* Math 53 with prof Zvezdelina Stankova
* Physics 7A with prof Alex Zettl","yes. math 53 can be a bitch though. and I heard horror stories of 7A pandemic edition. so who knows
sounds very do able. 53 and 7a are relatively light conceptually compared to 70. the struggle will be if midterms are all around the same time otherwise 7a and 53 problem sets aren't bad at all
yup
Stankova did a great job on 110
7A is relatively light, but the midterms are super tough. A 29% was a C on the second MT, so curves help a ton.
hi 26unitsguy! How's it going? Are ya keeping it together with _this_ workload?

Edit: But are you serious?
yeah it was honestly just midterm season that drove me crazy, rest is manageable. Even finals/RRR week was okayish tbh

And yeah I'm serious, maybe add a good breadth like phil 12A to the mix too"
EE 126 resources ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/im0g5x/ee_126_resources/,2020-09-03 12:35:43,"Does anyone have good resources to learn EECS 126 material? I am taking it with Shyam Parekh this sem and I'm gonna need some external help to understand this stuff ðŸ‘€(the lectures are just kind of confusing and hard to follow imo) I was thinking of watching Ramchandran's lectures but it looks like the two profs don't cover the same material. So any other recommendations would be greatly appreciated! (like textbooks, YouTube channels, etc.)","Stat 140's online textbook has some resources on markov chains and probability, otherwise I'd just recommend a judicious amount of googling. Most if not all of the probability stuff is covered in a typical undergrad/intro grad stochastic processes class, so you can search for those sorts of textbooks (Durrett has a pretty good book).
Look through AMC12/AIME combo problems"
