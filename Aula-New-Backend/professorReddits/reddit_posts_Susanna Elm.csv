Thoughts on Susanna Elm,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yejzte/thoughts_on_susanna_elm/,2022-10-26 22:56:43,"She works in the history department and Iâ€™m considering taking her course on the history of shipwrecks. Does anyone have any experience with this course or her in general? 

Thank you!!","I hear it's a smashing good time.

A lot of folks find themselves adrift if they don't keep up with the coursework.

From what I hear, things quickly run afoul if you get her talking on recent shipwrecks.

But seriously, haven't taken the class"
