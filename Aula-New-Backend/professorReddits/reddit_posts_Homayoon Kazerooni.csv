"SuitX, a company spun off from Cal mechanical engineering professor Homayoon Kazerooni's lab, makes exoskeletons for people with disabilities, and they've launched some devices that use the same technologies to both improve the power of able-bodied workers and help prevent common workplace injuries.",https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602890/a-modular-exoskeleton-will-make-more-workers-bionic/,2016-11-20 23:32:13,,"This is awesome. I wonder if they can make a device that will help people not develop carpal tunnel syndrome, one of the most common workplace injuries from repetitive overuse of the hands. We associate it most commonly with office jobs, but it can also develop from factory jobs that involve repetitive motions.
great idea"
"Phoenix, a new robotic exoskeleton built by SuitX and based on technology that originated at Berkeley's Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory, is helping paralyzed individuals to walk again. Max speed: 1.1 miles/hr. Mechanical engineering professor Homayoon Kazerooni is SuitX's founding CEO.",https://www.technologyreview.com/s/546276/this-40000-robotic-exoskeleton-lets-the-paralyzed-walk/,2016-02-01 22:10:04,,
