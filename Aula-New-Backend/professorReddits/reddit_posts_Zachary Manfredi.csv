Anyone have definitive information on union member's strike responsibilities?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1qx4ql/anyone_have_definitive_information_on_union/,2013-11-18 12:25:46,"The UAW has a ton of FAQ's on the strike, but nothing specifying if you have to strike, the penalties for being in the union and not striking, etc.

Info, particularly info backed with links, would be appreciated. 

EDIT: The GA sent this out. The answer is you don't have to do anything one way or another.

**1) Why is UAW striking on Wednesday?**

AFSCME 3299, the union covering UC service and patient care workers are going on a one-day strike on Wednesday, November 20th. They are striking to in response to intimidation of their workers by UC management. AFSCME’s  one-day strike will start at 5am to 10pm on November 20. 

The union covering GSIs, Readers, and other Academic Student Employees (ASEs), UAW 2865, has called a sympathy strike with AFSCME for Wednesday. Question 13 below has more info on AFSCME and their reasons for striking. 

**2) What does it mean to participate in the strike?**

This means that GSIs, other grad students, and undergrad tutors are asked to withhold their labor on November 20th, which includes not teaching sections, holding office hours, grading papers, or anything related to your duties as an academic worker. 

**3) Who authorized the UAW to strike?**

UC academic student workers voted 96% in favor of granting the union the ability to authorize strike actions; over 2,000 students participated in an historically high turnout. The UAW was authorized to strike under a variety of circumstances, including in solidarity with another union. Following AFSCME's call for a strike, the UAW leadership decided that AFSCME's call for a strike was a sufficient justifying circumstance for a one day solidarity strike. The UAW also held a large, public forum on November 14th with members, undergraduates and AFSCME workers to discuss the solidarity strike. 

**4) Do I have to participate in the strike?**

**It is an individual choice to strike or not. However, not striking or ""crossing picket lines"" will be interpreted as not being in solidarity with the UAW strike in support of AFSCME's action.**

**5) What happens to me if I strike? Can I be fired or disciplined for participating in the strike?**

No. The California Supreme Court has ruled that public employee strikes, including those by UC employees, are legal, and the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) protects your right to strike under the conditions under which the strike is occurring on Wednesday. If your employer threatens you, warns or intimidates you about striking, or disciplines you for striking, contact a UAW officer immediately, as this is an Unfair Labor Practice. This includes retaliation against future GSI or reader placements that are pending. These rights also apply to international students.

**6) Can my pay be docked?**

Technically, your pay can be docked for one-day's labor. However, the UAW feels this is unlikely with a one-day strike because we are salaried and it would be difficult for management to calculate and deduct pay for a day. Additionally, many GSIs and readers report working well in excess of their required hours, and the UAW encourages members to keep track of their hours worked and to pursue grievances in cases where the maximum number of hours has been exceed.

**7) Do I have to tell my professor/supervisor if I choose to strike?**

No. You are not required to inform your supervisor or professor. According to the UAW, if you feel that you need to send an email to your supervisor explaining your reasons for striking, it is best to keep it simple, with a statement along the lines of: ""I will not be working on the 20th. I will be participating in my union's legally protected strike, which is being undertaken in sympathy with AFSCME workers, who are striking to challenge the unlawful intimidation they faced from managers when they struck this past spring.""

**8) Do I have to notify my students?**

The UAW cares deeply about students and fights to promote quality public education, but feels it is important for labor to cease on Wednesday. Use your best judgement to reschedule exams, make alternative arrangements for turning in assignments, or changing office hours for this week.

**9) What if I am giving an exam or have an assignment due that day?**

The UAW cares about students and wants them to get a quality education but feels it is important for labor to cease on Wednesday. Use your best judgement to reschedule exams, make alternative arrangements for turning in assignments, or changing office hours for this week.

**10) Who do I contact in the union if I face intimidation? Where do I get more info?**

You can contact your UC Berkeley UAW reps including Zachary Manfredi (zachary.manfredi@gmail.com), Amanda Armstrong (mandy.armstrong@gmail.com), and Munira Lokhandwala (muniralok@gmail.com). Also there is a link about the November 20th actions: http://berkeleyuaw2865.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/november-20-solidarity-strike-pledge-please-sign/. 

**11) What activities are planned for the day?**

Whether or not you choose to strike on Wednesday, if you are interested in showing your support you can join the workers at the picket line at Telegraph and Bancroft throughout the day. In particular, there will be assembles at 11am on the steps of Wheeler Hall, and at 12pm there will be at rally led by AFSCME workers at Sproul Plaza.    Food will be served to strikers and supporters all day at West entrance at Oxford and Center. 

**12) What is the administration's stance?**

Provost George Breslauer issued a statement regarding the administration's stance. However, the UAW has issued an open letter (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N8JgNNJaSvfQFeNfiT5-sj4Im0mkbrpzkygn4TJawx4/viewform) stating that the administration is engaging in illegal intimidation and that the strike is a legally protected action. Peaceful concerted activities are legal and protected by labor laws. The  Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) prohibits representatives of the UC (including faculty supervisors) from interfering with any right of its employees. The Public Employee Relations Board (PERB) has held that even if the intention of University representatives is not to discourage or impede the right of employees to take collective action,  including striking, if a message is communicated that could have the effect of discouraging or impeding employees from striking, this message would be in violation of the statute. Again, please let the UAW know if you are facing intimidation or threats by any staff, administration, or faculty members.

**13) What is AFSCME and why are the workers striking?**

AFSCME 3299 is a UC union comprised of dining hall workers, janitors, hospital workers, shuttle drivers, and campus grounds keepers. AFSCME is currently fighting a 1.5% wage cut unilaterally implemented by UC management as well as threats to their pensions (to put the economic status of these workers in context, 99% of these UC employees are eligible for some form of public assistance). Specifically, AFSCME workers are striking for a second time to address management retaliation against workers that stem from their May strike. If you want to read more about how how these workers have been treated by the administration go here: http://www.afscme3299.org     ","Seconded.

This whole thing is a clusterfuck - to add to this confusion, apparently Breslauer sent out an email to department chairs and deans this morning saying that the union misinterpreted what we can and can't do during contract negiotiations and that we actually are not legally allowed to strike. 
In case anyone is curious of the (strike) context:

http://www.dailycal.org/2013/11/18/grad-student-workers-go-strike-systemwide/
Here's an equally important question. Can no GSI work on Wednesday? Should I bother showing up to section? 
I read the title as ""unicorn members"" and I got excited
I think that's probably incorrect (that we can't strike). Our contract expired. I'd be surprised if we were still held to the terms of the contract once it expired...
GSI's can choose to strike or not to strike. It's up to them.
Yes, this was my understanding, as well. I just received the actual email from Breslauer - my department sent it out along with a message saying they support our individual decisions but are not taking a stance on the issue. Which still doesn't answer your question, obviously. Meh.


>Dear Colleagues:

AFSCME, the union that represents Service and Patient Care Technical
workers throughout the University system, has called for a one-day
strike on November 20, 2013.  The UAW, the union representing GSIs,
Readers and Tutors has also voted for a strike and there is indication
that the UAW will seek to have its members join with AFSCME on November 20. It is the University’s position that a strike by GSIs is premature because the University and the UAW are still actively bargaining over the terms of a successor agreement, and the parties have not exhausted the collective bargaining process including the conclusion of bargaining, mediation and fact-finding.

The University has a long tradition of supporting civil expression of
individual views and supports fully the free speech rights of all,
including academic student employees.  So long as they meet their
scheduled teaching obligations and do not violate University policy,
employees, including academic student employees, are free to join in any
demonstrations or protests they choose.  Furthermore, classes are
expected to be taught at the assigned time and, in the assigned location
unless a change is requested by the course instructor and approved in
advance by the Department Chair. Requestors should be advised that all
student needs, especially disabled student access and assistive
services, must be accommodated if a class is rescheduled.

Please remind your faculty to ensure that University teaching
obligations for November 20, 2013 are met. For more information,
please see this website: http://hrweb.berkeley.edu/labor/strike
