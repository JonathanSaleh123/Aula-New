MATH W54 with David Nadler,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14ha4z8/math_w54_with_david_nadler/,2023-06-23 14:20:05,Has anyone taken MATH W54 with David Nadler over the summer? What were the grade cutoffs like? Does he curve the class?,"Didn't take MATH W54 or any class with Nadler, but from his syllabus in Su22 it's probably like: top 30% get some form of an A; next 30% get some form of B, etc...

Ming Gu vs. David Nadler for Math 54?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g7c1so/ming_gu_vs_david_nadler_for_math_54/,2020-04-24 10:00:55,"I'm taking Math 54 this summer, and seats are open for 2 sessions (with Ming gu and Nadler). Who is the better option? The (amazing) ratings on ratemyprof for Nadler are from 2015; are they still true now? There are mixed reviews for Gu - I've heard that he's a terrible lecturer, and doesn't care about students; but I've also read that his exams are relatively easy. Which prof should I go with?

Edit:  I'm taking it in the summer, so LMAO Just realized that I'm gonna be taught by grad students. Nvm guys ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","I had Nadler for 54 in Fall 2017 and loved him! He was very clear, patient, organized, and precise. A very chill dude. I wouldn‚Äôt say his exams were easy, but not impossible, so they were fair. 

He also did his lectures writing on an iPad so no blazing through slides which I don‚Äôt like in math.
I had Ming Gu for 54‚Äîhis lectures are pretty bad, he has a fairly strong accent, and he writes the easiest exams I‚Äôve taken at Berkeley. Just know that in order to understand the material, you‚Äôll mostly have to learn it on your own or through section. He spends way too much time on the easy, mechanical stuff, and too little on the harder conceptual part of 54.
Ming Gu had pretty boring, difficult to follow lectures when I took him. But his exams are very easy. Like comically easy. I think the average for MT1 was 95%. And he seems like a really nice and very smart guy so I‚Äôm sure his OHs are worth attending (I was a dumb freshman and never went RIP).
Took Gu for 54, alongside the adjunct and got an A. But that‚Äôs mainly because of the adjunct. I wouldn‚Äôt take Gu again for any class to be honest.
Ming Gu is awesome dawg...just don't be an idiot
Yeah, Gu used PowerPoint slides all the time.
So Gu is a bad teacher but has easy tests? Is the tradeoff of bad lectures for easy exams worth it? I'm deciding between Gu and Nadler for the fall
Hello, I am taking his class rn and his teaching really makes me anxious lol

Would you recommend any online resource or useful youtube videos so that we can better prepare for his exam?

Thank you!
Sorry, but what's an adjunct?
Honestly, probably not if you‚Äôre in CS/math/stats/physics. Linear algebra comes up a LOT, and it‚Äôs very useful to have a deeper understanding of it, which you almost certainly will if you take it with someone else. You will probably get a better grade with Gu than you would with Nadler, but IMO you should go with Nadler. Gu‚Äôs lectures spend all the time on the least important stuff, and then skip over all the actually challenging conceptual meaning and understanding.

Do you guys remember if Gu's practice exams are similar to his real ones?
Thanks!"
David Nadler or Ming Gu for Math 54 Fall 2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hn2f0z/david_nadler_or_ming_gu_for_math_54_fall_2020/,2020-07-07 13:28:50,"Hey guys,

With most math courses being moved to remote for Fall 2020, including Math 54, I was wondering who would be the better choice to take. I've heard Nadler is a better lecturer, even though his tests are harder, but if it's going to be online then I imagine a lot of it will be self-learning. With that in mind, would it be a better idea to take Gu instead? I've heard his exams and curves are easier, but he that is is a poor lecturer. Let me know what you guys think","Ming Gu not even a question
I see, thank you
I agree
Do you guys remember if Gu's practice exams are similar to his real ones
yeah theyre just as easy and straightforward as his practice exams"
Which Math 54 professor should I pick?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hc6imt/which_math_54_professor_should_i_pick/,2020-06-19 11:57:11,"Incoming freshman, with the choice of taking Ming Gu or David Nadler. I've heard that Gu is not the best lecturer but has easy tests, whereas Nadler is a better lecturer but harder tests. Who do you guys recommend taking this fall?","You're already in 54, which means you've got some skillz. 

Go with the interesting guy and the harder tests. Make yourself smarter. 

The harder you work, the smarter you will become. 

That's the college secret, whether at UCB or Podunk CC.
I took 54 with Gu last spring and while the exams were easy (our first midterm had an average of 92), if you‚Äôre at all interested in linear algebra I would recommend taking it with someone else. He teaches in a very dry manner, showing you ‚Äúthis is how we do this‚Äù without much explanation or any of the value you normally get from Berkeley professors. 

Also this may have been a one time thing, but he was also very disorganized. Grades were submitted 2 weeks late with no communication (piazza was vaguely concerned that he had died and no one knew) and then they were incorrect for some students when they did get submitted. 

So, long story short, I really cannot recommend you take 54 with Gu.
You basically summed it up in your question. It's up to your preference. If you're still not sure maybe look at their different syllabi on tbp. I'm taking it with nadler because the schedule worked better for me.
I had Gu and my experience was as you described. His lectures were honestly really terrible haha, learned entirely from friends, Youtube, and the textbook. The textbook is great though so you'll learn a lot just by reading it and doing the problem sets he assigns. I didn't have any trouble with linear algebra in CS 189 so I guess that means Gu teaches you what you need to know, despite the easy tests
+1, your success in upper division courses will thank you for understanding linear algebra well
Do you remember if Gu's practice exams are similar to his real ones?
[deleted]
The practice exams he gave us were very similar. If I remember correctly (from two years ago),both the practice and real exams were 5 questions, first one was generic computation, last one was a slightly complicated proof, things like that are the same. However I wouldn‚Äôt say that the topics on the exam were exactly the same as the topics on the practice - it‚Äôs more the format that‚Äôs the same.
Nah, just come for logistics on Day 1 and dip for the rest of the semester lol. 3Brown1Blue (or was is 3Blue1Brown?) is an excellent YouTube series on linear algebra. Highly recommend, and most GSI's recommended it too.
Alright, thanks for the information. It's gonna be 7 questions for us because we have 90-100 minutes for exams now. I'm just hoping difficulty wise it's similar, and lmao the proofs kinda give me a headache. The rest are fine though. Good to know"
"Math 54, which prof?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/htlmb2/math_54_which_prof/,2020-07-18 11:37:20,"Ok incoming freshman here, pre-haas, maybe

We have two profs: Ming Gu or David Nadler

I've heard reviews that Nadler teachers the material better, however I'm worried about the curve since prob 90% of the people taking his course are EECS or CS making the curve not so generous. On the other hand, Ming Gu has exams that are apparently comparatively easier.

Thoughts?","‚Äúhowever I'm worried about the curve since prob 90% of the people taking his course are EECS or CS making the curve not so generous.‚Äù

Majority of EECS/CS students take the EECS16 series instead so I doubt there‚Äôll be many of them in 54

Edit: Also being EECS/intended CS doesn‚Äôt automatically make one a math wizard
I highly recommend Professor Nadler, he's widely considered to be one of the best Math 54 professors.
nadler
If your priority is an easy A, Ming Gu 100%. Not sure about Nadler's curve.
I had Ming Gu and he teaches by the book. You'll be doing a lot of self-learning and will 100% need to read the textbook. From what I heard from friends who took Nadler the same semester, his lectures/teaching style was easier to follow but his tests were definitely harder. It depends on your learning style!"
Math 56 vs 54,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cggdnl/math_56_vs_54/,2024-04-29 18:20:46,"I'm taking linear algebra just to learn the material not for credit. For those who have taken math 56, how difficult was it.  What should i take? ","if 56 is with paulin, i highly highly recommend: made me love the class and the way he taught was just so intuitive and fascinating. not difficult per se, just another typical berkeley math lower div grinder
Its with David Nadler, Paulin said that he's a good professor but looking at Nadler's curves in 54 and other classes, it seems like it would be difficult to get an A in his class."
