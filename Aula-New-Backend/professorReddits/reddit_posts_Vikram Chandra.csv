"English teaching professor Vikram Chandra is featured in a story about classes being taught this fall by famous authors. Professor Chandra wrote Sacred Games and Geek Sublime, among other works of fiction. This term he's teaching The Short Story.",http://lithub.com/the-classes-25-famous-writers-teach/,2017-09-12 23:43:07,,
Cal creative writing professor and programmer Vikram Chandra looked for a smart word processor that lends artificial intelligence to the wisdom of a human novelist. He created Granthika. As you write it can construct a timeline around your story calling out chronological contradictions as they arise,https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/fall-2017-bugged/debugging-novel,2017-10-01 01:09:47,,">  But when it is released (projected to be late next year), Granthika will do more than simply store the working text of a novel in progress. 

back in the day, we didn't call this Granthika. we just called it ""vaporware."" 

cool idea, but call me when it ships.
interesting af"
