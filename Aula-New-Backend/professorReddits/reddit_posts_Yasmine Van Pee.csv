Penis Size: An Official Ranking of the UC Schools,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hejh52/penis_size_an_official_ranking_of_the_uc_schools/,2020-06-23 10:58:16,"There has been a lot of dick-measuring contests between the UC’s recently, but none of the absolute chad’s who post on reddit have actually performed serious research into this important matter. Using several [reputable](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080813163857AARspHD) [s](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079)[o](https://www.uclahealth.org/urology/mens-clinic/penile-implants)[u](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5450)[r](https://sexinfo.soc.ucsb.edu/when-will-my-penis-start-grow)[c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwjEeI2SmiU)[e](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006060217670)[s](https://twitter.com/UCDLoveLab/status/1129865683334905857), I have compiled an official ranking of the average penis size of students at each UC.

**9. Merced: 0.00 inches**

Here is the thing about Merced: it doesn't actually exist. Has anyone ever seen the Merced campus and returned to tell the tale? Sure, there are a couple of vans that skirt around the other UC campuses with ”University of California UCM” proudly slobbered on their sides, and the students at Merced have always vigorously defended the existence of their school, but I challenge any Merced student to give me directions to their school that doesn’t take a paragraph to write.

**8. Berkeley: 3.68 inches**

Berkeley would be much higher up the rankings, but unfortunately they’re seriously let down by the students in the computer science departments. It isn't that the CS and EECS students tend to have smaller pee-pees, because that is simply not true (CS kids are the chaddiest of chads). No, the real problem is that computer science students watch so much hentai that it’s impossible for them to get hard without having four different screens of anime tiddies bouncing up and down and a hentai body pillow sitting in their lap.

**7. Irvine: 3.69 inches**

I have a real problem with Irvine students. All the Irvine kids on tinder always brag about how nice their campus is, the length of their wee-wee’s, and how they did not actually get rejected by UCLA (they just chose to go to a better school). Unfortunately, it is all just a ploy to hide how small and insecure their dicks and egos are. However, the Irvine students certainly make the most of the phrase “it’s not about size, but about how you use it,” considering they're the masters of compensating.

**6. Santa Cruz: 4.20 inches**

The thing about Santa Cruz students is that they do not actually care at all about any type of ranking. Instead of taking lots of Viagra, Santa Cruz kids simply put on their yellow hoodies, lie down somewhere on campus, stick a fat joint into their mouths, and slowly slide along the ground making deep and erotic sounds in order to arouse themselves. This ritual is necessary for the banana slugs to get hard, since the perpetual cloud of weed that hangs over the Santa Cruz campus keeps the students supple and flaccid.

**5. Davis: 4.96 inches**

If you ever wander around the Davis campus, you begin to realize that it really is a cow town: the students literally moo as they slowly meander through the school. At first I thought it was just a ritual similar to Santa Cruz’s, but the sad reality is that Davis kids are so bored that they're always drunk. The Davis students never seem to reach their maximum pee-pee potential due to their drunken state, but at least they have something to show for themselves.

**4. Riverside: 5.39 inches**

Riverside kids have a lot going for them: pretty intense wee-wee’s, nobody cares about what they do, and they're great at exclaiming “rivaside, mothafucka.” Slightly above average is probably the best way to describe Riverside students, and they should be proud that, for the first time, they aren’t second-last on a list ranking the UC’s.

**3. San Diego: 6.33 inches**

Triton sounds a lot like Trojan, but fortunately for San Diego students they actually have something to show for themselves, unlike their pompous LA neighbors. Surfing is proven to increase pee-pee size by at least 10%. However, only half of the school actually surfs; the other half never leave their rooms, preferring to game or game or make fantasy YouTube videos titled “How I got into UCLA.”

**2. Los Angeles: 6.66 inches**

LA kids talk a lot of smack about how they have the biggest wee-wee’s of all the UC’s. Every other day you see another LA student post a picture of their penis on twitter with the caption “longest dong in the west baby haha #yeet #skraa #letsgetit.” However, like most of their delusions regarding their ranking, the reality is that they always have, and always will be, second best (with Chico State taking the top spot).

**1. Santa Barbara: 6.969 inches**

That’s right, the chads and brads that pollute Santa Barbara have the largest pee-pee’s in the UC system. Every SB student has: crazy big muscles, surfs, huge throbbing dicks, and a brain the size of a pea-pea. They don’t have to brag because they have nothing to compensate for, which pushes them up to the top spot.

The most important fact, however, is that $tanford sucks all of our schlongs.","Flawed methodology. You can’t just measure your own dick and declare it the average size for all of Berkeley.
UCSC should be higher up, just because banana slugs canonically have massive penises. A banana slug's penis can exceed the length of its body. The average banana slug penis is as long as the average human penis. And since they're hermaphrodites, every banana slug has one. 

Their species name, dolichophallus, literally translates to ""long penis."" 

They have sex for hours, and both of them get pregnant. It's intense.
Can confirm,

Was flaccid for so long until I met my new beloved waifu body pillow.

 [UCLA would disagree.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/bc6bbv/something_ive_noticed_about_this_school/)
Sorry boys for bringing down the average, we'll have a protest tomorrow at Memorial Glade to advocate for use of median.
I've been to UCM and returned to tell the tale. Lemme help you out.

Directions to UCM:

This is so fuckin based. Also ty for giving us EECS students massive dicks. My waifu is so pleased.

this is truth but switch la and riv, the only reason a ucla kid would have a larger schlong is if they paid for surgery
Finally I'm above average. I'd like to thank my parents on behalf of my flawless genetics.
Yay! My first time being over average at something in Berkeley
I am an incoming freshman and I am scared
