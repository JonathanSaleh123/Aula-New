Maciej Zworski or James Sethian for math 53?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13s1fhi/maciej_zworski_or_james_sethian_for_math_53/,2023-05-25 20:01:04,,"Sethian
Avoid Zworksi like the plague 

But imo this is a shit situation to be in cause there’s no “clear winner”, both are loaded with demerits and have little to no merits
Sethian, best professor I’ve had at Cal
Zworski is hilarious, lovely, and probably one of my favorite people at Cal.  But Sethian will almost definitely be a clearer lecturer.
Not Sethian"
Should I avoid James Sethian?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/89k96j/should_i_avoid_james_sethian/,2018-04-03 17:07:25,"I'm deciding whether to take Math 53 with Taruto or Sethian for next semester. Problem is that Taruto's 53 lecture is at 8 AM. Sethian is at a better time but HOLY COW, his grading average is significantly lower than the Math 53 average.","I would take Sethian because he is a really enthusiastic lecturer and cares about teaching. I might have survivor's bias because I ended up doing well (according to my standards) in the class, but I do remember stressing a bunch that semester by looking at the grading curve and expecting the first C of my life. 
[deleted]
Holy shit how is that even allowed by the department?

Sethian's Spring 2015 avg for math 53 was 2.35. That should be grounds for dismissal by the math department if when he teaches, basically half the class does not have a passing understanding (a C or better understanding) of the material.

It's clearly not the case that it was a semester with dumb students at that point.
DO NOT TAKE 8 AM MATH CLASS. Worst decision in my university life... 
I personally have a really positive experience with Sethian, although I only had him for Math 54 last spring. It was an 8-930 am tu/th class so I was less than pleased waking up early to learn math. But IMO I have to say he's a really great lecturer, he is really really passionate about his field and I managed to stay awake all the time in his class. His no phone policy forces you to pay attention in class assuming you don't end up dozing off. His Math 54 exams were extremely fair, (he says he doesn't curve the class so he lowers the difficulty of the tests) and I think many people ended up doing well in that class. I'm actually really surprised at these comments saying not to take his class, although his teaching of 53 might be vastly different from 54 
I took Math 53 with him in Spring 2015, and I've gotta say he's actually pretty great besides the grading.  He's a very animated lecturer and seems to care about his students.  Even the idea of a professor (not a lecturer) in the math department who gives the remotest shit about the students in a lower div course is amazing.

When I took it with him, he offered an optional clobber policy in which your entire grade would be based on the final, which is pretty cool.  His midterms weren't too bad (although I was underprepared and did poorly) while is final exam was unbelievably difficult (I think much harder than he intended it to be).  I got a B, no idea how and I didn't ask questions.
If those are your choices maybe delay taking 53 for a semester?
his name reminds me of slytherin and that's a bad sign
He shouldn't be dismissed just because he won't inflate everyone's grades like most other lecturers do. 

Half the people who pass math 16 can't do basic algebra.

Half the people who pass math 53 don't know how to do a multiple integral. 
Hey you were in my class!  That final was brutal, it might've been the hardest thing I took at Berkeley.  I think he messed up somehow, he said beforehand that there would be no issue finishing the exam in the given time and I don't think anyone actually finished early.  I was seriously considering the fact that I might need to retake Math 53 and somehow eked out a B.

He is a pretty great lecturer, I really appreciated how animated he was and it did come off like he genuinely cares about his students.
> That should be grounds for dismissal by the math department

You assume the Math department gives the remotest shit about students in a lower div course.
2009 was way way worse RIP those poor souls
simply take 53 next spring lol
Looks like his grading for 54 is much better, still below average but not horrible. Looks like he is a bit more fair with grading now. I’ll consider taking 53 with him next semester thanks!
>  I got a B, no idea how and I didn't ask questions.

Something similar happened to me -- I did slightly below average on both midterms and felt that I did awful in the final so I expected a C or something but then I ended up with a B+. I'm still confused how that happened but I'm not gonna question it. 
Can't otherwise I will be really behind. I need it for so many upper div classes that I'm interested in
Good to know that I wasn't the only person that felt emotional during that final, I didn't see anyone crying but I think I was close to tears at a certain point myself. I think the moment I remember the most was at the end of the final when he asked people to walk home with friends so that we would be safe and all I could think about was how little I cared about my personal safety when I felt that I had just failed a class. 
lmao facts
There may be more remote shits but where?
[deleted]
I was in that class. I'm still mad about it.
You definitely weren't the only one, I walked out of there a bit shellshocked.
Average was 2.02!
Spring '09? I remember the final was a pain in the ass.
I remember taking the final in Haas pavillion. Computationally is was horrible. "
James Sethian vs. Suncica Canic for Math 53?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h0hy7m/james_sethian_vs_suncica_canic_for_math_53/,2020-06-10 12:18:07,"I'm trying to take Math 53 for my first semester (tested out of Math 1A, maybe Math 1B depending on AP test results; doing Math 54 this summer). 

I've heard good things about Prof Sethian and it's an 8 AM lecture which is better for me since I'm a morning person. However, it conflicts with SCANDIN R5A which I've heard is a relatively R&C course; there's another slot for MATH 53 in the afternoon w/ Prof Canic. Who should I go with? Should I try to keep Prof Sethian and drop R5A, or go w/ Prof Canic?","I took Sethian for 54 and I thought he was a great professor! However, our class was curved down due to high exam grades and everyone received one grade lower than they expected. 

Also, you can always take Scandinavian R5A another semester! To be honest, decent math professors (for undergrads) are hard to come by so I recommend you choose classes with good professors rather than to knock out requirements early.
I took it with Canic last fall (2019) and the exams were easy! Her class was pretty chill overall, although I will say the grade distribution was rather odd. Ended up scoring 98 on the second midterm and 92.5 on final which clobbered the first midterm, got 100% on quiz grade and homework grade but still ended up with an A- rather than an A. She’s not the best lecturer in my opinion but is definitely caring and actually has a heart LOL. Would recommend her class!
The Sethian curve is ridonkulous
Makes sense - I'll go with Sethian for 53 then! I'll just do the R5A class next spring then. Thanks!
Oof that's a weird grade distribution. Will definitely take it with her then - thanks for the advice!
Ouch - really? I thought that Canic had bad curves because her exams for easier?
That's not what laka means by curve -- Canic curves to a higher average grade per Berkeleytime. She's also a decent (although not great by any means) lecturer, and the vibe of the class is pretty chill. Exams are easy and just require precision, and HW is all just completion. She often finishes lecturing 10-15 minutes early which is a plus. For lower div math, you probably just want to take the section which is curved to a higher GPA unless the professor is horrible (e.g. Ming Gu Math 54 this fall).
Holy crap I just checked berkeleytime and u/lakalaka1 is right - his curve is HARD - he gives <15% of students an A. Yea Imma go w/ Canic - thanks for the heads up!"
Does anyone know anything about Prof James Sethian? Should I take Math 53 with Sethian or Canic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fw5cmh/does_anyone_know_anything_about_prof_james/,2020-04-06 12:36:18,title.,"All I know about sethian is that he has the [worst grading curve](https://imgur.com/oxAMxl1) of any college professor I've ever seen. About 50% of his students get a C+ or worse.
Sethian is an outstanding professor and one of the best math professors the department has. His lectures are captivating and he explains concepts extremely well. I will say his exams can be really difficult compared to the other professors since they are a lot more conceptual based and the quizzes are dependent on TAs. Also beware for his hw problem sets are quite long(the second one was about 70 problems!) but you really feel like you learn a lot taking 53 with him
Canic is cool.
Is that fall 18? Cuz if not fall 18 has a decent curve from what I remember
I absolutely loved having Sethian as a professor and think he’s one of the best math teachers I’ve ever had. With that said, I would only suggest taking him if you like math and **are good at it**. His tests are conceptual and hard but curved, so beware of where you think you’ll stand compared to others. But don’t be too afraid I’m an idiot and did well so I’m sure you’ll do great if you decide to take it with him.
Her grade distributions seem amazing! I heard it was becuz it’s her first time teaching though, so do you think she’ll curve harsher next semester?
That shows his average over every semester he's taught. Berkeleytime doesn't seem to have fa18
Ohh! Is he generous with his curves? I do like math and think I’m decent at it but based on the BerkeleyTime distributions it seems like most of his students gets Cs or worse...
Probably, it was because our exams were extremely easy for some reason. She will probably toughen up her exams going forward.
I honestly have no idea about how he puts his curves together. They seem to really differ every semester. But I think there are a lot of people in the class how are taking it as a req that aren’t all that interested in math."

I've heard that Sethian is absolutely amazing but his class is REALLY hard. Good luck!
sheu is annoying and teaches as if it’s the 1980s
Sethian, no doubt
Between the two I'd take Sethian. I took 53 with Canic, but from what I've heard from my friends who've had those professors, Sethian seems better
I had Sethian back in 2006. Hardest math class I ever took but he was really good.

Does he still talk about muppetspaces and muppetvectors?"
Physics 5A and Math 53 pairing opinions appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14qvxg8/physics_5a_and_math_53_pairing_opinions/,2023-07-04 17:49:32,"Hello everyone!

2.) Prof Maciej Zworski at 2:00 to 3:29 PM. 

What are your opinions on the teachers? Should I take back-to-back classes or avoid doing so? Thanks in advance!","Sethian is an amazing lecturer who I say is the best prof I’ve had. However, I will say that his rendition of 53 involves a lot of work. I think at the start of the semester it averaged somewhere around 75 problems per week which may be a lot to do on top of 5A. I don’t necessarily think there’s a problem with taking back to back classes tho; last semester on Tuesdays I had classes nonstop from 9:30 to 3:30 and I still did fine.
I see, thank you for your reply! I will definitely take that into consideration when picking my classes."
Math 53,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fu1ms2/math_53/,2020-04-02 21:24:23,I am a MCB and math double major and I wanted to know who to take Math 53 with: Suncica Canic or James Sethian. I would really appreciate any feedback ! :),"Canid is a fun lecturer. She puts cute animal pictures in her lecture cause last semester they were 1:30 long. She’s also quite easily approachable. I remember during lecture, what I did was after she showed a cute animal picture on the slides, I would pull up one on my iPad and point the screen towards her. She literally was trying to hold back her laughter. Also on Halloween, she brought candy for the entire class.
I've heard canic is alright. I've heard sethian is a challenging grader.
I took 53 with Canic last semester. She's a decent lecturer and a very nice person who really cares about her students a lot. She assigns quite a bit of homework (they're all problems from the textbook), but it's just graded based on completion. Make sure you actually do them though because her test questions are pretty similar to the homework problems. Also her tests were really easy last semester, but I think that might have been because it was her first time teaching 53.
I had Canic last semester. I went to lecture the first few weeks but stopped because I thought she wasn’t a good lecturer so I just ended up reading the textbook. The tests were really easy though."

My guide to picking out classes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d3rrmu/my_guide_to_picking_out_classes/,2024-05-29 18:01:28,"Hi yall, I've noticed its that time of year where people are starting to ask about what courses to take/what schedule to do so I'm just gonna write down what I personally think and I hope it'll help some people.

Here's a few things I want to address first to the people who are coming in from hs since I've found hs classes and college classes are vastly different and they take a lot of getting used to for a good chunk of people. Here's what I found that are different abt college classes vs hs classes.

1. Classes are always graded not on how well you do objectively, but how well you do relative to your classmates. That means no more 90% = A and 80% = B, and so on. Instead, what will matter for your grade will largely be three things - your score, the average score, and the standard deviation of your score. Basically these things can tell you how well you did relative to your classmates and will largely determine your grade. This also means that you don't need to be discouraged if/when you come out of an exam knowing you probably got less than a 70% on an exam. There's a good chance that exam was just hard. In fact, a 50% or so was enough to get an A comfortably in some of my classes so please don't take it to heart and give yourself a hard time if you don't do very well objectively.

  
2. Professors can make or break your class. In highschool, there's usually only a few teachers who teach each class, maybe 2-3 and they all basically teach the same things because there are guidelines (such as common core or AP guidelines) that shape what will be taught in your class. This reduces the amount of variance in hs classes and that makes it so that what teacher you get usually doesn't matter too much. In college, your professors kinda have free reign on what they cover and how they cover. Different iterations of a class can have very largely differing content and difficulty so I'd highly reccommend looking up who is teaching the classes you want to take and see if they are well liked (a common tool for this is ratemyprofessors.com). (footnote 1

3. You have complete freedom over whatever you take and it's all up to you. You guys are legally adults now (or at least fairly close to it. If you're one of those kids who are at college at the age of 13 I don't think this post is for you to begin with). It's not up to any person to choose what you take and I personally believe that you can ask for people's advice/opinions on stuff but you ultimately make the decision. Don't let anyone (including me) dictate what you should do.

4. Depending on where you come from, the classes here may seem much harder relatively. This is a common thing I've seen in a lot of people and I just want to tell you that you're not alone and I believe you guys can do it if you put in enough effort. I could make a whole thing about my advice for this stuff but that's off topic.

Ok I think that's all the major differences between college and hs classes I can think of rn. Let's carry on to choosing courses.

1. The unit system is a scam and don't believe it. They say that each unit will take a student approximately 3 hours/wk but this could not be any less true. There are some classes that will quite literally take you 3 hours every month even though they have 3-4 units (footnote 2). Other classes are notorious and take a lot of people 20+ hrs/wk even though the 4 units suggests it should be 12. A particularly infamous example of this one would be CS 70.

1.1. Just tacking along, this also means that classes vary a lot in difficulty so it's usually kind of pointless to ask people if taking a certain number of units is a good choice because taking 16 units can mean anywhere from ""I have basically no work to do and can fuck around every day"" to ""I'm taking way too much because I'm taking 4 of those 20 hour courses and basically working 2 full time jobs""

2. Thus, it's improtant to figure out what classes are relatively easy and what classes are relatively hard. There's two methods I'd suggest.

2.1 First is you just look for it on google/reddit. A lot of classes (especially the cs ones) have people commenting on the class if you just look for ""\[Insert name of your class\] berkeley reddit"" such as ""CS 70 berkeley reddit."" Also another tip I've found is most of the times where you don't get results ur satisfied with, try asking google a phrase of all the keywords you want instead of asking ""What is the difficulty of CS 70 at berkeley like."" Dont have any evidence to prove it but personally its worked so if you want u can give it a try.

2.2 Try taking the classes yourself. ADJUSTMENT PERIOD IS YOUR BIGGET FRIEND!! You can enroll in up to 20 units and so what I'd reccomend is just enroll in an extra class or two that you are thinking about taking and see what all the classes are like for the first week or two. Then, you can have first hand experience with the workload of the class and you can determine if you think you can take it yourself instead of having to rely on what other people say.

3. It's usually pretty pointless to ask ""Is this a good schedule or is this too much."" Everyone is at different skill levels and you kinda have to account for that. I know a lot of people who struggle with getting by at 13 units while there are also some people who take 30+ units and still thrive. Don't go hating on everyone who asks these questions but ultimately, the answer to any of these questions will always be ""depends on who you are and how good at this stuff you are."" You guys have 4 whole years here and just take it slow and figure out what pacing is good for you instead of forcing yourself to go along with what is ""normal."" You can finish basically any degree taking less than 12 units/sem if you don't do any other classes for fun. Not that I'd reccomend doing that cuz please take a courses that interest you but I just wanted to put that there for people who are worried they're behind. You're gonna graduate on time anyways with the same degree as everyone else so who cares.

4. Speaking of fun classes, theres this thing called decals here which are student led classes and there are a lot of interesting ones so I'd reccomend you look at them and see if there are any that interest you. Similarly, there's courses that are titled freshman/sophomore seminars which are classes where you don't have much work and you listen to ur profs talk abt a variety of subjects. If you don't know what to take it might be nice looking for one of these that fit your taste.

Uh I feel like that's all i have for rn have a good day yall and hope this helped. Comment if there's anything that you disagree w or want to add and I'll try to take it into account. Oh also i didnt know what flair to use so uh i'll just got w other.

Foonotes

1. An example from my first sem here was math 53 taught by James sethian vs Norman sheu. Sheu's class had hws that were graded much more leniently and had about 1/3-1/2 the length of Sethians. Idk if sethian did this but Sheu gave extra credit for attendance + released ""practice exams"" for all the exams that were basically the same things with numbers tweaked or a small twist.

2. (in my case, nus ctx 11 was this for me. Nothing requried except 5 hws and 3 open note, mc, online, exams. hws are super short and you literally just skim the notes/ctrl f for keywords and you can finish each in an hour or so. Everyone I knew taking the class also didn't study for the exams at all/minimally and got A-s or As just by looking up answers on the fly). ","who is taking 30 units

Not having any GSI’s to help prepare for this final on top of already taking one of the hardest lower division math classes, there’s a pretty massive feeling of uncertainty and nervousness. My professor curves our class to a c- which is pretty damn punishing so all of this combined just makes it feel like we’re headed for an absolute train wreck of a final. 

I’d love if someone could shed any light on the situation and maybe how the school could fix/accommodate for this?","Curving to a C- is such bullshit. Anyone who does that should honestly feel ashamed. They’re choosing to make people’s lives worse for no benefit.
How is a class curved to c-?
Sethian?
We can use GPT-3 to grade the finals.
I suppose the professor him/herself will have flashback of undergrad lifestyle with very little sleep and whatnot. But to answer you, it does look like we're heading for a train wreck -- not like the grades will be any more generous but only putting the toll on the professor on top of the students. If anything, the professors should've raised massive concern when all the admin decided was to give 2 extra weeks to grade.
has he told you he's grading them? lots of profs are planning on proctoring the exam and then not grading them.
Anyone have any updates for how sheu will conduct his final
Oh James James James….
Curves to a C-?  Highly implausible.  You probably misunderstood something.
Seriously. You’re functionally saying that you can’t teach the material well enough for more than half of the class to get a C. It’s either idiotic or an indictment of your approach to teaching, and I’d lean both.

lots- especially lecturers who can't not continue with the course bcos they have the no-strike clause but can refuse to take on tasks not otherwise assigned to them (the grading). They have to continue as though business is usual but then will not submit grades. The department I'm in (granted a social science) every lecturer is intending on doing this.
