"Judy Juanita, an Oakland-based playwright and novelist, has accused the Berkeley Repertory Theatre of discriminating against Black audience members at a performance of the company's new play about racial disparities in California's schools and prisons.",http://www.eastbayexpress.com/CultureSpyBlog/archives/2015/07/14/oakland-playwright-says-berkeley-theater-discriminated-against-black-audience-members,2015-07-16 08:24:22,,"Not surprising.  I went to a play there a few months ago, and was one of only a few minorities in the audience.  

I browsed through the program book, and saw a photo of their teen program, and figured out how serious they were about diversity:

For reference, these are the demographics of Berkeley High School, just a few blocks away:

* White - 40%
* African American - 22%
* Multi-Racial - 12%
* Hispanic/Latino - 16%
* Asian American/Pacifc Islander - 9%
* Native American - 1%

tl;dr because it was a dress rehearsal, theater staff thought there were no audience members in that section, so they turned her away. No racism here.

The only part you need to read is the response from the theater, which explains what happened:

>As you know, Friday's presentation was not a public performance, but a final dress rehearsal, which is still a working session, with technical staff seated throughout the house. Because we had invited an audience in for the first run-through of Act 2's group discussions, our house management staff were tasked with making sure that technical crew still had access to their reserved blocks of seats. Unfortunately, they were not aware that seats had been reserved for anyone other than technical crew, which is what led to your group being questions. This was our error, and as you note in your blog post, was resolved once they fully understood the situation.

Just like it was an honest mistake that staff at Elmwood Cafe ""thought"" someone was a homeless person soliciting the paying customers?
