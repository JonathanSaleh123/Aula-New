Why does no one at Berkeley remember its roots???,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c87av2/why_does_no_one_at_berkeley_remember_its_roots/,2024-04-19 13:40:03,No student that I‚Äôve talked to knows who Harvey Dong is ???? Like I thought he was a literal legend here but I‚Äôve talked to capable students (or so I thought) and they don‚Äôt know who he is or what he‚Äôs done. Can Berkeley even call itself a leftist haven if its own student population doesn‚Äôt remember its forefathers ?  #sad #capitalismplaguesusall ,"Sorry but who cares lol we‚Äôre already overwhelmed with course work and real work
Why should I care?
I met him last year at a student award event. Lovely man. He's definitely a legend...and we're up to our gills in legends here. Is there something in particular *you* think everyone should know about him? 

\[For those out of the loop: Harvey Dong has been a leader of Asian American activism in the Bay Area for decades, known especially for his participation in the Third World Liberation Front which established the Ethnic Studies Department at Berkeley in the late 60s. [He and his wife owned Eastwind Books in Berkeley, which closed last year](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/03/21/eastwind-books-berkeley-harvey-beatrice-dong-university-avenue-asian-american). He is a lecturer at Cal, and you can take [his class on Chinese American History](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-asamst-121-001-lec-001) through the Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies department this fall.\]
S tier yapping
ok
Bold of you to assume we are all leftists. Berkeley is not an ideological echo chamber
We aren‚Äôt all leftists lmao? Some of us have lives and jobs.
ok
Who tf cares
What constitutes real work?
Bro at least give me something to  argue against gtfo here w the ‚Äúok‚Äù
ü§£
It's absolutely an ideological echo chamber. Just a soulless corporate one these days.
Busting our ahh off on night shifts as health care workers and then having early morning classes, plus commuting.
Aight:

Thai chilis are better than Serrano Chilis.
I love all the upvotes as if this is what every student that just doesn't give a shit and is trying to get that bag is doing
Why does this have to work in opposition to activism on campus
Once bought a bunch of Serranos at Safeway cuz they mislabelled them as jalopenos. Stir fried a bunch of them for a dish, bathroom trip was not a fun experience‚Ä¶
Lack of time to study up on all that, especially the student parents caring for their children right after school too
Oh for me, I switched from Serrano Chilis to Thai Chilis because, even though Serrano Chilis were much larger, they weren‚Äôt really spicy whereas Thai Chilis had quite a kick
Ur ass doesn‚Äôt hurt the day after?
Thai chillis are good too, I always chop them up with garlic when I make fried rice
Nahhh I‚Äôm Telugu üòÖ

‚ÄúToo spicy‚Äù is not in my dictionary lmao
I chop them up with ginger when I make upma"

AC course for summer: ETHSTD 11AC or ASAMST 20AC? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cohvh8/ac_course_for_summer_ethstd_11ac_or_asamst_20ac/,2024-05-09 22:20:31,"Hi,

I need help with which to choose. I am planning to take one of these online options for Summer A session. ETHSTD 11AC ( Profs: Keith Feldman and Juana Rodriguez) or ASAMST 20AC (Harvey Dong)? I am doing some minor medical treatment, and I might be little tired. Easier or less load class would be real nice. If you have taken any of them, please share your input. 

Thank you in advance. ","Asamst 20ac you have to do a bit of work, but cool class. Nothing you can‚Äôt handle"

did anyone take this course and is willing to share the text with me? thank you so much i really appreciate it","[deleted]
Did you find the Asian America one by Dhingra? I can‚Äôt find a free version
that would be awesome! thank you so much
Could you share with me too?
Can I also have a copy?
looking for the same, were you able to find something?
i used an older version
i think i'll make do with an older version too, do you happen to have a pdf/epub?
i just searched on libgen"
ASAMST 20A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10dtikf/asamst_20a/,2023-01-16 13:51:41,"Hi, was wondering if anyone has taken this course with professor Harvey Dong and how it is in terms of difficulty/workload. I'm taking it to satisfy a humanities requirement. Thanks!","It's a class that usually has quite a bit of reading, but it's super interesting and a valuable class. Harvey is a LEGEND - one of my biggest regrets that I never managed to get a class with him at Cal. He was one of the student leaders of the Ethnic Studies movement in the 70s, and now he's one of the oldest lecturers in that very department! Super super nice guy with some great stories.
Harvey Dong is amazing! I just took that course with him last semester. I just wish I had more in person time with him, but he did one in person meet up that was optional, so I got to meet him, and I‚Äôm so glad that I did. He really is a legend. He was there during the strikes that brought us ethnic studies, on the UC Berkeley campus in 1969. I really loved that course. There is a ton of reading, and I poured a lot of work into that class, but it was worth it, and it‚Äôs all really interesting. I didn‚Äôt know so much of what happened in this area that shaped Asian American relations and unity until this class. Again, a ton of reading, but a great class.
Easy class, pretty interesting and Prof Dong has such interesting stories and first-hand experiences with various Asian American activist movements here at Berkeley. Definitely worth taking if you are interested in the topic. Also worth taking even if you aren‚Äôt (easy A, GPA booster!)
thank you so much for the reply and that's great to hear! Do you know how the class is difficulty/grading wise?
Thank you for the reply! Quick question but how accessible/approachable is Prof Dong in and out of class, I would potentially need a non-science letter of rec down the line and would like to keep this class as an option.
I don't know about Harvey specifically, but I do know that no classes in Ethnic Studies grade on a curve because they're graded solely on if you meet the rubric; it's entirely possible and doable that the whole class makes an A. If you're decent at writing exam papers that answer the prompt, you'll do just fine. If you have more specific questions, though, I would just email Prof. Dong with any concerns you have! He's genuinely a super nice and approachable person, he teaches bc he loves his subject and wants it to be accessible to his students, so he really wants everyone to learn and succeed in his class.
Never personally had to contact him regarding ASAMST20A (I had a GSI), so not entirely sure. However, I did contact him once regarding a research project for another class and he responded within a couple days!"

im still looking for a pdf (softcopy) :( if anyone has one!
i have a physical copy if you‚Äôd like to borrow!
Eastwind books should have copies of that book. It‚Äôs just a couple blocks from campus. This is a great class and Harvey Dong is really just a legend!
i think eastwind closed down
Oh no! That‚Äôs so sad! I just looked it up and you‚Äôre right! That place was amazing! They‚Äôre still going to be selling some books online, including Stand Up.
