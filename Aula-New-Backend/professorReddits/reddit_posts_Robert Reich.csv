Robert Reich standing up for us!,https://i.redd.it/e3h9gb7c963a1.jpg,2022-11-30 10:21:38,,"Reich the truest NIMBY. He wants people to be paid more, but without building extra housing, so his house goes up in value faster and displaces the poors.
>U Cal
Does RR really believe Newsom is idly awaiting ""memo"" advice on twitter?

Are we supposed to believe that, given his extensive network of government contacts, RR couldn't directly call/text/email Newsom and/or his team?

Is this pure narcissism or some virtue signaling performance for likes and retweets, or both?

I actually really like RR, but I cringe every time I see someone I genuinely like using social media like r/ImTheMainCharacter
he gets paid 300k a year to teach a class once a week in the spring. For someone who could have so much impact its crazy all he does it tweet all day and can't even get the school's name right
Desantis wouldve already said something
👏🏽
Who is ""us""?  Did this turn into r/gradstudents when I wasn't looking?
I love how the grad students brigade this sub to try and control the narrative, and not allow anyone else to express an opinion.  You can down vote me to hell, but this sub doesn't belong to you.
\> U Cal

Does he not literally teach at Berkeley
Good
This tweet is a gentle suggestion to the governor to take some time out of his day and think about the poor students:/

Talk about saying something without saying anything. But that’s all that RR does anyways - not counting the gaslighting.
Other Universities actually provide housing that's not operated at a profit, to help make reasonable salaries, living ones.  Building extra housing could do even more than just offset the shortage/price pressure.  It  could be part of the ""salary"" GSIs make, at minimal cost to the University.  But we can't have that, because people in communities around almost all the campuses (not just Cal) don't want that.
Do not use these words to distract people. Solve UC's problem before talking about other things. We haven't been paying livable wages yet.
University of California.  It's not just Cal on strike.  It seems like a reasonable abbreviation to me.
Stating this in public puts Newsom on the hook to take a position. A public position by the governor can influence a positive outcome for the union.
Someone clearly doesn’t use Twitter…
Seems like a fine abbreviation for University of California to me.  He's not just talking about Berkeley.
Yeah, that actually confused me, too.

As far as I can tell, the strike doesn't benefit undergrads. It's impeding instruction, and is likely to result in higher tuition for undergrads in order to pay grad students more.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Literally the only time this sub hasn't been a total neoliberal circlejerk. Cry more.
The whole university is on strike, not just Berkeley.  ""University of California""
Point they’re trying to make is your wage would be livable if rent wasn’t being driven up by people like him pushing back on multi-unit housing developments in Berkeley
Usually I've seen UC, though I guess if you want to disambiguate from University of Colorado and University of Connecticut it makes sense
Watch Newsom continue to not respond at all.

In other words, this doesn't put him on the hook for a thing and is just performative posturing.
I can understand that perspective for sure. I’ve met the exhausted undergrads here. It’s upsetting and as a GSI I worked to accommodate them so they all had the ability to pass. But being a dual GSI (paid for 10hrs/week) and GSR (10 hrs/week) one semester yet spending over 40 hrs a week on GSI work alone and on top of that managing my own experimental work is not fair labor practice. The problem is administrative bloat, plain and simple. If the pay was congruent to the work, there would be no strike.

It would absolutely benefit undergrads if their GSI’s weren’t working 16 hrs a day including weekends and could focus more on instruction instead of being under stresses of our own. We really do care about our students.
I'd argue that since the overwhelming majority of undergrads are going to become workers, seeing collective labor action successfully negotiate better compensation and working conditions is entirely good.

People who insist that these gains must be made at the cost of higher tuition are myopic. The state had its largest budget surplus ever and can afford to peel more money toward its higher ed system. The university pays incredible dividends over time by educating a tax-base that will be high earners and contributors throughout their lives, so it's a worthy investment of resources even if it isn't strictly profitable. Passing the costs of running it onto a direct consumer model is antithetical to the public education mission and is another example of the gross hold that neoliberalism has had on public goods since the 70s.
When your grad students can’t afford housing, that impedes instruction. You should want your teachers to be paid well.
nobody in the history of the state of California has ever referred to the UC system as “U Cal”
University of Colorado uses CU anyway, pretty much for this reason.
Why do you view yourself as labor? Is this a job to you? You are a student.
Yes, the money will come from both:

- Taxes (paid by people who didn't get into college)
- Tuition (paid by undergrads)

Both of these classes (undergrads, and uneducated) are beneath PhD students, but are being asked to fund their privileged education. Do you think that is right?

If you aren't privileged enough to get into graduate school and join the 3%, should you be forced to pay for the aristocracy's education? Why are we forcing the lower classes to pay the aristocracy?

This is the opposite of what strikes are for. Strikes are for the lower class to organize and take money from capitalist oppressors. But this is a set of privileged students organizing against a non-profit to demand more money for their education which will (back-handedly) come from the classes beneath them who couldn't get into grad school.
>I'd argue that since the overwhelming majority of undergrads are going to become workers, seeing collective labor action successfully negotiate better compensation and working conditions is entirely good. 

As much as I support the specific aims of the strike (uGSIs, GSI/Rs, and postdocs are absolutely being exploited even more than you can normally expect under capitalism and both need *and* deserve much better compensation than UC is currently offering) this is what *really* gets me excited here. The potential to break tens of thousands of students out of the degree-to-industry-as-quickly-as-can-be mindset and have them thinking critically about the larger structures they're just beginning to slot themselves into is huge. The optimistic part of me hopes this demonstration of collective power can generate a real shift in people's perspectives. Start the snowball rolling, ya know?
Ah, you’re not a grad student, are you? Hah
Do you believe someone who is working for $24000/year is not lower class? These are not dues paid to be part of the wealthy elite. My expected postdoc salary will be less than I made after I got a job after undergrad. I just really love my field. Your money is not going to graduate students stuffing their pockets.  [maybe when you’re older](https://youtu.be/qqrCoyVK80I)
You weren't working 40 hours as a GSI, you were working for 10 and volunteering for 30. If you don't like doing unpaid volunteer work you can stop anytime you want.
> Do you believe someone who is working for $24000/year is not lower class?

No, it doesn't make any sense to judge a student by how much money he makes. Students aren't supposed to make money. They spend money on school, often taking out loans, to get an education, so that they can make money after they graduate and get a job.

U.C. Berkeley PhD students are the cream of the crop. We are not the proletariat. We are mostly white. We are next in line to the aristocracy. The janitors are brown and paid less than us. Give sympathy to the janitors. A STEM PhD student can leave at any point and earn $200k/yr. We don't need sympathy. School is a choice to learn.
Ooh… you’re in for a surprise when you get into the workforce.
Since you already know the term proletariat, I'd suggest looking up ""labor aristocracy"" next. 

Materially, all these students and researchers are part of the proletariat. They generate value through their work that some other entity (the university in this case) takes ownership of. Your attempt to refute that is a purely ideological position.
Don’t tell that to Berkeley students they’d rather be the “workers”
> They generate value through their work that some other entity (the university in this case) takes ownership of.

You're acting as if there's some evil capitalist extracting profit from their labor— but the University is a *non-profit*, owned by the people. The ""product"" of research is given to the commons as a public good.

The public that owns the university is [mostly without even a college degree](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA). They are more racially diverse and economically oppressed than PhD students who are mostly white and one step away from running the world.

 - PhD students are not workers— they are students.
 - PhD students are not oppressed— they are prioritizing learning *by choice*.
 - PhD students are not the proletariat— they are the privileged runners-up for the aristocracy.
 - The university is not a capitalist oppressor extracting profit— it is a non-profit, paid for and owned by the public.

This strike has the metaphor backwards, and it's extracting value from the black and brown laborers of the public  to make them fund the elite education of bourgeoisie intellectuals who are one step away from running the world.
The university may be a public good, but it still exists within a liberal capitalist economy and is still ran according to the pressure of capitalist labor markets. It's workers are still workers.

Just because education jobs are largely ancillary to direct commodity production doesn't mean that they are removed from it or that workers engaged in those jobs are somehow ""not actually workers"". There doesn't need to be an ""oppressor""--it's simply the reality of the economic system. They are still selling their labor power on the market. 

You're even granting here that, ""The ""product"" of research is given to the commons as a public good. It is owned by the public.""

If the product of the research is ""given"" to the commons, that literally means it's uncompensated labor: If the public ends up profiting (remember that the definition of profit is basically ""uncompensated labor"") from the work done at universities by researchers and GSIs (which it unequivocally does: nobody can argue that the university doesn't produce more economic value than it requires given the dispersed contributions of an educated workforce and the direct fruits of research), then those people are literally no different than factory workers when it comes to labor value.

Taking your argument to its conclusion, anyone who works within any area of the government should do so for free because paying them requires taxes from ""real"" workers and they have no right to advocate for better working conditions.
>That would make sense if this were a for-profit corporation—but the University is a non-profit. 

The university holds the rights to any ideas their grad students or postdocs develop. It doesn't matter if they're legally a non-profit or not. Unless you think the USSR didn't have any exploitation since profit wasn't even considered as a metric in their economic planning. 

>It is owned by the public. 

IP owned by an ostensibly public institution is not the same as being part of the public domain. 

>PhD students are not workers— they are students. 

And where is the line between student and worker in your mind? PhD candidates usually only take classes for a couple years at most before essentially becoming full-time (as opposed to merely part-time) producers. But beyond that, does a job requiring training not count as a job?  Pay during training is mandatory, at least under CA law. 

>PhD students are not oppressed— they are choosing to learn. 

Oppressed is not a rigorously defined word. What I said is they're *exploited.* By which I mean they don't receive the full value their labor generates *and* that they don't control its distribution. 

>PhD students are not the proletariat— they are the privileged runners-up for the aristocracy. 

Again, look up ""labor aristocracy."" Individuals can defy their class interests. This divide and conquer mentality goes as far back as European colonialism (and absolutely further, but without a strict capitalist underpinning). 

>paid for and owned by the public. 

The UC only receives about 10% of its funding from the state general fund. And again, unless you're willing to say all the striking workers in China are also not being exploited since their government claims to run industry on behalf of the people, then this definition of ""owned by the people"" comes up woefully short."

Kamau Bell, that he supported the landmarking because the developers are “pretending” to build low-income or inclusionary housing. So far, the proposal for the new building has a subsidy for including one low-income unit. The plan is incomplete and could change, but all development in Berkeley must include some affordable housing.

From the article
The oversimplified response to calling afoul to the obviously inept solution to homelessness, affordable housing mandates that are woefully inadequate and as a solution to homelessness, aren't even directly relavent to the problem, because the problem isn't about there being no existing housing. 
    The problem began with the 2008 sub prime mortgage scam. A decade and a half of defaulted loans, uprooting entire communities that were many generations in place, the fracturing and scattering of families, with some folks remaining in place refusing to leave the scene, unsettling into homelessness. Ever been to the lien sales on the court house steps and seen the salivating developers calling out bids to homes? Between them and the banks who backed them, a massive amount of wealth was generated in a very short period. Remodel, market, sold, repeat. Up went the home values which went in step with the tech boom. Many homes were bought and turned into rental units, and having not yet been restricted by rent control, rental amounts were set to reflect the money that was being made by recent arrivals. The demand for housing rose, but there was still adequate housing. The barrier was the cost. We saw it happen all over the market. Residential and retail too. Long standing businesses were there one day and gone the next. Vacant retail and commercial buildings were not being occupied, or quickly put on the market as long-term landlords decided to cash in on millions of dollars in unrealized gains. Enter the firm based re development free for all of Berkeley, Emeryville and Oakland. All with the battle cry of affordable housing to get well meaning liberals to endorse the erasure of these cities. All the projects happening all over the place, increasing noise and traffic, making it impossible to get anywhere on time, with the incoming wealth, rent goes up, goods and services went up, and that brought about displacing longtime residents with rent control, because housing is only one piece of what it means to be able to pay for life. Municipal tax revenue gains increased as the demographic reflected more and more wealth in the area and people with no where else to go, end up on the street with their names on a goddamn wait list. And so yeah, the whole Nimby label is often not taking into account, what the real cause of rise in homelessness is. Its the circumstances created by wall street gaining momentum with residential house flippers, reselling their lien sale properties higher and higher, with an increasing housing demand brought on by lots of incoming tech workers, supply and demand pushing prices even higher, and pushing people out on to the street and then believing that the solution is for the developers to get even more projects to build more housing which any owner is going to want to fill with financially stable people, and affordable housing units are not an attractive feature to banks, investors, and buyers because of the stigma and less rental property income. And the city council have all been fucking happy to help, complicit in how much the ecosystem here can support, disregarding the amount of water it takes to make as much concrete as these complexes require. Looking at that, and personally being from here and getting lost in my own home town because all the unique buildings that have been here for decades are gone, I'm inclined to say stop building entirely and let's look at the real cause of this in order to arrive at real solutions.

https://www.berkeleyside.org/2020/07/24/8-housing-projects-560-apartments-approved-berkeley-2020

From a different article:
I was thinking more of these examples: 
2440 shattuck ave

40-unit apartment complex
no on-site parking.   
3 units would be affordable. 
The firm anticipates paying about $1 million into the city’s affordable housing fund

Shattuck and Francisco Street
 plans for a 68-unit apartment building 
At least seven affordable units
still deciding whether to include additional units or pay into the affordable housing fund to satisfy city requirements.
No resident parking

These are only 2 buildings out of how many others that are being planned in the city.  I could go on and on with each and every building going up. You can’t put even a dent in the housing crisis with this system.  And rip parking.  But at least they’re planning for commercial space. Berkeley needs more vacant storefronts. 

PS - they’re planning for 9000 new units by 2040.

Robert Reich column on Berkeley vs. Big Soda,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/berkeley-vs-big-soda_b_5786028.html,2014-09-10 18:13:04,,"Muh Freedom
The proposal doesn't make healthier options at the store any cheaper.  And the tax doesn't go to public water fountains.  The tax isn't slated for anything in particular.  There is a committee which will hold meetings to decide how the revenue will be spent.  The Berkeley committee system is sluggish, and wrought with political cronyism.  

The wording is odd: ""sweeteners used to sweeten such drinks, but exempting: (1) sweeteners...""  

The long form of the proposal mentions that natural fruit juices sweetened with sugar are exempt.  But the ballot question only says 100% juice is exempt, making it seem like juices sweetened with sugar are not exempt.  
A similar tax failed to pass in Richmond last election. The ABA advertised heavily about how bad it was for local business, and I think that had a major influence on the voting outcome. This article is pretty dramatic though.
I think governments have an obligation to taxpayers to influence society away from behaviors that burden everyone else. Use the tax money to educate people to avoid high sugar diets and also support the costs that type II diabetics and the obese place on the economy. People can continue drinking that crap all they want, but now they have to pay their share of the price everyone else had to pay.
Jesus Christ this is such horseshit. ""Big soda""? Give me a fucking break.
Of course companies that sell soda are upset about this. Why shouldn't they be? All they want is to sell a product to consenting adults who want to enjoy a coke...why the fuck does the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to legislate peoples' health choices?

Sometimes I really hate this city. Soda is unhealthy, I know, but people should have the right to make their own goddamn choices without some fucking bureaucrat deciding what's right for them. I can't believe that the city of Berkeley thinks it has a right to charge fucking adults for making their own choices regarding beverages. This is such a waste of the city government's time.

And why the fuck would any rational person compare the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda (if such a right even exists) to the fight for free speech? What the fuck is Robert Reich smoking? Does he really think these two things are comparable?

Sorry for all the cursing, I'm pretty drunk and fucking pissed off.
I think its great if this passes. Soda's making people unhealthy. Since we  subsidize HFCS production, a tax on sugar later on seems like a logical step to equalize prices. 
>There is a committee which will hold meetings to decide how the revenue will be spent.

Actually it's not even as good as that. The committee will make general spending recommendations but if they try to direct the actual tax amount (in a 1:1 ratio or anything close) they'll run afoul of the law since taxes for specific purposes require a 2/3 majority vote.

So how much of the money raised by the tax will end up funding health programs for kids or whatever is anybody's guess.
>Use the tax money to educate people to avoid high sugar diets and also support the costs that type II diabetics and the obese place on the economy.

They can't.

All the money raised by Measure D goes directly into the General Fund. Setting up a special fund like that would have required a 2/3 vote.

This tax is also so vaguely written that it includes things virtually all sports drinks, coconut water, almond milk, etc. Basically almost any liquid drink that has added sugar in it, even if it's very small amounts.
It's not a a soda ban; it's a soda tax.  Cigarette companies also want to sell a product to consenting adults.  Is it bad to tax cigarettes and donate the money to lung cancer research?  Is it wrong to tax luxury goods and redistribute the taxes to less wealthy people?  It depends on the role you think the government should have in society.  But if cigarettes are  taxed, people in Berkeley will buy less soda and will be healthier because of it.  
> the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to legislate peoples' health choices

The city of Berkeley is not some outside entity imposing arbitrary rules on the helpless population. This measure was put on the ballot by collecting sufficient signatures from the residents of Berkeley, and now the people get to vote on it. It's called democracy.

>people should have the right to make their own goddamn choices without some fucking bureaucrat deciding what's right for them.

They can still choose to drink as much soda as they want. And this law hasn't been made up by some bureaucrat.

>the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda

That's not what's happening.

Obesity and diabetes are already at epidemic levels, and we have a responsibility to prevent the next generation from suffering the same fate. If this law means that 5% fewer children develop diabetes at a young age, then I think it's worth the extra $0.12 per can that the distributors will be paying for distributing these drinks to them.
> And why the fuck would any rational person compare the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda (if such a right even exists) to the fight for free speech?

If anything, the opposite would apply: Freedom of speech is analogous to freedom of consumption.
""legislate peoples health choices"" ?! It's just a tax and isn't a high one. You can chug all the soda you want.

I do think Bloomberg's ban on 16oz soda or whatever was pretty stupid for the reasons you outline.

> And why the fuck would any rational person compare the right to prevent other people from enjoying soda (if such a right even exists) to the fight for free speech?

Because they both happened in Berkeley. Reich says it's not as dramatic, so calm down. And he makes a link at the end between this and Citizens United.
RIP /u/throwawayheyheyneigh's freedom. 
What we should do is stop subsidizing HFCS.
People can enjoy soda as part of a healthy diet. Cigarettes are not the same.
>It's not a a soda ban; it's a soda tax.

But the purpose is to prevent people from buying soda. I never said it was a ban.

> Cigarette companies also want to sell a product to consenting adults. Is it bad to tax cigarettes and donate the money to lung cancer research?

In my opinion? Yes. The state has no right to tell people not to engage in unhealthy habits.
>The city of Berkeley is not some outside entity imposing arbitrary rules on the helpless population. This measure was put on the ballot by collecting sufficient signatures from the residents of Berkeley, and now the people get to vote on it. It's called democracy.

Why does the fact that it was passed democratically have to do with anything? Does majority support have any bearing on whether something is ethically questionable? Why do the people have Berkeley have a right to charge me for making my own health choices?

>That's not what's happening.

It *is* what's happening. The only way this measure can work as intended is if some nonzero number of soda purchases that would have happened don't happen. Each of those potential purchases is a person that would have enjoyed a soda that no longer will. The majority is butting into the lives of grown-ass adults and saying ""You're not responsible enough to make your own choices, so we're going to make them for you.""
But the whole purpose is to prevent people from buying soda. Why does the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to do this? They explicitly say that the purpose is to make people healthier by making them less likely to buy soda, same as cigarettes.
The city of Berkeley doesn't have control over federal crop subsidies though. They do have control over local tax initiatives. 

Since you're for the discontinuation of HFCS subsidies, then you are necessarily ok with an increased price of soda. In which case, this local tax seems to do the trick.
This point is spot on. Cigarettes and Soda are in completely different leagues in terms of health hazard. Those who support this tax... would you be okay with taxing individuals who do not work out? If not, why not?
edit: grammar
I'm not arguing the point, because I honestly don't have an opinion one way or the other, but what if the health of the people affects the state? If the state has to support people who have bad health due to, say, smoking, does the state have the right to regulate/legislate smoking?
I don't think anyone expects this to cause soda sales to drop to zero.  They'll probably drop, but that's the point, isn't it?
> But the purpose is to prevent people from buying soda

prevent?  let's try...  ""reduce the amount"" 

> The state has no right to tell people not to engage in unhealthy habits.

This IS up for debate, but you have to realize that the arguments have little do with 'rights.'   It's much more about a public health issue.  For example, we ban smoking in bars/restaurant because it creates risk and costs for others.   The goal is not to stop individuals from expressing rights to be (un)healthy, but to reduce the amount of tax money we need to spend on public health. 

A healthier population means less money spent on health care means overall quality of life.   

>  Why do the people have Berkeley have a right to charge me for making my own health choices?

Because you are more likely to be a burden on the system if you are obese and have diabetes, which was ultimately preventable in the first place. 

When you get that electric wheelchair because your joints get decimated by your obesity, you can be glad that .12c you paid for your coke cans helped pay for the curb cuts that allows you to get your wheel chair up on to the side walk. 


>Why does the fact that it was passed democratically have to do with anything?

Because you claimed that this was ""some bureaucrat"" telling you what to do. It's not.

>Why do the people have Berkeley have a right to charge me for making my own health choices?

They aren't charging you. The tax is to be paid by distributors. 

More importantly, the price of soda is already effectively set by the government through massive subsidies to corn farmers. So why get so upset if some people disagree with what that price should be set at? If you think the government has no business manipulating prices of goods, then all those subsidies have to be taken away, and the cost of the soda would go up by a lot more than $0.01 per ounce.
> But the whole purpose is to prevent people from buying soda.

No it's not.

> They explicitly say that the purpose is to make people healthier by making them less likely to buy soda, same as cigarettes.

Yes exactly, you got it right!

> Why does the city of Berkeley feel like it has the right to do this? 

Um, the constitution of California?
>The city of Berkeley doesn't have control over federal crop subsidies though.

Sure, but if they really gave a shit they could issue a proclamation condemning the subsidies and banning products containing HFCS from vending machines in city buildings or something.

Berkeley has made the National news with some of the city proclamations in the past. Not sure why they wouldn't make one about this issue if they really cared about health rather than just getting more tax money.
I don't even know where to start with this poor reasoning.

> The city of Berkeley doesn't have control over federal crop subsidies though. They do have control over local tax initiatives.

What the city of Berkeley has control over is irrelevant to my comment. I'm looking at things from an overall perspective, as a party to city, state, federal, and other municipal governments. If folks are really concerned with the health effects and consumption rates of soda, and they really cared about a lasting solution to the problem rather than a band-aid over a broken knee (assuming the problem is analogous to that, which I'm not convinced it is), they'd first and foremost take issue with the massive HFCS subsidies that get handed out like... well, HFCS-composed candy.

> Since you're for the discontinuation of HFCS subsidies, then you are necessarily ok with an increased price of soda. In which case, this local tax seems to do the trick.

A higher soda cost from a lack of HFCS subsidies is not the same as a higher soda cost from arbitrary taxation by a local government. That government money can and should be spent elsewhere. The price increase will be an organic, not artificial, function of the market, as opposed to a similarly artificial raise in price aimed at combating ""Big Soda"" and raising money for the city of Berkeley's general fund.


This is more of an argument against state health intervention, I think. 
There have been studies that show that public healthcare costs decrease due to smoking because people who die earlier need so much less end of life care. If anything we should be subsidizing smokers for saving us money. 
Where did I say it would drop to zero?
But a lot of people drink soda and don't get obese or become diabetic.

If the problem is obesity and diabetes, why not just tax obesity and diabetes? 


>Because you claimed that this was ""some bureaucrat"" telling you what to do. It's not.

A bureaucrat formulated the tax, Berkeley residents passed it.

>They aren't charging you. The tax is to be paid by distributors.

...and then passed on to consumers. Do you really think distributors wil take the hit themselves?

>More importantly, the price of soda is already effectively set by the government through massive subsidies to corn farmers. 

And it shouldn't be. Kill the subsidies and excise taxes and let consumers make their own decisions based on what things actually cost to produce. I'm completely fine with the price of soda going up by ending subsidies that promote inefficiencies in the soda market. The only reason these subsidies still exist is because of the political clout the corn lobby has.
> No it's not.

Then what's the point?

>What the city of Berkeley has control over is irrelevant to my comment. 

Then your comment was irrelevant to the topic at hand, wasn't it? This topic is solely about the City of Berkeley, their policies, and the scope of their influence. So your offhand comment about federal subsidies belongs here why--you either mistakenly posted in this topic instead of another, or you were using your comment to critique local policy.

>If folks are really concerned with the health effects and consumption rates of soda, and they really cared about a lasting solution to the problem rather than a band-aid over a broken knee (assuming the problem is analogous to that, which I'm not convinced it is), they'd first and foremost take issue with the massive HFCS subsidies that get handed out like... well, HFCS-composed candy.

Again, local municipalities don't have control over federal subsidies. All of this is just bluster. You can't say, ""If you can't do everything, then do nothing."" That's an impossible tactic. If Berkeley was putting up a tax on candy, you'd probably say the same thing, but replace ""HFCS-composed candy"" with ""HFCS-composed soda"".

This policy is EXACTLY what you're asking for: Local government combating massive national subsidies of sugar by taxing the manufacturers of products full of cheap, subsidized sugar. This is a reasonable, local start toward addressing to that problem using the power that local government holds.

>A higher soda cost from a lack of HFCS subsidies is not the same as a higher soda cost from arbitrary taxation by a local government. **That government money can and should be spent elsewhere.**

That's not how subsidies or government spending works. 

Anyway, Berkeley is in a position where it feels it must use local tax policy to counteract national tax policy and subsidization. 

Again (third time now): The City of Berkeley has no way to directly combat federal subsidies or the market pricing of the items created through those subsidies. However, Berkeley still has health problems (same as everywhere else) due to the diet that these subsidies promote. The City decided to try to do something within its control to combat that fact: Increase the cost of manufacturers of one of the subsidized foods to more accurately reflect what it should cost, at least if they want to do business in Berkeley. The tax money will be used to help the City of Berkeley, and you, as a resident, are able to much more easily have influence over how the city spends its money than how the nation spends your money. You can vote on local ordinances (including this one), participate in city council meetings (I think there is one next week), and even run in local elections.

You can disagree, but you aren't offering any feasible local alternative to what is seen as a problem. Hell, maybe you don't think this is a problem: Fine, go and campaign about that! But taking the position that this is the 'wrong' way for *Berkeley* to address this problem while not offering an alternative local solution is pointless.

I'd also take issue with the use of 'arbitrary'. This tax isn't arbitrary in the least: It's targeted specifically at soda because of the effects that soda has. There are, of course, other 'bad things' in the world. But it's intellectually dishonest to say that something is arbitrary because it chooses to focus on one problem rather than another. If you think there are other things to focus on, then it is fully within your power to do some research, get some signatures, and make a change. Sitting back and complaining that people aren't doing the right thing because they could be doing something else is just lazy.
That is surprising! I wonder if they also considered people dying younger losing the state money by not being productive/paying taxes.
Implying that we should be using government power to knowingly and actively work against the public health, and increase cancer and lung disease rates. You do know that there is more to good governance than saving money, don't you?
>But the purpose is to prevent people from buying soda. I never said it was a ban.

I'd argue that it's not ""preventing people from buying soda"".  It's just discouraging them from doing so.
1) It's a statistical argument

2) It's about PREVENTION
So the people of Berkeley, who have no control over the federal government's corn subsidies, are trying to undo some of the harm caused by those subsidies by exercising what power they have locally. I can't see why anyone would get so worked up over that. 
Are you that drunk? Read the next sentence. Where I quote you.
> Then your comment was irrelevant to the topic at hand, wasn't it? This topic is solely about the City of Berkeley, their policies, and the scope of their influence. So your offhand comment about federal subsidies belongs here why--you either mistakenly posted in this topic instead of another, or you were using your comment to critique local policy.

Are you being willfully obtuse? The comment was directly related to what we're talking about. Let me see if I understand you, though. So because we're talking about, e.g., what to do about pollution on the local level, we can't talk about it with respect to national policies? I'm not sure that someone who commented on national policies in that situation would be making an ""irrelevant"" comment. 

> Again, local municipalities don't have control over federal subsidies. 

Thanks for the clarification!

> All of this is just bluster. You can't say, ""If you can't do everything, then do nothing."" 

Where did I say that? I was putting forward the idea that there *might* be better solutions to the problems created by soda consumption (again, if there even *are* problems directly correlated with soda consumption, and I'd ask you to show me some direct correlations, but I suspect that'd be asking too much of you) and by HFCS subsidies than an arbitrary tax that *goes into the general fund.*

> This policy is EXACTLY what you're asking for: Local government combating massive national subsidies of sugar by taxing the manufacturers of products full of cheap, subsidized sugar. This is a reasonable, local start toward addressing to that problem using the power that local government holds.

Huh? When did I ask for, or demonstrate support for, anything like that? Again, I'm not convinced (one way or the other!) that ""Big Soda"" is, per se, a problem. And even if it decisively were, we'd still be faced with the huge (and to my mind unasked, especially by folks like you) question of the legitimacy of any ""sin tax"" whatsoever. You seem to take the legitimacy of such a thing to be a given; please correct me if I'm wrong about that.

> That's not how subsidies or government spending works.

I hear a claim but not an argument there. How is that not how government spending, at least for subsidies, works? Whatever form they come in, the government can choose to stop granting or to reduce subsidies. But they're copping to the highly lucrative HFCS-related industries. Taxing something downstream only is *not* a solution. It is, at best, a register of protest, and a dubious one at that, given that the money garnered by the measure won't even be allocated into programs dedicated to, e.g., recreation or nutrition education. If you support this measure, as you seem to, you might at least admit that it hardly looks genuine of the city to prop up ""unhealthiness"" as a reason for this tax and then contribute none of that money towards doing anything else about it.

> Anyway, Berkeley is in a position where it feels it must use local tax policy to counteract national tax policy and subsidization.

You haven't said *one thing* about how will effectively, in practice, ""counteract[s] national tax policy and subsidization,"" other than make some products slightly less available to some consumers by means of taxing distributors. The money will, again, go into the city's general fund. It will accumulate a sizable sum for the city on the backs of distributors who distribute a product

> Again (third time now): The City of Berkeley has no way to directly combat federal subsidies or the market pricing of the items created through those subsidies. 

True. But that's not a positive argument for the means advocated by Measure D.

> However, Berkeley still has health problems (same as everywhere else) due to the diet that these subsidies promote. 

Give me one study that shows a) how the health problems you're referring to, which I don't deny, are directly linked overwhelmingly to the consumption of HFCS or ""sweetened beverages"" and/or b) that show that taxing sweetened beverages as Measure D proposes will actually have any effect at all on rectifying these problems, even within Berkeley city limits (barring, of course, people who voted for it feeling good about themselves for having ""done something,"" as you put it).

> I'd also take issue with the use of 'arbitrary'. This tax isn't arbitrary in the least: It's targeted specifically at soda because of the effects that soda has. 

Re: effects, see above. And it's not arbitrary, you say? Why start with soda? Are you going to impose an extra tax on potato chips, too? What about candy bars? And fast food? Or what about wine or liquor (already taxed, I know, but so is soda!), which the middle-upper class by a vast majority consumes and which is not provably significantly better or worse for you than soda? What about video games? That's a pretty good industry, and it would be good if people got off their couches and got outside! What if we taxed people for buying Reddit Gold, since it's not so healthy for them to be spending so much time on that website, anyway?

> There are, of course, other 'bad things' in the world. But it's intellectually dishonest to say that something is arbitrary because it chooses to focus on one problem rather than another. If you think there are other things to focus on, then it is fully within your power to do some research, get some signatures, and make a change. Sitting back and complaining that people aren't doing the right thing because they could be doing something else is just lazy.

You're awfully smug for somebody who, like me, is also behind a keyboard talking about the issues. It's massively fallacious to say that a proposal is in and of itself ""bad"" in some sense because the person advocating it isn't actively pursuing it. And it's not lazy to lodge a complaint that the current course of action isn't the best--and, not only that it *isn't the best,* but that it has demonstrable negative consequences! Those being, in this case, the notion that a) such taxation is a solution to larger-scale government problems (it isn't), b) ""sin taxes"" are OK (dubious at best, but perhaps acceptable if you're as pious a liberal as many in Berkeley are), and c) the money goes into the general fund without any additional oversight (not acceptable--unless you think it is acceptable, in which case, you and I live on different planets). What's lazy is misrepresenting, oversimplifying, and willfully misunderstanding someone's argument to support a prejudged conclusion.

An additional point re: my request for knockdown empirical evidence of a causal correlation between the rise in consumption of HFCS and the rise in ill health effects overall. You might want to take a look at the Wikipedia page on the matter (which itself shows just how readily available information is about what the city seems to be treating as an open-and-shut case):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup_and_health#Obesity_and_metabolic_syndrome
I know. My comment was intentionally absurd, but I think it's just as absurd to pass an idiotic tax like this that attacks a broad and frankly illogical category of items that we have no evidence are harmful.

Mountain Dew, coconut water, Gatoraid and organic soymilk would all be taxed the same under Measure D.

I can understand why we might want to tax one, or even two, of those items as part of an anti-obesity crusade. But taxing organic soymilk? How is that going to help people be less obese or make healthier decisions? 
If they were concerned about fighting corn subsidies (which I've never heard a proponent of this measure say is the case), then a tax on soda alone is way too specific. Corn syrup is in like everything now. 

I'd be completely fine with a tax on corn-derived products that is specifically designed to combat the effects of corn subsidies (including analysis to determine what the effect of these subsidies is in order to combat them with a tax of equal magnitude in the other direction). But that's not what this is.
I may be drunk but I'm making more sense than you. 

How are they going to regulate people's health if not by preventing people from buying soda? 
Here's a link from the Harvard School of Public Health specifically citing studies about the health effects of soda: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/soft-drinks-and-disease/

The City of Berkeley notes that soda consumption is demonstrably a harm to public health. They believe that the manufacturers of that harm ought to be taxed to sell that harmful thing to people. Therefore, they have proposed an additional tax on the manufacturers to sell the substance in Berkeley.

I don't know whether this will ""solve"" the problem, but I see the reasoning and don't haven't heard of a better local alternative. 

All that you added to the conversation is that ""we"" should 'stop subsidizing HFCS'. That's beside the point (and now in another post you're saying that HFCS may not be harmful after all, yet you're calling *me* out for being obtuse, despite you being the one in the weeds on this one). My original comment was: You think ""we"" should do something, but since Berkeley cannot do that thing, they are doing as close to that as possible by raising the price of being in the soda business *in Berkeley* since their gripe is with soda specifically and their jurisdiction is Berkeley specifically.

Now you're going down another rabbit hole about OTHER things that could alternatively be taxed, why things should or shouldn't be taxed, ad hominens about living in Berkeley, and questioning how Berkeley spends its money when there are council meetings literally every week that you can attend or read about which go into detail about city spending, and give citizens an opportunity to contribute to that discussion. All of this is a huge red herring from the actual discussion of whether Berkeley is doing what it can against a problem that it sees--and whether your offhanded comment was at all relevant. 

If you have alternate ways for Berkeley to try to address the problem of the availability of soda at prices which are deceptively low (low enough to promote soda consumption, which is harmful to health, over other beverage choices which wouldn't have the same adverse effects), then please present them.

Otherwise it's just tangential ranting. You can bring up as many arguments as you want to levy against *me*, but I only said that Berkeley cannot do what you thought should be done (again, for posterity, ""stop subsidizing HFCS""), and that they engaged in the alternative, which would seemingly make sense to you (removing subsidies has the effect of raising prices, which is essentially what the result of Berkeley's tax is). Now you want to debate about the whole issue and drag the kitchen sink into it because you've found that your original position wasn't substantive.

But whatever, we disagree on this. I don't feel like marching down the field with someone who keeps moving the goalposts (beginning your argument with 'something else should be done' and then continuing it with 'maybe nothing should be done, who knows').

You're the one who brought up HFCS subsidies, remember? I am talking about sugar, and specifically soda, as is Berkeley. 

Are you just arguing to argue? Are you going to go and downvote your original comment stating that ""What we should do is stop subsidizing HFCS""?

>a tax on corn-derived products that is specifically designed to combat the effects of corn subsidies

That's what measure D is. Corn subsidies obviously keep the price of junk food artificially low. The effect is over-consumption of such foods.

>analysis to determine what the effect of these subsidies is

[OK, here's the National Institutes of Health with that exact analysis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247588/)

>a tax of equal magnitude in the other direction

Then you're against measure D because it is much too low a tax?

""Regulate"" again implies something like the Bloomberg ban, which isn't what is proposed at all. Research shows even small additional taxes change behavior, but that doesn't mean it's an infringement of freedom. Of course the price of products change the choices you make but it isn't forcing a choice. No one is prevented.
This will be my last post in reply to this, because we both have better things to do.

> You're the one who brought up HFCS subsidies, remember? I am talking about sugar, and specifically soda, as is Berkeley.

Here's a quote about Measure D from an analysis released by the office of the city attorney (my italics):

> Added-calorie sweeteners would include any edible product that is perceived as sweet and adds calories, and is used to make sugar-sweetened beverages, including but not limited to sucrose, fructose, glucose, other sugars, and *high fructose corn syrup.*

So no, it's *not* just about sugar. It hardly even seems to be mainly about sugar, although proponents of the measure use that language colloquially. You keep pointing out that my original comment was about HFCS, as if they're unrelated. No, they're not unrelated, either in fact or as far as the city of Berkeley is concerned—it's conclusive. And if your argument is going to be that we should tax sugary things for the sake of their being sugary, again, why start with soda? You say this is a “rabbit hole” but haven’t produced a single argument why it’s not a reasonable worry to lodge against the measure. 

> You think ""we"" should do something, but since Berkeley cannot do that thing, they are doing as close to that as possible by raising the price of being in the soda business in Berkeley since their gripe is with soda specifically and their jurisdiction is Berkeley specifically.

Are you really so dense as to think that the tax won’t just be passed on to consumers, either by businesses themselves or by distributors? (Or, perhaps, to small businesses *qua* consumers of distributors’ products?) In case so, let me try to persuade you otherwise: the tax will be passed on to consumers. It won’t solve any problem. It will bring added-calorie sweeteners (in your lexicon, “sugar”) to the forefront of the local conversation for about a month or so, and then it will fall into the background and be forgotten. It will line the pockets of the city with a nice chunk of change in the meantime and will do *absolutely nothing* to change consumption habits.

> Now you're going down another rabbit hole about OTHER things that could alternatively be taxed, why things should or shouldn't be taxed, ad hominens about living in Berkeley, and questioning how Berkeley spends its money when there are council meetings literally every week that you can attend or read about which go into detail about city spending, and give citizens an opportunity to contribute to that discussion. All of this is a huge red herring from the actual discussion of whether Berkeley is doing what it can against a problem that it sees--and whether your offhanded comment was at all relevant.

I stand by the ad hominems about living in Berkeley; they hold inductively in my experience. Nonetheless they’re not part of the substance of my argument itself, and your dragging them in here to make it look as though they are is a cheap move on your part and further reveals how little you’ve addressed my substantive claims. And re: the Berkeley city council being open, give me a break! Do you think that “reading about” or even attending those council meetings will give citizens a genuine, leverage-able way to “contribute to the discussion” (that’s cute, but I want some hard rules about how that money is spent)? For anyone who knows anything about how Berkeley’s city government actually behaves, that's even more idealistic than my idea that we *can* do something about federal-level HFCS subsidizes.

> If you have alternate ways for Berkeley to try to address the problem of the availability of soda at prices which are deceptively low (low enough to promote soda consumption, which is harmful to health, over other beverage choices which wouldn't have the same adverse effects), then please present them.

Ah, yes, the lovely tu quoque. First of all, whether or not I or anyone else can provide a positive alternative to Measure D has, again, absolutely no bearing on the measure’s legitimacy. This whole time, you’ve taken for granted, and miraculously *continue* to take for granted, this idea that soda is this Big Bad Beverage which is “harmful to health” (it’s certainly not nutritious, but is it comparable to smoking?), and about which something should be done. The purpose of the studies I gestured towards—did you glance at that Wikipedia page?—was to point out that there’s strong empirical evidence that HFCS and added-calorie sweeteners in general are bogeymen: they aren’t healthy in and of themselves, of course, but they *haven’t been and are not currently shown to be* the sole or even a major cause of increased obesity. If you do support sin taxes, I figure you’re at least obliged to have good reasons and good science behind you; you seem to have neither, and you haven’t shown me otherwise. Indeed you’ve noted, laughably, that the City of Berkeley “notes that soda consumption is demonstrably a harm to public health.” So the proponents of a soda tax that would increase their funds are claiming that soda is bad and should be taxed? You don’t say! 

Beyond this you seem to think that Measure D (a sin tax for some vague purposes perhaps related to deterrence of consumption, but with absolutely no empirical evidence that taxation will result in any significant decreased consumption or increased health, and with absolutely no plan to dedicate that money to, e.g., health education) counts as “doing something” in the relevant respect. Granted (here’s an ad hominem, so hold onto your pants!) this seems to be the preferred Berkeleyan method of “doing something,” as far as the city is concerned (that and besides mandating that free weed be given to low income residents by dispensaries), I don’t see any reason to think, nor have you given me any reason to think, that this will do *anything* about the effects of soda consumption. 

> Otherwise it's just tangential ranting. You can bring up as many arguments as you want to levy against me, but I only said that Berkeley cannot do what you thought should be done (again, for posterity, ""stop subsidizing HFCS""), and that they engaged in the alternative, which would seemingly make sense to you (removing subsidies has the effect of raising prices, which is essentially what the result of Berkeley's tax is).

You ended up saying a lot more than that, but OK. And no, as I explained previously, a price raise from a tax is not the same as a possible or even likely price raise that results in the market when the subsidies are cut.

> Now you want to debate about the whole issue and drag the kitchen sink into it because you've found that your original position wasn't substantive. But whatever, we disagree on this. I don't feel like marching down the field with someone who keeps moving the goalposts (beginning your argument with 'something else should be done' and then continuing it with 'maybe nothing should be done, who knows').

This is the most curious thing of all. The original claim was both a proposal and a criticism of Measure D’s justification. Moreover, it was substantive: it involves the sense that instead of imposing a sin tax that will be passed onto consumers and then promptly ignored (though used for some nice extra cash by the city), it might be better for the city to a) invest in nutrition education, which I’d suspect would itself have more effect on reducing consumption than any tax, b) get involved in the state-level conversation about which subsidies get forked over to Big Ag (a *huge* entity in California, so we don't even need to bring federal into this), and c) get other city governments and counties on board with the campaign and to commit to increased nutrition and health education programs themselves.

My (empirically supported) claim that HFCS is not itself the sole cause of our society’s unhealthiness (one “sole cause” would be heightened calorie consumption in general, not merely HFCS consumption) is totally compatible with the claim that we should stop subsidizing HFCS. If anything, what looks completely bizarre to me is, again, your conviction that Measure D will be effective in anything but a technical way and that the logic behind supporting it is fairly open-and-shut. It’s not. I would at least expect you to acknowledge that complexity but you’ve clung steadfast to this syllogism:

* A) Soda is a/the main cause of ill health effects
* B) Taxing soda locally will help reduce ill health effects (either now or later)
* [Possible additional premise C) There’s nothing else we can do [B]]
* Conclusion: We should tax soda locally.

Here's a similarly silly syllogism (I like how that sounds!):

* A) Misbehavior by financial professionals has been a/the main cause of economic instability in the past few years
* B) Taxing financial professionals will help prevent or repair economic instability (either now or later)
* C) We can't do anything about this on the federal level
* D) We should do something about this on the local level [C]
* Conclusion: We should tax financial professionals (*qua* financial professionals) who live in Berkeley.

There are problems with each of the premises in both cases, but I’ve done everything I possibly can to point them out to you.

Edits: Typos.
>That's what measure D is. Corn subsidies obviously keep the price of junk food artificially low. The effect is over-consumption of such foods.

This measure has nothing to do with food. I don't know how you can say the purpose of this measure is to combat corn subsidies when 99% of products with corn material in them are not being targeted, and when products that *don't* have corn in them (soft drinks with actual sugar) *are* being targeted. 

Either the people who designed this measure are idiots, or the corn subsidy argument was tacked on later in order to attract voters. Either way, I'm not buying it.

>""Regulate"" again implies something like the Bloomberg ban, which isn't what is purposed at all. Research shows even small additional taxes change behavior

How on earth can you say that ""changing behavior"" is not a form of regulation? Are you serious?
Are you actually quoting the measure, which says:

> including but not limited to sucrose, fructose, glucose, other sugars, and high fructose corn syrup.

Then saying, in all seriousness:

>So no, it's not just about sugar.

All of those things are both literally and scientifically *sugars*. 

Sucrose: Table sugar.

Fructose: Fruit sugar.

Glucose: Simple sugar.

High fructose corn syrup: Glucose-fructose combination (see above how those are both sugars).

Other sugars: Self explanatory.

Your statement is provably false. And it's a great example of how this entire conversation has went. From you first bringing up HFCS and the fact that we should stop subsidizing it (to which I said, 'well, Berkeley can't do that, but they can impact prices through taxes...'), to then pointing to me and saying that my argument about HFCS is flawed because HFCS isn't bad after all...but I never made anything close to that claim in the first place (HFCS in the conversation was *your doing*). This whole thing is just silly.

You keep calling me dense, while you're simultaneously obfuscating the original point that you made and are making intellectually dishonest (or just uninformed) arguments to rope me into something I wasn't originally discussing. I mean, come on, you're actually being condescending about my use of the term *sugar* to describe...*sugar*? Really?

I'm sure you're just mad on the internet right now, but this is just a dumb argument where we're talking around each other.
>This measure has nothing to do with food.

That's just nitpicking. One could reasonably include junk beverages in what I referred to as ""junk food."" The vast majority of sweetened beverages are sweetened with corn syrup, so the subsidies are definitely relevant. That's not the only argument for this measure, but it certainly is a supporting argument.

> 99% of products with corn material in them are not being targeted

So you're saying the measure doesn't go far enough? I think it's prudent to take on one challenge at a time. First we reduce consumption of sweetened beverages, then we can take on other types of junk food.

>Either the people who designed this measure are idiots, or the corn subsidy argument was tacked on later in order to attract voters.

Neither. The corn syrup subsidy argument is just one of many. Take the time to read the links I sent you, and you'll find there are a lot of intelligent arguments for this tax from people who definitely aren't idiots.
Well ok if you consider every tax to be a ""regulation"" then it is a ""regulation.""
If you need to change the definition of regulation in order to justify passing a regulation...maybe it's time to reconsider.

Taxes - *especially* taxes aimed at changing behavior - are absolutely regulations. I don't know how any sane person could say otherwise.
Well just to me it's quite a bit different to ban an action than it is just to make it more expensive. What would you call the former?
Both are forms of regulation. 
Well I'll look forward to my income regulation refund this year."
"Robert Reich, always at it",https://i.redd.it/0ofz7u7ftnr51.jpg,2020-10-07 19:32:49,,"ToiletPaperUSA has some good ass content
y'all realize Robert Reich *is* the 1% right (or at least very close to it)? I don't know why we focus so much attention on the 1% when the vast majority of them are people like doctors, tech workers, small business owners, etc. the people you're thinking of are like the .1%
this guy just copy pastes the same boring shit about how some people are too rich why do people love him so much
How much tax are they responsible for?
No, the people you refer to are usually the upper end of the upper middle class meaning the 5% to 1% usually. The top 1% income lower boundary is like 430k, and that bracket makes 1.5 million per year on average, and while average isn't the best metric, it shows a difference between upper-middle class and rich.

The above is sort of irrelevant though, because this tweet is just stating a fact.. about unpaid taxes. The point of the tweet was the point out the unpaid taxes are mostly from the top 1%. This is actually really relevant; the Alstadsaeter-Johannesen-Zucman 2019 AEA research on the Norweigan tax data for instance showed quite staggeringly that the richer you were, the higher the probability that you had unreported taxes (top 0.01% the probability was over 44.5%). 

Zucman also showed in QJE 2013 that about 6% of the total international wealth is stored unreported tax havens. While that seems low, it's actually an astronomical number in terms of raw wealth.

I don't think the point is so much ""I hate these 1% people"" as it is pointing out there are problems with certain elements such as with taxes, that they get away with - and in this case, illegal elements (not reporting is illegal).
Because he's right?
the boundary for top 1% is 360k for an individual or $530k for a household. that's honestly a pretty realistic for a dual-income couple working in tech/medicine/law/finance. the vast majority of people earning in that range are professionals or small business owners making in the 400k-1million range. these people have the highest tax burdens in the US. 

as you yourself seem to realize, the *average* is heavily skewed by outliers at the top. check this: https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent

it's a bit outdated, but the average household income for people in the bottom half of the top 1% is only 500k. the average household income for people in the top 0.5 - 0.1% is just over a million. the top 0.1% - 0.01% makes ~4 million a year, which while clearly rich, still probably isn't the ridiculous opulence you're probably talking about. it's the top **0.01%** that makes $30 million a year.
360k for individual or 530k for household like you mention isn't indicative at all of the average doctor or tech worker like you mention. The median doctor makes about 180,000, the median tech worker makes like 100k, and the median small business owner makes like 75000. So the typical doctor, tech worker, small business owner *is not* in the top 1%. Perhaps your perception is distorted because we are in the bay area, and salaries tend to be higher because of cost of living, but this is just not true if you look at the entire US.

But again, this isn't what the tweet is talking about. It's about categorizing the group that is responsible for a certain % of unpaid taxes. If you look at the norweigan tax data graph of intensive vs extensive margins, you see the derivative only seems to be non-trivially above 0 when you reach the P99 group. That's why the 1% is grouped in here as it is. If you talk about other issues like amount of wealth like your whole comment was about, then yes, 0.1% or 0.01% makes sense to focus on.
My point is taxes. The tax loopholes that someone like trump can exploit are **absolutely** not available to someone making 500k. Wealthy professionals have the highest tax burden in the US. The real problem with our tax code isn't that the 1% pays too little, it's that the 0.1% pays too little.

(Also, while not all doctors/tech workers/etc. make that much, most of the people making that much are doctors/tech workers/etc.)
Sure, but tax avoidance isn't the same as tax evasion - I was talking about tax evasion, and presumably the tweet was too. You're still talking about the amount they pay, which is 100% SUPER relevant (yes, the top 0.1% paying more is more important than the top 1% paying more), but that's not what the tweet is about, it's about the proportion of unpaid taxes of our *current* tax code. 

Even if your last statement was true (which I don't think it is, doctors/tech workers/small business owners don't make up a majority fraction of the top 1%), what matters is the amount of the group that are in the 1%, which is quite a bit less than 50%."
Is Robert Reich still going to be teaching at Berkeley this year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vs6w0u/is_robert_reich_still_going_to_be_teaching_at/,2022-07-05 13:07:55,I really wanna take wealth and poverty in the spring but heard rumors that he has retired - anyone know anything?,"Robert Reich is a hypocrite that doesn’t practice what he preaches, lol. He blocked affordable housing next to his home by claiming it was a historic landmark. There are plenty of other amazing professors at Berkeley who aren’t blatant hypocrites.
He doesn’t have office hours when you are in his class🙃 I believe you can just audit his class or have access to the old audit materials if you want
He’s a hypocrite who doesn’t practice what he preaches.
You can tell a lot of what he says is propaganda because many of the things he regularly claims are nonsense that go against the basic principles of economics. And there’s no way he could be that dumb, so it’s all just pandering to his fanbase and target demographic without being honest about what he really thinks.
So just another NIMBY? Like all the rest of the neighborhood?
Wow ! That’s interesting to hear ! If true it’s really outrageous. Yeah everyone is generous with other people s wallet until it’s yours. How many young people Democrats become financially successful and oh Republicans ? Human nature is about survival and we can count those who make true sacrifices for others without their own interest in return. Even charities do something for their own good. Example religious sisters will choose Christian families over good families to serve their christianity. Etc… etc …
Shit, I love a lot of his stuff. That sucks. I still want to audit a lecture or two of his though, hypocrite or no lol
Anything to sell more books 🤷‍♂️
Most NIMBY’s just vote and stay quiet. Bob Reich has a whole online presence that portrays him as a champion of the poors. Turns out he prefers being a champion in a moated castle. How dishonest and distasteful could he be to pen a letter to keep the poors out of his “historic” multi-million dollar neighborhood.

I feel like from the outside, his tweets seem reasonable in the way that he addresses societal issues such as gun control and abortion etc but now that yall mention this...hmm

Robert Reich on Prop 22,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j139hi/robert_reich_on_prop_22/,2020-09-27 18:46:47,"How is he voting on this? 

This is unrelated, but to those interested, I will be voting yes.","He is voting no, and has endorsed the No on 22 coalition. His name is listed on the No on CA Prop 22 webpage. He says drivers should be employees, and he thinks the gig economy is bad for workers' rights.   


He actually does have a secondary opinion: if drivers aren't employees, then they should have access to income insurance. However, income insurance isn't on the table with Prop 22. A yes vote for Prop 22 doesn't create a safety net for gig-drivers.
Robert Reich has lost all credibility since he became a NIMBY. Who gives af what he says, get informed and make your own vote cheers
I'd expect him to vote no, as his entire brand is built around ""standing up for the man"" and ""big business bad,"" and I'm sure he cares more about his brand than the actual pros and cons of any particular policy.

I'll vote yes on it too. If you think Uber and the like can actually compensate their drivers like employees, you're kidding yourself. The services and the gig work they provide will just cease to exist.
Yeah gig economy companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Lyft loose billions per year so it’s not like they are rolling in cash right now.
Well he's always been one, we just didn't know until recently.
From reading his pieces about the gig economy, it seems like he genuinely believes that the gig economy isn't good for workers. You can disagree with his opinion, but there's nothing about him that suggests he's being dishonest in his opinion for branding purposes.
Well that’s just because they suck at financials. That isn’t a very good argument for voting Yes.
I don't know about you, but I take any economic argument a politician makes - even if I completely agree with it - with a huge grain of salt. Because they have made a career and a brand out of promoting a specific political ideology.

And that's what Robert Reich is. He has next to no formal economic qualifications, and his position as a professor is largely based on his experience as a secretary of labor and some other *political* positions with multiple Democrat administrations. I don't like the blurring of economic teachings and partisan politics. (And yes, it's hard to totally separate economics from economic policy, but there's a very noticeable difference in tone when you compare him to actual economists.)

I've also seen my fair share of absolutely idiotic tweets from Reich that are nothing more than political soundbites. There was a tweet of his about airline recovery that was highly misleading - there was a thread on here about it. He soon deleted it, but he questioned why *hedge* funds did not suffer the same losses as the rest of the market in March (hint: it's in the name). Either he's a complete idiot, or (more likely) he's a partisan figure pushing an agenda without trying to actually analyze the facts.

That's not to say I disagree with everything he says. But even if you completely align with his political views, you should be wary of his reasoning.
how would you know that without looking into their financials? you can be amazing at financials and still lose money...
They're doing the classic startup thing of spending money on expanding market share before trying to become profitable. Amazon did it, Facebook did it -- tons of startups do it.

The issue is that there are very few ways for them to make the service profitable without outright raising fees, and people don't value Uber rides enough to pay an extra 40-50% on top of what they already are.

Simply put, Uber is pulling a Snapchat, and like Snapchat it's not hard to see the writing on the wall of where this is going once their venture capital money runs out. It's easily observable by looking at their financial reports. The only question is whether or not we're gonna let it become ""too big to fail"" before that happens, and end up screwing over even MORE people when it fails after it becomes an even more entrenched cottage industry of drivers."

I made sure to read any news article. I think if it was over like 10 pages I'd lean towards skimming it. Honestly, it's an amazing course and I really hope you put some effort into it!
I read one reading the entire semester and got a flat A: that being said, you have to understand the main concepts about these things, and know how to write concisely and to-the-point ""memos"". These make up a big portion of your grade. The in class quizzes (if they still have them) aren't hard if you just somewhat know the basics around the topic: however, if your GSI gives quizzes about the specific readings, you might want to at least skim them.
Very if you want to pass.
Essays make up most of your grade, like you mentioned. You probably want to do the readings (at least skim the longer ones) if you want to be able to write informed and persuasive memos. Also, GSIs have quizzes in section (when I took it at least) that also counted towards your grade, which again required that you at least understood the key points and facts that the article was pushing. 

Definitely would not call it an 'easy' A class though - average grade is a B+. That being said other than the readings there isn't actually much work to do. 
I'm in the class too; literally 120+ pages LOL.

A larger user base.
It's the same old tired argument that has been made since the industrial revolution.
And why did it have a larger user base?
Seriously. If it were 100 years ago he'd be crying that the banning of child labor meant that families would go hungry because they wouldn't be able to rely on that income any more.
because texting is limited in foreign countries where whatsapp is most popular.
established earlier perhaps? just speculating...google voice should be king though
Yup! And those countries are also some of the countries where Facebook has the smallest presence, so if Facebook can tie their site and WhatsApp together (force people to use FB logins for WhatsApp or whatever) then they'll dramatically increase the Facebook userbase in markets they don't currently have a foothold in.

These people are endorsing Sanders for president; they aren't acting in their role as economists to green light his economic ideas, even though that may be implied in some cases. 
This article strikes me as extremely biased, to the point where I find the writer completely untrustworthy. It basically reads like a campaign press release.

For one thing, what defines a ""top"" economist? I don't see any of the Nobel Laureates that signed the 2003 letter (linked by u/thechungdynasty) on the list (though to be fair, some of them have since passed away). So, lets see how many of the signatories belong to a university with one of the [top ten economics programs in the country](http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings). Well, there's Reich himself and there a professor from Harvard Law School, but that's it. If these really were a sampling of the top economists in the world, I would expect to see at least a few more hits. I did notice that 7 of them are from UMass-Amherst whose economics program isn't even ranked (because its not in the top 75). My guess is that they accepted anybody with a phD or similar credential who was willing to sign it.

So how impressive is 170? Is that a large portion of economists or just a fringe minority? According to the BLS, there are about [13710 economics professors](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes251063.htm) in the US. Of course, many of the signatories are from foreign countries, and many aren't strictly economics professors (Reich himself is technically in Public Policy and the Harvard professor was in the Law School; there are also politicians and members of think tanks), but lets accept 13710 as a conservativly small estimate of the total number. Not every one of them would have been asked of course, but Reich is extremely well connected and he knows who to call and who will never be convinced. I'm sure he wanted to get as many signatories as possible to lend additional authority to the message. Lets say maybe half of the professors in the US (6855) are far along enough in their career to be useful for this sort of thing. 

So at best, all the number 170 demonstrates is that roughly 2.5% of economists (170/6855) agree with Sanders's policy positions. For perspective, that's less than the [percentage of scientists that are climate change deniers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveys_of_scientists'_views_on_climate_change#John_Cook_et_al..2C_2013).
For more reading, [here](https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wall-St-Letter-1.pdf) is the full list.


Also reminiscent of [this](http://www.epi.org/publication/econ_stmt_2003/).
not commenting on the article but im an alumni and wanna encourage everyone to register asap and vote in the primaries. your futures to some extent depend on it, we can either kick the shitty can down the road or address a lot of issues our society is facing by electing someone who gives a fuck. anyone who has had reich knows how much he cares.
Fuck what the hell is the old jew doing here... tired of him getting spammed everywhere else on reddit, now here? 
Exactly. I like Sanders as a person, but there's no chance he can deliver on his fiscal policy platform. [Bernie Sanders’s Proposals will cost the nation over $18 Trillion](http://www.wsj.com/articles/price-tag-of-bernie-sanders-proposals-18-trillion-1442271511). He plans to pay for this by raising $6.5 trillion in taxes, which would increase the size of the federal budget by 1/3rd. 

With a Republicans controlling houses advocating cutting taxes and small government, the chance of his plan succeeding is **zero**. A lot of his supporters don't seem to get this. At this rate he's going to be an even bigger let down than Obama.

Yep, I linked the 2003 letter as it's significantly more authoritative. FWIW, UMass-Amherst is sort of a niche school that includes some prominent neo-Marxian (not to be confused with Communist, proper noun) researchers, Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintes being chief among them (their work on education is fantastic, but that's beside the point). Good school to study dynastic transfers of wealth, not a great school to get into the private sector. They deeefinitely do not accept ""anybody with a phD or similar credential"" though. 

I wouldn't go so far as to say anyone who didn't sign is necessarily against Sanders' policies. Berkeley's J. Bradford Delong, for example, has been playing around with the differences between Hillary and Bernie and seems to be riding the fence at the moment; I'd imagine a lot of left-leaning economists are doing the same. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate, has [come out in support of Sanders](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/11/12/stiglitz_sanders_is_right_everybody_has) on values; his signature is curiously absent. That's just my push-back against the comparison to climate change denial; otherwise I agree that this signature list is fairly lacking in power.


Primaries for California are in June and by then the race should be more than decided, so this message is probably better served elsewhere? 
Note: I am not a Sanders supporter, but I'll say this. That article is very misleading. The problem is that when an outrageous claim is made on the front page of an influential paper and that claim gets disseminated through the media - CNN and Fox in particular - then a response, no matter how untrue or misleading the original claim was, is almost useless.  The article was so misleading that the economist whose study was cited felt compelled to [make a response to the article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gerald-friedman/the-wall-street-journal-k_b_8143062.html). The most obvious misleading claim is that it'll cost 18 trillion (15 trillion for healthcare and 3 trillion for the rest of his programs) - while this is true, it is how much it'll cost over 10 years, it is not an upfront cost (i.e. the yearly budget will not have an extra 18 trillion in costs, which should be pretty obvious to novice congressional watchers). If Laura Meckler is going to cite an author, she should probably not cherry pick and ignore his most important point, which is that there will 10 trillion in savings per decade compared to ACA. It is suggested that an additional 5 trillion (per decade) be spent, which will still result in 5 trillion in savings per decade. Here's his summary of the ten year projections:

>Because of the nearly $10 trillion in savings, it is possible to fund over $4.5 trillion in additional services while still reducing national health care spending by over $5 trillion. With these net savings, the additional $14.7 trillion in federal spending brings savings to the private sector (and state and local governments) of over $19.7 trillion.

Virtually everyone is insured and it's cheaper than ACA. Though you're right that it's politically impossible to pass this bill - even the Democrats won't approve of single-payer healthcare.
> They deeefinitely do not accept ""anybody with a phD or similar credential"" though.

Oh, I'm sure they don't. I was referring there to who Reich et al invited to sign the letter, not who UMass Amherst is willing to hire. I was writing in a hurry and was mostly trying to make the same points you are. You seem much more knowledgeable about the academic landscape than I am, so I'm glad to know that my back-of-the-envelope sniff tests were more or less accurate.

Also, my point wasn't that support for Sanders is *definitly* that weak. Just that a letter with 170 signatures doesn't prove otherwise. The US is so big, most people don't have an intuitive sense of how many fully-credentialed experts you can find to endorse anything that isn't obviously absurd.
Whoops.
Discussions of the federal budget are so stupid in general. Like: how much new healthcare is being proposed? Some for sure, people without access to primary care will get it now. So care should be taken to train new doctors, NPs, maybe build new clinics. But mostly single-payer is just an accounting move, with all the same services provided by the same people. The Federal government has unlimited money and is really only limited by the actual ability of the nation to provide what it wants to do.

> Virtually everyone is insured and it's cheaper than ACA. Though you're right that it's politically impossible to pass this bill - even the Democrats won't approve of single-payer healthcare.

Yea he had zero cosponsors on his 2013 single payer legislation. ;.;
tbh I'm pretty unthrilled with single payer as a big issue. Would rather we just make Obamacare better or bring back the public-option and introduce single-payer gradually. Imagine just letting people buy into Medicare, that would be game-changing in a non-threatening way. Single payer is just skipping steps.

UK created NHS after their nation was blown up, you can't just nationalize whole industries (though here it's only the insurance industry, not healthcare itself) without something like that.
Oh haha thanks for clearing that up, my bad. Totally agree with you on all points here."

Hi. I'm a recent graduate of Sacramento State University currently working on helping students in (middle school to high school) apply for college or seek some sort of higher education. 

Anyway, let me get to the point. 

Anyone ever meet Mr. Reich? I am a big, big, big fan. I wonder what he is like. Some day I hope to meet him or attend a lecture by him. I'm not just someone you could consider a fan, but also a pioneer interested in economics. Strangely, I've bounced around in my studies. See, my major (Bachelor) is in international relations. I was pursuing a degree in politics and world studies (i.e. UN mediators/NGO jobs..etc) but was dumbstruck by a International Relations course I took from Professor Cannon (highly recommend!). This was International Political Economics aka World economics and theory. Unfortunately, fellow comrades who pursue a degree, I was not able to pursue my masters degree. Tragedy struck my family, I ran into debt, I freaked out when, due to never having acquired how to deal with educational pressure and a social life, I suddenly shut down 3/4 into my Junior year. I couldn't learn anymore. Nothing would stick. I'd go over my notes all day and retain them for 15min, then forget. I couldn't wake up on time even if I slept over 10hrs a night! It was no surprise when my GPA dropped a bit below 3.0 and working 3 jobs did no help either. 

Anyway, I sucked it up, forced myself to settle down, started exercising (and eating more...that's why I am so fat now... yeah a fat hornet...heehee) and on my senior year took over 22-24 units. Yes, no joke! 

I passed all with a C+ or higher! Then, finally! Graduated!!! Bought myself a beautioful 2014 Scion FRS as a gift! (well, two years later...I was broke right after graduation...)

So, fellow bears, I hope to meet Mr. Reich sometime soon. I would ask him if I could attend a lecture, but have heard that he no longer is lecturing at UCB. Is this true? Have you ever met him? How is he? 

Hoping to also find a way to enroll into UCB within the next year...or attempt to. No great victory comes before a sacrifice. 


Strive on my fellow college comrades! ","He teaches Wealth and Poverty every spring, nothing during the Fall.
I contacted his assistant earlier this summer and she said that he's off on sabbatical this fall.
Just wondering... what does he do besides teach Wealth and Poverty?
I used to live right by Brewed Awakening, and I saw him sitting outside and drinking coffee/reading there more times than I can count. 
Thank you! I will make a note. Much love. 
thank you! 
He's currently the Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at GSPP.
I'm a big fan of his policies during Clinton. 
This is the only place I have seen him at. 
thanks! 
Also, although it's bad practice, if you really want to listen to his lectures you could just go.  Don't take up a seat, just sit in the aisles.  At the end of every lecture he has a Q&A, but most students leave beforehand.  
I meant what he does at Berkeley.
Thank you! I will next next semester!"

Good night Reich side
No, she is not intelligent enough to listen to. The choice of her and Milos just seems to be designed to provoke rather than to encourage any type of learning or understanding about right wing politics in America. Who is next David Duke?
Reich does this a lot actually. He takes his credentials as being former secretary of labor and uses it to run his mouth on a wide variety of social topics that he often doesn't really understand- just knows how to make it sound good to his audience.

Isn't it funny that when people accuse others of hate speech, they themselves are foaming at the mouths in anger and rage, and is often directed at a single ethnic group and gender....just in case you wanted an example of *true* irony.
Of course you want another white male to come next
> The choice of her and Milos just seems to be designed to provoke rather than to encourage...

Is that a bad thing? The radical left should be provoked relentlessly, the public needs to be constantly exposed to whats fomenting on college campuses. 
Complaining about how her free speech is being blocked but she charges $20,000 and puts forth a list of demands that Berkeley must abide by for her services.  One of her demands is that student protesters disrupting her speech be expelled. 
>When they list Maajid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali as anti-muslim extremists, it's time to realize they harm progressive causes far more than help it.

I don't have time to go through every single thing you linked, but  just picking out one example to respond to:

Hirsi Ali deserves respect for rising above major hurdles in her life, but the SPLC is accurate in describing her views as extremist and anti-muslim.  She literally said that the entire Muslim faith is a death cult and the main vision is to beat gay people and kill apostates.  That's not to say that there aren't extremist factions within the Muslim religion, but she depicts the entire Muslim religion as if it's a monolithic death cult.  If she said the same opinions about Christianity and ignored the many different sub groups with differing interpretations, she would similarly be labeled an anti-Christian extremist.  [Here are her own words on Islam:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali#Social_and_political_views)

>Just like Nazism started with Hitler's vision, the Islamic vision is a caliphate – a society ruled by Sharia law – in which women who have sex before marriage are stoned to death, homosexuals are beaten, and apostates like me are killed. Sharia law is as inimical to liberal democracy as Nazism.... Violence is inherent in Islam – it's a destructive, nihilistic cult of death. It legitimates murder.
so someone reports on one crazy person and suddenly everyone on the left side of the aisle thinks that way? so by david duke supports trump does it equate to all supporters being members of the KKK? if one person in our neighborhood is a pedophile does the neighborhood run a pedophile ring? talk about hasty generalization and guilt by association. both sides of the aisle are guilty of fallacies like these but dont expect such idiocy not to be called out here.
> Anybody who is not actively apologizing or expressing some type of white guilt,

Proof?

>anyone who steps out of line will be plastered as a bigot

Citation please?

>and is often directed at a single ethnic group and gender....just in case you wanted an example of true irony.

You haven't provided any examples to back up your claims, so if you have any proof, I'm willing to listen and not write you off before listening to the merits of your argument.  
Yes, the University should not be used as a forum for hateful idiots like Milos and Coulter. 
I'm still not particularly seeing the irony here. 

I think the fact that she particularly said protestors **disrupting** her speech should be expelled is worth notice - means that they can still protest her speech peacefully, but will get punished for trying to go any further with sabotage or violence like the other speeches had happen during them before.

Its one thing to protest fairly peacefully, and another to try and start a riot by harassing speech-goers, sabotaging the speech, or causing property damage under the guise of protesting.
Congrats bro, that's a quote from 2007 that you found at the wiki. This is what ""Berkeley sjs"" consider research.

Regardless of how harsh those words are that criticize Islam (a religion), they hard qualify for listing her ""an anti Muslim [people]"" extremist.

What she actually writes is that Islam needs reform, but of course, the splc skipped over years of her writings about that, didn't they?

She's complaining about freedom while being supported by a foundation that promotes ideas which limit other people's freedom.  
Disrupting someone else's speech is still speech.  To demand that anyone who even attempts to knock you off your soapbox should be expelled isn't the words of someone who is interested in free speech.  If you believe that stifling someone's speech is wrong, no matter how repugnant the speech then you should be ready to accept that repugnant speech will lead to interruptions and that those interrupts are also an act of speech that should be protected.

Courts have held that the right to free speech extends beyond literal speech and have also ruled that there needs to be an interest in public safety to halt free speech (ie no shouting fire in a theater).  Expelling students for disruptive protests does not meet that bar.
>Regardless of how harsh those words are that criticize Islam (a religion), they hard qualify for listing her ""an anti Muslim [people]"" extremist.

The SPLC doesn't claim she is anti Muslim [people].  Rather than accuse you of being dishonest, I'll just give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you didn't do your research and are quite the hypocrite, evidently.  Quoting directly from the article on anti-Muslim extremism implicating Hirsi Ali:

>Fueling this hatred has been the propaganda, the vast majority of it completely baseless, produced and popularized by a network of anti-Muslim extremists and their enablers. These men and women have shamelessly exploited terrorist attacks and the Syrian refugee crisis, among other things, to **demonize the entire Islamic faith.**

In addition to calling for Islamic reform, she demonizes the entire Islamic faith, and in a very extreme way, labeling the entire faith as a death cult that wants to cause destruction and murder apostates.   And these words come directly from her own mouth, and 2007 does not mean her words don't count.  That's a desperate attempt at deflection by you and nothing more.

I am not a student and you know nothing about the row I've had to hoe. 
i think thats a pretty sweeping assumption. that highly depends on the environment. tech culture like sillicon valley, research institutions whether its medical or scientific, even wall street do have safe spaces. it highly depends on the environment and surrounding culture.

the right will say the left shoves their ideals down their throats. but what you're doing is assuming the right culture is prevailing in left areas and demographics as well. 
You go girl
I am genuinely curious where you learned this.

It would seem to be against everything ""we"" as a society have learned about free speech since the days of Voltaire and John Stuart Mill.

So I am genuinely very curious as to where folks like you are learning that disruption of speech is a free speech activity.
> Disrupting someone else's speech is still speech

It's absolutely not. That's called the Heckler's Veto and it's not protected under the First Amendment, mainly because if it were so everybody could just shut down everybody else.

Furthermore, these ""protests"" are not protests, they're riots where people get hurt. If students get involved in them they *should* get expelled, it goes against the student code and values of this school.

Let me explain in terms you might understand. If I set you on fire to shut you up, that would be a felony, and no matter how much I cite the first amendment, they'd still slap my carcass in prison. 
>> Regardless of how harsh those words are that criticize Islam (a religion), they hard qualify for listing her ""an anti Muslim [people]"" extremist.

> The SPLC doesn't claim she is anti Muslim [people]

Lulz, THAT WAS YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPLC'S CHARACTERIZATION.

> The Young America's Foundation, a group that offers a list of speakers active in **anti-muslim and anti-black movements according to the Southern Poverty Law Center**.

In the meantime, I repeat, if the SPLC and you, glosses over 10 years of her statements then you both got nothing.

""free speech activity""

That's rather arrogant of you to determine what constitutes fee speech and what is actually not free speech.  If you believe that disruptive speech does not deserve to be protected then you accept that there is in fact a limit to the freedom of speech.

You guys complain about the antifa deeming everything you say to be nazi propaganda, but in return, when people provide real and legitimate pushback on your ideas you declare your opponents to be enemies of free speech.
>Lulz, THAT WAS YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPLC'S CHARACTERIZATION.

You're the one falsely assuming I referred to Muslim people rather than followers of the faith.  You don't get to put words in people's mouths and then accuse them of your own assumptions.

My exact words, **in context**:

>the SPLC is accurate in describing her views as extremist and anti-muslim. **She literally said that the entire Muslim faith** is a death cult and the main vision is to beat gay people and kill apostates.

You're making a false assumption and I doubt you'll admit it.
Go away, you are a bore.
there are many instances that im not in favor of safe spaces. and before you call me a libtard im actually... well these days i would be considered a conservative.

safe spaces actually make HR a lot easier. you can read up how corporations use it to increase efficiency in the work place. its a strategy to reduce internal issues that can cripple the work place. from your perspective i doubt you work white collar in fortune 500/public listed corporations. you are in for a very rude awakening.
> ""free speech activity""
> That's rather arrogant of you to determine what constitutes fee speech and what is actually not free speech.

That would be me backed up by Robert Reich, most 1A lawyers and many free speech philosophers, including the Supreme Court.

> If you believe that disruptive speech does not deserve to be protected then you accept that there is in fact a limit to the freedom of speech.

Your rights end where my nose begins has always been one limiting factor, but I understand that fascists like you believe in assaulting people like Felarca did, glassing people like Moldylocks was caught doing, bike locking them like one professor stands accused, and throwing m80s at people in order to free speech disrupt speech you dislike.

Again, my question is, who taught you these things that are so anti-democratic, and violations of human rights?
You're going around in your own circles. And filth.

Taking quotes from the splc that she said in 2007 without ever once mentioning what she has said in the interim about how to reform islam that contradicts that is bullshit.

She is harshly critical of the faith. She even says that in that quote.  She has also stated that it can be, and needs to be reformed, and how to do that.

Her words are critical of **IDEAS**, and they do not mark her as you claim as an anti-muslim extremist which clearly has the connotation of creating hate and inciting violence against **PEOPLE**.

Team SocJus such as yourself, get offended when people criticize their favorite ideas. The splc is a fraud and likes to take your money when you get offended by people criticizing your favorite ideas.
Wait you are trying to tell me that you think that HR policies are the Same as campus Safe Spaces!?!? Is that what you are saying!?
> but I understand that fascists like you 

Suppression of speech isn't something that's exclusive to facist regimes, but hey look you're cool and can throw ad hominems around.

My point stands that whenever you're met with resistance to your beliefs you lash out a declare your opponents to be enemies of free speech.

I was pretty pissed off at the antifa following Milo, but given that you guys decided to meet their violence with violence I don't care anymore as long as long as you keep your brawls away from my apartment.  There are no saints in this and people need to realize that this is a contest in which everyone loses.
> Taking quotes from the splc that she said in 2007 without ever once mentioning what she has said in the interim about how to reform islam that contradicts that is bullshit.

If she retracted or walked back from her statement since 2007, feel free to quote it.  If you can't, then she should be held accountable for the ideas she espouses, like everybody else.  

None of your responses negate the fact that she accused the entire Muslim faith of being a death cult, and if she said the same of Christianity, she would rightly fall under the category of being anti-Christian.  To claim an entire religion desires destruction and is a death cult is clearly an extreme characterization, whether or not you care to admit it.

> > but I understand that fascists like you

> Suppression of speech isn't something that's exclusive to facist regimes, but hey look you're cool and can throw ad hominems around.

You've explicitly condoned violent disruptions of speech as free speech. It is not ad hominem to label that as fascist.

But also, long before I called you a fascist, you had already been labeling me. So you dislike my labeling you as a fascist, but it's okay for you to label me. Get out of here, chucklenuts.

In the meantime, I have asked you several times now, and you have been impolite, rude, and an asshole, in not answering my question:

Who taught you that disruption of speech is part of free speech?

So answer the question, or shut up.
Hey spez, I found the infinite loop!
Yeah. I didn't think you had any clue what you were talking about. Explain to me what in your mind you think a corporate Safe Space looks like. Also just to be clear there are probably a few places in Silicone Valley that have them but they are practically non existent in the real world. It's obvious you never had a real job in your life and honestly I doubt you ever will.
If you believe that violence is the only way to disrupt shit then you are sorely mistaken.  Furthermore I invite you to contemplate on the true meaning of facism - a right wing movement centered around a strong nationalist identity.

Like I said earlier, you don't truly care about free speech.
Still waiting for any supporting evidence whatsoever to any of your claims.  Obviously you don't have any.  Great research skills!   
You're shifting the goalposts and shitting your bed.

No one is worried about non violent protesting and non violent disruptions of shit.

Everyone is worried about your team, team antifa and their m80s, beatings, bottlings, bike lockings, assaults, and vandalism.

If antifa came to town and carried signs and allowed speakers to speak we wouldn't be hearing Dirks say that UC Berkeley has no protectable free speech venue for Coulter.

Anyway we're done, since I have answered your questions and you still refuse to answer mine. I accept your refusal in the face of my constant reminders as your concession that you got nothing and you know antifa AND BAMN is a fascist terroristic group that has no rational defense in democratic society."

And once again Prof Robert Reich is back with his Wealth and Poverty class.  Those of you who like Prof Paulin will note he’s teaching both sections of Math 54 in the Spring, a bit unusual.","Great summary!
The one semester I decide to take MATH 54, Paulin teaches it the semester right after. Kinda wish I waited lol.
BTW, unless you’re a senior or a junior with a really good enrollment time, you can fuggedaboutit wrt taking the Wealth and Poverty class.
Paulin is a fantastic lecturer, anyone who wants to take math 54 in the future should take it in spring imo.
Sorry I don't know too much about it. What's the hype about Astronomy C10?
There is a class that I really want to take, but is not listed in the catalog. If I remember correctly, there was a comment that more classes will be added to the catalog once things are finalized. Am I correct?
Econc142 and seems like a new class called Econ143 is being offered. Wonder if I can just make half of my required econ electives metrics classes lol

Yes! And these posts, noting how great this post is, are great.
I'm with Nadler, which to be fair hasn't been too bad of a class either. Definitely enjoying it more than MATH 53 at least

I've been to protests with him — he shows up and talks about labor violations.""",http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Robert-Reich-s-name-is-floated-as-next-UC-9694559.php,2016-10-04 20:13:23,,"The mistake many academics make is to assume that because they are at the top of their field (= 'smart'), they must be great at everything, including administration. Berkeley has a great track record of proving this to be a false assumption. Most faculty members have no concept of how to run much of anything, unless it's a research group where they have total control over everyone. They have no training in admin of complex systems, no skills, yet they think they can walk in and run the show. I'd love to see one of them do well as  Chancellor, but it would take some thought and, perhaps, humility to accept that they need help to do the job properly. Not likely to happen in my estimation.
Chancellors are not allowed to speak their minds because they have to represent the University.  On this basis alone, Reich will never take the post.
Be prepared to change your opinion of him if this does go through.
this is like saying donald trump is a great speaker and tax evader so let's make him president. the two are not related.
Neoliberal Janet Napolitano would never approve of it. And he probably wouldn't want the job either, it's a career killer and a death trap.
Honestly, even if a popular, respected guy like Reich becomes chancellor, there would still be people bitching about how evil and corrupt he is because *FIGHT THE POWER* or whatever
We need someone who will make Berkeley a more elite institution. 
Hell no. Reich would be terrible.
YES PLEASE

Edit: This man is incredibly devoted to public service. He's been here long enough to understand the ins and outs of Berkeley. He knows what being a professor here entails, and has performed well with administrative positions. He's protested with students and knows what they want out of their university. Can't think of any other person more qualified to lead our university and bring us back on track. I suggested Tsu-Jae King Liu, but she's already Provost for Academic Planning.
He probably gonna get a job in Hillarys cabinet
Reich is not a career academic, and in as much as he has been recently he teaches public policy. 
Yeah, the guy was the secretary of labor like would he really wanna be the chancellor of a university?
I'm sorry but what does ""protesting with students"" have to do with being a good Chancellor? How about ""is great at raising money"" or ""great at recruiting Nobel Prize winners to teach here"" or ""making sure the quality of the institution stays high?"" Enough of these ridiculous and inconsequential 'qualifications'.
Maybe having just a tiny bit of administrative experience might be good.
Janet Napolitano was Secretary of Homeland Security and now is UC president.
Sfgate outlines, for the sake of generalization, two paths people at uc Berkeley want. One in which the university focuses on increasing the quality of the institution, professors and its research through obtaining more funding. One in which the university focuses on providing an accessible education to the masses while trying not to degradate the quality of the institution. You are right that reich would not be a great fit for the first path. But as a long-time advocate on labor rights and reseacher on wealth inequality as well as an adminstrative experience, he would be great fit for the latter.
At least to your first point- Napolitano was hired for a position that mostly hinges around fund-raising, and she was a former cabinet member herself. I think Reich is plenty well-connected and qualified to raise money for the university— he just might have a harder time offering corporate donors what they'd want in exchange for that money.
I would prefer a Chancellor who understands my problems to the point that she or he can protest with me.
Like running the Labor Department...? 
What does making education here even more accessible even mean? We're already educating ~35,000 students here at any given time, they keep trying to increase that number and the campus is bursting at the seems. We already have UC Berkeley extension campuses, there's plenty of other UCs and CSUs. Are you just saying we should offer more financial aid/student housing? Cause if so that's basically an issue of raising money. 
And then have their hands tied by bureaucracy and consequently be criticized for doing too little to appease everyone? Chancellors a shit job and I'm sure Reich's time as the Sec of Labor was enough getting shit on for many life times. 
Your problems are my problems? Or are my problems your problems? Or...wait a second....

Trump did it today, blaming the University of California at Berkeley for denying Milo Yiannopoulos (of Breitbart News) the right to free speech – when in fact the University opened its biggest and most accessible auditorium to that hatemonger. And there’s growing evidence that the agitators who caused police to cancel the speech may have been connected to right-wing groups -- such as those spawned by Yiannopoulos himself – that intended to create an incident that would give Trump and his surrogates a justification to blame the University, the media, the left, and their other targets.
So Trump threatens to withhold federal funds from Berkeley (as if he had the despotic power to do this).
Trump “counselor” Kellyanne Conway blames “the media” – her favorite target. “What’s going on out there is what’s going on all across the country,” Conway, said. The protesters “have got media cameras following them; they give interviews.”
And Yiannopoulos blames his target -- “the Left.” “One thing I do know for sure: The Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down,” he wrote.
It’s all right out of the despot’s playbook. Know your history.
What do you think?.""","This is exactly what happened in Berkeley last night. The campus itself is no hotbed of loony lefties - it's depressingly conservative these days. The trouble was caused by outsiders.
I haven't seen any evidence that right-wingers were connected to the violence in any way. Obviously the UC administration isn't to blame, but this sort of violence and unrest often erupts at leftist events and it's pretty disingenuous of Reich to suggest otherwise. 
You know who I blame? The Berkeley administration that thought their students weren't worth protecting because of their political views. UCPD stood by and did nothing while people were beaten almost to death with shovels. People were openly pepper sprayed on camera. There was only one arrest and a bunch of bloody students. You can see how much the safety of these students means to the Berkeley administration.

Funny, I remember Robert Reich *not* being bug-fuck crazy. What happened to him?
The real question is, what's the fucking strategy? I feel like the right has their shit sorted out. They ain't stupid. And the left is so fragmented and full of infighting. Shit. If Hitler was actually rising to power right now, none of these protests would be doing anything to stop him. Rather, they'd be adding fuel to the flames.

I agree. Berkeley is definitely socially liberal, but in every other way they're moderate or conservative.

The tankies, again.
I've seen no evidence either way, and would love to see a legitimate source on who the agitators were. But the automatic assumption that the agitators were leftists makes zero sense to me. The violence was obviously planned. The outcome benefits Yiannopoulos and his cronies more than anyone else. Usually, you start with motive and opportunity.....

Quite the intelligent, nuanced view you have of the situation. I can't imagine why anyone would associate you with extremism, unwarranted aggression, or childishness.
I have no official sources, but I have a close friend who is part of AntiFa (leftist anti-fascist group that often includes anarchists and communists). Granted, he's not a member of the bay area chapter, but since my friend is from SF he does have some connections here. According to him, it looks to be a genuine leftist demonstration, not a right-wing straw-man operation. I don't think the right really needs to do anything like that anyway; the left (the real left, not the democrats) is agitated enough to do things like this, no conspiracy necessary.
Yes of course it benefits him, but you're forgetting the monumental idiocy of the anarchist left, who don't get that trying to silence dissent causes people to want to dissent even more.

There will be no end to inequality if he and others such as Sanders think that we can inhibit inequality while maintaining a capitalist economic system.
I thought you meant Keynesian but I guess there's an economist named Kautsky. There's seems to be two main policies which we are told work: Keynesian policies and supply side policies. The former leads to high inflation rates and the latter leads to huge inequalities. None of them are stable in the long run. What to do?
Kautsky was a Marxist social theorist. What I mean is that socialist reform will not make society less unequal.

Keynesian economics works if productivity increases faster than consumption, but that just is not happening in the USA and in many developed countries. 
I thought the problem was that productivity was increasing way faster  than wages (statistics show this), and since higher wages lead to more consumption, the fact that wages were not increasing as much as they could have led to lower consumption than could have been possible.

BTW it seems that Sanders wants a Keynesian style of economics (Keynesianism is not socialism as far as I can tell) - he's mentioned that he's not much different than Eisenhower economically. 
You are right, this is essentially Thomas Picketty's conclusion in ""capital in the 21st century"". The rate of economic growth is much faster than the rise of wages.
Is it? I wouldn't know, I haven't read it (side note: isn't it a running joke now that everyone says it's a thoughtful and extraordinary read but no one's read it?). I'm just going off what I've heard from progressive and conservative economic explanations. Progressives (and many others) argue that wages have been stagnant even though productivity has been increasing. Conservatives argue that when workers get paid too much it will lead to high inflation (because then demand will grow and with increased demand the companies will charge more for goods which will then make employers pay more for their labor because they need to sell their products and so on until prices are sky high). Both argue for capitalist positions but both will lead to one problem or the other (neither will say that none of these solutions will work in the long run). "

Just because Reich is linked with Clinton doesn't make him progressive.  The real truth, which kmbabua you''re too ignorant to figure out, is that Clinton and the current Democratic party aren't that progressive either.
Do you even go to this school? This is the most transparent astroturfing I've seen
What the fuck are you talking about? Robert Reich had no part in the financial crisis of 2008, he had no firm to bail out, he supports breaking up big banks, and he was a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders before he lost the primaries. Where did you even come up with these ideas?

The statements ""there were no students committing violence"" and ""most students were not committing violence"" and ""most of the violence was not commuted by students"" all have different meanings and can all be simultaneously true or false or any combination.

Any time I see this argument, I just point them to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5roofj/lets_make_this_clear_if_a_protest_becomes_violent/) I made. It doesn't matter if you aren't actually rioting. Standing around at a riot is literally helping the rioters and letting them blend in to avoid police.

Sounds completely reasonable to me, the requirements are basically the same as for the regular naturalization process. Being ""illegal"" is not really the fault of the many children who were brought here illegally/born to parents who came here through illegal means. This country is all they have known their entire life; naturalizing them means they will actually be able to pay taxes and be productive members of society. They're already here anyways, the country only benefits from this imo

Berkeley Rents Fall Amid Construction Boom,https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/berkeley-rents-fall-amid-construction,2023-09-26 11:03:25,,"Truly shocking that supply reduces price
Building more market rate housing brings rents down? I was told this wouldn't happen!!
Interesting article. One unaddressed question is how much of the new ""luxury"" housing coming on the market is actually being occupied?  From the visual evidence--all those banners that say ""Renting NOW!""--on both new and slightly older buildings--there are at least some vacancies.
Robert Reich is shaking in his boots.
The same thing has been happening across the Bay Area this year. Thanks to high mortgage rates, people would rather rent out their properties than sell. Also tech layoffs and the rise of collecting severance remotely helps.
Do the authors make a comparison to comparable local cities where they are not building as much housing? To support the hypothesis, there should be data from the same time period showing less decline elsewhere. Maybe I missed that.
My apartment is on the registry, but I already signed my lease so my rent probs won't change ;-;
Good
Wow amazing how that works. Building housing means lower housing cost. Wow who would have thought. Seems unlikely but I guess it works! Wow
Where?
Build, baby, build!
The problem is too many people. Landlords are happy to build more podscrapers so that another 100,000 can live here.
Or is it the crime in the area, and fairly regular shootings?
Hey places to live so we don’t live on the street!
good
Does the article show those lowered rents and their comparisons?
What!?!? The NIMBYs in sf say building more housing would just raise rents all the more . . . Who knew supply affects demand
Always interesting when city governments actively oppose lessons from introductory economics. It evokes medieval legal enforcement of geo centrism. 

Ironic that Cal has one of the best econ departments in the world, they should try sitting in on a lecture or three.
I learned that in Econ 😎
It’s a novel concept for the city to conceptualize.
I think this is the naive way to look at it. Part of the argument against building new housing, as mentioned in the article, is that it's ""luxury"" (which I don't think is well-defined, but falls somewhere under ""uses modern construction techniques and appliances""). In that argument, ""luxury"" housing doesn't make other housing cheaper, because it's a different market.

This article refutes that argument - increasing ""luxury"" housing also decreases the cost of older, less ""luxurious"" types of housing.

I know that the article cites plenty of research, including a sentence where each word is a separate research article outlining the same point, but it's incredible to have this type of research locally. It makes arguments about ""that won't work here"" much more difficult to sell.
We should always hope for a small number of vacancies or else it would be impossible to move without serious logistical issues.

If half the units were empty, I don't suppose the owner would be pulling out their hair wondering what to do...they would lower the price.
The banners are there year round and all the time. Nearly all new builds have vacant units hence you'll see offers for ""one month free, free parking, etc.""
I hunted around for a place that checked all my boxes, and for a reasonable rate.  I couldn't understand why someone would pay twice as much for a unit in a massive building with no yard, etc.  Doesn't make sense to me.
lol, no. The landlords oppose new housing like it’s the plague. They know that new housing lowers their rents. Just look at rental empire heir Dean Preston in SF. He’ll use literally any reason under the sun to oppose new housing that undermines his inherited millions!
Not opposing the new construction, more is needed to keep rent lower, but c’mon man you can easily see why property owners would oppose new residential construction to keep their property values higher. 

Once again, I’m not in agreement with opposition to new housing, but acting like people oppose new construction because they don’t understand basic supply and demand is a ridiculous claim. Masking it in forcefully elevated language doesn’t make you look wiser and doesn’t contribute to the conversations about promoting sustainable urban growth, safety and quality with increased population density, and the balance between homeowners’ property values and the neighboring rental prices.
Isn't the counter argument just wrong then and the naive argument correct, actually making more luxury housing which you think wouldn't impact normal housing does?
*""If half the units were empty, I don't suppose the owner would be pulling out their hair wondering what to do...they would lower the price.""*

Maybe. Actually, I do know several people who own rentals in the Berkeley area, from apartment buildings to ADU / in-law units, to rooms with private bath in shared home.

A number of them have been complaining recently they can't find new tenants.

But most of them, to date, stubbornly stick to their original asking rent, or just bring it down a tiny bit. Say, $1,350 instead of $1,400 / month. 

Based on these sorts of conversations--which I concede are only anecdotal--it's not uncommon for owners to leave units vacant for some time until someone comes along who is willing to pay their original asking price. 

Part of the reason for this in Berkeley is, most likely, vacancy decontrol.  If that person with a $1,400 unit dropped the rent to $1,000---their new tenant would then fall under rent control, and might stay much longer than they had originally intended because of the significantly lesser rent.
In Berkeley, at least, the new buildings are aimed at one of three types of markets.

(1) UC students, crammed in as much as possible. 

(2) Tech workers, priced out of San Francisco, and eager for a place to live nearby, and working all the time.

(3) ""Empty nesters"", or others with lots of disposable income looking for a place to live where they don't have to do any upkeep and they are close to restaurants, entertainment, etc.

My own observations are that:

(1) is a very large local market, but has its limits. A lot of students just can't afford to live in the new ""luxury"" buildings, even when they double or triple up in a bedroom;

(2) is a market that has atrophied, temporarily at least. The developer bet Pre-Pandemic was that the tech industry would continue to rapidly grow in San Francisco, San Francisco rents would be sky-high, and a lot of well-paid single workers would decide to cross the Bay and live in Berkeley and be willing to pay high prices (but less than San Francisco prices) for new apartments. That doesn't seem to be fully panning out;

(3) I know a very few of these people, but I have yet to see it become a big share of the market that justifies building primarily for them. The economic calculus used to be that someone would sell their valuable house in the Berkeley Hills, make a fortune on the sale, invest it, use part of the investment income to live on, and part to pay rent for a less expensive, but still spacious, new apartment in Downtown Berkeley or nearby. But if you gross a million dollars on the sale of your house, now, renting a two bedroom apartment in Berkeley might still cost you $50,000 a year, which is equal to income from a 5% annual return on a safe million dollar investment, and leaves nothing for living expenses beyond rent. So it probably makes more sense to move to a less expensive community with cheaper rent, but reasonably comparable amenities.
That's a limited perspective. Of course, ""first movers"" into a market will oppose competition from other suppliers, support regulatory capture, etc. 

Good on Dean Preston. Sure he's greedy, but I'd rather have property values in the millions than a Bay Area version of Kowloon Walled city.
I have seen and heard lots of people claim that new construction raises rents.  There really are a lot of people who don't understand basic supply and demand.  I think we do need forceful language (and data like in the linked post) to drive it home.
>keep their property values higher.

Its not really about this as far as I can tell, there are other things people want besides money, assurance that their neighborhood won't become dangerous, quiet (ie no construction no more people), make it easy for people to come visit them (lots of street parking) etc.

If anything upzoning your property is the best way to increase value long term (think about how much a house costs in SF vs berkeley)
The person you replied to isn't questioning why random property owners oppose new construction, s/he is questioning why city governments oppose it
There are plenty of have nots who think building more housing increases rents. (Demand effect).

Here's a Financial Times graphic citing a research paper ""Folk Economics and the Persistence of Political Opposition to new Housing.""

https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A08b5b213-856d-4637-bbde-37f1b5201290?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1
Yes. Easy to see from introductory econ principles because housing of different quality are substitute goods. Increasing supply of ""luxury"" housing relieves demand on ""not-luxury"" housing and reduces its price.
I think your anecdote is consistent with the article. It doesn't seem like rent is falling off a cliff for the older units, but rather trickling downward. If you're uncertain exactly what price people are willing to pay, you slowly lower your price until you find someone that does.

It also doesn't surprise me that units stay vacant for some time - as others have posted, that's somewhat normal. However, I don't know enough to say whether the vacancy duration is abnormally long, or if prices are abnormally sticky. Prices are, however, going in the expected direction with the increased housing supply.

I'm not too familiar with the rent control in town - can you link me to something so I can read more?
Part of this is also the sunk cost some people have in ADUs - the city loosened restrictions on their construction to encourage as many as possible to build them and people likely made financial decisions on their viability based on current rent prices and anticipated rent to only go up. Not to say we should feel bad for landowners but it does make sense they would want the rent to cover the financed debt they likely took on for Adu construction.
Literally no one is proposing Kowloon Walled city levels of density. It is not remotely legal, and would simply not be funded by the real estate oriented banks anyway.

All we're sayin is that 4-7 stories, Paris-level density is extremely livable, a lot prettier than single family homes, 100x more environmentally sustainable, conducive to more transit, a looooooot cheaper to build and buy, etc., etc.
Those are all really good counterpoints to housing expansion. I kinda just threw that under an umbrella saying “safety and quality with increased population density.” Growth is pretty much inevitable though, so the goal is how to find opportunities for development that do not create these concerns. Too many people look at this a binary choice between growth or no growth, and the resulting discussion becomes so polarized, preventing effective compromises.
Who elects city governments?
>It doesn't seem like rent is falling off a cliff for the older units, but rather trickling downward. 

Yes, but considering that rent had been continuously rising in the years prior, a small decrease in price is a pretty significant trend reversal.
The ADU owners I know (and there are several in my neighborhood) often leave their units empty, or use them as periodic guest quarters for family and friends--sort of informal, unadvertised, AirBNB's, often for free.  

They are VERY picky about leasing a building in their backyard or their finished basement to a long term tenant, and their choice is quite often to leave it vacant if they don't find the perfect person who can also pay the rent they want. 

I don't know how they do this financially, but it is a definite pattern.  The City's assumption that *""build ADUs, and they'll all become active, long-term, rental units""* may be flawed in that respect.
Of course nobody is proposing that level of density, however if we move towards a free market in housing, and there exists bottomless demand to live in this area, we'll move in that direction.

I too think a Paris-like development would be nice. But if you seriously believe that with the current 4 over 1 paradigm and the burden of inefficient public transportation will make for affordability and beauty, I think that's out of the picture. Maybe if we get another Haussmann we can start dreaming, but for now I side with the NIMBYs.
The registered voters in Berkeley who bother to turn up for a local election. This group would include property owners but also university students and other renters. Probably the property owners significantly outnumber the renters.

But let's not act like city governments (or governments in general) actually best represent the interests of their constituents. Obviously ideally they would, but in practice they do not.
Again, literally no one is proposing even that we ""we move towards a free market in housing"". All we're saying is that making everything illegal except  a cookie-cutter single family home with a huge water-hungry yard is insane. It's not a sustainable model on any level. It's not economically sustainable, it's not possible with the space constraints that cities have, it's an environmental disaster and anti-public transit.

The ""burden of inefficient public transportation"" literally comes from the lack of 4-7 story development near transit stations. Single family homes are incompatible with any mode of ""public"" transit except a taxi. Modern 5-over-1s are hated by a slice of the population but loved by another. But no matter how they look they are still 100x more sustainable than McMansions. If you don't like 5-over-1s then just don't live in them. Literally no one is forcing you.

Plus, if you absolutely wanted to change how they look, it is infinitely easier to pass a construction code that mandates how buildings look and what materials they can use rather that to try to make single family homes work. We literally already have exactly that system in place. That's how we limit all construction to only single family housing in the first place!

There is a whole international traditionalist architecture movement that specifically advocates for more ""familiar""/old-timey architectural styles regardless of urban form (height, bulk, proximity, etc.) Feel free to advocate for your city to adopt that type of traditionalist construction code that mandates that all new 4-7 story buildings need to look like those in Paris. That's completely besides the point if we're talking about adding enough density to support enough transit, schools, and grocery stores without the need to drive everywhere!"

I've seen Hillary stickers and pins on campus, but I haven't seen many. The most political debate I've seen was unusual. Members of the campus Bernie club were in a heated argument with those from the campus Socialist club on Sproul.
Does he really need to choose and elect a President in order to prove his point? I'm just worried he's losing sight of the big picture here.

His ideas have been brought into mainstream attention and are widely recognized to be correct. Hillary and the Democratic Party as a whole have understood the economic argument against income inequality and have incorporated it into their platforms and proposed policies. Watching the debates, Hillary actually seems to have a better understanding of the issue than Sanders (who comes off as more interested in retribution/scapegoating than actual solutions).
Ok, yeah good to know he's handling it well in class.
""Largest in the country"" actually equates to 300 people, just remember that.

In case you weren't aware, that post was a joke. The OP made other troll posts as well.
How you do think Sanders is scapegoating?  I'd be careful not to confuse clear messaging with simplistic thinking.  He's pretty consistent in saying things like, ""we don't want billionares deciding the elections, writing the laws.""  That's a *much* different message than attacking them.  It doesn't even accuse them of doing something wrong *per se*, just that it's not the way our society should operate.

I'll be the first to agree that the anti-Hillary stuff is often baseless.  I'm pro-Sanders, not anti-Hillary.
I don't see it as a problem because he hasn't ever mentioned it in the classroom.

Also, $1b in quarterly profit for a company with $35b in assets isn’t exactly a lot of money.

Lastly, as an aspiring vegan, fuck Tyson
So has NIMBY Reich changed his stance on low income housing in his neighborhood yet? Last time I checked he was still trying to defend his property value.
Its not that companies are greedier during some periods its that when a supply shock happens companies will immediately raise prices but it takes time for prices to fall once thats resolved. Between the time it takes for the supply shock to be resolved and the prices stabilizing, downstream customers are paying an elevated price and companies pocket the difference. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_price_transmission
Better yet, people could just stop eating junk like breaded chicken tenders and switch to either supporting actual restaurant businesses (not those multi-billion $ chains) or buying produce and making their own food. Healthier, cheaper (not eating out), supporting locals (both through the market and businesses), and driving demand away from shit frozen food companies that don’t need or deserve any more money.
Lol Robert reich is such a hack it’s embarrassing

**[Asymmetric price transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_price_transmission)** 
 
 >Asymmetric price transmission (sometimes abbreviated as APT and informally called ""rockets and feathers"" [1][2][3]) refers to pricing phenomenon occurring when downstream prices react in a different manner to upstream price changes, depending on the characteristics of upstream prices or changes in those prices. The simplest example is when prices of ready products increase promptly whenever prices of inputs increase, but take time to decrease after input price decreases.

Oh, I see! I guess it doesn't have anything to do with the fact that the Fed printed in the last two years more dollars than had been printed in history prior to that point!
You mechanism doesn't seem to properly explain why wouldn't any single company decrease prices (after the supply shock is gone) first to get a bigger share of the market; I guess you could say that markets are not competitive, prices are sluggish or something like that.

But most importantly, I also don't see why this mechanism only affects the prices that downstream customers face. Why do the prices of the goods companies buy as inputs adjust faster than the prices of their outputs, as a rule in every industry? Companies that sell finished goods to end customers are greedy and want to ""pocket in"" the difference, but companies that sell intermediate goods are not so greedy and don't pocket in this difference?
This problem isn't exclusive to junk food though? I went to buy chicken (raw, skinless, boneless) recently and the bag I usually buy was $16 when it was always $7/8 before???
I completely agree that purchasing from better sources & eating more healthy is the overall ideal.  That's a given.

This situation though - Cal using Tyson - is the issue.  It's not 100% independent from what you are talking about (like kids not scarfing down chicken fingers would solve this problem); however, what you are talking about is a hell of an ask vs. Cal buying chicken fingers from a better source.
Is someone forcing you to eat Tyson branded chicken?
Explain QE to me in a sentence
i mean its a combination of both. If it was purely a money supply issue we’d see wages rising with inflation, but prices for certain goods are outpacing wage growth. We had pandemic shocks to supply as well as one of the largest energy/food producers in the world get heavily sanctioned. This obviously would cause prices to increase bc supply/demand, but because of rockets/feathers inflated prices cause windfalls to corporations between the raw materials and average consumers
Jesus it’s gotten that bad?
Mm true, I was thinking of it more of a general problem than the specific Cal-Tyson one we’re talking about here. You’re right, switching to a better source is definitely a more realistic solution for the school.
Do you not realize the food industry is an oligopoly in the US? We need antitrust laws implemented. Yesterday.
As I understand, QE, or quantitative easing, is a temporary policy of printing money to help the economy recover that has been temporarily implemented for about 14 years now. :)
Fight regulation with more regulation. Or we could make it a free market and have to compete on price
how does the money get circulated?
There is no such thing as the free market. Capitalism in its freest form results in the concentration of wealth and profits into the hands of fewer and fewer firms, as oligopoly and monopoly reign supreme. This is what unregulated competition drives. Antitrust laws break up firms into smaller pieces in order to increase competition, driving down prices in the process. Regulations are necessary.

My attempt to highlight the flaws of Affirmative Action and why it doesn't do what it's supposed to: (Not a shitpost),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h9vaz8/my_attempt_to_highlight_the_flaws_of_affirmative/,2020-06-15 20:07:54,"Hey all, though I once yearned to be one of the shitpost legends on this sub, along the likes of u/HornyAsianBro, u/blockeleyhacker, and others, I am writing this in a more solemn state of mind, and I understand I will never reach that status.

THIS IS NOT A SHITPOST

You should know that I am Asian, as my haters would know, my post history reveals that I am a dual Korean-American citizen. I'm here to point out something that isn't original, but is certainly left alone more than it should be in regards to the debate around affirmative action, or racial consideration in the college admissions process in general.

Let me just say, I do not support Affirmative Action. Mind, I support its intention and the principle behind it, but it's clear to all of us that putting quotas on ""diversity"" is innately discriminatory and thoroughly nonsensical.

The Supreme Court case UC Regents v. Bakke pretty much established race as a necessary and important consideration in the admissions process-- we know it is. Anybody who knows anything knows that race (for the anthro majors, *ethnicity)* IS in fact a very integral part of our identities, experience, and realm of opportunity. I'm not here to argue that, and in fact, I know most of us aren't against that notion either. It's the fact that we allow this sentiment to drive unfair and often controversial policies into place, that lift some and bar others. Affirmative Action was not the solution to racial disparity in America.

It's also apparent that arguments in favor of AA tend to rationalize racial quotas as a necessary form or reparation to the impoverished African American and URM communities. While noble and righteous, it conflates *poverty* with *race*, and generalizes entire ethnic/demographic populations as representative of poverty, or lacking in opportunity.

This is one of AA's major issues. While seeking to address inequality in America, it attempts to solve that issue by generalizing the URM population as poor and the white/asian population as affluent enough. If the purpose of AA is to stimulate and encourage college education and opportunities for poverty-stricken students across the nation, wouldn't it make more sense to literally consider exactly that issue during the admissions process? Nope. Instead, Common App and most Universities choose to be ""need blind,"" and *IGNORE* incomes of applicants.

THIS is an issue; if my race does not constitute my identity, it certainly does not constitute a believable standard of income/societal privilege. Statistics aside, generalizations have NO place in something as paramount as college admissions. If anything, this is a MORE of a major impediment to poorer non-URM groups than it is a help to the much-needed diversity on college campuses.

Here's something tangible to consider: a popular sentiment around here is that rather than allowing race to decide admissions, merit is the more logical aspect to consider. This is applicable to any and all anti-merit policies and arguments. AA proponents will negate this by pointing out the disadvantages URMs deal with and the importance of diversity in public and private institutions. Like always. these are indeed things worthwhile to consider, yet it seems that it's only applied when its in the university's interest.

An example? Why doesn't the need for ""diversity"" apply to the NCAA, or any professional sport for that matter? Why is it okay for the Cal football team to be dominated by black and white students, with almost zero Asian representation? Why is the college athletics realm dominated by black students in general?

The answer is simple, if albeit generalizing: black students tend to perform better, receive more attention, and have proven themselves to have consistently better statistics than other ethnic counterparts. Basically, they've earned it, and they've worked for it. Asian americans have no place on the Cal football team unless they're at the competitive level of their peers. It makes sense, doesn't it?

Oh, it sure does. *Wait*, you say...

Yes. Merit makes *sense*. There's nothing to doubt about it. There is, however, something to doubt about Affirmative Action.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: The scale between merit and social service meets its tipping point when certain groups' opportunities are taken away to be given to another. Merit has been and should be the qualifying factor in college admissions.

edit: i wanted to crosspost this to r/ApplyingToCollege, but I was banned lol. If one of you guys think this is deserving of more discussion, please feel free to repost.","I don't really think your example of the football team illustrates what you think it illustrates. The  over-representation of black athletes in football is, if anything, an example of the structural issues in American society. We're fine reserving a few slots at our universities for athletes, who make universities crazy revenue while the athletes must sign away their right to make revenue off their absurdly lucrative talents. Those same athletes often don't get the same educational opportunities because their enrollment is tied to performing at what is essentially a full time job, at least for portions of the calendar.

Look, you get into how incredibly complicated it is to assess 'merit,' and you're entirely correct. Most college applicants have had to overcome one hardship or another, whether because of their ethnicity, sexual orientation, family income, geography, etc. Hey! There's the value of intersectionality - to try our best to understand all that and put in place policies that work to address those issues.

But I think it's ultimately kinda lazy to take all of that complication, throw up your hands, and say that the solution is worse than the current reality. Your very post recognizes that there are problems, so how do YOU suggest we build a better, more equal society?
While I do agree with most of the reasoning, you seem to make an assumption in your argument. It’s not perfectly clear that AA’s goal in the case of college admissions is to ensure equality regardless of income. We shouldn’t be thinking about income when we think about AA, that’s not the point, we should solely be thinking about race and whether or not all races are being represented well in admissions.

Whether we should also take into consideration income is another matter entirely. The question should be if AA is ensuring equality among races in the admissions process. If it is, then we should ask ourselves if its benefits outweigh its consequences.

The argument for AA is simple:

* These groups of people have been discriminated against *precisely* because of their race / appearance.  It is universal; even affluent minorities are still discriminated against, and would perhaps be even more affluent (based on their merit, if we're going to bring up that bag of worms) if such discrimination did not exist.

* AA seeks to redress the issue by directly targeting the groups targeted by discrimination.  Simple.

The merit argument is flawed in that it is circular.  Discrimination reinforces itself.  Those discriminated against have fewer opportunities, more challenges, and can be reliably found to 'achieve' less due to that.  They are less meritorious *because* of discrimination.  The majority groups are more meritorious *because* they have relative advantage.

_______

If the value of AA is recognized, then the next issue is where it should be applied.

AA in employment has some significant complications.  Logistically, there are many thousands of employers, so it is very difficult to implement.  They are also private companies that are aligned to their own competitive interests, rather than public institutions.  Tokenism is also a major issue in perpetuating discrimination.

Education is a natural target.  Ideally there would be more AA in early education, no doubt.  This is likely to be the most impact, and also avoids entirely the discussion of merit unless you begin to judge toddlers this way.  If such a system were in place, these arguments would be made - and loudly - but they are nonetheless absurd.

The problem with early education is that the structural funding issues prevent this from occurring.  Early childhood programs, which are demonstrably effective and money-saving, remain a near impossibility politically.  Actual AA in early education is a pipe dream.

College is then the natural target because it is a limited number of institutions, many with a powerful progressive voice that can hear reason.  Furthermore, secondary education functions as a powerful sorting mechanism in our society.  AA interventions here have powerful effects in future employment and life outcomes.

______

Opposition to AA is a kind of NIMBYism.  Most people can understand, at least in the abstract, that systematic discrimination is a real issue, and one that will not simply solve itself.  Even if slow progress over centuries would lead to social justice, it is morally reprehensible to let this situation endure for hundreds of years because it is inconvenient to address it affirmatively.

It is inconvenient to privileged groups.  This is not a bold new perspective.  It is one that simply prioritizes the issues directly in front of them over the undeniable and horrific issues of our society.
[deleted]
have my upvote; i didn’t consider your perspective on college sports and the implications of a black-dominated field. that’s a really good point, and we sort of reached the same conclusion, that it’s awfully complicated. my post didn’t aim at finding a new solution, it really was just a hard poke at Affirmative Action, since Cal is expected to pass thay bill in an upcoming vote.
literally doing nothing is more just than AA. because we go from ""deserving people might be passed over"" to ""deserving people will be passed over""
From an idealistic point of view, I certainly agree with the aims of race-based AA.  And from a both idealistic and pragmatic point of view, I completely agree with socio-economic status (SES) indicators, which Berkeley is actually successful at using at (UCs have a significantly higher percent of Pell Grant recipients than comparable schools)

However, I disagree with race-based AA (without significant checks, which a simple repeal of prop 209 fails to put in place) because how it ultimately gets implemented in a real system:

* It does not become an even-handed reparative system.  e.g. Asians (who were historically discriminated against -- and still are) don't benefit from Harvard considering race -- in fact, they are [actively discriminated against](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/realpenalty.pdf) relative to the white majority!
* While racism is present, in practice it's not really that clear that outcomes are significantly different once you condition on the type of SES factors UCs already consider. The sole exception seems to be [black men](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html).  (I'm open to other sources here contradicting this claim -- I've found it surprisingly hard in my research to find papers that compare race differences conditioned on SES rather than independently).
* Because race is so arbitrarily defined by administrators, benefits fail to go to the groups with the most need.  As one [example](http://www.jbhe.com/news_views/52_harvard-blackstudents.html), the majority of black students at Harvard are Caribbean or African immigrants (or children of) and very few are decedents of slaves.

Generally speaking, metrics like racial diversity are very coarse representatives of who is being helped.  Making this highly simplified metric itself a factor tends to pervert incentives. (e.g. discriminate against poor Chinese immigrants in favor of rich African immigrants)
This argument is valid if one of the following is true:

1) Affirmative action reduces the admissions of white students more so than for Asian American students

or 

2) Asian Americans have white privilege/don't suffer systemic racism. Anyone who believes this is true probably grew up in the bubble of the South Bay or similar, because it's not.

In every implementation of affirmative action I've seen, both are false, so affirmative action fails at equitably addressing systemic racism. Then, it's just a tool to introduce more diversity, which while I agree can be beneficial, is harder to use as a justification for denying more meritorious students.
Affirmative action is systematic discrimination. By definition.

And easily identifiable.
i either suggest you re-read my post or i suggest myself to re-read your comment; maybe there’s an imperative here i’m not grasping, because otherwise this isn’t what i argued at all
Just a graphic that I found helpful to think about.

https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/gq2n31/inequality_v_equality_v_equity_v_justice/

When you go to college, it might be a good idea to take some general education classes relating to these topics that you are discussing (both in philosophy and maybe in social sciences). I found them to be very interesting and open my perspective more than regular English classes.
I think it's pretty naive to say that, in the current system, deserving people 'might' be getting passed over.

But hey, if you think that the current educational system is equitable (or if you think that higher education doesn't have to play a role in fixing societal issues, as if high ed is somehow distinct and separate from society) I doubt there's anything I can say to change your mind.
[deleted]
any classes to recommend? my upcoming fall is purely technical; some humanities would be welcomed
the tree does not disallow the boy from moving to the left side

and anyways, according to this graphic inequality, equality, and equity all are bad options, and switching among them is a waste of time. so why argue whether or not AA pushes for equality vs equity when we should argue whether or not AA pushes for justice
agreed, my point is that affirmative action fails to solve any of these issues you mentioned. colleges literally go “need blind” and emit income during college admissions... meanwhile affirmative action uses race to qualify whether poverty affects the applicant or not. well which is it? my post just points out AA’s fallacies, it doesn’t refute anything regarding the real issues at hand. it also doesn’t support any particular course of action, other than against AA.
Hmm I have been out of school a while, but one class that had quite an impact on me was ESPM 163AC Environment Justice. No prereqs, fulfills a ton of breath requirements.

Not exactly applicable to AA but still interesting. So that's a real course with real work load. There are also many 1-2 credit seminar/special topic classes around in different department that are super interesting. It's awesome because the work load is so light but you get to learn something  completely out of your normal classes. It was super fun for me. You should really try to take advantage of that opportunity.

Edit: I was looking around on the catalog. It seems like a lot of classes satisfying American Culture requirement give good exposure to these ethnicity/race issues. Psych 167AC and polsci 117ac,167ac look cool too. Sociology 130ac, socwel 150AC, etc
Highly recommend Wealth & Poverty by Robert Reich. Incredibly popular and thought-provoking class.
I do love Robert Reich"
Has your experience at Cal been a positive one?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/20j1jh/has_your_experience_at_cal_been_a_positive_one/,2014-03-15 20:30:35,"For me personally, I love Cal to death. I've experienced the best moments in my life at Berkeley so far, and I feel a bit sad that I will be graduating soon. I've made so many new friends, all of whom are brilliant and super talented in one way or another, and are a bit quirky in their own ways (though I like that!). While my classes have been tough and rigorous (I'm CS), I feel honored to study alongside such incredible students and learn from amazing professors. Cal has definitely helped me a lot and has shaped my life for the better...and I'm really grateful that it helped me get a job in Silicon Valley (I really liked the advisers in the career center).

I think Cal's campus is beautiful, I love how there's always clubs on sproul doing stuff (even if the flyering gets a bit annoying), I love the local cuisine and culture, and I love how close Cal is to SF. I've been able to pursue a lot of activities outside of my CS sphere, such as joining political and social clubs, and taking DeCal courses on various fun subjects (I think Cal's DeCal program is extremely cool, something that the ivy league lacks). I love Cal's diversity: I've met people from varying socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds, ppl from around the globe, and have developed a deeper understanding and appreciation for people's differences. I love Robert Reich and found his course to be one of the most insightful courses I've taken in my life (outside of CS). I also loved my first year in the dorms, my year in the co-ops, and the two years I've spent in my apartment with two friends. 

I've also never felt the size of the school population to be a problem: I love that there's so many people here. Because of that, you can always find your niche of friends with whom you share common interests and create a small family, and can always meet new and interesting people every semester (with different classes, different club activities, ect). I also really like how non-judgemental and relatively mature most students are: in high school, I was an outcast because people felt I was a nerd who liked anime, starcraft, science fiction, and wasn't super good at sports. At my high school, there were a lot of cliques and I often felt that I didn't belong, and being gay didn't help either. But at Cal, most people have been really accepting of who i am, and since everyone is unique in their own way, and don't judge ppl over stupid stuff (like what music someone likes, what shows they like, what their interests are, what clothes they are wearing, whether they are gay, etc). And while Berkeley is competitive and I have heard of backstabbers in curved classes, I've never experienced that: all of my friends have been nice and took care of me when I missed class or was sick. I'm just so glad that so many people here are open to making new friends on the spot and genuinely liking others (at least compared to my high school)

If I went to another school, I would have probably just only cared about getting my degree and doing a job, and nothing more. But after coming to Cal, I learned about politics, and as a result, I am much more socially conscious than I was before, and I thank Berkeley for improving me as a person. 

Also not about berkeley specifically, but I love having freedom...i feel much more responsible and mature than I was in high school, and I thank my college experience for that. 

Yeah, some stuff about Cal sucks: telebears, a lackluster football team, mediocre campus spirit (although the RAs + rally comm + ASUC try really hard), really rigorous courses, the surrounding area can be unsafe at times, bureaucracy (although this wasn't a problem for me), telebears, inadequate policies to address sexual violence, inadequate medical + mental health services, rising tuition, etc. But I think that the positives strongly outweigh the negatives, and we are trying hard to improve in the above areas and do it a lot of them better than other schools. ","Somedays I wish I never came here. But most of the time I know I would never trade this experience for anything in the world. 

I have become a better person after being here for 4 years. Yeah, I had my share of mishaps and failures, some of them soul crushing, but nonetheless it has made me a better man. 

I have many regrets about my experience here, I have made mistakes, I have hurt and been hurt. But if my life is but a sum of my experiences, I would be hard pressed to have a better place and people to have these experiences.  
I graduated last May and was lucky enough to get a job in the bay, so I can visit Cal once in a while. I love Berkeley for all the same reasons you list. If you could define an equation of variables that make me who I am today, the entire thing would probably be to the 'Berkley'th power, because it so fundamentally affected every aspect of me. 

My economics/political science studies helped me build a framework through which I viewed the world. My tenure as an RA taught me self-awareness and empathy. The people I met exposed me to diversity, social justice, and inclusion. At Berkeley, I began my journey of food discovery, my hunger for literature, the foundation of my own independent thoughts and beliefs about the world, what I look for in a romantic partner, what real friendship meant, and so much more.

What makes me most thankful is the fact that I ended up at Cal in Fall 2009 completely by accident. The story is complex, but suffice it to say I thought I was going to Stanford until the last second, when I could no longer attend and chose Berkeley without ever having visited. 

Now working with a fair amount of Stanford graduates, I couldn't be happier that I ended up where I did.

All that being said, two things I'd like to point out:

1. Our school spirit was roaring my Freshman year, before our football team fell off the deep end. It's pretty unfortunate that our pride in our school is largely dependent on this, but I suppose that's just the way it goes.

2. The class sizes are Berkeley's achilles heel. Approaching a professor when they have to juggle hundreds of students is hard, and scary. Not all professors are friendly. It can be hard to be motivated when you are so easily lost in the crowd. What I'm trying to say is, navigating the masses (both academically and socially) requires a skill set--maybe even a personality type--that not everyone has or knows how to develop. Berkeley tries to provide everyone with the resources to overcome this (that was my job as an RA), but I know hundreds of Cal students (not exaggerating) who will tell you that it is prohibitive to their success.
While I agree with you that there are many things to love about Berkeley, I've got to say that I've been continually disappointed/discouraged by such large class sizes. CS is particularly crowded; I'm in 61C now and I'm finding that it's difficult to make connections with peers and instructors. I wish I knew professors better because, among many other important reasons, I have yet to develop any relationship that could result in a letter of recommendation. Discussions are large too. I feel like if I want to have someone talk to me about the course (peer/instructor/etc.), I have to go to office hours which is difficult when every other course is large and designed the same way.

Did you ever feel frustrated by this? I know the CS major is becoming more and more popular - is there any more involvement in upper division classes?
Ever since I first got here I've been gradually declining into depression and the beginnings of alcoholism, so no I wouldn't call it a positive experience, but I'm definitely glad I came here over any other school.
You ever have the experience at a party where someone brings up a topic, and you see an interesting, deeper question that the topic prompts, so you raise it to the group... just for them to exchange bewildered glances? So you drop it, and go back to talking about kittens or football or whatever, but you still get people telling you that you ""overthink"" things? I used to get that a lot before I came to Cal, but never since. My time here has been something of an emotional rollercoaster, but I've never forgotten how privileged I am to be in the company of people who are unafraid to confront big ideas. I know that I will dearly miss the days when I could sit down at a cafe and eat a sandwich while the people at the table next to me discuss quantum physics, or medieval literature, or whatever esoteric thing has wrapped itself around their hearts without shame or self-consciousness. I won't miss the late nights, or the enormous classes, and I certainly won't miss Telebears, but I will miss leading a life of the mind.
This is pretty cool to read. I visited the campus last spring break, I am a junior in highschool, and I fell in love with how beautiful it was. Could I DM you some questions?
I dunno, it was bittersweet for me. I think the weather really affected me negatively (from So Cal), while the courseload took a huge hit on my confidence. I'm sure my experience at Cal was more of a function of where I was in my life, but there's just something about the city that's always put me off. Not really sure. I really enjoyed SF, the classes, the students, and the greenery, though. 
Why the hell are people downvoting this? I thought it was a pretty touching story.

Anyway, glad you really like it here! Cal was the highlight of my life too...grad school (I went to law school) was a bummer
Awesome, thank you for sharing. I really hope when I graduate I'll be able to look back and feel the same way.

I'm a junior right now so not quite finished but a good ways there. Since coming to Cal, I've learned so much about myself, including what I really want from life and how to be genuine. The university makes many things difficult; it's difficult to maintain close friends and get good grades, etc, but now that I've gotten past it all I feel confident and ready for what life has in store for me next.

I'm studying abroad right now, and it's really put into perspective how lucky I am to be able to attend such a great university. The academics, people, and opportunities at Cal are truly top-notch. Others would sacrifice a great deal to be where we are now.
I chose Berkeley for the prestigious name. I came here with a purpose, to use the college name to get me where I wanted to be professionally and that's exactly what I did.

Socially I hate this place. It's grimy as hell. My car window just got smashed, I constantly get parking tickets, the homeless people sleeping on campus weird me out, most people aren't friendly in class, the competition between students is a buzz kill and it's the biggest small town i've ever been to. I'm from LA and getting used to this place has been very difficult for me. Anyone reading this make sure you check out the campus/city prior to moving here. That was my biggest mistake. It's not for everyone but what is?

Bio/Psych major checking in. You have to be strategic about the professors you pick for recommendations.

In my popular classes (MCB 104), there would literally be 30-40 people who would show up to every single office hour session (even the ones right after exams). They'd have to reserve a discussion room just to hold office hours.

Typically it's the electives where nobody cares enough to go to office hours. For me, that was MCB 103 - the professor was still excellent, but office hours were usually me and 2-3 other people.

Edit: Scratch that, in my Psych/Breadth classes nobody gave a damn and office hours were basically deserted. It's only the Biology folks trying to get into medical school that flooded office hours.
I'm constantly afraid of not getting into the CS major so for that reason it has been a highly stressful experience lately. Fun classes though.
you're not alone, i felt very similar my first year (about the confidence hits from classes but especially the lack of SoCal sunshine(its weird how important it is)) and still do.
if people don't like my post or story, that is their choice :) People have different experiences, so it's good to respect that.

I just wanted to post this to see if anyone else had a really good time at Cal. And I wanted to see if people had a negative experience at Cal and why they feel things didn't work out 
Wow man/woman, care to share why Boalt was a bummer? I work in the law library and ask students about their experience there and it's always a resounding ""It's difficult but amazing."" What do you say?
uhh, i didn't post that, and it's deleted ._.
Appropriate user name, if I knew how to label peeps on reddit you'd be ""underdog team leader that pops up at the half when the team is down with a rally speech.""
This deserves gold. thank you for this, I'm going to fucking office hours this week.
> Also, you won't get a good letter of rec. just by getting an A in a class. I don't know where that notion came from. To get any meaningful letter of rec you have to do research with a professor. I think most people in engineering will back me up on this.

Most definitely. Letters from class interactions show very little.
Well, I suppose my experience with office hours thus far has been lackluster. With the exception of Dan's office hours, I've had other professors hold discussion style OH which are often full.  But perhaps you addressed my question - I've only taken extremely crowded lower div courses (CS, Math 1A/1B, Chem 1A/3A, Bio 1A, etc.). I was really wondering if, beyond those, you're less likely to get lost in the crowd. 
Well office hours are a bit difficult for several reasons. Some professors don't show up to their own scheduled office hours, and a few years ago EECS had a problem the professors not updating the listings on their doors with the correct date/time.

They've pretty much fixed this (note that this does not apply to other departments, some of which still have this problem), but in my own experience, I've also usually had another lecture or section during a professor's office hours. Since Berkeley professors are do brilliant work, they need all the time they can get for research and this cuts into student interaction time.

For some professors office hours = office hour, and if I've got lab section during that hour then there's no way I can make it.

I also agree about the letter of rec. People ask me sometimes to help them word out their request, but all they have to work with is ""oh, I went to office hours like twice. and I got an A, so it should be good right?"" I imagine these situations are awkward for the professors.


Yeah, classes at Cal were pretty brutal. I remember getting my first panic attack while taking Biochem for Biochem majors. First and last class I've ever actually failed. The sunshine down here really spoils us, I think. I was just hanging around Venice today and just being outside literally put a smile on my face. Damn this sensitivity.
From a brief look at columbialawpolsci's history he did not go to Boalt, but Duke Law School. He probably went to UC Berkeley as an undergrad then from the ""highlight of my life"" bit
2L Boaltie here. Law school is a grind, pure and simple. I enjoy law school more than most, but it's a mind-numbing and soul-crushing process. I was having a beer with one of my classmates the other night and he remarked that one of his favorite parts of law school is that there's so much work that you simply don't have time to think sad thoughts. &#3232;_&#3232;

See you in the library!
Yes, it's deleted now that you've deleted it after the fact. "
