James Campbell VS Enrico Moretti Econ 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jigca7/james_campbell_vs_enrico_moretti_econ_1/,2020-10-26 08:14:10,"I'm looking to take Econ 1 next semester, and not sure which professor to pick. Rate my professor hasn't been too helpful as both of them are flooded with negative comments and I can't tell if it's just students who are unsatisfied with their grades.

Does anyone have any experience with either Professor? Any insight would be appreciated! How were the tests/ quizzes/ assignments? How easily accessible are they outside of class? How were the lectures? Thank you so much!!","Took econ 1 with Campbell during the summer. 10/10 experience, great professor who is knowledgeable, a good lecturer, and has forgiving policies. Although I did take AP microecon in high school so half of the class was a breeze.
I heard that Campbell‚Äôs quizzes are very hard and he can be a harsh grader, but I‚Äôm also confused because people seem to be really split on them. I‚Äôm having a hard time deciding which econ professor too.
I‚Äôm also confused. Help will be appreciated!
yeah I'm in his Econ 101A and he's super chill, and you can get extensions for any assignments no questions asked
Thanks so much! I‚Äôm going with Campbell :)"
econ 1 with Enrico Moretti or James Campbell?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k0cow0/econ_1_with_enrico_moretti_or_james_campbell/,2020-11-24 12:08:23,"I checked Rate My Professor and both have low reviews, how was your experience?

&#x200B;

The posts on reddit for Campbell seem to be very good but on Rate My Professor it seems really bad. Did anything change? Is it really that difficult, or are the reviews mostly by people who are unsatisfied with grades?","If you do a search on this sub (look for Campbell, or Moretti), this question has been asked a lot of times
Thanks, I didn't think to check! I feel that after checking the sub I'm even more conflicted
Well, Campbell‚Äôs version is full, so if you haven‚Äôt made a choice yet, it seems like the choice is made for you already."
How is enrico moretti for econ 1? Hearing mixed things...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/do2yt1/how_is_enrico_moretti_for_econ_1_hearing_mixed/,2019-10-27 19:39:00,With my given slot time for classes it is unlikely I am getting Econ 2 and will have to do Econ 1 which Enrico moretti is teaching and I have heard all types of things so I am a bit concerned.,"I was actually a big fan. It was an 8am class (with iclicker attendance), but I found it interesting enough to stay engaged in my partially asleep state. I was originally going to both econ 1 & 2 while I was enrolled in 1 and on the waitlist for 2, but once I got in to 2 I actually decided to stay in 1 because I liked the 2 hrs of lecture and 2 hrs discussion more than 3 hrs lecture 1 hr discussion in econ 2. I felt like having that extra hour of discussion gave us a lot more time to practice/ask questions/exam prep, etc. Also when I took it in Spring 2017 there was an ebook with homework included, so our problem sets were online and all multiple choice.
I loved him actually. Like the other commentor I took it at 8 AM, but he always brought an energetic attitude that definitely kept me with the lecture. Be forewarned about his accent though, I fucked with it and it made his lectures more engaging for me but I know some people don‚Äôt do well when they have a hard time understanding the professor. He always seemed very approachable, did a good job with student questions, you can even sign up to get lunch with him if you want. Exams (especially final) were actually pretty easy I felt, but maybe I just had a good GSI. Overall I really liked the class even though I‚Äôm not an econ major, and that was in large part due to the Moretti‚Äôs enthusiasm.
Amazing, thank you!!
do you have his syllabus saved by any chance?"
Econ 1 Spring,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j61bzr/econ_1_spring/,2020-10-06 01:18:11,"James D Campbell or Enrico Moretti? How was your experience with each of them? Who has the ‚Äúeasier tests‚Äù and which one should I choose to take Econ 1 with?

I remember seeing on Ratemyprof that Moretti doesn‚Äôt post any recordings or notes but since everything is remote now, I‚Äôm wondering if anything‚Äôs changed?

Thank you!","I‚Äôm in Campbells Econ 100A right now. He‚Äôs pretty good. Also, we don‚Äôt have a midterm, just 6 quizzes, and the final is a timed essay (no math problems). Not sure what he‚Äôll do for Econ 1 next sem, but I think he did the same structure as we have for his summer class of Econ 1.
I took Econ 1 with james Campbell in the summer and really enjoyed him as a person/the content having never taken an Econ class before. I ended up getting an a- really studying hard for the quizzes, but piazza helped a lot! My only complaint is he talks super fast so I found myself spending like an hour after each lecture finishing up all the notes (maybe this was just a summer thing since they‚Äôre so condensed).
i‚Äôm also having difficulty choosing. who did you end up picking?
[deleted]
moderately difficult but that was me
Did you have any prior Econ knowledge or experience?
no! said that in my original reply:)"
Thoughts on this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/2fa3uojm3ybc1.jpeg,2024-01-11 21:30:17,If I can take all these classes this semester I will be able to apply to haas this year (freshmen). Please let me know your honest feedback.,"I think it‚Äôs doable
No
Not ideal, see if you can either block or minimize classes on Monday or Friday. This tactic would have boosted my gpa at least .5
I didn‚Äôt see the classes but soooo early üò≠
You are dumb
i took the ugba 10 ugba 88 econ 1 combo alongside cs classes last semester and it was very chill imo, just be on top of lecture for ugba 10 lol dont fall behind (id also recommend econ 1 over 2 i dropped 2 for 1.)
Prof Paulin is the GOAT
Light work
You‚Äôre currently an undeclared freshman at Berkeley?
Based on everyone who took Econ 2, they regret not taking Econ 1 with Campbell. I also took 2 class with him and they were so good. Just a tip if u still can
Pros: classes should be relatively light (assuming ur good on the fundamentals). Lectures are spread out so u have enough time during afternoons/nights to study/work/socialize

Con: there are many classes, so if you don‚Äôt have a good study habit then you will not be able to juggle them. Also you will need to wake up early, so if you‚Äôre not a morning person then this might not be good for you.

Depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are. Good luck, u got this!
Bow your head, let me pray for you"
Looking for an econ 2 study group,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/198qq3y/looking_for_an_econ_2_study_group/,2024-01-16 23:12:39,"If anyone is interested in making a study group in econ 2, dm me.","What section are you in?
Hi, I am looking for a group to study with for the remainder of the semester! Not sure if you found a group already or are still interested in studying with others! lmk
I am with the teacher Enrico Moretti"
