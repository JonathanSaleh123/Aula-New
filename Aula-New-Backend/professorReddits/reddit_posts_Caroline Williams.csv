How are bio 1b and physics 8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1db9stj/how_are_bio_1b_and_physics_8a/,2024-06-08 11:47:26,"Profs are bio 1b: Caroline Williams, Charles Marshall, Michal shuldman

Physics 8a: na ji
","I took both during Spring 2024.

Bio 1B is almost all memorization based with only a few equations here and there that you need to know how to apply. Labs are worth 40% of your grade so do try on those as all those little points lost can add up. The third midterm was a week before RRR week which seems bad, but it was doable. The final was all multiple choice and if you did better on the final than all three of your midterm MC sections, then the final score would replace all of them. The midterms have a written section with around 3-4 questions which come directly from lecture or are questions that you need to apply your learned knowledge to answer. I think bins were lowered by a few points because of the third section (organismal bio), which tends to have the lowest average each semester. There is no other additional curving as your raw grades from assignments, labs, and exams, determine your overall grade in the class. Overall, it‚Äôs a doable class if you are able to memorize terms and definitions. 
 
Physics 8A made me cry each week but that was because my background in math and physics isn‚Äôt as strong as my background in chem and bio. I paid around $50 for the online homework which had unlimited attempts. However, the homework didn‚Äôt really correlate with the exam problems so I didn‚Äôt pay much attention. For Golightly‚Äôs section, I found that focusing on lecture examples and watching supplemental YouTube videos worked best for me. I sometimes used the book (physics vol 1 which is online), but other times I found that it taught material that was unneeded. The class is based on a curve with the following stats: top 25% = A, next 40% = B, (sorry I forgot the percentage for a C). All of those boundaries include +/- grades as well. Even though I felt that my performance was weak in physics as compared to my peers, I ended up with an A- in the class üôèüèº. Labs are out of 5 points each and there are 6 total. The only bad part is that the grading for the labs is done by your GSI and the grading rubric can vary greatly across sections. Overall, if you have an adequate background in math, then you are pretty much set (imo).
marshall and williams are both excellent! very sweet, friendly professors who are good at teaching. never had shuldman.¬†
Really helpful thanks sm!
Any content bases tips?
What do you mean?
Like what the hardest segments of the class are or any tips on studying specific topics
Bio 1B: I would say the hardest section was organismal biology mainly due to the amount of material that we needed to know. My tips would be to draw out all of the life cycles until you can visualize them and learn the meaning of roots, suffixes, and prefixes (-phyll, -cyte, -gonia, etc.). Some YouTube videos may be helpful in explaining the cycles to you differently, which may or may not help you. 

Physics 8A: You should know kinematics like the back of your hand. Kinematics are the most basic part of physics and you should become familiar with them to help you out. I would recommend O-Chem tutor on YT for those. Also, know how to extract information from the text to set up your equations. This is a major part of physics and determines basically your grade. If you have time, you should watch the physics Crash Course series on YT for an overview of most of the topics (watch through to thermodynamics since thermo is the last thing covered in 8A)."

a fellow n curious bear :)","I took Bio1B as an engineering major (it was either that or Chem 1A) and actually quite enjoyed the course. It taught me to digest large amounts of information and improved my study habits. I do remember thinking the Evolution section was the easiest. 

We had a field trip up to the botanical gardens, which was really cool.

When I took it, we had a quiz where we identified a bunch of specimens in lab. It was surprisingly easy-you'll realize how much you've learned throughout the semester.

I don't know how it compares to other biology courses, but I heard 1B is relatively easy. Every now and then terms like ""haplodiplontic"" resurface in my head. Good times (I graduated this semester).
By any chance were you an IEOR major?"
