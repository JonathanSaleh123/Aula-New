fall 2023 chem 1 prof,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1526dr0/fall_2023_chem_1_prof/,2023-07-17 09:16:16,"hi! i am currently enrolled for chem 1a but under the profs two are listed:  Alexis Shusterman, Eric Neuscamman. I heard shusterman is the way better prof and was wondering which it would be.

ALSO CAN U TAKE CHEM 1A L SEPERATLY FROM CHEM 1A

Thanks reddit community, you guys help smm!","if listed two, both will be teaching. i would say both are ok. alexis is amazing. yes you can take the two classes concurrently or lab after lecture
Shusterman is a legend. Personally my fav prof at Cal. She's the only prof who actually made me 'like' chemistry. During fall semesters since the chem classes have 700+ students, they usually have two professors. Usually each prof teaches half the sem.
Wait that‚Äôs interesting. I thought she only taught in the spring! I agree Shusterman is the best. She made the class feel personal too even though it was huge üíï"
"Lin Lin, an assistant professor of mathematics, and Eric Neuscamman, an assistant professor of chemistry, received 2017 Early Career Research Program awards from the Department of Energy to further their work. Lin joined the math department in 2014.

Are they working on similar subjects? Looks like they both work with DFT

is this schedule good (incoming freshman),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dlq9l5/is_this_schedule_good_incoming_freshman/,2024-06-22 00:35:44,"https://preview.redd.it/1438i26lt28d1.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ff619572364f9150520ee3b72de7f5dfd7a332

intended major is MCB","Looks standard¬†
Typical first semester schedule
looks pretty normal; after this semester, you‚Äôll see what you like and adjust as necessary (i.e. earlier classes, longer breaks for lunch, etc.) good luck and welcome!¬†"
freshman mcb major schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14he1z2/freshman_mcb_major_schedule/,2023-06-23 17:07:19,"thoughts on this schedule?

I had Alexis Shusterman for chem3BL and I really enjoyed learning from her. I also had Michelle Douskey, she's taught chem1AL for a while now and knows how to teach it well. Usually chem1a isn't too bad. Having lab in the middle of the day is also pretty ideal. The only thing I dislike about it is the 9am lectures, but if you're an early riser you should be fine (if not, lectures are typically recorded iirc).

I can't speak about the other classes since I've never taken them. But Math1A is just Calculus up to derivatives I think? So it's pretty easy. 

Overall, I think this is a good first schedule for a freshman (13 units), you have a lot of time free in the evenings for any clubs/extra-curriculars you might want to get into, you also have the flexibility to take most decals if you find yourself interested in them. Another perk of having evenings free is that most midterms for Chem1A are at like 7pm? You also have this big chunk of time in the middle of each day for lunch, Office Hours, etc.

Hope this helps :)
Typical for very 1st semester. Have backup discussions/labs ready for chem and math. These fill up quickly during enrollment time.
extremely standard schedule
Schedule looks fine to me. I just want to mention that for some people (namely myself) I find it really hard to focus when I have random gaps in my schedule. I had a lot of 1 hour breaks in between my schedule during my freshman year and it was honestly the worst since I personally could not seem to do anything productive during that 1 hour gap between classes. So if you‚Äôre that type of person, I‚Äôd recommend trying work around that.

Also, for your math class, I know MCB prefers Math 10 series since it teaches stats and stuff, but to my knowledge Math 1 series is accepted by more majors so it might be easier to swap majors if that‚Äôs something u want to consider. Maybe take a look at the course load/topics and compare between Math 1 and Math 10

Also a freshman! How did you check your enrollment time?
Douskey is great for 1AL, the schedule seems doable but stacking math and chem may be challenging, I got a NP in 10a my first semester but I‚Äôm not sure how the rigor of 1A compares. Good luck!
Looks like you are ending up jobless after college
this helps soo much üôèüèª thank you
which class would you say is more popular, 16A or 1A? i got screwed over with a 12 pm enrollment time
if you go to cal central, you should see your time next to phase 1 under the ‚Äúmy academics‚Äù tab
how üò≠
that‚Äôs not even a bad enrollment time üíÄ
It‚Äôs not a matter of popularity, it‚Äôs major dependent.  If you‚Äôre contemplating at all being in any of any math heavy majors - CS, DS, Stats, Math, IB, MCB, Chem, Physics, any Eng or Chem major, don‚Äôt even think about the Math 16 series. You pretty much eliminate yourself from those majors once you take this series.
Depends on your major. 16a is lighter but most advise 1a being accepted by most majors and grad schools.
ah i see now, thank you! I got 12:20 üòì
Troll
i‚Äôm gonna be on a flight at 12 pm üíÄ
i‚Äôm premed so 16a works but i was asking in terms of how fast the classes fill up
Get Wi-Fi on the plane if you can
Freshman enrollment is assigned for two days. Halfway into the first day, your desired discussion & lab may be full so will have to look for different time slots. By the 2nd half of the 2nd day I believe the waitlist is available only."
Will I manage?,https://i.redd.it/8mcc59lx1sbb1.png,2023-07-13 11:41:15,Will this be manageable for a freshman? I'm tryna maintain a 3.5gpa or above as well.,"If I see another redditor that's gonna say that this is doable, I swear to fucking god. This is not doable under any circumstance if you consider you mental health, a balanced life, and a guaranteed higher GPA a key priority. You're gonna have to work on Physics 2 hours a day, Chemistry for an an hour and a half, math for an hour and half, and english for about an average of an hour a day. Please save Physics for another semester and protect your GPA. Only your grades show up on your transcripts, not how fast you finished your techs.
What's your major
background is kinda important especially because a bunch of those are weeders. if you're willing to spend all of your time outside of classes doing busy work you could take a shot, personally i'd save physics for another sem.
What would you recommend replacing physics with? Physics was a backup to engineering 26, I'm WL'd on that. Chemistry I just want to do as well. Also thanks for an honest answer I was thinking it's too much, just got no idea how hard anything is.
Applied math with a focus on engineering or astrophysics. I'm undecided so I'm doing as many prereqs as I can while staying in the unit limit.
Physics is a replacement for engineering 26 since I'm on the WL for that at spot 5. I'm hoping that I'll be able to get it instead.
Either a 1 unit decal course or an easy elective that can help satisfy your AC requirement. I'm also telling you this without knowing your overall plan in terms of either finishing some stuff early or if you wanna front load classes to accomplish some research down the road. Regardless, chemistry, math, english and some other bullshit class is already enough. I also want to take the moment to say that in this sub, ppl always say that something is either ""doable"" or ""not impossible"" but, frankly, I think alot of people are out of touch of reality in terms of what a proper healthy workload is. I think you'll do well if you earn all A's on a lighter workload, take up some extracurriculars, and develop some relationships with professors to get a chance at having research down the road. Doesn't make sense to take more techs right now.
Hm gotcha, I mean this is a heavy load but not impossible. I definitely wouldn't recommend doing physics 7a and chem 1a at the same time typically but I get you're trying to figure out what you wanna do. Although if you're not doing chem1AL it shouldn't be as bad, not sure if that was intentional or not. If you're more into physics then might just be better to swap out chem for something else though
i'd like my chances for getting into e26, a bunch of ppl will drop. 7a is a pretty gigantic jump in workload compared to that so i wouldn't exactly recommend that schedule. not entirely impossible but you will hate yourself.
Alright. I'm most likely gonna replace Chem 1A since I want to knock out ME Minor requirements, and physics would be more useful for my later plans."
