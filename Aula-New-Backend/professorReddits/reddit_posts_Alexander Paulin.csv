I love Alexander Paulin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zkl20s/i_love_alexander_paulin/,2022-12-12 19:31:16,This is all. What a top notch professor.,"Seriously. Dude is giving us 100% on all the quizzes and is so supportive of his students. I'm so happy I took my first college calc course with him.
first math professor that’s ever cared about me even though we’ve never had a face to face conversation
Berkeley genuinely doesn’t deserve him. Most STEM professors I’ve had here either act like sadistic control freaks or deadbeats who clearly don’t care about teaching. He’s empathetic without being condescending, his course policies during peak COVID were extremely transparent but also very flexible, and holy fucking shit - I actually still remember everything I learned in 1B two years ago. Paulin obviously has a stellar understanding of how to structure information in an intuitively approachable way. The lecture videos on his website pretty much carried me through 1A and 54 even though I took them with different instructors. 

And then there’s the two stats classes I’m currently taking that categorically deny us lecture recordings, slides, exam solutions, and treat DSP students like dogshit.
Thank god i can watch his lecture vids for the 54 final. I don’t want to drag any professors down (they’re amazing) but it’s acc much better to watch paulin’s lecture vids
Paulin was my first ever math professor at Cal (fall of '08). I think he had just started teaching (at Berkeley) when I took his class. I signed up for H54 because regular 54 was at 8AM and mama didn't raise no fool. Except she did, because that class kicked my ass. I was so not prepared for an honors linear algebra course. 

Somehow I got a C. Big shouts to my GSI Manny whose name I still remember because of how awesome he was. 

Anyway Paulin is a genius but was always encouraging folks to attend office hours. 

Glad to hear he's an even better professor now.
he's amazing. thanking him for being so accommodating with everything after the last lecture was the least I could do
don't we all <3
oh he plays the guitar too.
🧎🏻‍♀️I love him
I feel so lucky to have had him for 1A and 1B. Does he still wear his Bowser shell backpack on Halloween?
Incredible professor.
The dude’s a legend.
Paulin very good. End statement
the 🐐
why？easy to get A？
Check our our lastest video on Prof. Paulin's acclaimed teaching methodology!  
https://youtu.be/4yFiBVc8IBw?si=phVr6eVgY0tS-M8s
I agree. I took math 16A with bamler—awful experience. I found Paulin’s website and all of his materials…and honestly just sighed because this is how it should be
y'all honors math kids built different bro, even with the 8 am regular why would you do that to yourself smh
(despite if this final goes questionably...decent, might have to ""take a stab in the dark"" or ""make a leap of faith"" for some of the problems)
idrc about grades. it's more that he's one of the few professors i've had who actually make you feel like learning and absorbing is the important part, and try their best to make the whole process of doing so as least stressful for you as possible. he's just very human, and is great at transmitting his love for math and a non-competitive academic mindset.
I’ve only watched his 2018 lecture on his website, and did a summer course, but from what I gather:

The dude cares about teaching properly by ensuring everything is explained succinctly instead of haphazardly (meaning with assumptions that you can pick up on multiple step jumps when going through problems).

He’s careful to ensure what he says is understandable from our perspective vice just regurgitating what might be common knowledge to his self.
It was a mistake. It was my first math class in college. I had no idea what ""honors"" implied in a university context. I just assumed it was going to be like ""honors"" in high school where you just get through more of the textbook. I had no idea it was a proof and derivations-based class rather than computation.

Anyway the *correct* move would have been to take regular 54 and just never attend lecture, which is what I did with 53 the next semester to great success.

My Take on Math 56 - Alexander Paulin Fall 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18eqf3h/my_take_on_math_56_alexander_paulin_fall_2023/,2023-12-09 15:47:40,"Positive

This is my second semester with Professor Paulin and I am a veteran of this school (Junior). 

For context, I am a student who takes time to learn new concepts. New material does not sink into my brain as quickly as some other students which makes me a little apprehensive when I take classes like Math 1b or Math 56. That being said Professor Paulin has figured out a way for every student to feel like they have won the battle against themselves. 

His super simplified approach to teaching not only highlights which chapters are important for the course but also important for future experiences weather it be academics or industry. For example, Math 56 has been designed to address problems data scientists in the industry feel new students coming out of college need to master. If there's one topic I'm taking from this class it's the dot-product concept. I understand not everything can be retained from a course however I do feel like I have internalized concepts much better than I would with any other professor (no matter what my grades say :)) .  

For some reason this semester I was most interested in actually learning/ understanding the material rather than just focusing on the grade I received. I found myself able to explain some topics to my friends or other people in the class which really boosted my confidence. After 5 semesters in this school, I firmly believe this is the hallmark of a professor who tries to ensure you are learning rather than racing. 

His office hours every Mon/Wed/Friday were super interesting as he would solve hard core examples which made simpler concepts very easy to understand. Very approachable as well, never felt like I was not welcome.

I also felt that the culture of the class was reflective of the culture of the professor. I don't know if this is just me but I do feel like the students in the class were much happier than in other bigger technical classes like 61A or 61B.

&#x200B;

Negative

I do feel like two exams overall was a lot especially given the amount of material the course had to offer. Maybe a second midterm to test our understanding of concepts would have been helpful to take the pressure off the final.

I wish the solutions to your turn exercises in the textbook would be a great addition to the book. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Advice to Future Students

&#x200B;

To students who have to take this class:

&#x200B;

I did not take this class with any other technical courses, and I still felt like there was a lot of material to cover. Linear Algebra as iv learned in this course is the most fundamental math used in industries like Data Science or Machine learning. MAKE SURE you use this semester of Math 56 to hone those skills. I did an internship last summer where all of these skills were most definitely applicable and could have added a lot of value to the firm I worked at. Do not take it for granted.

&#x200B;

Go to office hours and ask questions, Professor Paulin does not have a ""that's a stupid question"" kind of attitude. He understands most of us have no knowledge of what real math is and that he must explain every minute detail!

&#x200B;

SOLVE every example in the book provided, both example & your turn. Helped with the cumulative nature of the course.

&#x200B;

The exams are fair, ensure you know the procedures WELL and also remember : ENSURE YOU KNOW DOT PRODUCT CONCEPT PROBLEMS WELL!

&#x200B;

Hope this helps

OMG, I was literally going to make a course review as well. I'mma just add my perspective here.  
I am a junior as well, and am quite technically inclined, and pretty much agree wholeheartedly with the positives and negatives. Furthermore, I would like to add that I have taken EECS 16A, and have friends who have taken MATH 54, so I'm certain that this class is the best at creating a solid foundation for learning linear algebra applications.    


I spend a lot of time making simulations and graphics programming in Unity, so I'm used to googling concepts and implementing them in code. After this class, I actually understand a lot of concepts which I used to struggle to implement earlier.  


The exams are quite computation heavy, however, the books itself is very clear about the abstract interpretation of things and the geometric interpretation of things. I personally enjoy and understand a lot from proofs and found every important theorem or concept having a simple and concise proof.   


Finally, I'd highly recommend taking this course with DATA 100. All conceptual math in that course was a breeze when taken with 56. I also took this with CS 70, which also helped build very strong notions for bijections and mathematical notation  


Score: 9/10 

(9.5 if there was a second midterm, Paulin did say that it was due to logistical reasons that he couldn't accommodate a second midterm this sem.)
Kind of related but I had paulin for 1b last year and he was so damn good, one of the best I’ve had at cal. Especially during the strike, you could tell this man was putting in the work to ensure that his students still received the best education he could possibly offer. I still feel bad about the one time I got called out for yappin a lil too loud to my neighbor haha

Sung Jin Oh was a great professor too
NIKHIL BEST PROF!!
not sure if this is satire but f’(x) for derivative is not complicated at all and is taught in highschool calc
It says ""Sorry, nobody on Reddit goes by that name.""
they are talking about integration by parts, which I agree is weird; i've never seen it written that way. But it's not any more complicated than the usual stuff and is, in fact, entirely synonymous, so I do not think it is a big deal
I’m a calculus tutor, and have seen a few students use the f’(x) g(x) method, i mean it’s completely the same thing. it’s just a another way of writing the same thing, yes it may be longer to write but if a student truly understands what integration by parts is, the notation really doesn’t matter.

Paulin W professor
Idk but his approach was fairly straightforward for me to understand as someone who hadn't done Calc in high school
yes thats what i mean"
math 1b with Paulin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17bthg1/math_1b_with_paulin/,2023-10-19 13:59:40,I looked on rate my professor and they said alexander paulin was pretty good but does anyone have any tips to manage the class in general?

Trying to decide on a Professor Recommendation,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/118r0yj/trying_to_decide_on_a_professor_recommendation/,2023-02-21 22:30:40,"I'm in the process of applying to transfer out of Berkeley to another school, and I'm figuring out which professors I should ask for a recommendation. I need two, and they specifically have to be from a math or science professor. My main problem is that all my classes were huge, and I honestly don't think attending office hours every so often helped much to get my professors to notice me. I was wondering if anyone had experiences on getting recommendations from the following professors, as well as advice on how to approach asking them for the recommendation. Currently, these are my only options:

1. Alexander Paulin(Took Math 1B last semester with him, got an A-)
2. John DeNero or Hany Farid(Currently taking CS61A with them, doing alright in the class)
3. Satish Rao(Currently taking CS70 with him, could do better, but not terrible)
4. Emiliano Gomez(Currently taking Math 53 with him, could do better in the class ngl)

Thank you for any help in advance.","Paulin for sure — I’d recommend him even if you got a lower grade. He’s a genuinely good guy who would always go out to help a student 

Denero would probably not agree to write you one given 61A is such a large class, or even if he does I bet it’ll be pretty generic and thus less impactful 

Not sure about Rao but I’ve heard good things from Gomez so I’d shoot my shot with him
Thank you so much for the input! I think I'm gonna take your word and reach out to Paulin & probably Gomez. I think it's a little easier to approach the latter, since I have class with him, but how do you suggest I approach Paulin? Should I just email him, go to one of his OHs, or something else? I'd also appreciate any tips on how I should say it."

Need Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/166ynx0/need_advice/,2023-08-31 22:49:01,"I am currently taking 15 units: Math 1a, Data 8, a GE, a Data Scholars Program (1 unit) and Math 1 (2units). However, one of the classes I am taking is really scaring me (Math 1A). Mostly because I have never taken calculus ever and because I am not sure if I am shaky/need review on important precalculus topics. I took a math course this summer at Cal that covered the first half of precalculus and I got a C in the course. I took pre calculus my senior year of high school and did fairly well (B & A grade) but I'm not sure how that compares to preparing for Math 1A and if it was actually helpful, especially since I forgot a lot of it. 

I am debating whether to keep going with Math 1A or to drop the class to take Math 32. So far the content doesn't look super difficult and is stuff I have seen by am somewhat shaky in, but I am scared for how difficult calculus will get once it starts getting deeper into the semester. Is taking Math 32 a good idea or not? I am a data science major who wants to be good at math for their career and also wants to graduate a semester early (I have a lot of credits already). I am also enrolled in Math 1, taught by Alexander Paulin, which basically reviews fundamental precalculus topics for the first 8 weeks of the semester. Would this course be enough to help me succeed in calculus or should I take Math 32 this semester? Thank you. ","[deleted]
(I’m a former Berkeley math undergrad and grad student instructor.) Don’t take Math 32. You’re ready for Calculus. Just know that it’s going to be your hardest class, and the one that you spend most of your time on. Be a regular at your GSI’s office hours or your professor’s office hours (or both), and definitely make some friends in the class and study with them regularly. And keep in mind that the professor writes the exams, so do not skip lecture!

When it comes time for the exams, start studying early and do lots and lots of random problems. Old exam problems (from any Berkeley math professor) are best if you can get your hands on them, but do lots of them. When I was at Cal, Moffitt Library and the math department website used to have old exams. Perhaps students here can tell you where else to look. Also, keep in mind that exams are usually curved, so even when you feel like a total loser because you’ve failed an exam, you probably haven’t. Most of the class feels that way. 

Good luck!

Same here I’m meeting with an advisor next week to see if I can take calc at a smaller school you could do the same maybe the large class sizes for me makes it really impersonal but that’s just me
Paulin is a great professor, I had him for Math1B and he made going to lectures really cool.
Office hours and tutoring would be huge. Leveling with your professor about your obstacles and showing you're seeking help to fill those gaps can get you a long way. Professors are not solely concerned with performance: they want to see you learn something, and office hours are their way of getting more directly involved in the learning process than they can in a room with 30+ students."

No
Not ideal, see if you can either block or minimize classes on Monday or Friday. This tactic would have boosted my gpa at least .5
I didn’t see the classes but soooo early 😭
You are dumb
i took the ugba 10 ugba 88 econ 1 combo alongside cs classes last semester and it was very chill imo, just be on top of lecture for ugba 10 lol dont fall behind (id also recommend econ 1 over 2 i dropped 2 for 1.)
Prof Paulin is the GOAT
Light work
You’re currently an undeclared freshman at Berkeley?
Based on everyone who took Econ 2, they regret not taking Econ 1 with Campbell. I also took 2 class with him and they were so good. Just a tip if u still can
Pros: classes should be relatively light (assuming ur good on the fundamentals). Lectures are spread out so u have enough time during afternoons/nights to study/work/socialize

Con: there are many classes, so if you don’t have a good study habit then you will not be able to juggle them. Also you will need to wake up early, so if you’re not a morning person then this might not be good for you.

Depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are. Good luck, u got this!

Math for Physics (Upper Division),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8ov9ah/math_for_physics_upper_division/,2018-06-05 15:32:41,"Hello, transferring to the major in the fall. I know it's recommended that I take Physics 89 over the summer, but I can't because I have to work (damn rent's expensive), so I set aside time to study on my own over the summer.  I took the equivalent of Math 54 in my community college, but I still feel like I need to review since it was two separate classes and we didn't go over Fourier Series. 

Do any physics majors have any topics that they recommend I go over for the upper division courses? Though I don't know my official schedule, I'm most likely going to take 137A, 110A, or 111A in the fall.

Alexander Paulin has all his lectures, homework, and test practice online (god bless); should I just go over everything in order?
","I'm not a transfer student but have spoken to several over my time in the department and you might want to check if they'll let you out of 89 with an equivalent credit. I could be wrong but from what I recall there's a strict no substitution policy for that class. While I know it's kinda ridiculous to say that a certain class teaches the material in a way required to understand upper division physics class, it's a huge help in understanding classes after 89 if you've learned the math in a physics context as you do in 89. Even if they do let you out of it I would highly recommend taking it anyway (you can check my post history I'm not a fan of 'required' classes). It's tough but fair and really helps with the rest of the major. A lot of the courses are known for having huge gaps conceptually and this was the departments attempt at closing a few of them. 

Edit: a word
Pro tip 111A is a *massive* time sink. Also don’t buy any books for it, all the content is on their site. 

All of the classes typically do a good job of quickly reviewing the math they use. You’ll want to practice Dirac notation for 137, and vector calculus for 110. And linear algebra in general. 

They used to wave 89 for transfers who had 54 equivalent buy they stopped that last year. The material in 89 varies depending on the professor, but it will have a solid amount of Fourier stuff. This will come up in 111 towards the middle, but not so much in 110 and 137.  The Fourier in 111 isn’t bad. "
