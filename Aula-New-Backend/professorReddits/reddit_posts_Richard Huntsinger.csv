UGBA 104 SUMMER,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14dxuuc/ugba_104_summer/,2023-06-19 19:04:03,"Did anyone take UGBA 104 during summer (with Richard Huntsinger)? How is the grading distribution like? 

Iâ€™ve already checked Berkeley time but  Iâ€™m asking for personal experience & opinions so making this post.

Thank you!","95 is an A, 90 is an A-. in the summer i think the grading distribution is a little bit better compared to regular semesters because thereâ€™s no exams and less assignments, and the professor is more accessible since  there are less students in the class.
May I ask if the summer class is onlineï¼Ÿ
nope, only in person"
Thoughts on this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/2fa3uojm3ybc1.jpeg,2024-01-11 21:30:17,If I can take all these classes this semester I will be able to apply to haas this year (freshmen). Please let me know your honest feedback.,"I think itâ€™s doable
No
Not ideal, see if you can either block or minimize classes on Monday or Friday. This tactic would have boosted my gpa at least .5
I didnâ€™t see the classes but soooo early ðŸ˜­
You are dumb
i took the ugba 10 ugba 88 econ 1 combo alongside cs classes last semester and it was very chill imo, just be on top of lecture for ugba 10 lol dont fall behind (id also recommend econ 1 over 2 i dropped 2 for 1.)
Prof Paulin is the GOAT
Light work
Youâ€™re currently an undeclared freshman at Berkeley?
Based on everyone who took Econ 2, they regret not taking Econ 1 with Campbell. I also took 2 class with him and they were so good. Just a tip if u still can
Pros: classes should be relatively light (assuming ur good on the fundamentals). Lectures are spread out so u have enough time during afternoons/nights to study/work/socialize

Con: there are many classes, so if you donâ€™t have a good study habit then you will not be able to juggle them. Also you will need to wake up early, so if youâ€™re not a morning person then this might not be good for you.

Depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are. Good luck, u got this!
Bow your head, let me pray for you"
Would love to get some thoughts on my schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14wbma0/would_love_to_get_some_thoughts_on_my_schedule/,2023-07-10 17:33:56,"I'm an incoming freshman doing data science if you guys could give me your input it would be greatly appreciated! Go bears!

you have a major course, your math course, and english. i'm assuming ugba 88 is there as part of interest in haas? that's cool too. your schedule totals to 14 units which is good to get comfortable for your first semester
Hopefully your dorm is close by and not in CK, and hopefully your 8am class is not far from your dorm. Your Tuesday is going to suck if your dorm is far away, as youâ€™d have to either go back to your dorm for 9 hours, or figure out how to kill 9 hours.
Thank you my eng course on science fiction was the only one available and it seemed cool compared to the regular R1B like significantly better so I thought it doesn't matter the time rather my enjoyment although I may come to regret it yk
im in unit 3 is that close by?
Thatâ€™s not too far, so youâ€™re ok there.
Got it is it bad that i do UGBA over maybe some breadth course for L&S?
Your sched looks fine to me.  Your Calc and Data 8 lecturers are certainly top-notched."
