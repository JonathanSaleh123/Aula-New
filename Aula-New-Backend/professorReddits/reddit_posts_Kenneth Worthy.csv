Taking 2 summer online classes (Theater 118AC and ESPM 50AC) while working a full-time internship doable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v9b2rz/taking_2_summer_online_classes_theater_118ac_and/,2022-06-10 09:04:14,"Hey guys! I decided to take two summer online breadth classes – Theater 118 AC (session C with Abigail De Kosnik) and ESPM 50 AC (session D with Kenneth Worthy) – while working a full-time internship (around 40 hours per week). Have any of you guys taken these classes, and is the workload manageable? Any advice is appreciated – thanks!","espm 50AC w/ Ken is super doable, I took it two summers ago at the start of remote learning and his class was super cool. Discussions and atrendence at them were important but really the only required part when I took the class. There some weeks with a lot of readings, but you can probably get ahead super easily since he posts all the ones you gotta do at the start of the course. I'd recommend making a study guide w/ imp info from the readings. When I took it we had a few assignments, one paper about ur family, 2 of these like reading analyses thingys, & a final paper. We also had a midterm and final exam that were SUPER straightforward and super easy if you skim the readings. I'd recommend doing the readinfs bc they are super interesting. Also there were some films we had to watch, super easy. Also there were short quizzes for each lecture video and they were a piece of cake. You get a few dropped quizzes too. DM me if you want any more specifics!

Haven’t taken either of them — but if they’re breadth courses you could P/NP them pretty easily to get through. Looking at grade averages though these seem to have really high A rates so make sure to just finish the work assigned and you should be fine.
oh wow thank you so much!
thank you so much!"
