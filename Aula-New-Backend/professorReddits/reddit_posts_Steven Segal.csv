Unsafe. Offended. It's the same shit every time with these people. 

I really can't believe they justify outright censorship for those reasons. I suppose when you remove dissent by force it looks like you're always in the right. From the outside though it looks extremely hypocritical.
I'd expect graduate students to be more mature and open to dialogue instead of doing this...

But for some reason I'm not surprised
""That was followed by an acute awareness of rising anxiety and a desperate need for him to stop.” 

Emotion trumps reason when it comes to SJWs and feminists.
Grad students at a university known for promoting free speech trying to censor an established professor. Touche.

>“That was followed by an acute awareness of rising anxiety and a desperate need for him to stop.”

What purpose does this statement serve other than to imply that a subjective emotional response is a justifiable reason to censor what prompted the response. As if emotional responses and subjective desires are objective arguments.

It completely ignores the fact that our subjective worldview colors the way we perceive events. There is not an attempt to allow for the professors intended perception of what he was expressing. There is not any rebuttal to the proposition that police are being scapegoated, nor topic of crime within the black community.

Sure, there is a likely fallacy here regarding the argument of racial crime statistics. After acknowledging that, the discussion could move onto socioeconomic and cultural causes of crime. Or back to the subject of police scapegoating, which this article doesn't make clear were totally associated with the topic of black-on-black crime Segal mentioned the day before. There are arguments that could be made there,  perhaps invalid arguments, but IMHO valid ones concerning unfair projection of characterizations onto police could be made.

It doesn't seem that there is an interest in dialogue. As soon as anxiety or fear comes up for people, the dialogue has to stop and their personal responses go unquestioned.

Emotional responses are subjective people, and the SJW point of view may have many projections and distortions that color their perception of things. 

We have to be rational here, or else there is just emotionally based fascism.
It makes me sick really. I thought grad students at Berkeley would have a better idea how to have an open debate.
84% of whites are killed by other whites. Most murders are interracial. no one race is more predisposed than any other. It's offensive because those are the other big takeaways from the report this professor is referencing. it's a false equivalence to the core and serves no purpose. 
It's the school of social welfare.  This complaint was probably a class project.
Nothing in your post was relevant to the post you tried to respond to. 
Source? I'm quite confident 84% of whites don't die by homicide. I'm not agreeing with the professor or anything, just playing devil's advocate here."
