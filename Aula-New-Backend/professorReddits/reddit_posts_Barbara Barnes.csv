Has anyone had Barbara Barnes as a professor before? I need some advice please.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xdhzlc/has_anyone_had_barbara_barnes_as_a_professor/,2022-09-13 13:39:59,"Hi, I’m taking a class with Professor Barnes and I am really nervous about this class. It is GWS 129 and Some of the readings are so dense and really difficult to understand(for me). The majority of the grade is based on midterm papers and final paper. I am really nervous about that and do not want to fail! Can anyone that has had a class with Professor Barnes offer some advice please?? I don’t know what to expect since the topic for a paper won’t be known until 10 or so days prior to a midterm. I know for some that seems like a lot but I feel like I need more time since I don’t fully understand all of the subject matter. Please help!","[deleted]

GWS100AC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9sit23/gws100ac/,2018-10-29 17:10:27,"Hi,

Has anyone here taken Women in American Culture (GWS 100AC) with Prof. Barbara Barnes? I'm curious how the workload of the course is since I can't find much on it. Does anyone know where I could find a syllabus for this course , and is it an ""easy"" AC to take? It's either this or ESPM50AC at the moment, but I'd prefer to have an easier workload since I'm graduating. Or does anyone else know of a really straightforward AC to take?

Thanks.","[deleted]
Thanks, this is really helpful. Was the class interesting and or worthwhile in your opinion? And how was the professor? I like classes that don't require a lot of writing or essays so this seems perfect. We're the midterms and final like mult choice, fill in the blank, short answers, or more like essays? Thanks so much."
