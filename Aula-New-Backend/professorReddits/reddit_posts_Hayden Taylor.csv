Just got accepted for a PhD program in Mechanical Engineering!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bf19us/just_got_accepted_for_a_phd_program_in_mechanical/,2024-03-14 17:50:58,"Yesterday, I received an email from the MechE admissions committee that I have been recommended for admission to Berkeley's MechE PhD program! This is truly a dream come true! I was interviewed by Dr. Taylor, who took notice of me due to my past and present work for NASA. I am very attracted to his group's work on space manufacturing technology and, with the development of Berkeley's aerospace program, I feel I would be well poised to ""ride the wave,"" so to speak. I look forward to coming here this fall.","congrats!
