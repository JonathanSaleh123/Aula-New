Chances of getting accepted?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16z9u3o/chances_of_getting_accepted/,2023-10-03 18:24:48,"Chances at the UCs

Hello. I just decided to give this subreddit a shot. I am an Indian male senior applying to all of the UCs, but my hope is to get into Davis, Berkeley, San Diego, or Irvine for computer science or data science (and software engineering in the case of Irvine). I have a 4.73 10-12 GPA, and a 4.54 total GPA. My school does not offer AP classes, only college classes, so I have taken a 17 college classes (20 by the time I graduate), meaning I will graduate with an AA in science. As for my course work, it is mostly humanities classes for the first few years, but it has leveled off to some stem classes, like Astro, physics, calc, trig, and college algebra (in order to take the one computer science class that was available, I would need a lot of prerequisites, so it wasn’t possible in high school). For my extra curriculars, I was on the school basketball team for three years(captain last year but not as an official title), I TAd and helped students in geometry and algebra 1 for 2 years. I am in charge of funds and making money for our school dances (along with the executive decisions), the president and founder of the school coding club starting this year, the president and founder of a community service club that’s raised a few thousand dollars for Ukraine, Hurricane Ian, earthquake in Turkey, etc. I am also in the school student body thing where I have helped run a few events and introduction for new students. As for extra curriculars for my major, I was in the only summer program for computer science and explored some IT stuff. I have a web development internship where I help fix up local websites. I code websites solo for local businesses, and by the time apps are due, I will probably have 5+ done. I also have done some python courses to compensate for no cs classes, but I probably won’t include that. My essays are about creativity in html and css (because my end goal is to be a front end developer), why I did my community service club, my cousin commuting suicide and how that effected perception of life, and I need one more. Sorry for the long application. I feel like I have a lot going on but cs is so sooooo hard to get into.","r/chanceme r/ApplyingToCollege
i think you should relax while you still can and try ur best and forget the rest
You’re wasting your energy diving into this “chance me” community for applications, just do everything you can to your best ability and you’ll land at a great school. Sell yourself well on the application and talk about all your interests and why you’d be phenomenal and ambitious student here, youll get it. There’s nothing else to do.
Nobody on this sub is an admissions counselor. You’ll be happier in the long run to just shoot your shot and not get caught up in the various chance me subs filled with some of the most neurotic people you’ll ever come across
Live life my guy
ur not getting in
You’ve done all you can do hun and if it’s not enough to get accepted then this probably just isn’t the university for you. 

Everyone ends up going to the university that’s meant for them.
just apply and see what happens. Nothing you can do now… I know it’s hard waiting, but it’ll be fine wherever you end up going. maybe we’ll se you here next fall :)
There is a chance
no one here can tell you if you can or can’t get in but good luck! you got this, just submit your best foot forward as they say"
