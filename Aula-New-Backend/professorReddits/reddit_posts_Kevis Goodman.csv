"Want to take English classes, do I need to start with 45ABC?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6dww3a/want_to_take_english_classes_do_i_need_to_start/,2017-05-28 16:28:26,"eecs/math here, have most of next year free to do whatever so I thought I'd take some english classes. Read a decent amount of canon lit by myself, and i've taken 125D, got an A-. I definitely want to learn some poetry at least. Thinking I should start with some early stuff since I've mostly only read post-1800s outside of school.

Definitely want to take a Shakespeare class. Should I be taking 45ABC series first or can I do stuff like Medieval Literature, Old English, or Lyric Verse? I'm fine with reading some extra stuff by myself and going to office hours but I don't want to be too far behind that I have no idea what the professor is lecturing about.

I would really love to read Dante and Milton in a classroom setting particularly.","graduated 2016:

You can start with electives if there's a topic you really care about. That being said, the 117 Shakespeare class will get you your Shakespeare fix. 45A will give you your early stuff fix (Prof. Arnold teaches a dope 45A). only pick an elective if you know you like the topics. You list two topics: Dante won't come from English, need Comp Lit for that. Milton will be covered in 45A, but there are electives taught on him (I believe by Prof. Jennifer Miller?). 

Basically take an elective if you want it, otherwise 45A/117B/117S for early stuff. 
don't bother with 45, jump right in and take upper divs p/np - kudos for diversifying your coursework i hope more STEM kids follow your example!
You absolutely should take Milton with Kevis Goodman. I'd also recommend anything that Joanna Picciotto or David Marno are teaching. I'm not sure what the prerequisites are, but they should be easy to find online.
Don't really need to, however the subject material of 45C is typically fantastic so would highly recommend
I'll sign up for Shakespeare with Marno, looks like Goodman isn't teaching fall term and Picciotto is teaching Literature of the Later 18th Century.

Are there any other professors or courses you'd recommend?
I have not had her, but everyone I know loves Anne-lise Francois. She is a romanticist.

Eric Falci usually teaches classes on the lyric or Irish poetry. He's very, very kind and well regarded in the department; but, again, I've never had him.

Outside of the three I originally recommended, my personal favorites are pretty idiosyncratic. Geoffrey G. O'Brien was very important to me, but I don't imagine him being a crowd favorite. Charles Altieri's scholarship is incredible, but his lectures can sometimes be incomprehensible. Both of them do 20th-century American poetry. If anything on offer by Hass or Hejinian interest you, I highly recommend taking something with either of them.
