"pls, tech gods, i can not find this book help",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rngufz/pls_tech_gods_i_can_not_find_this_book_help/,2021-12-23 23:18:19,"does anyone happen to have a pdf or find this book online 4 free: Organic Chemistry: Structure and Function 8th edition by Peter Vollhardt?? I have looked everywhere, and i am poor. thank u!!

&#x200B;

edit: bro i love yall i found the book!! if anyone needs lmk :)) ","It doesn’t exist and the only online version I was able to find didn’t read properly and is essentially undecipherable. If you want the textbook for the class, the best option is honestly to go with the online one through whatever bookstore vollhardt wants you to buy it from. Don’t buy the solutions manual tho as it’s useless
Some textbooks are available free through the library. Worth double checking. Link [here](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=623949&p=4397838).
Maybe rental (like through Amazon or others) is cheaper than buying even a used or online book?
You could also look around online for a less recent version of the textbook, such as 6th or 7th edition. I'm pretty sure the content will still remain highly similar between the two.
bless ur soul thank u for ur help :,)"
"rate my schedule, advice/insights",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/192wjen/rate_my_schedule_adviceinsights/,2024-01-09 17:58:04,"hi! i am a freshman (2027) pre-med taking these classes and would like to know if this schedule is feasible, if you have any advice for the courses, or if you have reviews on the professors. please let me know!

* CHEM 3A - Peter Marsden
* Theater 25AC - Angela Marino
* BIO 1B -  John P Huelsenbeck, Michal Ilana Shuldman, Benjamin Wong Blonder, Benjamin K Blackman
* R1A
* Decal","This is a reasonable schedule in my opinion! Marsden has optional HW (you would still want to do it because the HW mirrors the exam) but if you don't feel like doing it you'd always have the flexibility!

BIO 1B is not set up like a weeder class compared to BIO 1A, but it is still a difficult class because of the memorization. The labs are fully done in-lab, so there's no lab report or anything like that due after class.

I haven't taken the rest but this seems very reasonable
Marsden is the best professorv
OMG! THR 25AC is going to be an absolute blast! I had a different professor for that class, but I had Angela for THR 119 and she is the absolute best! She’s really understanding about mental health, time conflicts, etc and just wants to encourage discussion :) Of course THR 25AC tends to be a bit bigger than the upper divs, but I’m sure it’ll be the same in terms of vibes :) Hope you have a great time with her!
hi! no advice but i wanted to say im also taking similar classes w bio 1b:) also pre med! we got this fr
Marsden is amazing! Have fun
The only note is that I believe the BIO 1B and CHEM 3A finals are usually back to back on the same day, but if you’re alright with that, then it looks good!
thank you so much!
what were your thoughts with THTR 119?
yes yes!!!
My class experience was a bit interesting for THR 119. Because of the events in October, our class discussions turned away from actual reading material. A lot of my friends in the class disliked it, but I previously felt like she made a safe space in the class and it was very nice to be able to talk about whatever. The only bad thing is she randomly drops assignments on you. Our final felt like it came out of nowhere. However, I had a lot of fun in the class :)"

First Mu-Ming POO, and now Michael RAPE. 
I definitely feel bad for him in that respect.  It's pronounced RA-puh, but that doesn't help when there's only text."

Bishop, who was naked, told police he and the woman were ""just having rough sex.""

Open Team In Dynasty Baseball League (Again),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3cvs25/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league_again/,2015-07-10 21:41:28,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. I've posted previously about a different team that was open, and a recent Berkeley grad wound up taking it. I'd love to meet more Berkeley students (maybe who are still attending, though I'm not picky) who are into baseball.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward.

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete).

Here's the team. It's in definite need a rebuild, but there are several awesome core pieces (Cole, Wacha, Trout, Abreu) to build around or trade away for a haul depending on your strategy:
