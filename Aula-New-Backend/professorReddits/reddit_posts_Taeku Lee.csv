PS167AC with Taeku Lee?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fzm0mx/ps167ac_with_taeku_lee/,2020-04-11 17:00:14,"I'm a poli sci major looking to fulfill my AC requirement before I graduate in the Fall. Has anyone taken or know anything about PS167AC ""Racial and Ethnic Politics in the New American Century"" with professor Taeku Lee. His rate my prof doesn't look great but the content of the course looks intriguing. Can anyone help a fellow bear out?",
"The Asian-American population's growth in the U.S. is far exceeding that of any other demographic group, says Cal political science professor Taeku Lee. Not only are their percentage of voters climbing, but they're increasingly Democrats as well, especially in battleground states.",http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/28/trump-risks-alienating-asian-americans-a-rising-voting-force.html,2016-07-28 22:02:10,,"It's very diverse though.  Both between ethnic groups and by generation.  There are plenty of older folks who vote very right wing - hell the Philippines voted in super-Trump.  But their children are overwhelmingly democrat, probably correlates well with education.  Also, some groups (like Japanese) are much more involved in politics in general than others.

But yeah, I think the AA growth by percentage has been the highest since the 00s.  Mexicans/latinos still win by volume though.
And yet, Asians are the least likely to vote minority
I'd like to see that statistic broken down by state. Asians are especially concentrated in solidly red/blue states with already low voter turnout like California, New York, and Texas."
