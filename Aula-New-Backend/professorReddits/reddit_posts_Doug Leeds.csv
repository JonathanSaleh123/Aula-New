ENGIN 183A. Its 1 unit, pretty straightforward and the first class isn't until next week
public health 142 is four units and is spectacularly easy. integrative biology is also four units and, provided you took biology in high school, will be the easiest class in the history of your degree.
Definitely look into decals!
