Psych 166AC and Psych 136,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gwbo2k/psych_166ac_and_psych_136/,2020-06-03 23:12:51,"Has anyone taken the following courses:
Psych 166AC Cultural Psych with Sarah Gorchoff
Psych 136 Human Sexuality with James Mchale

If yes, can you please give me an overview of the class, possibly the syllabus, how the exams look like, about the professor, and/or what I should take notes about the class?
I’m an incoming transfer this Fall and I don’t have much resources to look at about Psych. If you also have Psych classes reco, that’d be great. 
Thank you!","TIL about Psych 136, what a fantastic meme class"
