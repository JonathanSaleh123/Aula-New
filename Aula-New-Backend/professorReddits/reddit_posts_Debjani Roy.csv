Chem 3BL: What are your thoughts on the class?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18os8u7/chem_3bl_what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_class/,2023-12-22 15:42:05,"Instructor Dr. Debjani Roy. Would love to hear about your honest experience in this class, estimated workload as well as tips and strategies for navigating the course.

&#x200B;","I feel like your experience really depends on your GSI. I had her for 3AL and 3BL and I enjoyed 3BL a lot more because of my GSI. However, labs were fairly straightforward, try to pick an efficient group so you can leave early or finish your lab in class. Dr. Roy is extremely picky with grading and points, so try to go to OH in order to maximize your points. Those 1 or 2 points off every lab really adds up at the end. And she does not round lol, left me with an A- twice with a 92.5-6 grade ;( but otherwise, she’s really nice. Also, attendance is mandatory for lecture.
I had this prof w/ both 3AL and 3BL. I love her! Her class note and slides & instructions were clear and easy to follow. As we were taking 3AL, there was a strike among GSIs so the final is online and she offered extra credit. She also told us no need to do notebook prep or no need to do the data analysis to release the pressure on assignments when it was midterm season(love that). When it comes to 3BL, there's a lot of NMR and you can just go to her office hour where she would love to help you answer that and to tell you the right answer. Both are easy A+(sort of), so definitely recommend taking lab classes with her.
Is attendance mandatory for the section you’re enrolled in, or can I go to the other section’s lecture?"
Chem 3BL Lab Final,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/183za3k/chem_3bl_lab_final/,2023-11-25 17:36:00,Anyone have advice on how to prepare for Chem 3BL Final (class is taught by Professor Debjani Roy)? Just a bit worried because have heard her final is pretty hard.,"I'm also preparing for it - I've been going through the practice final she gave, as well as annotated lecture notes to make sure I get the concepts down.
Make sure you review all the concepts she goes over in the final review lecture. Go through the pre-labs and lab worksheets and be able to answer the questions from memory and know how to write out the mechanisms. I would say the final is hard not because she throws in curveballs but just because there's a lot of content."
Waitlist Position Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17jhjq9/waitlist_position_question/,2023-10-29 17:59:22,"I tried enrolling into chem 3bl when the lecture was opened and there were only 3 people on the waitlist for the lab section. Is my waitlist position at 20th for the lecture or the lab?

https://preview.redd.it/87fdk58xn8xb1.jpg?width=1988&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f70743468ad21a0c07f508165b5d28ea4bb84453","You cannot be enrolled in the course if you are enrolled in a lab. So you’ll be on the waitlist for both essentially.

Edit: I suggest enrolling in the class and an open lab (even if it’s not ideal with your schedule) if there are seats and try to switch labs later!
Thanks. So if I get in the lab at position 4, I can be enrolled automatically? Or do I have to wait for the lecture too?
So how it works if you are on the waitlist in a lab, you are added to the waitlist on the lecture, but if there are still seats left in the lecture you’ll be enrolled if you enroll in an open lab. Otherwise, you’ll remain (20th it seems) on the waitlist for the lecture. However, I believe u can enroll in a lab and be on the waitlist for the lecture? Don’t quote me on that tho. I just remember having this same issue during my first sem at berk. For more clarification, you can ask your college or academic advisor. But I recommend just enrolling if still possible in open lab and lecture and then switch later bc many people drop"
BERKELEY LOWER DIV CHEM COURSES REVIEW,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18oomdn/berkeley_lower_div_chem_courses_review/,2023-12-22 12:51:30,"Here are my thoughts on the lower div chem courses I've taken at Cal. Hope this helps for anyone who's looking for insight! I know I was looking for something like this before I took these courses. Hopefully this helps.

If you have additional insight to add to mine, ADD IN THE COMMENTS. ALSO, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS! I'm happy to respond.

CHEM 1A (Prof Alexis Shusterman):

Took AP Chem in HS but struggled with it so I was really worried to take gen chem at Berkeley especially after everything I heard about it. However, Chem 1A quickly became one of my favorite courses here. Dr. S explained every single concept clearly and in a fun way. I genuinely enjoyed going to her lectures. Even when the content was difficult, she found a nice way to dumb things down and make difficult concepts understandable. Dr. S is genuinely one of those professors who WANTS students to succeed/do well in her class. The course has a lot of ""free"" points built in: discussion quizzes that are based on completion, HW sets with drops that are very doable esp if you go to OH, attendance/participation pts, etc... I was amazed by the fact that Dr. S responds to every. single. ED post. in a quick and detailed manner. Highly highly recommend you go to office hours because she does not judge you for not understanding something and will find different ways to help you until you get it. Actually makes an effort to remember your names too.

In terms of exams, they are somewhat challenging but doing the many practice exams that are provided helps immensely. Note that GSI's are also very helpful with exam preparation. If you attend lecture regularly, go to OH, complete all the provided problems, you can get an A! This class is not curved, so you are not in competition with anyone. The entire course staff is super encouraging and will even shift bins slightly at the end to give people a grade boost.

CHEM 1AL (Prof Michelle Douskey):

This class is conceptually not too hard but has a ton of busy work. Dr. Douskey is like that funny, sarcastic, ""cool"" Aunt that's fun to listen to. But her lectures barely help for completing lab work and preparing for the experiments. The prelabs take up so much time and can be frustrating when you aren't getting the correct answers. The post-labs are thick worksheets that can easily loose you points if you do not do them meticulously. The way to do well in this class is to go to OH regularly. If you ask for help, they will check your answers and guide you in the right direction, if not give you the correct answers. I always went to OH for the post-labs so I barely lost points on the assignments. How the experiments themselves go is entirely dependent on your GSI. The lab final exam is very very fair. They give you tons of practice exams that are quite similar to the final you take. If you do all the practice exams, review your pre-labs and post-labs, you will do well on the lab final. I was pleasantly surprised when I received an A+ in this class!

&#x200B;

CHEM 3A & CHEM 3B (Prof. Pete Marsden):

Took the entire Ochem series with Pete. Please please please take this series with Pete if you can. Even if it means delaying Ochem by 1 or 2 semesters. Though I got an A in Chem 1A, I struggled so much with Chem 3A. Ochem is so different from Gen Chem (you cannot compare). You can be amazing at gen chem but then have a really difficult time with Ochem, and vice versa. There's so much visualizing, 3-D manipulation, application, and memorizing reactions/reagents, etc... Midterm 1 in Chem 3A is very doable (I and most people did well on it) because it's mostly fundamentals and does not get into the meat of Ochem. However, post-midterm 1 the content gets challenging fast. If you fall behind like I did, the consequences are detrimental. It's so hard to catch up and understand what's happening because the content builds as you move forward. I had a rough time with the second midterm and final for 3A (nearly failed), yet still managed to get a B in the class.

In Pete's classes, he does weekly quizzes at the start of the Tuesday lecture on the material from the previous week. In 3A, I failed most of these quizzes. Even with doing terrible on Midterm 2, the final, and almost all the quizzes, let me repeat: still got a B. This would not have been the case with any other professor. The amazing thing about Pete is he gives you so so much extra points. For the midterms, he includes anywhere from 5-15 extra credit points. For the final, he includes anywhere from 15-30 extra credit points. The quizzes: sometimes he automatically adds an extra credit point or 2 if the class does poorly. After the first and second midterm, there's an exam analysis assignment that enables you to get anywhere from 10-25 percent of the points you missed back (depends on how the class does overall). He also will use your final percentage for one of your midterms if you do better on the final (clobber).

Let me make it clear: if you turn stuff in, go to section, and put some effort, you will pass. It's almost impossible to fail his class. There's so many other ""easy"" points included in your grade. You get points for going to a certain number of discussion sessions and simply uploading your notes afterwards. He does ""post lecture worksheets"" after each lecture that are submitted to gradescope. Though these are annoying to submit by the EOD for each lecture, they are free points if you go to OH to check your work/ask questions and are entirely based off the lecture.

I personally went from struggling in Chem 3A to doing really well in Chem 3B. Chem 3B is wayyyyy easier than 3A if you take it with Pete. Content is so much more digestible and actually makes sense when you look over it for a second time. Ochem clicks for more people by now, you've passed the learning curve. The reactions are more interesting. The midterms are more fair than 3A imo. The exams are still difficult and I wouldn't call this class ""easy"" per say, but it's definitely more doable than 3A. 3A is a lot of orbitals and 3D orientations (Pete loves these for some reason) but 3B is more about learning straightforward arrow-pushing mechanisms (you'll know what I'm talking about once you start ochem).  Almost everyone does better in 3B than 3A with Pete. The thing with Pete is that he uploads these super long homework sets that are optional and not turned in. So you will probably try to avoid these. However, these problems are so important for doing well in the class. If you do them, you will do better on the quizzes and exams. The other thing with Pete is that he uploads plenty of practice exams for each exam. Sometimes he will use the same exact format, maybe even reuse the same question, so it is extremely important that you go through every.single.practice exam he provides. Pete's lectures follow a chalkboard style and are very clear/structures. He dumbs things down for everyone (sometimes so much so that he overcomplicates it lol). But he includes a lot of jokes and is so so quirky that lectures are not bad at all. He's actually a good teacher/lecturer. Very fair. Wants you to do well if you use his resources. Can be a little passive at times and I've heard he can get mad in OH, but no doubt the best option for Ochem at Berkeley! Bottom line: take Chem 3A/3B with Pete.

CHEM 3AL (Prof. Katie Blackford):

She's a new professor so her lectures are not the most seasoned BUT she's so accommodating and so helpful. 3AL pre-labs are no where near as time consuming as 1AL pre-labs. Her lectures are somewhat helpful for the pre-labs, experiments, and post-labs. Lecture attendance was not mandatory when I took the class, which was nice. The post-labs are 1-2 page worksheets that you do in the lab and submit by the end of the lab time. Though this can be stressful sometimes, they are mostly recording data and just a few analysis questions. The GSIs can help you and you have everyone around you to run your answers by. Notebooks that you prepare with the procedure/data tables/safety are not checked in detail either, so you do not have to put much effort into them. The workload for 3AL is sooo chill compared to every other chem lab. It's not time consuming at all. The labs can be long and tedious sometimes, but you're never graded on your technique or actual performance within the lab so it does not matter. Her lab exam was harder than the 1 practice exam she provided, but she moved grade bins generously. I barely watched her lectures but after studying the post-labs/pre-labs and doing the practice questions, I did fairly well. You do not have to worry about this class at all. If you try your best, do the work, and study hard for the final, you will get an A.

&#x200B;

CHEM 3BL (Prof Debjani Roy):

CHEM 3BL is definitely more work than 3AL but less work than 1AL. The pre-labs are 2 page worksheets graded on accuracy, but some of the answers can be found in lecture and the questions aren't too bad. The post-labs are 4-6 page worksheets that involve data recording, drawing mechanisms, predicting products, answering analysis questions, and NMR. This class is soooo much NMR. You will get sick of it after analyzing spectra for each lab. Please take the time to understand NMR if you didn't at the end of 3AL because you will need to know it for this class. It is the core of the class. She gives you 3-5 days for the post-labs (depending on the lab), so you have time to check your work. Certain GSI's are not helpful in OH but some are, so it's up to you to find the ones that will help you with answering questions on the post-labs and pre-labs. You have to prepare a notebook with procedures, safety, a reaction table, and recording data for each lab. Unlike other labs, you have to submit screenshots of your notebook after each lab on Gradescope. These notebooks are graded very strictly. They look for specific observations and details. The thing about 3BL that's annoying is the grading is very very knit picky. They will take points off for the smallest things and these points add up. If you want to do well in this class, you need to spend a lot of time making sure your submissions are perfect/accurate/not missing anything. Lecture attendance is mandatory since there's iClicker, which is annoying. But the lectures actually help for the experiments. She goes thru experimental techniques, Ochem concepts, and helpful NMR tips. She uses iPad notes for lecture and her handwriting is unfortunately hard to read. She packs so much stuff into the lectures and moves super quickly so her lectures are hard to digest. I could never follow along in the moment. She uploads pre-recorded lectures tho on Youtube, which are actually more helpful because you can pause. The lectures are not bad overall. I will say tho... Dr. Roy is such a nice and helpful person! It sucked that we had to take our lab final the Monday after Thanksgiving break due to room availability but Dr. Roy made an effort to offer extra office hours (even a zoom one the Saturday after thanksgiving break so she could offer more help for the final). She is so quick to answer questions people post on discussions and to emails. She will go the extra mile, even staying extra time after lecture/OH if needed. She was funny at times and so approachable. The lab exam was incredibly fair. She provided two practice packets and a study guide too which made studying very doable. She even included extra credit on the final. Was surprised to get an A+ in this class. It seems daunting because it's so much work but if you put in the effort and study hard for the final, it's not a hard class at all.

Long live Dr. S
this is so facts about 1al being a ton of useless work lol
Dr. S is my chemistry hero
Yes. The actual midterms and practice tests are basically copies of each other!"
