nooo I heard she was great and to take one of her classes!!
Hey, that's cool. I know not everyone will have the same opinion of her, and I can kind of see what you mean. But I took IAS 115 before all the videos and the #globalpov tweeting (she didn't allow any electronics in class at the time), and that class, which I walked into basically by chance because I was looking for a interesting class to fill a Tu 3:30-5 gap, spurred me on to do the whole GPP minor. That class, for me, was an emotional roller coaster - in my mind, 'holy shit things are so entrenched in this system, how can we possibly change anything' constantly switched places with 'hey, people are doing things to change this, and they might have started out as small first steps but their effect is getting bigger all the time'.
It was definitely a teacher oriented lecture style.  Every story and lecture was somehow about her.  

Thats not to take away from what she has done and those that she has inspired.  
For sure. And if it inspired people like you to serve people through the minor, she's definitely doing something right!
Right, she did an amazing job getting people to support her cause, and to inspire them.  It wasn't so awesome when you are already highly invested/knowledged in the issues.   "
