"Course Review (Sp23): MCB 102, Physics 8B, Theater 109",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13m659s/course_review_sp23_mcb_102_physics_8b_theater_109/,2023-05-19 13:01:45,"Howdy :) It's that time of the year again, phew what a rough semester. My roughest yet. If you have any questions feel free to pm. As always, these are just my opinions and experiences, I am only one person and there are lots of other people with other experiences! Background on me: pre-med, declared MCB.

Physics 8B (Bordel): 6/10

* I'm still terrible at physics. Ugh. 
* This course is all about putting in what you want, so please go in person, ask questions, engage. She was very transparent with us about grades the entire time and updated us often. 
* Prof. Bordel is nice and a pretty good lecturer. Where I felt the lectures were lacking is in the connection of topics. Unlike 8A, 8B has a ton of more discrete/unrelated topics between which there isn't really a smooth transition. This made it very confusing to understand and retain the concepts. You need to go back and review tons of the old material, or you will fall behind and get left behind. 
* \*Make sure to do all practice exams that you are assigned by Prof Bordel and GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS!\*
* Workload is moderate but on the higher end. Weekly homework (w/ one drop) using online software, you get multiple attempts to get the question right. Get as much of these points as possible as a small cushion to your grade.
* Short weekly quizzes testing basic theory (1-2 mcq questions), get them right, it will help cushion your grade.
* Why I rated this course a 6 and not higher was because the exams were quite tough and the homework didn't necessarily match the nature of the problems on exams. I believe more practice material written by Prof Bordel would have been really helpful.
* I didn't really bother reading the textbook, just focused on lectures.
* Discussion sections (while we still had em) were somewhat helpful. I personally didn't feel super supported in discussion, so I didn't go. I'd elect to go to the professor/GSI's office hours instead. Also, go to head GSI reviews before midterms! They are intense but great practice/reality check.
* Course is curved - I believe roughly a 77% was an A- for this semester. Not easy though.
* There are 2 midterms and a final. All exams are multiple-part, word problems with free response. Partial credit saved me a lot.
* Final was very, very tough. Average was a 46%, which kinda shows how tough it was. 

MCB 102 (Yildiz, Miller, Wilson) - 5/10

* My, oh my. I have been humbled. 
* Light to medium workload - homework assignments for each section differ based on the professor. For the first professor, he chose to make homework optional and the ten points went to the exam (so the exam was out of 110 instead of 100). 
* 3 midterms (100 pts each for each section) and no cumulative final! You just take the third midterm during the time dedicated for finals. 10 assignment points for each section, for a total of 30 points. 
* Professor Yildiz and Professor Miller both lectured in person, which was great. But Professor Wilson chose to have us watch recorded lectures and did some synchronous in person ""review lectures"" - I wasn't a fan of this because the recorded lectures were definitely more than 50 minutes and were super dense. For section 1 (Yildiz), review your general chemistry and memorize amino acids. For section 2 (Miller), make flashcards to memorize those crazy pathways and review all those horrible ochem mechanisms. For section 3 (Wilson), memorize literally everything AND do the practice exams because they matched the real thing very closely (some freebie questions). Section 3 had the easiest exam because the exam matched the practice ones almost exactly, but he does love asking about small details. 
* Keeping up with lectures during part 3 was tough because it was asynchronous. Don't fall behind! 
* Not much practice given, but whatever you do get, make sure to do it. I'll say it again: MAKE ANKI FLASHCARDS AND MEMORIZE YOUR STUFF. You cannot procrastinate in this class like you might have for other pre-med classes, this one needs to be reviewed constantly so that information sticks. You can't cram!
* I took notes directly on the lecture slides (which I downloaded to my iPad).
* Go to discussions and do the work. Go to each section's review sessions. 
* Class was curved, but no final bins released and midterm 3 stats not provided. Rough bins after the first two midterms suggested that an A- was 1 STDEV above the mean (which is pretty tough). 

Theater 109 (Moran) - 10/10

* Great class. Michael's class taught me a lot about acting, no homework other than memorizing lines and practicing scenes outside of class. Audition for this class, get in, and take it. You won't regret it.
* ""Final"" happened during the last class before dead week - we perform two scenes with our respective scene partners. 
* Acting classes at Cal are always so much fun and underutilized.","I absolutely love your in-depth course reviews. Thank you for these!!
yooo this sem was so hard fr, but omg mcb 102 was a ride, ur review was spot on!! The third unit wasnâ€™t that hard like material wise but I just hated that everything was asynchronous, it made learning so hard ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

congrats to being done with a hard semester, u deserve an amazing summer :)
Youâ€™re the best for making these! Fr!!
