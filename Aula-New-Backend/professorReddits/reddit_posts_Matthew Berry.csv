Share your experience as a media studies major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/143epkf/share_your_experience_as_a_media_studies_major/,2023-06-07 07:26:34,"I am wondering if I should declare a media major, is it hard? 

Are there a lot of in-class essays? I would like to know if there are any nice or relatively easy classes or teachers. 

also please tell me the hardest and easiest of the three concentrations.","easiest major imo lol and im a ms double major, no in class essays beyond some finals
Only in class essays I did were for the midterm and final.
I reckon there isn't much in-class essays.  I was a philosophy major and I don't recall a single class essay we had to do.  All of them were take-home.
easy major, but it is very theoretical, rather than practical. all essays are take home.
Thanks! Are there any nice professor?
Thanks for sharing! Which class included the in-class essay? I'd be glad to know your teacher.
tbh theyre all nice and enjoyed all their classes except for dr. jha
Media 111B with Mathew Berry has been the only one! There is a midterm answer key and study guide somewhere on the web. I think it was on course hero. I studied both of these for ~ 1.5 hours x 2 days by doing flash cards of the concepts (also can be found online). Then the morning of, I studied around 45 minutes and got a A- on the midterm. Very similar questions to what was found on course hero.
Only read negative stuff about Jha

Do you have tips to succeed with her?
Thank you so much!
Do you have tips to succeed in final exam in 111b? I heard it has essay. Does midterm exam have essay too?
Matthew Berry in general; for 112 as well.
rely on ur gsi, dont go to class as its a waste of time, ctrl+f lecture slides
If you know of any good professors, please tell me
Appreciate you!
Media Studies is super interdisciplinary so there are only 5 classes you absolutely need to take from the Media Studies major. There is MS 10, 111, 112, 113, 114. All of these classes only have one option for professor AFAIK with the exception of 112, which alternates between Matthew Berry and Ian Davis each semester. Other than that, 10 is taught by Josh Jackson, 111 is taught by Berry, 113 is taught by Meeta Rani Jha, and 114 is taught by Davis. 

As far as concentrations go, they are all about the same difficulty. I don’t have numbers to back this up, but it seems the majority of students are in Digital Studies, followed very closely by Media Policy and Law. I’ve only met a couple students in Global Cultural Studies.

For picking a concentration, it honestly just depends on what you want to do after graduating. Digital Studies is the most general. Personally, I would only pick Media Policy and Law if you are planning on attending law school because I assume jobs for media law are limited if you don’t have a law degree. 

Look through the classes for each of the concentrations and just figure out what you would be most interested in. Part of the requirements for graduating is that in addition to the 3 courses from your concentration, you have to take 2 additional courses from any concentration, so you can create decent overlap if there are classes you’re interested in not from the concentrations you picked.
