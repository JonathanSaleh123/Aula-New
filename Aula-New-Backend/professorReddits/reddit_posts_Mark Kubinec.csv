Courses Over the Summer for Freshman Premed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/131bh9h/courses_over_the_summer_for_freshman_premed/,2023-04-27 16:46:34,"I'm a prospective freshman at Cal and I'll be majoring in Microbial Biology at Rausser on the premed track. I was looking to take 1 or 2 courses over the summer in order to meet some of the gen-eds earlier on so that I can take a lighter load in the fall. Would you advise this strategy and also what are some good ideas for courses to take? I was looking into Chem 1A as I'm taking AP Chem this year and felt that I'd have a good background for it, but I was wondering if the instructor (Mark Kubinec) would be a good teacher and also if taking the class in the summer would be too fast of a pace to truly learn and get a good grade? Any advice would be really appreciated!!","Just enjoy ur summer! Take a long break before the never ending grind ✨
Maybe take Chem 1A in the fall so you can see what the class is like, and then you can take a Premed class next summer. Chem 1A is really fast paced. 
I would say rest up before the fall too because you’re in for a ride. But if you want to get started on your classes I would recommend taking courses that fulfill one of your college requirements(3-4 units), and a 2 unit course on something of your interest (if you want to fulfill the 6 unit FAFSA summer requirements.) I took an Interview Skills 2 unit class over the summer that was really helpful towards resume and professional skills.
 current cal premed here. if i were to take classes during the summer before my freshman year, it would prolly be either one of the r&c classes (virtual if possible) along with a breadth maybe
Totally get that lol just tryna weight out my options:)
Awesome tysm!! Would u mind it if I dm u w some more questions?
The pre med classes are truly on one here. So yeah I say try them out and learn your college  studying mechanisms before embarking on that summer journey
Yes u can, glad to answer your questions :)"
