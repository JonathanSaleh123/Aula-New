Philosophy 133?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rdpbfh/philosophy_133/,2021-12-10 18:27:00,"Hey bears,

Has anyone taken Philosophy 133? I'm thinking about taking it P/NP for my philosophy breadth next semester, but I just saw that the prof highly recommends a background in logic or philosophy; I have neither. Would you say I could get a P reasonably easily? My other classes will be keeping me pretty busy as is.

Seth Yalcin is teaching it this semester. Thank you!","Philosophy of language is pretty difficult. We went over some phil of language type material in a different class I’m taking right now, and I (and many other students) struggled with it as philosophy majors. I’m sure the class will be doable, but I don’t think it’s gonna be that easy of a P as another philosophy class.
Hi! I took Phil R1B this semester and I’ve never taken a philosophy course before but I would say it’s pretty difficult to grasp the logic and reasoning behind philosophy. It requires you to think differently and question arguments. From my experience I wouldn’t take another philosophy class lol, I heard ls 22 is a fun philosophy breadth
I took it with Yalcin a few years ago. If I remember correctly our grade was based on (3?) short papers and a pretty comprehensive final with just essay prompts (don't remember if there was a midterm). I feel like grades depend on the GSI to some extent in phil classes. Ours in Phil 133 was a pretty difficult grader (he had a detailed rubric) but he's not at Cal anymore. You might get a more lenient one lol. I thought it was doable and didn't require that much of a background in logic, but the concepts can get pretty dense/difficult to understand and remember. I thought it was somewhat harder than the average philosophy class. It ate up a lot of my time, especially since the final required a lot of memorization when the concepts can take a while to grasp in the first place. I relied heavily on office hours and read a bunch of secondary sources that weren't assigned. The method that worked for me as a phil major was reading enough secondary sources on the topic until you feel like you get it and then checking ur understanding in OH. It was also helpful to read the professor's related publications if there were any. Sci hub and LibGen are ur best friends
Thank you for the insight! That's good to know.
Thank for the reply! I'll definitely keep that in mind, then :)"
