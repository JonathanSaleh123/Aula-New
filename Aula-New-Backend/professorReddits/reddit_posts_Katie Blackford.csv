How bad is this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/u59pqr8rreaa1.jpg,2023-01-05 22:28:04,,"better pack a lunch for tues/thurs
Thatâ€™s a huge L.

At least I only have classes back to back for 7 hours straight on one day of the week.

Probably better than having 2 long days of classes
Fellow BioE here, we have it horrible this semester :')
You gotta do some calorie loading before that huge block on Tuesday and Thursday. I guess that's what Monday's for.
A ziplock bag of trial mix from Trader Joeâ€™s for Tues/Thurs. Convenient, tasty, nutritious, calorie dense, and quick snack. Best of luck ðŸ¤ž
This is bad advice; however if you think you can still survive without going to discussions, I would skip some of them if they are not mandatory
â€¦ there goes your social life. Extra curricularsâ€¦ And sleepâ€¦ who needs it? Good luck though
Weâ€™re in Chem 3A & 3AL together, do you wanna start an early study group!?
![gif](giphy|gd09Y2Ptu7gsiPVUrv|downsized)
You caaan dooo ittt!!!
I do all of my classes back-to-back-to-back on Tues/Thurs because I have a full time job and that's the least disruptive to my schedule. Honestly I dig it. I'd way rather have to hustle and focus and only be on campus two days a week.
I took first semester organic w/ lab, first semester calc based physics, first semester multi, and an easy elective a semester. It was hard, but I got all A's, I had a girlfriend, and I was in ok shape. The one thing is it was at community college, so maybe without the girlfriend and/or dropping exercise you could do it?
You are going to be so sore after every Tuesday and Thursday.
agree with everyone that tues/thu looks really hardâ€” just want to add that educ 182ac was an amazing class and even though itâ€™s an 8am, you should absolutely show up! i learned so much in that class and lisa is a super engaging professor :)
You might wanna drop out after a couple of months of this torture. Best of luck, and remember to eat some protein bars and fruit during those long days
Ngl, id simply kms
I actually had a pretty similar schedule last semester. Youre going to be exhasuted on tuesday and thursday! I found myself not doing studying/hw on those long days but doing a lot on the shorter days, so if thats something youre fine doing then its managebale. Ive had a pretty heavy load every semseter and it definitely takes a toll on me and usually cased some burn out in the middle of the semester.  math 53 isnt rough but physics might take a bit of time. i just finished the physics 5 series and it definitely took the most time in my schedule each semester.
Take 170 with it
Drop 3al for me. Pretty please?
[deleted]
it fine
Seems like a pretty hefty load
that 3A lecture is gonna go hard trust
Kevin is a good gsi, that class will be fine. Everything else, youâ€™re royally fucked
Well itâ€™s not good
horrific
i think we might have the same math class and section lol. kudos to you if you can manage this schedule and i wish you the best of luck!
Yeah ðŸ˜…
So true ðŸ˜‚. Do you have a similar schedule?
Yeah, I was already thinking about skipping math discussions (besides when there is quizzes). I think I do better self-teaching myself math anyways
Iâ€™m down. Iâ€™ll PM you my instagram!
Thanks :)
And I do pack a lunch lol!
Thatâ€™s kind of what I had in mind too! But I originally was on chem lab waitlist for Wednesday, and planned to go home on Friday evening and come back mondays
Also, Ochem is by faaar the most work. For me it was over 50% of time spent studying, and the stuff you learn first semester is so important for second.
This is nice to know. Iâ€™ve been studying Ochem and multivariable on khan academy and other Berkeley professorâ€™s notes. I also took algebra-based physics in high school, so hopefully it will help with 7A. Thanks for sharing!
Educ 182 seems like such an interesting class! Do you remember what the workload was like?
Thatâ€™s what I plan on doing. Grind hw on Monday and Wednesday , and just really pay attention to lectures/ lab on the other days. Do you think math 53 discussion section was helpful?
Iâ€™m still staying open to premed, but leaning towards comp bio / biotech industry. I guess Iâ€™ll have a better idea after seeing how I do in Ochem haha
Fellow bioE junior here who had this schedule, you will die
yeah agree with the other commenter â€” workload really wasnâ€™t too bad, most of the work is reading and a few papers, which are generally pretty straightforward if you keep up. and my discussions tended to be more interactive/activity-based but that depends on the gsi you get
It depends on how your prof outlines discussions. My prof had discussion twice a week with a quiz on the second day each week. If you have a good gsi then the discussions should compliment the course material nicely. I took 54 concurrently and found 54 discussion a waste of time but skipping 53 seemed to lower my understanding so it's dependent on the gsi tbh. Good luck! Discussions are what you make of it
That schedule's rough with ochem in it. Good luck, though! You got this!
Any advice? ðŸ˜„
Pray pray and then pray again. In all seriousness, I would mostly study for Chem 3A by doing every problem set once throughout the week and once before an exam as itâ€™s the only class where actually studying will nearly guarantee you an A (though I had Professor Robak). Math 53 and physics 7A are all up to what type of question you get on the test/if youâ€™re confident with the concept.
Did you find math 53 discussions helpful?
They were useless for me. Book helped a lot
second half of math 53 was A LOT harder so if youâ€™re the same as me then you might be able to settle a lil bit into your schedule for the first few weeks without yet having to worry about math 53 yet"
BERKELEY LOWER DIV CHEM COURSES REVIEW,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18oomdn/berkeley_lower_div_chem_courses_review/,2023-12-22 12:51:30,"Here are my thoughts on the lower div chem courses I've taken at Cal. Hope this helps for anyone who's looking for insight! I know I was looking for something like this before I took these courses. Hopefully this helps.

CHEM 1A (Prof Alexis Shusterman):

Took AP Chem in HS but struggled with it so I was really worried to take gen chem at Berkeley especially after everything I heard about it. However, Chem 1A quickly became one of my favorite courses here. Dr. S explained every single concept clearly and in a fun way. I genuinely enjoyed going to her lectures. Even when the content was difficult, she found a nice way to dumb things down and make difficult concepts understandable. Dr. S is genuinely one of those professors who WANTS students to succeed/do well in her class. The course has a lot of ""free"" points built in: discussion quizzes that are based on completion, HW sets with drops that are very doable esp if you go to OH, attendance/participation pts, etc... I was amazed by the fact that Dr. S responds to every. single. ED post. in a quick and detailed manner. Highly highly recommend you go to office hours because she does not judge you for not understanding something and will find different ways to help you until you get it. Actually makes an effort to remember your names too.

In terms of exams, they are somewhat challenging but doing the many practice exams that are provided helps immensely. Note that GSI's are also very helpful with exam preparation. If you attend lecture regularly, go to OH, complete all the provided problems, you can get an A! This class is not curved, so you are not in competition with anyone. The entire course staff is super encouraging and will even shift bins slightly at the end to give people a grade boost.

&#x200B;

CHEM 1AL (Prof Michelle Douskey):

This class is conceptually not too hard but has a ton of busy work. Dr. Douskey is like that funny, sarcastic, ""cool"" Aunt that's fun to listen to. But her lectures barely help for completing lab work and preparing for the experiments. The prelabs take up so much time and can be frustrating when you aren't getting the correct answers. The post-labs are thick worksheets that can easily loose you points if you do not do them meticulously. The way to do well in this class is to go to OH regularly. If you ask for help, they will check your answers and guide you in the right direction, if not give you the correct answers. I always went to OH for the post-labs so I barely lost points on the assignments. How the experiments themselves go is entirely dependent on your GSI. The lab final exam is very very fair. They give you tons of practice exams that are quite similar to the final you take. If you do all the practice exams, review your pre-labs and post-labs, you will do well on the lab final. I was pleasantly surprised when I received an A+ in this class!

&#x200B;

CHEM 3A & CHEM 3B (Prof. Pete Marsden):

Took the entire Ochem series with Pete. Please please please take this series with Pete if you can. Even if it means delaying Ochem by 1 or 2 semesters. Though I got an A in Chem 1A, I struggled so much with Chem 3A. Ochem is so different from Gen Chem (you cannot compare). You can be amazing at gen chem but then have a really difficult time with Ochem, and vice versa. There's so much visualizing, 3-D manipulation, application, and memorizing reactions/reagents, etc... Midterm 1 in Chem 3A is very doable (I and most people did well on it) because it's mostly fundamentals and does not get into the meat of Ochem. However, post-midterm 1 the content gets challenging fast. If you fall behind like I did, the consequences are detrimental. It's so hard to catch up and understand what's happening because the content builds as you move forward. I had a rough time with the second midterm and final for 3A (nearly failed), yet still managed to get a B in the class.

In Pete's classes, he does weekly quizzes at the start of the Tuesday lecture on the material from the previous week. In 3A, I failed most of these quizzes. Even with doing terrible on Midterm 2, the final, and almost all the quizzes, let me repeat: still got a B. This would not have been the case with any other professor. The amazing thing about Pete is he gives you so so much extra points. For the midterms, he includes anywhere from 5-15 extra credit points. For the final, he includes anywhere from 15-30 extra credit points. The quizzes: sometimes he automatically adds an extra credit point or 2 if the class does poorly. After the first and second midterm, there's an exam analysis assignment that enables you to get anywhere from 10-25 percent of the points you missed back (depends on how the class does overall). He also will use your final percentage for one of your midterms if you do better on the final (clobber).

Let me make it clear: if you turn stuff in, go to section, and put some effort, you will pass. It's almost impossible to fail his class. There's so many other ""easy"" points included in your grade. You get points for going to a certain number of discussion sessions and simply uploading your notes afterwards. He does ""post lecture worksheets"" after each lecture that are submitted to gradescope. Though these are annoying to submit by the EOD for each lecture, they are free points if you go to OH to check your work/ask questions and are entirely based off the lecture.

I personally went from struggling in Chem 3A to doing really well in Chem 3B. Chem 3B is wayyyyy easier than 3A if you take it with Pete. Content is so much more digestible and actually makes sense when you look over it for a second time. Ochem clicks for more people by now, you've passed the learning curve. The reactions are more interesting. The midterms are more fair than 3A imo. The exams are still difficult and I wouldn't call this class ""easy"" per say, but it's definitely more doable than 3A. 3A is a lot of orbitals and 3D orientations (Pete loves these for some reason) but 3B is more about learning straightforward arrow-pushing mechanisms (you'll know what I'm talking about once you start ochem).  Almost everyone does better in 3B than 3A with Pete. The thing with Pete is that he uploads these super long homework sets that are optional and not turned in. So you will probably try to avoid these. However, these problems are so important for doing well in the class. If you do them, you will do better on the quizzes and exams. The other thing with Pete is that he uploads plenty of practice exams for each exam. Sometimes he will use the same exact format, maybe even reuse the same question, so it is extremely important that you go through every.single.practice exam he provides. Pete's lectures follow a chalkboard style and are very clear/structures. He dumbs things down for everyone (sometimes so much so that he overcomplicates it lol). But he includes a lot of jokes and is so so quirky that lectures are not bad at all. He's actually a good teacher/lecturer. Very fair. Wants you to do well if you use his resources. Can be a little passive at times and I've heard he can get mad in OH, but no doubt the best option for Ochem at Berkeley! Bottom line: take Chem 3A/3B with Pete.

CHEM 3AL (Prof. Katie Blackford):

She's a new professor so her lectures are not the most seasoned BUT she's so accommodating and so helpful. 3AL pre-labs are no where near as time consuming as 1AL pre-labs. Her lectures are somewhat helpful for the pre-labs, experiments, and post-labs. Lecture attendance was not mandatory when I took the class, which was nice. The post-labs are 1-2 page worksheets that you do in the lab and submit by the end of the lab time. Though this can be stressful sometimes, they are mostly recording data and just a few analysis questions. The GSIs can help you and you have everyone around you to run your answers by. Notebooks that you prepare with the procedure/data tables/safety are not checked in detail either, so you do not have to put much effort into them. The workload for 3AL is sooo chill compared to every other chem lab. It's not time consuming at all. The labs can be long and tedious sometimes, but you're never graded on your technique or actual performance within the lab so it does not matter. Her lab exam was harder than the 1 practice exam she provided, but she moved grade bins generously. I barely watched her lectures but after studying the post-labs/pre-labs and doing the practice questions, I did fairly well. You do not have to worry about this class at all. If you try your best, do the work, and study hard for the final, you will get an A.

&#x200B;

CHEM 3BL (Prof Debjani Roy):

CHEM 3BL is definitely more work than 3AL but less work than 1AL. The pre-labs are 2 page worksheets graded on accuracy, but some of the answers can be found in lecture and the questions aren't too bad. The post-labs are 4-6 page worksheets that involve data recording, drawing mechanisms, predicting products, answering analysis questions, and NMR. This class is soooo much NMR. You will get sick of it after analyzing spectra for each lab. Please take the time to understand NMR if you didn't at the end of 3AL because you will need to know it for this class. It is the core of the class. She gives you 3-5 days for the post-labs (depending on the lab), so you have time to check your work. Certain GSI's are not helpful in OH but some are, so it's up to you to find the ones that will help you with answering questions on the post-labs and pre-labs. You have to prepare a notebook with procedures, safety, a reaction table, and recording data for each lab. Unlike other labs, you have to submit screenshots of your notebook after each lab on Gradescope. These notebooks are graded very strictly. They look for specific observations and details. The thing about 3BL that's annoying is the grading is very very knit picky. They will take points off for the smallest things and these points add up. If you want to do well in this class, you need to spend a lot of time making sure your submissions are perfect/accurate/not missing anything. Lecture attendance is mandatory since there's iClicker, which is annoying. But the lectures actually help for the experiments. She goes thru experimental techniques, Ochem concepts, and helpful NMR tips. She uses iPad notes for lecture and her handwriting is unfortunately hard to read. She packs so much stuff into the lectures and moves super quickly so her lectures are hard to digest. I could never follow along in the moment. She uploads pre-recorded lectures tho on Youtube, which are actually more helpful because you can pause. The lectures are not bad overall. I will say tho... Dr. Roy is such a nice and helpful person! It sucked that we had to take our lab final the Monday after Thanksgiving break due to room availability but Dr. Roy made an effort to offer extra office hours (even a zoom one the Saturday after thanksgiving break so she could offer more help for the final). She is so quick to answer questions people post on discussions and to emails. She will go the extra mile, even staying extra time after lecture/OH if needed. She was funny at times and so approachable. The lab exam was incredibly fair. She provided two practice packets and a study guide too which made studying very doable. She even included extra credit on the final. Was surprised to get an A+ in this class. It seems daunting because it's so much work but if you put in the effort and study hard for the final, it's not a hard class at all.

Yes. The actual midterms and practice tests are basically copies of each other!"
