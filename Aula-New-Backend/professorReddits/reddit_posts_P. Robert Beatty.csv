Advice on MCB135A and MCB150,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14bdf7a/advice_on_mcb135a_and_mcb150/,2023-06-16 18:10:44,"Hi! 

I'm starting at Berkeley in the Fall as a transfer student in MCB, and I'm trying to choose between taking MCB 135A (Molecular Endocrinology) with Prof. Gary Firestone or MCB 150 (Molecular Immunology) with Prof. Robert Beatty. I'm sticking to only one MCB course for the fall since I have to take Chem 3B as well, but both courses seem really interesting and I can't choose between them. What would you recommend is best to take for the first semester, while also balancing it with 3B workload? What has your experience been with either one of the courses? I appreciate the help in advance :)","both are great in terms of content and instructor. so it really depends on your interest on the content and your schedule. also 135a is offered in fall while 150 is offered every semester
Haven‚Äôt taken 150 but I‚Äôve heard that it has a higher workload. Firestone is a great professor and the class was super interesting, so I‚Äôd recommend 135A"

no public FBI record as far as I can tell. so either the guy is a genuine scammer whose attempting to fake his own death, or the person who put this flier up is a scammer offering a fake $30K reward lol

beautiful poster though
So I live down University and I‚Äôve been seeing these signs all around the area for the last 8 months or so, and recently someone (whoever is putting them up) put new ones out. Probably within the last week. 

When you Google this guy, it says he died Summer 2022. What are these posters for? Why are they putting more up if he‚Äôs dead? Can anyone offer any insight on who this dude was and why these posters exist?
berkeley be crazy

When I lived in Berkeley, I collected fliers from campus and the surrounding neighborhoods. Some were protest-related, some were political, and some were clearly made by folks struggling with severe mental illness, like this one. All of them were entertaining though. Wish I still had them all‚Ä¶
i've been getting regular emails from an old decal ""prof"" claiming they're a victim of ""cyber rape and chi hacking"". they're often filled with ""evidence"" accusing different people they've never met. i think this is a similar situation

I saw this guy walking down telegraph on Monday!
I worked at a computer repair store on shattuck a few years back, wild dude would come in and want an air-gapped computer install because a hacker was after him.  Maybe related?  lol.  The same customer also invited me to a park one day to ""teach me about self esteem.""
At least he's not a satanist, eh?
HE ORCHESTRATED IT
Security is economics
It looks like the plaintiff (Hamilton) in these cases against Fontenot is a registered sex offender who lived in the same apartment community in Berkeley.
Your answer is mental illness.

There‚Äôs someone in Alameda County court records who has filed civil suits against this person. Could be legit cases, of course. But considering that he‚Äôs being targeted even in death, there‚Äôs a nonzero chance that the plaintiff in these cases is your poster culprit.

This got voyeuristic and macabre so I‚Äôm going to drop the curiosity now.
The only answer is he faked his death and stole someone‚Äôs identity. If he‚Äôs as good a hacker as they claim, then this is your answer.

this is amazing
whoa WHAT ?? that‚Äôs so weird üò≠
How can someone type the correct zero for 30 but somehow use O for the rest? Makes O sense
Pray more
wait what?? 
So what do you make of that
Oh wow. That‚Äôs so interesting. Thank you for some insight!
That‚Äôs what I was thinking too!! It would be so insane if he faked his death or something crazy like that. But what‚Äôs even weirder is there‚Äôs absolutely no info on this dude being a hacker on the internet. And there‚Äôs only one picture of him online, which is the same as the poster picture and the one on his obituary. Weird stuff.

"Professor Richard Muller is giving a colloquium on Monday about his Koch Brothers-funded, global warming confirming study of earth's surface temperatures ",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/m0kj1/professor_richard_muller_is_giving_a_colloquium/,2011-11-04 11:32:44,"Monday, Nov. 7

‚ÄúA Reexamination of Global Warming‚Äù
The most quantitative evidence for global warming consists of 1.4 billion earth land surface temperature measurements dating back to Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. There is useable Earth coverage from 1800 to the present, and excellent coverage from 1900 onward. There have been several criticisms of the prior analyses of these data by NOAA, NASA, and the UK. These include data selection bias (the groups use on 20% or less of the available stations), poor station quality (80% of the US stations are ranked poor by US govt standards), unseparated influence of urban heat islands, and possible bias from the adjustment procedures applied to the data to compensate for station moves and instrument changes. We have now completed a new study of all these issues. Using a statistical approach developed by team member Robert Rohde, we are able to use virtually all the data. We‚Äôve studied each of the systematics in depth, and have looked at possible driving forces other than the greenhouse effect. Our ongoing work consists of analysis of ocean data and exploratory analysis of other climate effects.""

Ugh. It doesn't make me appreciate science. He didn't recant his position. He passively misrepresented his old views for greater attention. If you read his 2008 book, or listened to him talk in the last few years, you'd know he's not a warming skeptic. Yet somehow that's what the media call him, because they like simple narratives."
anyone taken pubpol c103 (wealth and poverty) with robert reich?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9kbxsc/anyone_taken_pubpol_c103_wealth_and_poverty_with/,2018-09-30 18:19:33,how much work is it? is it easy if i p/np? it seems really interesting and i wanna take it next semester but im worried it'll be too much since im also taking cs 61b and ee 16b.,"It's 3 essays and maybe \~30 pages of reading a week.  It's really not that bad as far as classes go and at least when I took it 40% of your grade is attendance.
I've heard it's quite a bit of reading, but you can always take it P/NP if you don't want to put in too much effort
You'd have to be a senior (or a junior with a great enrollment time) to even stand a chance at getting into that class
Can confirm it wasn't that bad. I forgot to change my grade option to p/np and accidentally got an A- with minimal work/full attendance "
