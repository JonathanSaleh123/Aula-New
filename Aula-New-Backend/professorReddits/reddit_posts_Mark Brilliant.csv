Mark Brilliant Opinions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9txrvl/mark_brilliant_opinions/,2018-11-03 14:15:17,"Iâ€™m considering taking his 133B: Wall Street/Main Street class but his ratings are mixed and his class grading averages are horrendous. Has anyone here taken a class of his before? What was the workload, difficulty, and quality of lecture? Thanks :)






","I took history 128AC with him, he is a good lecturer and always has a prepared narrative and structure of his lectures, which I appreciate. He usually proposes a thesis of every lecture and proceeds to back it up. He assigns a lot of reading and he can grade papers pretty harshly, but I found his tests fair.
Roughly how many pages did you write for that class?
2 papers, first was 6 pages second was 10. Papers were weighted heavier than the exams
Appreciated."
"Thousands of academics sign petition calling for Impeachment of President Trump, several are from the Berkeley campus",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/efb3sl/thousands_of_academics_sign_petition_calling_for/,2019-12-24 19:04:23,"https://medium.com/@historiansonimpeachment/historians-statement-on-the-impeachment-of-president-trump-6e4ed2277b16

Some are authors, some are professors, many are historians.  This is the current list (at present) of Professors associated with Cal that have signed:

Brilliant, Mark - Director of the Interdisciplinary American Studies Program

Fischer, Claude - Professor of the Graduate School of Sociology

Hollinger, David - Preston Hotchkis Professor Emeritus

Penningroth, Dylan - Professor of Law and History

Rosenthal, Caitlin - Assistant Professor of History

Sargent, Daniel - Assistant Professor of History

Zinoman, Peter - Chair of History Department","[deleted]
The president has had articles of impeachment against him voted in the House of Representatives.  The impeachment trial, and therefore the actual vote regarding his removal from office, has not taken place in the Senate yet.

The petition came from academics who believe that the articles are warranted and are encouraging the Senate to vote in favor of the articles as well.  2/3 of the Senate would have to vote in favor for the president to be removed, a result that appears remote at the present given the support the president enjoys from Republicans in the Senate, who make a majority of that body."

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"
