How is Math 55 w/ Professor Sylvie Corteel?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13qvxsj/how_is_math_55_w_professor_sylvie_corteel/,2023-05-24 12:58:28,"hi! i'm an applied math + cs intended double major, so i have to do pretty well in Math 55 (get a B+ or higher in order to declare cs), and I was wondering how hard math 55 w/ Professor Sylvie Corteel is? I looked at the berkeleytime grade breakdowns when she taught, and they're pretty good:

but also a bit nervous since the average grade for math 55 is a B- but the average grade for cs 70 is a B

CS70 covers a bit more topics like computability that will never be covered in 55, and if you plan to take CS170 you will be behind the class even before it starts
you could take it at a cc

I am also applied math + CS. I took Math 55 + Stat 134 and genuinely a great pace, I got an A in both. One thing I would say is to be cautious of using 55 and 70 interchangeably as prerequisites when registering for classes, because I made the mistake of taking EECS 126 having only taken 55 and not Stat 134 yet, and I struggled harder than I should have. Another note is that a lot of the applied math concentrations take Stat 134 anyways so you will cover the whole spectrum regardless of what you take!
thank you so much for your help! would it be okay if I dm'd you if I have any more questions abt doing cs + applied math?"
CS70 or MATH55 as cogsci major w/ cs minor,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/151bi3p/cs70_or_math55_as_cogsci_major_w_cs_minor/,2023-07-16 10:06:21,"I'm trying to plan my next 4 years at cal as an incoming freshman. To fulfill my lower division reqs for cogsci, I need to take either Math 55 or CS70 but I've been hearing horror stories abt cs70 being really hard and a weed out class. I heard that math 55 cud replace the cs70 requirement for my cs minor. anyone know any info abt this or recs on which course to take?","i have the same question cog sci major but ds minor i heard math 55 is a little bit easier but honestly they‚Äôre both hard
rofl I took CS70 three times as a cogsci major and cs minor 

It‚Äôs possible to do it but at what cost üíÄ
55 with srivastava, got a b plus
I took MATH 55 with Ken Ribet as a high school senior and got a B. It's an interesting class for sure.
I took Math 55 with Sylvie Corteel, and it was a great class.
for what purpose üíÄ  


why would you do that ‚ò†Ô∏è
I was going to fail the first two times, emergency dropped lol"
