ESPM 50ac with Professor Kurt Spreyer,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/r4nvj6/espm_50ac_with_professor_kurt_spreyer/,2021-11-28 20:55:07,"Could anyone who has taken ESPM 50ac with Professor Kurt Spreyer provide some insight on the type of topics you studied, difficulty level of the course, any revelations you had by taking the course, etc!  I'm wondering if this class is more for those completely new to the subject area, or if it is still engaging enough for those who already have a basic knowledge/interest in the material.  I've heard overall good things about the class which is why I enrolled in it, but am trying to decide if I want to switch it with another course right now.  I do not need the class for any credits, but rather am purely interested in the topic and want to expand my perspective! Thank you !!","It's easy. I barely did any readings and walked away with an A.
Overall I would say ESPM 50AC is a pretty worthwhile class. The workload is pretty manageable--it's a lot of reading but tbh you don't need to do most of it (Kurt goes over the readings in Lecture and also tells you in the midterm review which readings are important). The exams are also fairly easy as long as you show up to lecture. I think the content of the class is pretty cool too--it explores the interactions between natural resources/social structures and I think it's pretty eye opening. There are 4 units: New Orleans, Native Americans/Colonialism, Asian Americans in California, and the Bay Area (at least when I took it in Fall 2020).
I also take this class. Thank everyone for the info.
Drop ESPM 50 AC if you have an online discussion. Might seem like you don't need to go to class, but really hurts your GPA.
Same here!
But as long as you attend online discussion, it's ok?"
ESPM 50AC (Kurt Spreyer) vs. ANTRHO 3AC (Daniel Fisher),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k09soi/espm_50ac_kurt_spreyer_vs_antrho_3ac_daniel_fisher/,2020-11-24 09:45:27,"i've registered for both of these American Cultures Classes, but I need to drop one.

I've heard Spreyer was a little difficult this semester, is that true?

I'm taking CS 70 so I can try and declare computer science so I want to take the easier class.

Any advice would be appreciated.","I took 50AC with Kurt a few years ago and it’s so easy. Just attend section and do the assignments and he will give u the A. Final project is super open ended and I don’t even think there were any legit exams.
I am in ESPM 50AC right now and have taken ANTHRO 3AC.

DO ESPM 50AC no doubt. It's super easy.
ESPM 50AC is great. I remember having to do a couple of quizzes, a project, and a few papers. It’s really not that bad, but you may have to get a course reader unless they provide you all of the materials now
When I took it there was an in person essay prompt based exam, but with zoom u it's probably been relegated to just something on bcourses which is much less stressful"
ESPM 167(Kurt Spreyer) vs DATA 104(Ari S Edmundson) for DS ethics,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q698vg/espm_167kurt_spreyer_vs_data_104ari_s_edmundson/,2021-10-11 16:57:48,"Which one do you think would be a lower workload? I just need it to fulfill the DS Ethics requirement, nothing more.","My old roommate took data 104 iirc and he really really hated it. Said it was more work than he expected. 

i had kurt spreyer for espm 50ac and he seemed alright (tho 50ac is known as kind of a joke). his exams weren't too difficult imo. he is really strict on not having laptops in his classroom but ppl would usually sit in the back and use them anyways

Except it gets completely full like 2 days in. < 20 unreserved seats left rn.
oh no, what would you suggest then?"
"ESPM50AC is not what I expected, for the worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5sx3uc/espm50ac_is_not_what_i_expected_for_the_worse/,2017-02-08 17:43:19,"I don't really know what I was expecting, but what I got really sucks. 

I thought that there would be an ongoing discussion about the influence of natural resources on American culture. So far, all that I've gotten is that black people suffered at a disproportionate level in Hurricane Katrina, that race has nothing to do with biology, that the United States is a structurally racist institution, that colonialism brought nothing good to the world, and that economic mobility is a myth (does this make me  a mythological creature? ᕙ(◔◡◔)ᕗ).

I don't deny many of the specific details (although I think that Racial formation theory plays an unhelpful semantic game), but I think that the scope of analysis which Kurt Spreyer and the TAs use is so narrow that they miss the big picture.

I think that their fixation on race prevents them from seeing broader themes within American society, like the fracturing of the population by class and geographic location. In my discussion section this week, I brought up the fact that the WaPo [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2015/09/03/katrina-swept-away-new-orleans-school-system-ushering-in-new-era/) education in New Orleans is better now than before Katrina. I got slammed by the TA, who I feel strongly implied to the class that I was a racist, for taking such an instrumentalist approach to education. Last week I got slammed for observing that in one sense, everyone at this school has the option of picking their pay grade when they pick their major. I think that I saw at least one girl in the class turn a shade paler than she already was when I said something to the effect of, ""if you are like me, and on financial aid, and you go into STEM, your kids probably won't need financial aid"". 

Look, I have no illusions about what I am. I'm not that smart, I transferred into this school from a community college, and I work at a 99 Ranch. I won't win any awards, and I won't graduate with honors. I'm not very good at reading or writing, and when I do enter the workforce in my final form, I'll just be a worker bee in a field where worker bees can expect to make in the low six figures after 5 years in the industry. But that is enough for me to guarantee my mom's security in the future, and if I'm lucky, the security of my wife and kids. I don't expect to love my job, but I don't think that I will hate it and being able to provide for the people who I care about is worth never being able to take a job that I love.

But it wasn't magic, or worse, ""privilege"" which got me here. It was the tenacity and discipline to make and follow a plan which involved working a crappy full time job for a couple of years while taking classes on the side, and not wasting the opportunities when they come. 

My parents immigrated to this country with my two brothers and I in 2001. My dad, a lifetime smoker, died in 2004 from heart disease. Life hasn't been easy, but it's been getting better and I and confident about the future. Had I been taught what Kurt and his TAs believe, I might have been convinced that people like me are destined to fail. But I believe that decisions matter, and that opportunities can be found if you are willing to look, work, and sacrifice. 

This is uncalled for, but maybe it is the privilege of whites from upper-middle class backgrounds to condescendingly tell ""PoC"" that it isn't their fault that they have stagnated, that the system is stacked against them, and that they shouldn't bother trying in the first place until they (upper-middle class whites), the heroes of our society, fix all the ills that colonialism has wreaked on us because we can't solve any problems on our own.

Sorry for the long and ranty post, but I thought that this class was going to be a lot less lame that it is. Anyone want to tell me where I'm wrong? Or other comments? I've given up saying anything in class now, so I guess I will continue committing my ""microaggressions"" in my mind.","The class definitely is obviously quite liberal in the topics and viewpoints it discusses, but I think you're downplaying a lot of the things taught in that class unfairly. Also, I highly doubt Kurt or any of the TA's would argue against the fact that dedicated, motivated people can defy the odds with the right choices and opportunities. An instrumentalist approach is obviously not wrong, but the class considers things in a more holistic sense, considering other viewpoints as well. You're going to Berkeley; you're bound to expect a class like this.

In any case, I don't think anyone is going to change your beliefs regarding this, it's simply a perspective thing. I actually hope you continue to voice your beliefs in that class, because as /u/nickpeaches mentioned, the class is taken by many people who just don't care enough to discuss and many who will not critically think/analyze the professor's bias.
Don't people just take this class for the easy breadth? I had no idea people actually tried to get something out of it. I imagine most of your classmates are totally fine just skating by and not participating.
Honestly, it seems like you're taking the class a bit too personally. I highly doubt your TAs or classmates know your about your Dad, or your job. Your experiences give you a different perspective. Maybe try talking to that TA in office hours about the origins of your skepticism.

All AC courses are intended to critique American culture-- that's the point of the requirement, to encourage people to challenge their assumptions and look past any biases they might have. 

I think it's likely that the professor isn't trying to teach you that ""Colonialism is 100% evil!"", or ""Poor people have no ability to improve their situation!"" or ""All people of color are stuck in an inescapable racist system!"" but rather that ""Colonialism did a lot of bad things that often go unacknowledged!"" and ""Many poor people find it difficult to improve their situation."" or ""People of color suffer in societies that view whiteness as superior. Our society exhibits similar tendencies."" AC classes normally try and paint these issues as shades of grey, rather than the absolutist black-or-white description you gave. 

Definitely talk to any instructors (the prof, GSIs, etc.) if you feel like your contribution to the discussion is being devalued. The AC program tries really hard to make sure everyone is included and feels comfortable speaking up, their staff would definitely fix the issue.
> I brought up the fact that the WaPo reported education in New Orleans is better now than before Katrina.

One thing that the Washington Post article avoided saying is that [overall spending went up after hurricane Katrina](https://deutsch29.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/buerger-harris-does-school-reform-equal-spending-reform.pdf). But even that is misleading because the amount of money spent on instruction per pupil went down. 

It is likely that the a lot of the positive educational effects post-Katrina were due to principals being able to cherry pick students and that the schools are churning through young teachers who can be overworked for a couple of years before they move on.

edit: grammar
Wow your personal story is very inspiring.

Don't give up on participating in class! Just take it P/NP and start triggering the shit out of your TA. The AC requirement is a meme anyways.
I had Spreyer 6 years ago, and I wrote in the review about how there actually isn't much room for genuine debate in the class regarding perceptions on race.

Cool thing was that office hours were held in Cafe Med at the time.
I hear Liberty ""University"" has openings if you don't want to be challenged.

There is a lot of food for thought in what you say.
I took an AC class a few semesters ago and I definitely feel your sentiment. I remember one discussion where the class was observing incarceration rates over time for a population. I pointed out some simple number manipulation (different scales, 1000s vs 10000s, etc) and was not well received by the rest of the class, because I was apparently undermining discussion (what?). In my essay about teaching a specific topic (which I won't go too deeply into because it might reveal too much about the class and upset some people) , I took a huge penalty on my grade because I focused more on consequences of teaching said topic, rather than arguing that more diversity was required to run the class. This was an essay written after two lectures, with very little material or guidance to work with.

In retrospect, I should have just kept an open mind, grit my teeth through the class and take the P (or NP, kek - but I did pass) rather than fighting such an uphill battle. Yes, it's good to have a civil discussion with your TA or your professor about a topic and I encourage it, but if you really feel futility in your discussion, just understand that it's to be somewhat expected and not every class will be fair.

Yeah I thought this was the quintessential bullshit AC course.

I recommend P/NP the course and then spend the rest of the time enjoying repeatedly triggering your TA.
I was in this class for two weeks last semester it was pretty annoying. Maybe not as bad as OP has made it sound, but I don't disagree with his assessment of Dr. Spreyer. I had a pretty cool T.A., her name was Samantha Beckerman, so no complaints on that front.

I switched into History 7B, and it was much better (clarity and depth of material) and far more nuanced. A bit harder, though.
Educated? From what the OP describes, it sounds more like propaganda. And it is disturbing. We should all be alarmed that this kind of biased, politicized content is allowed in classrooms. College is supposed to foster free and independent thought, not force narratives of victimhood and oppression down your throat. When will this madness stop?
It's really easy to avoid Kool aid just p/np and stop going to lecture

That's very progressive of you!
[No you're not.](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/american-cultures-requirement/)
No you're not, only r1a/b are required letter grade (for LS at least).
[deleted]
You can actually pass not pass so much shit. I think the reqt is that only 2/3 of your units have to be for a letter grade, although obviously majors won't count PNP for requirements. I basically have PNPd every out of major requirement I had to take all throughout college with the notable exception of r1a/b."
