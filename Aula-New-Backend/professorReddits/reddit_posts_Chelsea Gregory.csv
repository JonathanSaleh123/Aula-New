Pls help with me with choosing this class 😩,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/104ow56/pls_help_with_me_with_choosing_this_class/,2023-01-06 00:25:14,So I want to add this class but can’t figure out what the difference between LS C12 and LS C196 is. The class descriptions are the same so I’m confused. The only difference is the times. Am I just dumb lol,"I’d take the upper-division credit just cuz…

You can also take the UGBA version. They’re all the same course, just with different listings.
should prob just enroll in the 196 one for the upper division units

Ah ok I see the difference now. I am a junior so the upper division shouldn’t be too hard I guess lol.
