He does shift grade bins around based on how people do. However, he did shift grade bins *up* after the final."
James Campbell VS Enrico Moretti Econ 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jigca7/james_campbell_vs_enrico_moretti_econ_1/,2020-10-26 08:14:10,"I'm looking to take Econ 1 next semester, and not sure which professor to pick. Rate my professor hasn't been too helpful as both of them are flooded with negative comments and I can't tell if it's just students who are unsatisfied with their grades.

Does anyone have any experience with either Professor? Any insight would be appreciated! How were the tests/ quizzes/ assignments? How easily accessible are they outside of class? How were the lectures? Thank you so much!!","Took econ 1 with Campbell during the summer. 10/10 experience, great professor who is knowledgeable, a good lecturer, and has forgiving policies. Although I did take AP microecon in high school so half of the class was a breeze.
I heard that Campbell’s quizzes are very hard and he can be a harsh grader, but I’m also confused because people seem to be really split on them. I’m having a hard time deciding which econ professor too.
I’m also confused. Help will be appreciated!
yeah I'm in his Econ 101A and he's super chill, and you can get extensions for any assignments no questions asked
Thanks so much! I’m going with Campbell :)"
econ 1 with Enrico Moretti or James Campbell?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k0cow0/econ_1_with_enrico_moretti_or_james_campbell/,2020-11-24 12:08:23,"I checked Rate My Professor and both have low reviews, how was your experience?

&#x200B;

The posts on reddit for Campbell seem to be very good but on Rate My Professor it seems really bad. Did anything change? Is it really that difficult, or are the reviews mostly by people who are unsatisfied with grades?","If you do a search on this sub (look for Campbell, or Moretti), this question has been asked a lot of times
Thanks, I didn't think to check! I feel that after checking the sub I'm even more conflicted
Well, Campbell’s version is full, so if you haven’t made a choice yet, it seems like the choice is made for you already."
Econ 100A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cun49p/econ_100a/,2024-05-17 19:36:12,"I am a  new transfer student taking Econ 100A (with James Campbell) and Econ 119 over the summer. I'm not the best at math. Should I take just one course or different courses since summer is so fast-paced? 


-A very confused bear🧸","word of advice: don’t take 119 with xiangyi meng
Nah just take 100A
just took 100a with only having taken AP calc in high school 3 years ago. No econ experience. It was totally fine. Can't speak to 119 tho
100a should be very doable even without a strong math background. also, campbell is the best!
Just do 100a. If you need full time units, grab an AC course or another course for fun — you’ll want to focus on the 100a content.
100a is doable. 119 has now become more mathy so I would not recommend.
Oh no! It is with that instructor. Thanks!
how do exams grades weight?
Thanks!
I was considering 157 with Ryan Edwards, but I think an AC course will be a better choice. Thank you!
yeah, I took it with him this semester and it was possibly the most disorganized class in berkeley history. we got midterm review and hw solutions back the day of the exam; he last-minute changed the class from curved to binned, and threw curveballs from random parts of the textbook on our final even after assuring us in class multiple times that the final would follow past outlines. this may depend, but he also has an accent that makes it hard to follow lectures (it’s just him reading slides 😭)
Wow, thanks!"
Econ 100A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17ih61v/econ_100a/,2023-10-28 09:17:52,"Hello!
I am in enrolled in Econ 100A and I was wondering how challenging it was? I have already taken Econ 140 which I did okay in, but I am really worried about 100A. It is with James Campbell!
Thank you!","100a consists mostly of math problems that involve  at most partial derivatives and simple algebra. There are 3 Midterms and an essay final. As long as you attend the lecture and do the course pack for review you will do alright.
Ok great thank you!"
choosing ENVECON100 or ECON100A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/178yp1t/choosing_envecon100_or_econ100a/,2023-10-15 22:28:41,i’m an intended EEP major who is hoping to go to law school (need to keep a good GPA). environmental econ is with a prof who is unrated on RMP and historically has a better distribution and james campbell is teaching econ100A but it has a worse distribution. not sure what to optimize for in this case. thoughts anyone?,"Econ 100A
hello! May I ask why you pick econ 100a over envecon 100a? I cant decide which one to take"
Easy Econ Electives,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bvdhe9/easy_econ_electives/,2024-04-03 20:46:17,What are some easy econ electives for freshman and sophomore year? Workload/grading/professors. Anything info is appreciated!,classes with James Campbell and Ryan Edwards are solid
Does Econ 1 record lectures or are attending lectures mandatory?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15ezhq6/does_econ_1_record_lectures_or_are_attending/,2023-07-31 19:20:08,"Looking to take Econ 1 this semester, but I have a conflict on Mondays from 7-8pm. Does anyone know if Econ 1 with James Campbell will record lectures and allow me to deal with my time conflict too? I’m not an Econ major and not trying to take Econ 2.",Yes he records his lectures. Just double check the syllabus to make sure that’s still true!
ECON 100a vs. UGBA 101a,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16ycp72/econ_100a_vs_ugba_101a/,2023-10-02 16:53:37,"I'm looking to take either Econ 100a or UGBA 101a in the spring and am unsure about which would be better. I'm a stats major and will be using it for my stats upper div cluster requirement. My plan is to go into Business Ops/Data analytics and I am unsure which is more useful. Also, for reference, James Campbell is teaching econ 100a and I've heard great things, and there is no professor listed for ugba 101a yet. 

Has anyone taken either and could give me some advice? Which is harder? Which is more useful? What is the difference?

Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks ","General rule of thumb : ugba anything is easier than econ anything. 101a will cover around 85% of 100a’s material but give you 3 units instead of 4 for it. Econ classes will be more math so as a stat major you might appreciate that. Ugba classes are smaller in size so that’s a benefit. If you’re not a business major getting into the class will be your hardest battle, not the actual course
campbell is easily one of the best professors at berkeley
Hmm okay.. do you know if either class records their lectures?

Thank you for all the info btw!!
Okay! That makes it easier
he also records lectures"
Which professor impacted you positively?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1djbilj/which_professor_impacted_you_positively/,2024-06-18 22:29:28,Who are the hidden gem professors of Berkeley?,"Adhikari with data 140 💪💪
Robert Reich’s class sticks with me so much years later even though it had nothing to do with my major
David Presti is such a gem !! Genuinely a very supportive, approachable, and inspiring professor to talk with if you’re interested in consciousness, neuroscience, or psychedelic science =)
I regret that I didn’t build a better relationship with him, because Dr. Crockett in the Philosophy department struck me as a very sincere, compassionate, and positive dude. I basically did not show up to his class all semester due to some medical issues, and he went way above and beyond to help me try and finish his course. Gave me an incomplete I really didn’t deserve, and even emailed me pretty regularly to try and get me through the course after it had ended. He didn’t have to do that, and I’m still grateful for the amount of effort he put into trying to help me out (even though he was essentially a stranger). From the lectures I did attend, he was also an extremely talented teacher, and he always made a lot of effort for his students. Honestly seems like the kind of guy who just actually really does care about his students, and will go above and beyond for them. Very solid dude, take literally any of his classes, you won’t regret it.
Pete Marsden. Love that guy
Professor Paulin
John DeNero and Dan Garcia made me fall in love with men I mean CS
Trevor Murphy.
Absolutely love Professor Beatty who teaches MCB50
Professor Zook in Poli Sci, man is a living legend.
Really enjoyed josh hugs 61b
Kara Whittman just joined the English department but she is amazing. All around inspirational, compassionate and kind.
Edwin Lin, Mark Tanouye, Ivo Duijnstee, Richie Kim
If you take a Philosophy course, take it with John Campbell.
Professor Kim Shelton in the classics department was one of the most influential people in terms of helping me figure out what I was interested in, and she is such a fun professor and mentor. She is probably the only reason why I didn’t drop out in my second year when I realized I didn’t want to major in CS and wasn’t sure what I wanted to switch to.

Ani Adhikari, Micheal Jordan, Dan Garcia, and Jitendra Malik are all excellent lecturers in CS/DS and I loved their classes a lot. 

In classics/Ancient Greek and Roman studies, I really, really liked Ferrari, Murphy, Shelton (of course), and Peña. Ferrari’s class on classical literary criticism was one of the most formative classes I have ever taken.

Honestly going to Berkeley was an incredible experience for me because of the professors I had and classes I had.
papa denero
Shustermann 100%
Really only one prof in my time at Berkeley didn’t impact me positively…but as time has gone on, I’ve even learned valuable lessons from that semester as well. 

All the profs I had in the ME department had such a positive impact on me becoming the person and engineer I am today. Special shoutouts would go to Packard (🙏), Dames, Johnson, Kazerooni, Carey, Frenklach, Anwar. Also the shop guys and grad students that teach you everything you don’t learn in the book. 
Lisa Yan!! She’s inspiring
Physics department. Chieng I . When I transferred here I took his class for Quantum mechanics, but I basically failed the midterm. During class he went over the histogram of our scores, me feeling horrible over my first bad test grade, he then continued to talk about when he was in a bad position school-wise and how he overcame it. Explaining that the textbook is only 60 percent of how you learn and the other percentage is based on people. Every friend, professor, gsi, or tutor has the possibly of teaching you something you have not known, whether it be a new perspective or key idea. Once you start getting into upper-division courses there is a lot less content to help you learn, so you have to learn how to speak to people and how to read a textbook.
Naomi Ginsburg in Chemistry. A dedicated, wonderful human being.
Paul N. Hilfinger

One of the only (technical) courses I took where I still retain both the knowledge and life lessons learned

Runner up is Jim Pitman, the usual Stats 134 professor. Since human intuition about probability is so bad, he really emphasizes getting comfortable with the raw numbers and your computations with them, even if they don't ""feel"" right
How quickly people forget, the best prof at Berkeley I ever had was Professor Josh Hug.  I was lucky enough to have him for 2 classes, Data 100 and CS 186, plus working under him for Data 100, and doing research for him.  I think he’s back from his sabbatical this Fall.  I feel bad that I haven’t talked to him in 3 years, I probably should say hi.
I really liked the SLAV classes I took from Eric Naiman, who is still there, and Olga Matich, who has since retired. I was an engineering major and the first class I took was I think a breadth requirement, and I took two more from the same department because I liked them so much. 

Prof Matich had a sort of teasing banter with her GSIs, it was very entertaining. We got invited to one of these literature department paper readings where the researchers critique each others papers, and it seemed pretty aggressive to me, but that was just a critique session. It was eye opening.
Julia Fawcett for theater. Jose Ramirez for Cog Sci 131 (class was hard but office hours were great)
Lisa Pruitt in the ME department. Almost everything she taught over the course of a couple materials engineering classes has stuck with me, and i use on a regular basis in my professional career. The definition of an inspirational professor. She did not let her unrelenting care take away from her ridiculously high standards either.
Arman Catterson (Pshych 101)

Honestly, one of the best professors I’ve ever had. His honesty and reality checks that he gave us were awesome. He was such an advocate for our education and being real with real life possibilities. Always giving us resources for stuff outside of class and staying after to talk about grad schools was amazing. I have so much respect for him
Seth Lunine in the Geography department, great professor and an even better person
Thomas Scanlon, Will Fithian, Anant Sahai, Michael Ball, Ryan Hass, Ivan Danilenko
Ani Adhikari, Yun Song, Anant Sahai
Prof. Katharina Kaiser is a gem
Zachary Lamb, Chip Sullivan
Professor Samuel Otter.
Professor Celeste Langan.
Pablo Gonzalez!
Mary Kelsey - Sociology department!
James Campbell!
Ansell (political science) doesn’t get enough credit because this website is made up of elitist mouth breathing CS majors with a superiority complex.
Munis Faruqui, hands down. Great professor and an equally amazing person.
I guess not technically a professor, but Ted Moore and the other combo leaders in UC Jazz do a phenomenal job.
Etter for UGBA 131 and 137. These courses are tough material-wise but taught masterfully and Etter is one of the only professors I would actually get a beer with outside of class. Have heard his name come up in interviews and coffee chats multiple times after graduating - just a sign of his remarkable impact on Berkeley. If you are considering a career in investing or markets these are your exit tickets.
patrick russell in the theater department is genuinely one
of the best people i know
Americ Azevedo ENG130AC 

RIP Prof 🫡
Jesse Nathan in the English department was nothing short of a blessing
Andreas Glaeser and Ron Gronsky (both probably retired) in MSE were most impactful for me. Chris Dames and Tarek Zohdi in ME were also excellent.
Professor Hubert Dreyfus, RIP.
Jason Corburn, genuinely nice guy, great class (inspiring guest speakers), and his research is inspiring
Austin Hedeman! I’ve never seen someone care for their students as much as he does. And an amazing teacher—changed my life!
DAN GARCIA IS THE GOAT
Joelle Frechette, CBE 150A/B
Josh Hug
Andrew Charman. Absolute beast of a teacher but be ready to go through hell and back to get through his class. Worth it though. 

I know there's been controversy with him but I do think that Jonathan Shewchuk's CS189 was game changing for me.
Dan Portnoy - while he's tough (his bacterial pathogenesis class is intense), he's such a passionate and energetic teacher (although I wish his slides were more organized)

Alexis Shusterman - I had her when I took Chem 1A; she was so fun and energetic!

Britt Glaunsinger - she talks about viruses like she's telling a story. She should be nominated for distinguished teaching award!
Nasser Zakariya in Rhetoric. Does a lot of cross disciplinary stuff with history and philosophy of science that might appeal as an elective to the mostly STEM bent of this sub (the undergrad classes I took with him all had ample STEM students). Very smart and incredibly kind, let me take a grad class w him in my final semester and it was the most enriching class I took at Berkeley
Ethan Shagan! Best lecturer I've had. I audited his History of Religion class last semester and every class was fascinating.
love paulin
Paulin is universally loved and I agree with that sentiment
Ribet!!
Richard Huntsinger at Haas. I’ve never had a professor remember my name before and while it’s a small gesture, it impacted me a lot. It helped me get out of my shell in my classes/office hours and gain overall confidence in my academics at Berkeley. Something that as a transfer student, I really struggled with.
Oliver Arnold is the professor to take for Shakespeare, hands down. I thoroughly enjoyed my research seminar with him last semester.
Kevin Padian, Margaret Conkey 
Robert Kaufman's class on poetry is one of the only courses not related to my career that I still think about after graduating. Great guy, and his class really made me view the world differently
The One and Only OG, Prof Hilfinger
Victoria Robinson from Ethnic Studies was so inspiring. I also ran into her fifteen years later and she remembered me, which was really impressive. I was not that great of a student.
Seth Lunine! I loved GEOG50, and I’ve heard great things about his upper div class and really want to take it, though it seems to be popular and gets full pretty fast. Really caring and thoughtful guy, and knows CA and the bay so thoroughly! He slayed lol
ren ng, cs184
Becky hsu
Laleh Behbehanian in Sociology :)
Not sure if he teaches any undergrad courses, but Professor David Oppenheimer at Berkeley Law. I did URAP for the Berkeley Center for Comparative Equality and Anti-Discrimination Law, which he heads, and I have never met a more compassionate person in my life. 

For the students who couldn’t afford to work for free, he and his wife set up a fund that they paid out of pocket to compensate students who needed it. He also invited anyone who couldn't go home for the holidays to dinner at his own home for Thanksgiving break. 

On top of all that, he's a favorite at Berkeley Law (which is so hard to do teaching Civ Pro, lol), was a prominent civil rights lawyer, and has a storied career fighting against discrimination. 

The guy’s a hero in my book and the kindest soul you’ll ever learn from if you’re lucky enough.
Professor Lilla Balint hands down
Dr. Harry Edwards.  Tremendous class.  Still think about it 46 years later.
Peyrin Kao in 161 and 188, Dan Garcia and Lisa Yan in 61C, and Armando Fox in 169 and 169L.  Tbh i didn’t go to any of my nontechs so idk those profs, but presti seemed fun for a bit in drugs and the brain :))
yokotover /s
Olga Holtz
Another one is Professor Ricky Vincent! He is a Panther Cub, meaning his mom was in the Black Panther Party and he is a Berkeley local. He taught a summer class on the music of the BPP, he's also an old head who loves to crate dig. GOAT.
Same!
Yes!!!
Yeah she was my favorite professor and she was super kind
Unfortunate that he retired!
Love his class! Very relevant to a lot of the work going on on with interpretability in LLMs. I missed the final for his class because I had it written down on the wrong day and then got very sick right before the exam and was too feverish to recheck the time and he let me take it later and only docked me a letter grade for it. He was very kind and empathetic and he told me I should maybe go get evaluated for adhd which I got diagnosed with last year.
Crickett is legit
He's a mensch, for sure. Kills me he's only a lecturer.
Crockett is incredible. So happy to see him named here.
I'm taking a summer course with him right now. He does seem exceedingly smart in his lecture style concerning moral philosophy.
deserved the distinguished teaching award
Hahah, Garcia 61C is one of the best classes I have ever taken!!
i had him many years ago and remember him being a nice guy, really good lecturer and also a huge Godzilla superfan lmao. 2024 must've been one of his all-time great years
The OG in the classics department!!
His Hell Class is the best ❤️
he’s such a great guy, genuinely is passionate about his field, and loves to teach! I still get emails and notifications for career fairs and resume help despite being in his class over a year ago!
i recommend his global studies too!
+1 to Edwin. Wrote me letters of rec for PhD programs and got in! Great guy.
Just had Edwin for soc 005 and wish I had him for a better class bc the material was so boring but he still put his all into it lol
papa john 🍕
I took E7 with Packard, he was a legend. Loved Dames heat transfer class too, took it in '16
lisa is awesome
no
Sahai 😍
Idk about Sahai 🫠🫠🫠
Did you take 176?
True story.
Zachary is goated
He's fantastic. Loved his Moby Dick class even though I didn't finish it
Yes! She was my de facto thesis advisor! She was so kind and attentive and engaged in my learning! Glad to know there are others who felt similarly!
Yes! She is wonderful.
Ansell was awesome. Also really liked Dan Schnur for Campaign Strategies, Media, and Message.
Ansell is legit. His grading system is very fair and straightforward, and he really makes you feel part of the class.
I love Americ. He once talked to me on the phone during an acid trip. No lie. I used to attend his full moon tea parties where we talked about consciousness and shit
I was also heart broken to have missed his celebration of life. His wife was so sweet to all of us and I wish I would have made the time to support her in her move. I still had so much learning to do then, I let the stress of life come before being present then. So silly to have missed the mark so bad after all he attempted to teach me. Obviously I wasn’t listening yet. RIP Prof Azevedo
He did?! Noooooooo. I just got here 😢. Is he still affiliated with the school or do research?
Lisa is hot
No, I took Stat 135 with Yun Song
Nah. He came to film his documentary this past semester, so I met him then but no longer here. He's active AF on LinkedIn though.
Damn, he’s one of my favorite economists. Was looking forward to potentially meeting him. Thanks for the info"
Econ 100A v 100B - which is better to take for freshmen?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/japluh/econ_100a_v_100b_which_is_better_to_take_for/,2020-10-13 16:59:16,"Hi title says it all, am prepared for either and like both micro and macro equally so any insights will be appreciated. Econ 100A is being taught by  Martha L Olney while Econ 100B is being taught by James Campbell. Thank you!!","100A is considered a little harder than 100B because it requires more math but Olney is a great professor.
I’d say you can do one of two things:
1.) Take 100B in your first semester since it’s easier, but you’d probably end up having to take 100A with an upper div/econometrics which is a P A I N 


2.) Take 100A with Stats 20, because 100A is a bit hard but stats is a lot more straightforward (I took statistics in community college so I might be biased.) That way you can pair up Econ 100B (which is mainly theory) with a harder course in another semester and it should balance out.


Side note: take Econ 140 as close as you can to stat 20. Econ 140 borrows some terms from stat 20, and it’s helpful to remember them/have them fresh in your memory.


I’ve heard Olney is great, and I’m taking Campbell this semester (100A) and he’s super understanding and an all around saint. For 100A, he’s got us doing 6 quizzes, a presentation, a reading response, and writing final, so all the work is distributed. 
Hopefully this helps!
Dude I have the same problem as you.  I'm a freshman and I also heard that Professor Olney is retiring after Spring semester (I could be wrong). That's why I'm taking 100B before 100A.
OMG THANK U SO SO SO MUCH! I’m currently a freshman so I think maybe I can try to organise my schedule in a way that I don’t have to take 100A with an upper div. I’m planning on take 100 A with CS 61A and a couple other classes. Also, glad to hear Campbell is so understanding! Good luck!!
i could be wrong but isn't olney teaching 100b and Campbell is teaching 100a?
Thank you so so much! If you don’t mind me asking, which order did you take them in? And when?
Do you think it's good to take stat 20 in the summer and then Econ 140 in the fall? Is it too hard to take 100A and 140 at the same time?
same bruh, well we'll be in the same class then :)
Yeah I got it confused but I’m going to go with Macro so 100B
100A and 100B at the same time in my first junior semester.
Oh wow! Thanks for answering :) I’ve taken math 1B and planning on Econ 100B so hope that works out"

Wagner for Data 8 / CS 161

Hug for CS 61B / Data 100 / CS 186

Odean for UGBA 135 (one of the two that taught the class was awesome, the other not so awesome, I think Odean was the awesome one I got Odean and Selinger mixed up all the time).
Catterson. Literal godsend .
Tom Courtade was pretty amazing for EECS 126/127. Also Mike Zaletel for Physics 5A and Physics 112.
Josh Hug
Paulin
ALEXANDER PAULIN- structured lectures, notes, nice exams and SUCH A HELPFUL PERSON
I would add, for their importance in contributions to society:

Prof Robert Reich for PUBPOL C103 Wealth and Poverty.  Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

Profs Christine and David Romer for Econ 2.  Christine served in the Obama administration as the Chair for the Council of Economic Advisers. 

Prof David Card, Econ C142 Applied Econometrics.  Nobel Prize winner in Economics for 2021.

Prof Jennifer Doudna, Bio 1A (probably never again though), Nobel Prize winner 2020 for Chemistry.

Brian DeLay - (History 7A)

Nikhil Svristasa - (Math 54/55/224A)

Jelani Nelson - (CS 170/270)
In before all the Paulin and Denero comments
My favorite were David Presti and Terrence Deacon
TERRY FUCKING JOHNSON, teaches BioE104 and BioE 10(intro to BioE). He’s leaving us this semester but his last lecture is quite literally a bioengineering event. Hands down the best prof I’ve had. Can’t believe he was not mentioned here
Prof McFarlane narratve writing
Professor Wendy Brown for Political Science (Modern Political Theory)
Robin Ball- MCB Department
i think hass is pretty good for math classes. Really liked yun song for stat 135, but he rarely teaches it.
Alex Fillipenko, John Denero, David Whitney, Andrew Packard (RIP), Paul Li

Edit: Stephen Hinshaw
Anant Sahai
There are several really good civ engineering profs. The two that come to mind is Claudia Ostertag and Evan Variano. I just really enjoyed coming to class and learning from them. Extremely nice, personable, super smart people. Love them
Karen Nakamura anthro 189
Weaver
Darcy Grigsby for art history, she is phenomenal and makes you want to LOVE art history. Take HA C11 with her (she has an award for teaching after all).
[deleted]
In the music department: Matthew Hough (hard classes but a very good teacher), Robert Yamasato, Amadeus Regucera
John Kaiser sociol150
Denero, Adhikari, Rao
Gireeja Ranade for EECS16A/B
David Landreth in English. Man uses the word “cool” more than any human I’ve ever met, and his energy is just ✨👍🏻
Underrated, but Whitney for CogSci
Paul Li for Cog Sci 1
I thought Daniel Sargent was the best in the History department.
Professor Grace Gu is fantastic to take practically any class under, and Pete Mardsen for Chem 1A was absolutely unmatched. 

A lot of the other MVPs have already been mentioned
  Joe for JOMAMA 100
Charman for any physics class he’s teaching
Darren Zook for any global studies class
Hilfinger for 61B
Richard Borcherds for mathematics.
Professor Kaur for econ 174
Robert Reich

Robert Reich
Paulin
The Romers for Econ 2
Wendy Brown for Poli Sci 4
(I think they may all be retired now)
I like John Arnold and bediako
Noel Perkins is a new prof who just came from UMich but let me tell you this man has a gift for teaching. If you ever have a hard technical class, try to take it with him if you can (ME only to my knowledge)
Wes Holliday, super nice and caring prof. Love him!
You can assume that if a Prof is on either of these lists, they’re pretty awesome.

Only been here a year, but **Pamela Fox** is genuinely one of the nicest/most approachable people I've met. I would 100% recommend taking a class with her. Also **Mat Pyle** was incredible (and very enthusiastic to talk to you about his work), even if he did get off track a lot in class.

Prof Stephanie Jones Rogers!! Took two history classes with her she’s the best. 

Also Dan Neumark - yeah pchem sucks but neumark is the only professor who can make that lecture engaging.

Dr. Hug. Not sure if he's still there. It's been awhile since I graduated lol
Eric Stanley for Trans 100, excellent lectures and energy!
Dr. Blonder for Bio 1B or IB 153, he is literally so amazing.
Hiroshi Murayama. I took his intro to quantum field theory class and it kind of made me fall back in love with physics at a point when I was pretty burnt out. He's super kind and an amazing lecturer, really skilled at explaining complex concepts in a comprehensible way.
Sofia villas-boas
Darren Zook! You will not regret taking a class with him
I was a physics major so here’s my opinion. By far the two best professors I’ve had were Professor Irfan Siddiqi and Professor Michael Crommie. I had them for Physics 137A and Physics 137B. Even though it was quantum mechanics, those were some of the classes I ended up doing the best in. They’re both funny, entertaining, and explain unintuitive concepts in an accessible way for undergraduates. All professors could learn from them.

Username checks out 🤣
Forgot to add one more, Jelani Nelson for CS 170.  Awesome lecturer, great person, in the news lately for Karen fighting.
Can't speak to the rest, but +1 vote for Adhikari
Fillipenko is the greatest
No hilfinger? Sadge
Alexander Paulin for Math 1B/ Math 54.
I also had Zalatel for 5A and he was fantastic. Really great lecturer!

robert reich and his class are completely overrated
Yeah Scheckman is maybe the worst lecturer I’ve ever had.
+1 for MacFarlane.
Yes her intro to physio is awesome
I second this. I recommend that everyone, not just cs majors take at least one of his classes
Seconding this
I 100% SECOND THIS.
was looking for this comment🙌🙌🙌
Rao - wonderful human being, one of the best in OH, inspired me to work my ass off in 70 - but a poor lecturer.  Similar category to Hilfinger without the sarcasm.
Definitely not Rao
I would say he’s a excellent lecturer , but I wouldn’t categorize him in the “must-take” category.  I’m probably just being picky about this, but in my time at Berkeley I had a lot of classes, including Paul Li, with outstanding professors and lecturers, but only a few which I would elevate to GOAT status.
I have Pete marsden for chem 3al this sem and 3b next sem so happy he’s my favorite professor so far
I had Grace Gu for solid mechanics. That class moves at the pace of a snail and the material is incredibly boring but she's a good enough lecturer to almost make up for it.
bediako underrated
Casey is the bomb
it is so funny to me I got downvoted for this LOL

STATS 134 (the probability class she used to teach) was a really hard class for me, but man Adhikari's lectures were great. I made sure to never miss them.
Crystal clear lectures and presentation, even for some of the more advanced topics. I don’t think there was a single lecture where a large portion of the class seemed confused en-masse. My understanding is that this is uncommon among professors who teach 126/127.
I might have taken it with you lol, I took her for Statics (ME C85) and Composites* (ME 127)*"

I'm an incoming freshman, and plan to possibly double major in MCB/Stats. I come from a very rigorous high school environment, so I know I can handle enough. However, I still want the time and energy to adjust and get acclimated to college life.

The art will be finding consistent time to do socials/club work/hanging out. 

Eg : for the first 5-6 weeks you’ll be able to balance your social life and work. Then towards the middle all the way to finals week you’ll probably end up sacrificing your social life if you’re aiming for all As"
Econ 1 Spring,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j61bzr/econ_1_spring/,2020-10-06 01:18:11,"James D Campbell or Enrico Moretti? How was your experience with each of them? Who has the “easier tests” and which one should I choose to take Econ 1 with?

I remember seeing on Ratemyprof that Moretti doesn’t post any recordings or notes but since everything is remote now, I’m wondering if anything’s changed?

Thank you!","I’m in Campbells Econ 100A right now. He’s pretty good. Also, we don’t have a midterm, just 6 quizzes, and the final is a timed essay (no math problems). Not sure what he’ll do for Econ 1 next sem, but I think he did the same structure as we have for his summer class of Econ 1.
I took Econ 1 with james Campbell in the summer and really enjoyed him as a person/the content having never taken an Econ class before. I ended up getting an a- really studying hard for the quizzes, but piazza helped a lot! My only complaint is he talks super fast so I found myself spending like an hour after each lecture finishing up all the notes (maybe this was just a summer thing since they’re so condensed).
i’m also having difficulty choosing. who did you end up picking?
[deleted]
moderately difficult but that was me
Did you have any prior Econ knowledge or experience?
no! said that in my original reply:)"
Econ 100a vs Econ 100b?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wk9g37/econ_100a_vs_econ_100b/,2022-08-09 10:36:23,"Hi everyone,
I’m a rising sophmore who passed out of Econ 1/2 through AP credits, and am now stuck between doing 100a or 100b first. 

Is there any significance difference in difficulty between the two (I’ve heard 100b is more theoretical) or is there one that’s better suited for someone that has no Berkeley economics experience? 

Thank you in advance!!🤝","They are completely different classes. 100A is intermediate microeconomics and 100B is intermediate macroeconomics. 

It really doesn’t matter which class you take first but both are required for the Econ major. I’d probably recommend Econ 100A first because James Campbell is a great professor to take for those who do not have Berkeley economics experience. But honestly it really doesn’t matter which one you take first."
