Gaston Sanchez Trujillo or Noureddine El Karoui,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/khq6bn/gaston_sanchez_trujillo_or_noureddine_el_karoui/,2020-12-21 13:03:23,"I’m debating between taking stat 133 or 135 next semester, and unfortunately ratemyprofessors has low reviews for both professors. Has anyone had experience with either and can offer me some insights? Thanks :-)","[deleted]
I took stat 133 last semester. Professor Sanchez isn't nearly as bad as the reviews say he is. I liked him a lot. He's a nice, relatable guy and explains everything clearly, although he does move a bit slow. His lectures were pretty entertaining. He responds quickly to emails and is always there to help you out.

Grading wise, labs are based on completion - homework and projects are graded a bit harshly, but fairly. The quizzes are a bit difficult, so prepare well for them and know the material. The final was a breeze compared to the rest of the work we did in the semester - Professor Sanchez and the GSIs really gave us a donation there.

Throughout the semester there were opportunities for extra credit and other grade boosts. I'd recommend you take this class if you're into data science.
Gaston's kinda meh but there's no other option, plus the class usually ranges from medium if you've never programmed before to really easy if you have a programming background.
Nice, upvoted
Dang alright, thanks for that info!
That’s definitely reassuring to know. Thanks a lot! (:
Thank u!"
Stat 20 or 21?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sqorh/stat_20_or_21/,2012-04-24 15:14:53,"Sorry, I'm sure this question has been asked a bunch of times. I'm pre-Haas and/or an intended econ major, so I just want to know which class would be better to take for Fall 2012 (I'll be a sophomore at that time). The Stat 20 prof for Fall 2012 is el Karoui, who seems pretty bad based on his/her ratings. But I hear Stat 21 is a harder and more competitive class because of all the pre-Haas students in it. Any thoughts on which class would be better to take?  ","The material is pretty much the same, and the competitiveness will only matter if the professor curves down and that will depend on who is teaching.  So the amount of work you need to put into each class to get an A should be the same.  I'd recommend talking to the Stats advisers to see if there any departmental policy regarding grading curves.  
If it was me, I would base my decision entirely on who is teaching.  
Stat 20 requires more calculus. I took Stat 21 online during the summer and it wasn't nearly as bad as what I heard. Definitely recommend it if you have the flexibility.
also curious about the W21 course this summer.
I don't know who's teaching it this next Fall but I took stat21 with Ibser and it wasn't fun.
I think it really depends who you take it with. I took Stat 20 and there was very little calculus. 
I'm taking stat 20 right now with Professor Tom; no calculus.
Pretty straightforward but tests are harshly graded"
