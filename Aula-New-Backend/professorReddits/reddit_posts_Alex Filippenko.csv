Alex Filippenko's Office Hours,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12kyaho/alex_filippenkos_office_hours/,2023-04-13 11:22:26,Does anyone know Filippenko's office hours this semester?  Need to chat with him about something,
I get to interview Alex Filippenko tomorrow! Are there any questions you want me to ask him?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8czwjb/i_get_to_interview_alex_filippenko_tomorrow_are/,2018-04-17 13:45:56,"Yo dawgs,

I get to talk to the most loved professor on campus tomorrow - none other than Alex Filippenko of Astro C10 himself. I'm going to revolve the discussion around a bit of everything, including his favorite aspects of teaching, his undergrad experience at UCSB, and well, of course, the universe.

Feel free to post any questions you have here and I'll be sure to ask them. Will post interview on the sub once it's done.

Why did he give me a B+
[removed]
What are his thoughts on humanity's potential for becoming an interplanetary/interstellar civilization? And what does he see as the biggest roadblock towards us ever getting there?

Also when can I take a hi-res selfie with a planet
Ask him:  Is the motivation to find new worlds based on our poor use and destruction of this one. Do we aspire to be a cosmic virus jumping from host to host for our own self preservation?
how much acid has that man dropped
does he browse /r/berkeley? who's his favorite poster and why is it /u/notkmbabua?
how many eclipses has he seen??
Are there aliens?
Ouch. Multiple choice fam!
Oof. 
From what I've heard around Campbell Hall, there may be a new astro lab class that focuses on data science in the works (to be offered in addition to the existing optical and radio labs), and it might be possible that some of the new data science major upper divs will count as astro upper div electives in the future."

"Alex Filippenko, a Cal astronomy professor, has calculated that the universe is expanding 9% faster than previously figured. If Filippenko is correct, it could mean that dark energy is increasing, the universe is more curved than theorized and Einstein's theory of relativity could be inaccurate.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/03/hold-on-tight-the-universe-is-expanding-faster-than-we-thought/,2016-06-04 23:12:16,,"It's pretty damn cool when your favorite lecturer also turns out to have amazing research props.

Unfortunately astrophysics was a bit over my head but he was really nice and genuine. He has always been busy with research and never on campus.
nahh i thought bro was tucker carlson"
"The first ""real"" jobs of UC Berkeley's esteemed faculty. Alex Filippenko: gift shop salesperson. Darren Zook: bagging groceries in Texas. Laura Stoker: McDonalds. Joshua Hug: intern at at Lockheed Martin. Martha Olney: babysitter.

He's exactly the kind of person I'd want to buy my souvenir shot glasses from.
The thought of Josh Hug working at Lockheed Martin makes me chuckle, even if he didn't do anything."
"Nathan Magee: Astronomy C10 is ""a staple in the diet of anyone needing to complete those L&S breadths, and nine-time UC Berkeley Professor of the Year Alex Filippenko makes the course one of the most well-liked on campus ... Despite its popularity the astrophysics major is largely neglected.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2015/10/30/at-berkeley-and-beyond-reinvesting-in-space-exploration/,2015-11-01 17:43:30,,"Can confirm, is dank as shit
Can be fun to try to spot who is high/drunk during lecture. (Almost as much as with Drugs & the Brain.)
That black hole lecture was awesome. Too bad I was sitting so far back I couldn't catch any candy...
Astrophysics major is largely neglected because the job prospects are abysmal 
Just a reminder that psych is one of the most popular majors on campus 
Psych isn't nearly as hard though...astrophysics is at the uncomfortable crossroads between difficult and not very marketable.

Join Astronomy C10 Course this Fall!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i8muo2/join_astronomy_c10_course_this_fall/,2020-08-12 14:38:12,"*A Message from Prof. Alex Filippenko:*

Hey, Cal students, welcome to the Fall 2020 semester!  


There are still hundreds of open spots available in my  
Astronomy C10 / L&S C70U class (""Introduction to General  
Astronomy"") this fall (MWF 3-4 pm). If you want a class  
that will really blow your mind and satisfy the physical  
science breadth requirement, sign up! We welcome students  
from all majors and years. It doesn't matter if you have  
another class at the same time, since the lectures will  
be available online to be viewed any time (and we will  
allow a different time for exams, if there's a conflict).  


Please consider signing up, and encourage all of your  
friends, too. Astronomy C10 (course number 21183) and  
L&S C70U (course number 22133) are exactly the same  
class, simply cross-listed.  


I hope to ""see"" you in two weeks!","[deleted]
I wish I could take this course again
I'll consider it next semester when I'm not already planning on taking 20 units üò≠
I do research with Filippenko and all of our observations are remote. We can operate the Lick telescope completely on our own computers. Don't know if he's planning on doing something similar for casual observing but it's possible.
[deleted]
it's fall-only sadly - highly recommend it, if you can push one of your other classes to spring!
[deleted]
Is there a math component to the course? I'd love to take this but I'm terrible at any kind of complex math.
I want my last semester to be as easy as it can be given my set of circumstances. I'll have to take 16 units still as I'm pursuing a minor unrelated to my major.
Thank you, that's a good idea! First, I need to find out how to sign up to audit a class because I transferred here last year and don't know how üòÖ"

Not even memeing, but 61B. Professor Hug is such an amazing guy
EA 109 with John Wallace - it's about the history of Tea in Eastern Asia. Interesting class, great professor.
Are you outdoorsy? Then I recommend PMB 113L with Prof. Tom Bruns. It's Mushrooms of California. You learn about mycology and go to the woods to pick mushrooms.

Drugs and the Brain with David Presti! He‚Äôs honestly the best and so insightful and I loved his class! I‚Äôm MCB so the actual bio material was kinda repetitive and basic but he‚Äôs worth it!!! Took a seminar with him and took this class last semester just to listen to him talk again :)
CS164 with Hilfinger
take 140 with adhikari
Chem 3A with Vollhardt, best prof ever 
I'm having a pretty great time with Fish in Polisci 2 right now. Dude delivers amazing lectures without a mic (booming voice), and he's done field studies everywhere from Russia to Nigeria - tons of interesting stuff to say. He's got a real genuine dedication to empiricism and evidence-based thinking that you don't see everywhere in the social sciences. I usually attend my lectures as little as possible, but I hate it when I have to miss his.
Rhetoric classes with Nasser. He's so sweet and intelligent, and really good at involving the class 
[deleted]
Anything with Sahai is amazing 
he's teaching data 100 next semester
So much this.
I was an MCB major, but I took this class for fun. Dr. Presti is great!
+1
This man has been terrorizing Cal students and ruining lives since the early 90's.

Chem 3A 1999, *Never forget*
The essays in ps2 are really hard though, the average scores would be like 12/20. But I agree the lectures were interesting.
How do you know? Are course lists already out?
He‚Äôs such a wholesome dude lol
Did they curve midterms when you took it? We‚Äôre getting results back this week and I‚Äôm a bit nervous.
I was MCB-CDB, so I didn't take his upper div course on neurochemistry, but I heard great things about it, too
Yea it was curved
Same! I‚Äôm immuno but I might take it just for the heck of it! "

Would it be incredibly weird to like send the department chair an email and say how much I enjoyed the class? 

Thanks a ton guys!","What class is this? I want to take this prof :)
Go to their office hours at the end of the semester and thank them!

Volunteer in the Student Learning Center or otherwise help your fellow students; tell your prof she inspired you to do so!
I'm following too! :D"
