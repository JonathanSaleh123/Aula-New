On behalf of the Computational Approach to Human Learning  (CAHL) Lab, I invite you to take a survey to aid our research goals.   The principle investigator, Professor Zachary Pardos, is a faculty  member at the University of California, Berkeley, in the School of  Education.

This is a paid online survey about your course selection  decisions and personality traits. If you choose to participate, your  survey responses will be anonymously linked to your enrollment records.  Your enrollment records include a history of all courses you have  previously taken, including your grades, major, and whether you have  dropped out of the courses taken. You will be compensated with a $45  Amazon gift card for approximately 45 minutes of your time. There will  only be one session required.**Participants  must be between 18 and 50 years of age, must be enrolled at UC  Berkeley in the College of Letters and Science, have a UC Berkeley  email address, and have completed at least one semester at UC Berkeley.** **L&S Undeclared students are acceptable.** If you are interested in participating, please follow this link [https://askoski.berkeley.edu:1370](https://askoski.berkeley.edu:1370/) and then click on the **Course Selection Survey** tab.

I’m in a geology major (planning to be) and I am in L&S. But it says that I’m not eligible:(
I am assuming you are a data science student, we did not have that in our whitelist of majors. I just added it so if you would like to try the survey again, I would appreciate it.
me too! :(
By chance are you a freshman or recent transfer student? We require at least one semester of student course data so that could be it.
We check if students are in L&S via their major. Could you let me know what your major is so I can add it to our whitelist? Sorry for the inconvenience.
Psychology but no declared yet
Psychology is in our list, so is Letters & Science Undeclared. By chance is it your first semester at Berkeley? We need some course history so that might be why. Sorry for not making that clear. I'll fix it.
haha no worries! I’m a transfer student :)"
