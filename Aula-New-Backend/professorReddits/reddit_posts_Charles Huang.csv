looking for folks to help build the first career accelerator for asian americans!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vocmls/looking_for_folks_to_help_build_the_first_career/,2022-06-30 09:32:45,"Hey everyone! If you’re passionate about Asian American issues and based in NYC after graduation, check out Lunar Accel, the first career accelerator dedicated to helping young professionals break the bamboo ceiling, the phenomenon in which professionals of East/Southeast Asian background are by far the least likely to achieve management in the US.

Previously, we’ve invited the cofounders/CEOs of Rotten Tomatoes and Guitar Hero (Patrick Lee and Charles Huang), and our next goal is launching a flagship 3-week accelerator in NYC. We're expanding our team with positions spanning growth marketing, operations, design, and more, and would love for anyone interested to apply! This is (in our biased opinion) a unique opportunity to give back to the community outside of work, expand your network, and have fun working with cool people :). For more info and to apply, check out our website[ lunaraccel.org](https://lunaraccel.org/) or our [growth plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R42pWPwZ4tBjUAexXhvQq_wd3ihJfXnf/view?usp=sharing).

Feel free to comment/DM me directly if you have any questions. Or if you have any suggestions for ideas or people to talk to, would love to connect and chat too. Thanks everyone!!",
