Stupidest ones are bolded. Apparently EVERYONE supports illegal immigration and affirmative action now! If you plan on going to this protest and think it's only about fee hikes for education or something, READ THIS and realize what all you will represent by being there.

The protesters really screwed up. There are plenty of people from diverse backgrounds who support the protests against the fee hikes. However, a majority of the other demands are on very polarizing issues, so they will lose a huge amount of support. Honestly, this whole occupy cal thing is extremely naive if they think they have the power to make such major changes - they need to pick one issue and stick with it or else they won't accomplish anything.
Thanks for posting this. What should have been a focused thrust against the police brutality of the previous days has (as expected) become a wishy-washy ""protest all the things"" joke. I am disapoint :(
Why do they want affirmative action?  Does it bother them that Asian American students are over represented at Berkeley?  Admitting more students might sound great but it means that the university will have to reject others, and that burden at Berkeley will fall almost entirely on Asian Americans.
Yeah and a free PhD for everyone in the field of study of their choosing!
Is nobody here aware of the corruption and non-transparency on part of the Regents and Chancellors?  Does everybody here seriously, a-priori accept the power and authority of 26 banking and corporate elite over the University of California?  

Sure, debate the other ones--but seriously, you guys think that demanding structural political reform is silly?  

[Here is a nice essay](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/Minding%20the%20Campus.pdf) by  Professor Emeritus of Physics at Berkeley, expounding upon exactly why there are tuition hikes, and why the Regents and political structure is fucked beyond repair.  
I see four, maybe five reasonable requests here, one of which was already granted.

The affirmative action one in particular makes me glad I decided not to participate in the strike tomorrow.
Democratizing the administration of the UC system is not outrageous or obnoxious.  Affirmative action is largely misunderstood, while I personally have my misgivings about it, there would be no quotas and it would actually have a very small effect, only on the borderline admission cases. ( This is basically a demand from BAMN who seems to be quite over represented in the movement.  Reversing the fee hikes obviously needs to be coupled with revenue raising somewhere, and the consensus about where that should be is pretty resounding.
Immediate forgiveness of all student debt is beyond comprehension, but in a perfect world, education should be free anyways.

UCLA student here. I saw some chalk drawings on campus to the similar effect. ""NO FREE HIKES OR CUTS"". This blows my mind. Where the fuck is the campus supposed to meet the budget?
The list of demands isn't a finalized list. The Occupy Cal movement doesn't just stop here. You will not represent ALL of these ideas by being there. These demands were made to open up the conversation on these issues. Do you all really think the protesters are so naive as to think they can get all these things? The point of a movement like this is to refine over time, and until then, steer the conversation. Some of these have even been achieved in some form (birgeneau granted amnesty to thursday's protesters).

tl;dr occupy cal is an ongoing dialogue.
You obviously know nothing about negotiating.  Ask for everything, settle for half.
the Occupy Cal movement has just lost all legitimacy and credibility in my mind
can someone link me to the event? I want to see thisss
i mean, the demands are largely symbolic. might as well reach for the stars! not sure why they decided on listing demands in the first place, though. the occupy movement has been doing pretty well without them. 
I agree that convoluted/confused messages and demands tend to have a marginalizing effect on the wider student population, and that this has been a big issue in student activism the last few years, but I do not believe that thinking big should be criticized in and of itself. If you want and demand a little bit, you'll get a little bit - such is the shit appeasement is made of. Now, you can also choose to start at the top and work your way downwards towards the practical from there, which in turn could lead to larger absolute gains. 
Thank god US history is not made by you but real wo/men of character. Not idiots who tear down the visionaries because of their own small-mindedness, cowardice, and fear of the baton. Obviously university has been a waste for most of you commenting here.

Now don't bother whining about how *mean* I am because I don't give a shit. If you grow up and realize there is more to life than getting you [random science field] degree, I'll be with the patriots in Oscar Grant and in front of Sproul.    
With the Regents in the way, anything smaller than complete structural reform will be meaningless.  So what if we pass some small fee-hike delay now?  What do you think they'll do next year, after the energy has died down?  

The Regents must go.  

[Here is a nice essay](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/Minding%20the%20Campus.pdf) for a further examination of the failure of the current political structure of the UC.  
Well, the original protest wasn't about police brutality, it was wishy-washy to begin with. I honestly think they WANTED police brutality to happen so they could get more attention and and get other people to blindly support the protesters without even realizing what the cause was. They saw the response police brutality got in Oakland and wanted to make sure they got as much video footage of the cops in Berkeley as possible. Did you notice how literally everyone in those videos has a camera aimed at the cops? And they could have easily accepted the (very generous) compromise by the administration that would have allowed them to stay in Sproul Plaza 24/7 as long as they didn't set up tents. They rejected that and began setting up tents anyway. They knew the cops would start having to use violence, and they provoked them. Yes, the force used was excessive, but it wasn't like they didn't expect it.
Totally ridiculous that ANYBODY would have to feel the burden of affirmative action. You're telling somebody, ""you're smarter than that other guy/girl, but you're the wrong color. Sorry! Admission denied.""

People always forget about that part of affirmative action.
probably the quickest way to get UCB to the status of University of Phoenix.

Excuse me, that's DOCTOR Harley to you, as in doctor of rocket surgery
Thank you! OP is just trying to use sensationalism to discredit the movement and draw attention away from the most important objectives. 
The real issue is student loan reform. The current system is broken, and it risks following the same path as the subprime mortgage crisis, except even worse for the middle class. Student loans are being pushed much more actively and in increasing amounts, the debt can't be defaulted on, and there's less of a guarantee that a college degree can ensure a well-paying job, or any job for that matter.

The current job market is dominated by four-year degree holders, which raises the minimum barrier to entry forcing high school grads to college. The rapidly increasing costs of higher education coupled with the stagnation in wages for the middle class results in the necessity of student loans. On average, students take on over $20,000 in loan debt by the time they graduate. Couple that with the difficulties for new grads to find jobs, and you're basically trying to climb out of a hole before even starting.
Cmon everyone let's grab our share!  Fuck all the people who paid up front or worked through college.  Get your handouts while they're fresh!
How about by [fixing the fiasco that has been the last ten years.](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/Minding%20the%20Campus.pdf)  
A 'Demand' does not sound like an ongoing dialogue. No offense, but are you naïve enough to think that some of the most passionate people about the issues aren't crazy. More crazy than the Regents, but less corrupt and they don't have the money. (The Regents are totally corrupt and I hate them. But they're not crazy.)
I don't see why people try and give shit to the movement, when they're most likely not the ones even participating. If you don't like what you hear, why not go out and do something about it? In the general assembly, everyone has a voice. All you have to do is remember how to use it.
Half of these demands aren't just overshooting - they're stupid and have no principled basis to back them up.  You can ask for everything when you have a good reason.  Asking for complete forgiveness of all student debt has zero justification, as does making the UC a ""sanctuary for illegal immigrants"" in violation of Federal and State law.  You could also ask the state to handout $10k to every protestor while you're at it, that has roughly the same amount of justification behind it - zero.

You negotiate based on principle, not demanding handouts and concessions from people who owe you nothing.  

Me: ""I would like a million dollars.""

Millionaire: ""No.""

Me: ""Comon.""

Millionaire: ""No.""

Me: ""Comooooooooon.""

Millionaire: ""No.""

Me: ""Comoooooooooooooooon.""

Millionaire: ""Fine, you can have five hundred thousand dolllars.""

Me: ""Yes!""

if you're gonna ask for these ridiculous demands, why not just ask for free tuition while you're at it?
That's really not the point here. I would be okay with that if I supported all of these demands, but I don't and I think a lot of others don't as well.

I'm all for reversal of fee hikes and forgiveness of student debt even though I know they're impossible. However I am firmly against affirmative action and I don't support illegal immigration (I have a pretty strong opinion about this as a legal immigrant). I also think the call for forcing our Chancellor's resignation is ridiculous and completely out of line.
This is probably exactly what it's about. The ""extreme"" and polarizing issues will probably make the others (amnesty for arrested protestors, tuition to 2009 levels) more appealing to negotiate.
I think it would have gone over a lot better if they didn't call them ""demands"", but instead referred to them as something along the lines of ""issues of concern"". Calling them ""demands"" is polarizing and makes it seem like there's no possibility of negotiation or debate -- like a child.

Interesting to learn that anybody who thinks affirmative action is racism is not a real wo/man of character. TIL.
Immediate forgiveness of all student debt and full implementation of affirmative action is more than a little crazier than the fact that the Regents are totally crooked, and the state has the wrong priorities. By the way, I totally support those last two ideas.
What does 'they' mean? There were over 500 people who voted at the first general assembly to occupy the campus, and the only thing all 500 people voted on was to establish the camp. Was there a resolution to encourage police brutality? Do you really think 500 people collectively decided to incite police violence? The protests are heterogeneous in their makeup and their beliefs.

'They saw the response police brutality got in Oakland and wanted to make sure they got as much video footage of the cops in Berkeley as possible.' You say this as if this is illogical. The cops then went ahead with a repeat performance of similar brutality.

The administration's compromise was offered HOURS AFTER the first tents were set up (towards the end of the night). What you call ""generous"" is essentially farcical--camping out with no tents, no sleeping bag, and 'no sleeping.' Does that even seem possible?

These protests are something ongoing, and developing. It's a conversation happening, not JUST a push for certain policies.
The ""very generous compromise"" you speak of also included no sleeping or eating.  I stopped by one night--the police were standing guard, watching over the few kids to make sure they didn't fall asleep. It was fucking ridiculous--sleep deprivation of sorts.  

And what is this rather silly argument about how police force is okay if we expect it?  You might as well say that the world ought not be outraged by the massacres taking place in Syria, since of course the protesters ought to expect it!  
I'm just going to jump in here as one of the people that got beat by the police. How fucking dare you say we wanted this to happen. Have you been beaten by the police? It is not fucking fun. Even after the physical effects wear off that shit is fucking traumatizing. Hell, it's traumatizing just to see my fucking friends get beaten by cops, let alone experience it myself.
I use to think this. Affirmative Action does more to correct for the fact that white students out preform minorities on standardized tests. This is true for most standardized tests, from the SATs to the MCATs and GREs. There are a number of possible reasons students of the same academic standing (GPA, Major, etc...) would score disproportionally on a test, and one is definitely stereotype threat. This is an effect where if a minority is made aware that the test is evaluative their performance reliably drops.

Add to this the fact that standardized tests are not useful predicators of later success in the educational system. At best scores on the SAT/LSAT/GRE/etc... can predict the first year of academic performance but no more. Basically, Affirmative Action is a way to account for the inherent bias on standardized testing.
Actually, I think OP is legitimate. A meaningful protest should have a unified, strong message. If a protest has questionable demands mixed in it, then it weakens the impact of the protest.

I interpret the OP as a jumping point for discussion of the message, not simply a post to discredit the movement.
The OP's point is that the organizing minds behind the whole thing are, essentially, insane. While the core messages are quite reasonable, the authors of those demands are not whatsoever.
The only thing that makes you think they aren't corrupt is that they aren't good at getting what they want.
Or I could just oppose your entire ""general assembly"" and ignore your protest, I think that's also a viable option.  Completely forgiveness of all student debt and blanket approval of all illegal immigration just goes to show how retarded the core of this ""assembly"" is.  Real protests against corruption would demand that the bankers and financiers who broke the law should go to prison, not that everyone in California gets a handout.
Ha, yea, that about the gist of what this guy thinks is going to happen.  It's just embarrassing and makes the whole movement look stupid.  Ask for JUSTICE, not handouts, jail for the bankers and financiers that broke the law, not some new entitlements.
Half of them are things that are attainable and seem like they're being sought after (like making Berkeley a safe place to protest). The other half aren't so much ""demands"" as ideas or problems that are being called attention to. The first stuff seems knee-jerk in response to the administration, and I'm surprised there isn't more about the Regents.
[deleted]
I'm curious as to your stance on ""illegals""--whom I like to call ""refugees.""  What is your strong opinion?
How is calling for the chancellor's resignation ridiculous?

He endorsed the use of overwhelming violence against a peaceful protest on the fucking Mario Savio steps of all places, and then went on to describe linking arms and chanting 'stop beating students' as an act of violence.

I can understand criticizing some of the other demands, but calling for Birgeneau's resignation is completely reasonable.  He's disgraced himself and this university and should fuck off.
do the bears on their poster remind anyone of pedobear?
Sorry you have no imagination.
Well that's not what the poster said at all...
I agree, I think we should focus on restructuring the system itself, rather than focus on specific policy demands.  
I don't know about you, but I enjoy nice looking campuses. I don't particularly like one of the coolest parts of campus looking like a shanty town. The rules against encampments are there for a good reason.
Daily Cal : ""The protester added that any violent clashes with police, like what happened Wednesday, “will be beneficial to our cause.”""

http://www.dailycal.org/2011/11/11/occupy-cal-general-assembly-votes-to-set-up-encampment-tuesday/ 
'they' = the organizers who are making these Facebook events, designing the fliers, and pasting thousands of them over what seems like every wall on campus. I know it makes perfect logical sense for this group of people to want to make as big a deal out of this police brutality as possible. I was just clarifying to thrawnie and others who don't know that this movement is not at its core about police brutality. It was and is about the list of grievances above. They are encouraging the police brutality because they know it will make more people come out who don't otherwise support the list of causes. They're going to seem much stronger with all the extra people and media attention than they would have otherwise as just people holding signs for disconnected mostly ridiculous complaints.
You know what, it is a health and safety issue when people are sleeping and eating in the middle of campus DURING the school week. The majority of my friends do not feel comfortable about this, and I think the university is right to want to enforce rules about it.

As for comparing this protest to Syria? Please remember that this is true:

White People make up between 30% to 40% of both UC Berkeley's population and the state's population.  Affirmative action will effect them the least.
[deleted]
Affirmative action is stupid retarded.  It is just as racist to say that if someone belongs to a minority that they must be marginalized in society.  If you really want to make the system fair, simply let the school consider the applicants socioeconomic background, not race.  There are plenty of wealthy minorities, and there are plenty of economically disadvantaged people who live in shitty areas that are part of the racial majority.  Using race is stupid, look at their living situation not their color.
If you can think of a better way to objectively measure students, then let me know. GPA? People who go to community college sometimes get straight A's in joke public schools (i.e., ones full of underperforming students).

But performance on standardized tests isn't the only thing associated with race. So is performance in college. You have the point of view that, ""performance on SAT is associated with race, therefore it must be an incorrect measurement."" You are begging the question (look it up on wikipedia if you are part of the 99% that doesn't know what ""begging the question"" actually means).

I think it's interesting that you think color of skin is a better way to measure students than standardized tests. As in, the same test EVERYONE takes.
Nope, it's called tuition now.
Wonderful! That means it's PERFECTLY reasonable to charge no tuition, no matter what you call it.
My strong opinion: It would be totally fine if it were free and unlimited if the following were true:

1. ""Refugees"" don't get medical expenses paid by the U.S. government. (Think emergency room bills that can never be paid.)
2. ""Refugees"" don't get free education, I.E. paid for by U.S. tax payers.
3. ""Refugees"" don't actually get any free benefits paid for by U.S. tax payers.
4. Law Enforcement is 100% effective and free.

Essentially, free immigration leads to a better economic situation for everyone, unless you have a welfare state, or you assume market failures can exist.
Refugees from what?  From the expenses of paying for legal immigration into this country? You realize that the expenses that every illegal immigrant dodges is another expense on every legal taxpayer?  What about illegal immigrants that drive around without a license or insurance, use emergency medical care without paying for it, undercut legal workers by accepting below minimum wage from businesses... The list goes on.  If I tried to illegally immigrate into Mexico from South America, they wouldn't see me as a refugee, they'd arrest me and deport me.
I can spin it another way:

He endorsed the use of moderate force against an increasingly rowdy crowd of protestors that was obstructing justice--a situation that could have quickly turned violent needed to be controlled.

He also didn't call it an act of violence, he said it was ""not nonviolent""--and considering the historical use of the phrase ""nonviolent protest"", he's right.
Thanks! Here's the evidence for my comment guys. But I guess you will all down vote anyway, shocker.
How have the protesters 'encouraged' police brutality, if i may ask?
Scumbag Reddit: Disagree with well reasoned post? Downvote until only one point of view remains.
Bullshit.  I'm sorry for cursing, but I see no logic in saying that an encampment is a ""health and safety issue"" when basically everybody lives a walking distance from their house from Sproul.  Couple that with the fact that the encampment is not in the way at all of students who are walking to and from class, and you have a pretty weak story there.  

I'm not comparing the protest to Syria--after all, we are not getting killed.  But my statement was the logical extension of your argument, that if protesters know they will face repression, then the protesters deserve it.  

In any case, the logic of the picture as a whole is silly.  So we ought not be discontent with our situation and being marginalized by those in control, since there are other populations who are even more marginalized than us?  This type of thinking is the very reason why stratifications exist--it was used during the beginning of the slave era, to split apart disenfranchised whites and blacks by creating a new racial hierarchy, and you are seemingly using it now to de-legitimize protest in the 1st world.  
 
Wait you're saying he can't compare this protest to Syria because you posted a picture of ""poor"" Somalian Children as the 99%? And a white guy as the 1%? Whats your point?

I have to assume from here. Is it that we can't have problems because there are ""starving"" and ""poor"" individuals elsewhere? Also I would like to mention you're probably performing some savage Orientalism there, suggesting that Syria is in the same state as Somalia and even to stereotype Somalia as the go-to fucked up place in the world.

Is the UC System fucked up? Yes. Does Syria have it worse? Probably. Does Somalia have it worse them both of them? Most likely.

If we have problems we should fix them. Some problems are worse and should require more attention, yes. But that ULTIMATELY should not stop us from fixing problems.

The worst part is most of the people who use this argument, probably couldn't care less about Syria, Somalia, etc.

So what are the causes in your opinion?
Socioeconomic is definitely a better way to look at things, but I think you should realize that race has a part in socioeconomics. 
So you already start of by saying that one needs monetary assets to legally immigrate into the United States--enforcing the idea that immigration across borders is a privilege reserved for the wealthy and/or privileged.  I'd like to see you tell that to people who have had their livelihoods destroyed by the flood of US-subsidized agricultural products into Mexico after the passage of NAFTA.  Or perhaps you should tell it to the people whose lives have been torn apart by the violence of the drug war, fueled by demand from First World citizens?  

I call bullshit on the arguments that refugees costs the US taxpayer.  Refugees pay sales tax--that is unavoidable.  And their work is the foundation of most of US agricultural work; recall that several state's [farming industries collapsed](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/georgias-new-immigration-law-leading-to-crops-rotting-in-farmers-fields/) due to the passage of draconian documentation laws.  

Get out of here, bougy!      
Baton blows to the abdomen do not constitute moderate force.  I haven't been able to find UCPD's version of it, but every use of force continuum I have ever seen puts baton blows to the abdomen just one step below lethal force - and considers them more forceful than tasers, tear gas, pepper spray, soft and hard hand control, and pretty much anything else.  Short of literally just shooting us baton blows to the abdomen were the most severe form of possibly legitimate force they could have used. (I don't consider it to actually have been legitimate force, but it is a convenient word here to distinguish between ""force that could be appropriate in some situation"" and ""force that could never be appropriate"" - like just beating our faces in.)

Calling the crowd 'increasingly rowdy' is a load of shit.  If UCPD and ACSO feel that they cannot control a crowd of 250 students that are literally just chanting slogans at them, they are so inexcusably bad at their jobs that they should resign in shame.  At the time that the worst violence of the day started, the police were literally at 1:1 parity with the protesters.  They could have handcuffed and removed each and every one of us with barely any effort.  The crowd was not violent and presented no form of threat - as well demonstrated by the lack of serious incidents yesterday, when twenty times as many people were in Sproul.  

Birgeneau called it ""not nonviolent,"" UCPD has been explicitly calling it violent.  Both are ridiculous.  Linking arms and chanting 'stop beating students' is nonviolent by any reasonable definition of the term.
Recognizing that violence against protesters works in their favor is a far stretch from the notion that they're actively trying to incite violence to gain support. Your comment is still simple conjecture (in the context of the group's goals as a whole). I'm sure some students feel that way, but that doesn't mean it holds for all or even a majority of the protesters.
Not going to downvote, but you don't know anything about the history and rhetoric of protests, do you? Being the victims of violence is one of the most powerful tools, especially if it's inflicted by your enemy when you don't fight back. Not saying who is right or wrong on the police violence (I personally disagree that it was necessary at all), but you seriously can't possibly be naïve enough to think that they didn't want police brutality.

EDIT: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buovLQ9qyWQ
720,000 views in ~5 days? You can't say that doesn't help their cause.
I agree with you. Everyone cites its a ""Health and Safety issue."" But honestly its just a excuse for them to use violent force. If its really was a health and safety issue then the city, the school should use funds to encourage them to occupy in a safe and healthy way. 

Paying cops overtime to prepare and then break up a raid? Probably much more expensive than actually providing aid to occupiers.
I apologize for my misspelling and lack of actual hard data earlier.
My statement was based on the assumption that affirmative action seeks to allow access proportional to the population.  If you see it differently please let me know so that I understand you opinion better.  As you can see from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_California) ""According to 2010 US Census California's population was 40.1% Non-Hispanic White, 5.8% Black or African American, 12.8% Asian, 4% American Indian, 2% Pacific Islander and 2.6% from two or more races. 37.6% of the total population are Hispanics or Latinos of any race.""
	                     Undergraduate	Graduate	
African American	     4%	                3%	      
Asian American	     42%	                17%	     
White American	     31%	                42%	   
Hispanic American	     12%	                6%	        
Native American	     <1%	                1%	
International student 4%	                18%	
I was wrong the differences between state and university population are greater for white undergraduates than for African American students.  If you are realistic you should fight an affirmative action system which will let in even more unintelligent students who can not spell.
Exactly. If race matters for the individual student, it will show up in their socioeconomic background. Race has already been implicitly factored into UC admissions this way. It just should not become an explicit factor in admissions.
Yep, immigration is a privilege reserved for people who can afford it.  Kind of like, I don't know, food, or fresh water, or the computer you're on right now.  There is no something for nothing in this world.  Someone is paying for it, somewhere.  Sure, they pay sales tax, but if you get into a car accident with an illegal and they drive away because they don't have insurance (or for that matter, a license), you'll wish that they paid what a regular citizen was require to pay.  Immigration should be made more affordable, but this does not justify illegal immigration, it justifies immigration reform.  As for the drug war, you're preaching to the choir here.  That doesn't justify illegal immigration at all though, it just shows that we need to legalize drugs and put an end to one of the most senseless drains on money, lives, and freedom on the continent.  

The whole farming argument isn't very compelling to me.  So when farmers who pay low wages to workers because they're illegal go out of business, this is a big problem?  Sounds like it's just a failed business that relied on artificially low labor costs.  I don't think agriculture in this country is going to collapse, don't worry.
""So you already start of by saying that one needs monetary assets to legally immigrate into the United States--enforcing the idea that immigration across borders is a privilege reserved for the wealthy and/or privileged.""

The problem is that everyone except Mexicans DOES have to be wealthy and privileged in order to be granted even the opportunity to visit America. Do you know anything about the long and arduous process of getting visas and applying for permanent residency in America? You can't even think of immigrating to the US from any other part of the world unless you have a job already secured and a high stable income. Even then, you have to deal with quotas and long waiting lines. 

There is a reason why the Asians and Indians who make it to America tend to be the smart and successful ones. If you just opened US borders to all, you would be immediately flooded by millions and millions of people from across the world who would drop everything for the chance to live in America. Mexicans aren't the only ones that have had difficult lives. Secure the borders completely or make them open to everyone. It's hypocrisy to call illegal immigrants ""refugees"" and fund their college educations while closing the door on the rest of the world. 
Yeah sorry, I clarified this in another post. By 'they' I mean the organizers, not everyone at the protest.
This isn't necessarily connected to the events on campus, but I think it's interesting to relate your ideas with the usage of agent provocateurs against protests.
I'm not arguing with the rhetorical logic--that is sound. We've all seen how the media has grabbed onto the youtube videos whereas before they wouldnt even bat an eyelash at the issues with the regents.
 It's the idea of 'encouraging' police brutality that I don't understand. Does this involve asking a cop to hit you? What does the term 'encouraging' mean in your context?

I agree with socioeconomic background. But our metrics for socioeconomic background fall short. When you talk about Socioeconomic background you're talking about, where you grew up, how much your parents made, did they go to college, etc. Race can be one of these factors.

What I think the problem is, is that people are reducing this process to simply race. That's not what they're going to be doing. They're looking at race because it is included in one's socioeconomic background, but they're also looking at a great deal of other things that make up one's socioeconomic background.

Race is considered in this process, but one shouldn't believe its all race. 
I think we are getting a little skewed as to what ""justifies"" illegal immigration.  Let me re-frame the discussion a little bit.

I believe it is obscene for us--like you said, who are privileged to have fresh food, water, and computers--to tell people living in destitute conditions what they are and are not justified in doing.  If I was in a country whose economy had been wrecked, and where violence is the norm, I am going to move, and I don't care what kind of abstract socio-economic standard of morality my logic violates.  

Furthermore, you are still not offering much substantive evidence that refugees are a drag on the taxpayer--[they pay into Social Security](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/05/business/05immigration.html), we have both agreed that they pay sales tax, and, most important of all:  they're here to work.   Can I say that again? *They're here to work.*  And like you said, they work for artificially low wages because they have no protection from public regulation or that sort of thing.  And they still make up a [significant percentage of our labor pool.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5250150).  

In other words, I am still not seeing any reason to buy into your argument that refugees are a drag on the economy and the taxpayer, other than the fact that you might crash into one and have to pay a bit more for insurance.    
Your logic would make sense, except that it ignores the systemic ways through which the United States has decimated the Mexican state through  free-trade treaties and the empowerment of drug cartels.  The same is true to an extent for many other Latin American nations as well.  

Even in a neo-liberal framework, free flow of immigration is a prerequisite.  You cannot have free trade without the free flow of labor.

I am not for complete free flow of immigration, of course; that has a whole host of problematic issues.  What I am for, however, is recognizing the context of illegal immigration from the South as a result of socio-economic violence, and treating them like people.    
Different in every situation. Many protests have the goal, stated or not, to be the victims of police brutality. Sometimes, you're not willing to do that much to provoke it; the less you do to provoke it, the more effective the rhetoric. For example, being beaten by the police for standing with arms locked is doing very little to provoke the police. It's hilarious that the police tried to claim that linking arms is violent protests.

Other times the bait for the police won't work. For example, if the cops hadn't beaten the people at all, linking arms or not, the message would not go nearly so far. As a result, some groups will be willing to do more, such as throwing bricks at the police. It's more effective at inviting violence, but makes the protesters look worse.

In conclusion, different groups are willing to do different things to encourage police brutality. And police react differently in many situations. (If they don't do anything, then the story doesn't make the news.)

I must say, the protesters in Berkeley are lucky that the cops used violence with such little provokation. I think it was idiodic to play into the hands of the protesters like that, but given how many crazy/homeless/militant-hippies exist in Berkeley, they would have camped out for weeks anyway. And I gotta say, I don't like the look of Sproul plaza with a Shanty town. Not a fan of the 'slum' look, personally.
Thank you for explaining, I would agree that socioeconomic status and the high school that applicants attend is important.  I also see one problem with your explanation.  I am in the College of Engineering so I don't know any Jenny Doe's.  But in the dorms last year I meet a few and I don't really want them here anyway.
What's wrong with excluding race from your metrics?  You are still getting 90% of the picture from the student, and race does not correlate as well as other metrics for academic disadvantage.  I don't think that it helps the situation as much as most affirmative action people seem to think it will.  In fact I think it mostly creates more division and drama, and promote distrust and bitterness between races.
Weeks? You underestimate hippie determination. How long did people live in those trees by Memorial Stadium?
They built that nice walkway from the courtyard place just off Bancroft to the Sproul Plaza steps and now I can't use it half the time because of Occupy
But I don't think you can accurately say you're getting the 90% picture. I, however, do agree the AA might create more division and drama.

They were missing 2 starters and one is their best player, a transfer from Texas Tech.  His name is Jaylen Tyson. Look up why he transferred his former coach racially abused him and his players
Looks like Cal upset Duke with the way they were celebrating postgame

Don’t worry bronny mad rn he gon clap us this season 💀💀
The other team were hitting shots that they had no business making. The good news is that (albeit against lesser competition) this team looks much better than last years. Players are in the right spot and offensively the ball is moving with purpose.
That tends to happen in Basketball. Basketball is a bit more balanced and unpredictable than, say, football.
Nobody ever heard of Davidson University before Steph Curry went there.
St Thomas isn’t a bad basketball school - they have an outside shot of going to the tourney this year
Supposedly we’re going to hear about our appeal of the waiver rejection on Thursday. Tyson was listed as a top 10 preseason small forward - if he gets cleared this team could be a bubble team
We’re already at 1/3 of last seasons win total
Isiah Collier looks really legit
They been to the NCAA tournament in the years 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1986, 1998, and 2002 before Steph Curry arrived. But I get what you mean.
He is a hooper. Hoping he can get in on Monday
Practically every team in the NCAA other than newcomers and absolute perpetual losers has been to the NCAA tournament,all you have to do is win your conference tournament.  But I don’t think Davidson is in the top 100 most well known programs.  Even West Coast conference teams kinda look down on them and the West Coast ain’t no ACC.
He got his waiver - he’s playing on Friday!"

Robert Reich's class, C103!
there was a beer pong decal when i was there...
Ling/CogSci C142 (""Language and Thought"").  Best non-EECS class I've ever taken.

Take Music 29! It's a really easy A, and you get to listen to cool music. No music knowledge or theory required :)
Physics for future presidents
If they're offering Anthro 160AC next semester, I really did enjoy taking that class. It fulfills both Arts/Lit and the AC requirement for those of you wondering.

It's a class about folklore, which includes things like folk speech (wtf/lol/etc.), proverbs (takes one to know one), and basically any other type of colloquialism people use. The class was super interesting and I actually found myself going to all of the classes when normally I'd just stay home and do other stuff (I'm premed so I have plenty of other stuff to be doing). Professor Briggs was one of the most traveled and wise professors I've had and his lectures were both well prepared and conveyed the information effectively. He does a great job of tying in relevant features from modern times, making it less of a dumb history class and more of a new way to look at the world.

The class isn't a complete cakewalk - there's no way you can ditch every class and get an A. But if you go to the lectures and at least skim the readings, the class isn't overly difficult because the concepts are fairly easy to understand. For me the class was refreshing because I've been hammering out class after class that I don't give two shits about so I can get into graduate school.
How is the workload for CS 10? I am also taking chem 1a/physics 7a and have no programming experience
Waitlist of 250...but I'm in it woooo
I WISH IT WOULD COME BACK! I'M 21 meow. :(
I heard that in the past, everyone on the waitlist has gotten into the class. 

And it's freakin' Robert Reich. Take it!"
