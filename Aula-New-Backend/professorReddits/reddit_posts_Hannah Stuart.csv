"Mechatronics Design ME102B, Fall or Spring",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ckz5ek/mechatronics_design_me102b_fall_or_spring/,2019-08-01 21:11:43,"Hey,

I thinking whether to take ME102B on the fall or spring. On the fall Hannah Stuart is the professor and in the spring it is Kazerooni.  

If I take it this fall I thinking about taking the advanced course with Kazerooni in the spring. 

Does anyone know anything about Hannah Stuart?","Haven't hear about Hannah Stuart, but I took it with Kaz in the spring, and it was super chill. I don't remember there being any exams or homework, the entire semester was devoted to working on your capstone project. Lectures were usually about different components and concepts you can use in a design. That being said, please go to lecture. People not going to lecture really bothered him and I think at one point he said he wanted to give a final exam if people continued to not show up, but never did."
