"Cal mathematics professor emerita Marina Ratner, 78, a Russian-Jewish émigré who defied conventional belief that mathematical genius is the purview of youth, died. Performing her greatest work after 50, she proved an influential dynamics theorem that helped two mathematicians win the Fields Medal.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/science/marina-ratner-dead-mathematician.html,2017-07-27 00:17:52,,"[deleted]
RIP, you were one cool professor, even if I failed your MATH 1B and had to retake it over the summer. I think your teaching helped me get an A the second time around...
It's been said that the trope of mathematicians peaking in their youth is only known for men.  Theres not enough data points yet for the women to draw such sweeping conclusions.  People like Ratner suggest the alternative hypothesis 
I took her class spring 06, fuck that shit, fuck that shit, fuck that shit

Aside from that she was very nice and sad to see her pass. "
