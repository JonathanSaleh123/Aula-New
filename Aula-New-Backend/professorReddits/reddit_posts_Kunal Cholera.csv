"Business, Data Science and Econ Students!",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c5ypn9/business_data_science_and_econ_students/,2024-04-16 19:34:00," 

In my time at Berkeley (and the nearly 100 units at community college) there has been a single standout GSI/professor, Kunal Cholera.

Kunal is a knowledgeable, insightful, and an incredibly passionate educator. He held an engineering leadership role at LinkedIn for over a decade and earned his MBA at Berkeley, so he understands these business and data principles on a practical and useful level. He even created a YouTube channel with summaries of Microecon and Macroecon textbook chapters that were invaluable to me in UGBA 101A and 101B.

I often found his sections/discussions of more interest/value than my lectures, and would often go to non-mandatory sections just because I enjoyed my time participating.

**WELL**, incredibly, he’s now been given the opportunity to teach his own classes!

* He is going to teach a summer course, ([ugba-96](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-summer-ugba-96-01d-lec-01d)) **Special Topics in Business Administration** (Data and Decisions) and also in Fall ([ugba-88](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-ugba-88-003-lec-003)) **Data and Decisions.** This would be great for lower division students.
* Personally, I am graduating this Spring, but I’ll probably stop by and audit one of his Data and Decisions classes in the summer! He is teaching lecture 3 of ugba-88 in Fall, lecture 1 and 2 are taught by other professors who are also great.
* Finally, he will co-teach ([ugba-104](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2024-fall-ugba-104-001-lec-001)) **Introduction to Business Analytics** in Fall for the second half of the class. Since ugba-104 is core class, there is a high chance this class will be full, but this is not the case for ugba-96 and ugba-88 which will only happen if there are 40 students, so sign up if you’re interested!

Small note: Kunal hasn’t asked me to post this, but for anyone interested in the following topics or are majoring in related fields, I cannot recommend Kunal enough.

And Kunal, if you're reading this, I hope you do mind me promoting you on your behalf and best of luck in your future classes!","[deleted]

Not sure, but I'll see what I can find out."
