How is CS170 with Alessandro Chiesa?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6y3j6/how_is_cs170_with_alessandro_chiesa/,2020-04-23 17:07:20,"Avishay Tal and Umesh Vazirani are teaching Fall 2020, and Alessandro Chiesa is teaching Spring 2021. I'm thinking of taking 170 Spring 2021, and was wondering if any of you have had any experience with Chiesa--what's he like? How's his grade distribution? Is he a good lecturer?","according to my friend who's in 170 rn, Chiesa is a god-tier professor.  Heard nothing but great things from him. He's a really effective and engaging lecturer, and is really knowledgeable.
Chiesa and his italian lessons are the best.
I like him better than Prof Nelson currently in 170. He gives concise and sharp mathematical justifications and reasoning, simple but not overwhelming in logical jumps for lecture. Approve"
Doable schedule for CS in Spring?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3n4k7n/doable_schedule_for_cs_in_spring/,2015-10-01 10:33:46,"Is taking
CS61C (Randy H. Katz; Vladimir Stojanovic)
CS160 (Bj√∂rn Hartmann)
CS170 (Alessandro Chiesa; Umesh Vazirani)
in Spring a reasonable workload? Or would replacing 160 with 188 (Peter Abbeel) be a better combination? Thanks in advance.","Seems doable. I think 188 and 170 have better synergy though, plus 160 and 61c are both project-based classes.
170 is not a difficult class. 
ehh

CS61C - boring and annoying

CS160 - I've beard bad things about the project-centered format

CS170 - boring and annoying

CS188 - boring and annoying
yeah I might switch out 160 for 188, thanks!
I think you mean

61C - oohh glorious eecs

CS160 - make dank eecs designs

CS170 - eecs theory so gr8

CS188 - dank pacman memes
That's entirely dependant on your personal preferences. For example, 61C is super interesting if you have any interest in how computers actually work. "
