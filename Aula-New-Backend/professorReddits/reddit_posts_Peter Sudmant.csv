Thoughts on IB 134L?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14z68c8/thoughts_on_ib_134l/,2023-07-13 21:26:13,"I'm contemplating enrolling in IB 134L (Practical Genomics) this fall, which is taught by Peter Sudmant. Although I've heard positive reviews about the professor, the course's difficulty level is a concern for me, particularly as I have no background in bioinformatics. According to Berkeleytime, the average grade for Fall 2022 was a B+. While the course material seems intriguing, I'm a premed student and must focus on maintaining a high GPA. I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have taken this class before.","ive taken it. it is a super good class. def worth taking it if you are interested. the professors are amazing. you dont need to know anything about bioinfomatics. to get a good grade is not that hard. however, you must finish the lab (homework) and put effort into the final project. they dont expect you to get any astonishing discovery. just expressing your effort throughout is enough to get high scores. exams are not the majority of grade and are fair.
okay perfect thanks for the info! I signed up for the class."
thoughts on IB 134L??,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v8rcjc/thoughts_on_ib_134l/,2022-06-09 14:25:17,"I'm thinking about taking IB 134L (Practical Genomics) in fall with Peter Sudmant. I've heard great things about the professor but I'm worried about how hard the class will be, especially bc I have no prior experience w/ bioinformatics. On berkeleytime the avg for Fall 2021 was a B and my friend who took the class last year got a B. I think the material sounds really interesting but I'm premed and I want to prioritize my grades. Has anyone taken the class who can give their input/advice?","I took it fall 2020, it was my first UD and I took it concurrently with bio 1B, I was very out of my depth but the professors (we also had Tarvin at the time, not sure if she’s still teaching it too) did a really great job getting the information across. The exams were tough but fair, and the projects carried the final grades. I highly recommend to get a taste of genomics and coding in a biological setting, but I wouldn’t describe it as an easy A. If you’re prioritizing A’s over the content, I’d recommend something else, there are definitely easier classes.
I took it fall 2021 and it was an amazing class. I've learnt so much from both professors and found so much unexpected joy in working on each lab and project.bits not an easy A by any means, but if you're priority is learning and preparing yourself for learning how to do real word genomic analysis, then I highly recommend the class. The GSIs chosen for the class are also super passionate about teaching and helping you, ut feels like you always have support when youre struggling!
In the same boat as you. It seems interesting, but hard? Also, as an IB major it knocks out both a Group A and lab requirement so that's why it's enticing to take.
hey! would you mind elaborating on your experience in the class? I'm an MCB major, but I've taken some CS lower divs and data 8 and wanna dip my toes into bioinformatics (haven't had any coding experience in a biological setting tho). What kind of skills does the class teach? is it something that I could use in my research lab, for instance? what is genomics analysis? do you guys use a particular language (eg. Python)? I'm super interested in this class but unsure what to expect, so any help would be appreciated!
same!!! I have only these two recs left so I'm thinking about taking this course too for that reason aha!
I don't know if I should bite the bullet and take it or be more strategic and take two other courses. The problem is that the other lab courses don't seem enticing enough?
yeah.... the other lab courses are so random and not the best... I think I might take this class bc I feel like it'd be super useful for a career in science as opposed to the other labs which are pretty niche like anatomy, physio, or field labs. Honestly the fact this class is group A and Lab is soooooo enticing so I might just bite the bullet! LOL. Down to study w you if you decide to take it :D
How was the class?
Yeah, I echo whatever you said. My friend was in IB 131L and it was such a nightmare that she ended up dropping the course later in the semester. And even the somewhat bearable ones have a 10 page research paper or something or require special enrollment or something. With that said, I think I'm going to take it and if you are too, down to study as well.
Hey, so did you end up enrolling in the course?"
