Taking CS61b + ee16b vs taking CS61b+70?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/esx5zb/taking_cs61b_ee16b_vs_taking_cs61b70/,2020-01-23 10:28:28,"Hi. I'm an intended L&S CS and math double major and I enrolled in all 3 of these classes intending to drop one and I have no idea which to drop. I finished all my breadths through CC so I want to declare cs earlier, but at the same time Murat arcak is teaching ee16b this semester and I do want to take it with him. Alternatively (and I doubt this would be feasible but idk) I could take all 3 and nothing else. What would you guys recommend doing? Thanks

also for background I got a comfortable A in cs61a and slightly less comfortable A in ee16a","I think typically all three would be doable, but sahai’s 70 and hilfinger’s 61b will both be more work than usual. I’d recommend doing 61b and 70 together so you can declare by the end of the semester. If you got As in 61a/16a you probably don’t need to worry about not being able to get a 3.3 with this.
yeah if you're in a hurry, it seems like you should be able to do all 3 and get your 3.3+.

Just remember that if you do all 3, you'll have to do the 3 finals within 24 hours (Wed 7pm, Thu 8am, Thu 3pm).
I'm, for some reason, leaning towards 3 at the moment but I still have time before the drop deadline so if (or more likely when) I drop one I'll probably stick with 61b and 70. ty!
I didn't even consider that. that would be a terrible finals week, but having all 3 classes would be so nice (in terms of getting stuff done, not workload)
On the positive side, it’s not the worst spacing in the world, I’ve known students who have had to take 3 finals on the same day.  Also, despite the raised grade bins, if you’re an outstanding student, chances are you’ll probably still not need to stress out much for the 61B Final..  And if you’re at an A or A- for 61B it’s unlikely you’ll need to stress out for 70 either.
thanks for the confidence boost! I hope sahais workload isn't too heavy. if I can handle the next few weeks I'll probably stay in all 3 then."
