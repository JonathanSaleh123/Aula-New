What's your favorite class at Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/asxxn0/whats_your_favorite_class_at_berkeley/,2019-02-20 19:10:59,"Somebody asked this to the subreddit 6 years ago, but Cal is a different place now and I feel this question should be updated. 

So I ask you r/berkeley, what is your favorite class at Berkeley?","Data 8. Was a great introduction to basic programming and basic data exploration. Data 100’s a close second, really enjoyed how the projects actually felt like projects where you could apply everything you learned.
Soc 110: Organizations and Institutions. Lecturer was Linus Huang.
CS262: Advanced Topics in Operating Systems (really its distributed systems). The stuff you learn in 162 is fundamental, but 40 years old. Turns out systems people have been doing some cool shit since then. 
CS 161: Computer Security with David Wagner and Raluca Ada Popa. Well taught. Practical, useful information.

Stat 153: Time Series with [Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/), who is apparently no longer at Berkeley. I don't retain as much of this class but I really liked this instructor. He also taught me stat 135.

Philosophy 6: [Human Being, God and Society in Western Literature with Alex Madva](http://alexmadva.com/sites/default/files/Madva%20Phil%206%20Syllabus.pdf). Took this as a breadth early in my career. Wish I could have paid more attention or taken it when I was more intellectually mature. Ironically, since I've been reading more recently, I find a lot of use for the ideas that did reach me during this class, and it's class whose lessons I think the most about these days. If only I had someone as smart as professor Madva to guide me through everything I read.

Assorted math classes, starting with Math 1A with the notorious Alexander Coward. I found him a perfectly good, even above-average instructor. I never really was in tune with or had a side on the (pedagogical) controversy involving him, but he taught me how to write proofs and through lower-division math courses I gained a new appreciation for mathematics in an abstract sense of what it is, and how we use it. In light of that I'm not sure what to make of my not doing any math since graduation. Oh well.

I think these classes are among those that I consider the ""payoff"" to having gone to UC Berkeley instead of an adequate state school. Of course, I haven't gotten a bachelor's degree anywhere else, so I can't say for certain, but based on a vague sense of having spoken with friends who did go to other schools, these classes I felt were taught better than I would have gotten elsewhere.
IB35AC with Hlusko. This class uses biology to look at culture and racial issues that have faced America since its inception. Professor Hlusko does research in that is directly related to the topics covered in the course. 

The course text is “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” which I think everyone should read whether you take the class or not. 

This class made me think about changing my major, it was that good. 
Ib137 human endocrinology! Professor tyrone hayes is such a unique and amazing professor who really cares about his students above all else. The class is also really challenging and satisfying in that way

Math 105
EEP C118 - Introductory Applied Econometrics with Sofia Villas-Boas. Probably the first class that did not make me hate life. I was like whoa, there are professors that are genuinely nice to you and actually care that you understand the material? She's a literal godsend and is probably the best professor in the ARE department. There's a lack of arrogance, and I wholeheartedly appreciate that b/c she was always highly approachable. She also made me interested in research.
CS 61A. While changed since then, it provides foundation of CS in a way no other class did.

[Brian Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harvey_(lecturer\)), who is now semi-retired, is both an amazing lecturer, and someone who actually cares about the students.
IB 104 (Natural History of the Vertebrates) was a life changing class for a lost pre-med and gave me a passion for nature and biology in general. Not to mention the class usually has 3 professors and 3+ GSIs to like 30 students (after people drop because of the workload). I don't think very many other classes on campus can compare to that student:teacher ratio. And the professors are always incredibly awesome and passionate.

CS170
Going to hw parties with my friends was honestly the highlight of my week
Math 104. Grueling, but a rite of passage.
Physics 137A with Andrew Charman.  Seeing Quantum Mechanics with a more rigorous mathematical framework than in Chemistry was an eye opener to how beautifully mathematics described such a complex topic
LA1 ! 
I guess I should answer this question as OP. Data 100 last semester with Josh Hug and Fernando Perez. Made me want to be a fucking data scientist.
CS 184 (computer graphics) for sure
IB160-Evolution
Math 104 with Charles Pugh
cs61a!
Philosophy 125 (Metaphysics) with Shamik Dasgupta is so, so enjoyable. Rather than focusing on ancient/modern (as in, Renaissance-ish age) metaphysics (which I was expecting and also totally dig), we talk a lot about pretty contemporary metaphyical questions (the existence of god (""god""), space, time, special/general relativity, realism, persistence of identity), bringing into the conversation considerations from Newton, Galileo (more or less), and other hard science-type folks. Not only is the content absolutely gripping, but his presentation of the material, and his super fair grading system are so, so good. I'm a big fan.

Unfortunately, he's only subbing in as the lecturer for the class this semester (some other professor usually heads the course), but I can see anything he teaches as being really enjoyable with him at the helm. I believe he also teaches Philosophy of Science.

&#x200B;

I also found Philosophy 12A (Intro to Logic) really fun, surprisingly. Then again, I had silver fox Seth Yalcin for the instructor (+ a super cute, sweet GSI uwu), so that probably helped.
I second this. Data 8 opened many doors for me, and I’m now a data scientist. I’m super happy with how things turned out having taken D8 as essentially a “fun” class with no idea what it was about. 
I took Data 8 last semester! How many semesters did you wait before Data 100?
Linus is fucking great
Lmao I was in that class for the first 2 weeks (was waiting to get into music 26ac) and she is super nice and teaches the class in an interesting way. all I can remember her is saying ""teeth and breasts"" all throughout the first class tho
Does he talk about his research in this class? Lol one of my friends worked in his lab (seems like a great guy) and I remember hearing about how conspiracy theorists spun it into the whole ""chemicals in the water making frogs gay"" thing.
Big fan of Zook! Really appreciated how transparent he was about the quizzes and essays, so you could focus on being present during the lectures and learning rather than memorizing and cramming later on. I remember turning in his midterm and walking out in under 8 minutes that class; still remember some of those questions a few years later because they were all interesting “trivia” facts rather than obscure “testing you because I can” questions, lol. One of those classes I’ll recommend to anyone, regardless if they have any previous interest or experience in SE Asia or Poli Sci. 
Zook is phenomenal. I took one class with him freshman year and have been wanting to take another since then (currently a junior). A level-headed dude who took any (and I mean any) comment or questions seriously, and was a humorous, down-to-earth dude who'd be easy to talk in pm any context.
With Pugh? I loooove Pugh
This class has also been taught since the Joseph grinnell days and has specimens as old as like 1881 perfectly preserved. I think he was even the first professor and we still use his style of field notes in that class to this day. It’s a great class but you the bird section is brutal 
Hassner is an excellent lecturer and human being. Wish I could have taken 123H with him instead of just taking War! my last semester with a group of friends, oh well. (You’re making me miss Cal classes, dammit!)
 i preferred cs70 high-key
I’m in this class right now, but having skipped 7C the beginning was a little intimidating.  So far what I have learned is amazing and Charman great as showing the simplicity in the complexity of quantum.
I third this! Took it last semester as a freshman and it was super fun, great way to combine stats knowledge with coding! (took ap stats in hs and knew some basic coding beforehand so this class was pretty easy but still very applicable to real life!)
Two because I took 61a the following semester.
why is he reviewed so badly on RateMyProfessor?
She’s pretty obsessed with teeth and breasts, they’re kinda the theme for the class (and her research). She’s a great lecturer and loves her research. 
At the end of the semester he devotes a whole lecture to telling us his story about his research and battle with syngenta over atrazine!
For sure, the class is by no means easy. The lab sections were hard and the field notes took forever, but it was such a rewarding experience in the end!"
