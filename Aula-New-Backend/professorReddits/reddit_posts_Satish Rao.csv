Satish Rao’s opinion on the EECS Protest Yesterday,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/trspgy/satish_raos_opinion_on_the_eecs_protest_yesterday/,2022-03-29 16:23:14,On the slack Rao says “FWIW. If someone wants to relay on Reddit that I for one am inspired by the people who showed up”.,"Rao has always been on the students’ side, good guy
We love Rao.
Rao has been advocating for increased funding for EECS and CS, as well as exposing the horrible delegation of funds for many years now. It’s his statement many years ago on the way admins take so much money, which corrupts the funding for programs and courses, that opened my eyes to the way universities are mismanaged. We keep creating admin positions and they keep finding ways to line their pockets and grow, while at the expense of professors and funding growing curriculums.
Wow I feel noticed. finally some redemption
where was the eecs protest even advertised? i had no idea it was happening ngl
Respect to him.

fwiw it means for what it's worth"
"Professor Satish Rao: ""In light of the rise of UCLA to the No. 1 public university club, it is worth noting that UCLA’s administration appears to consume a significantly smaller slice of their pie. If UC Berkeley were as efficient as UCLA, we could easily add 100 faculty to campus today.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/15/uc-berkeleys-drop-ranking-tied-administrative-spending/,2017-09-15 12:42:54,,"Agreed. This campus's administration is so damn bloated. I used to work a job here at the university library and there were so many useless employees that could've been consolidated into 1 or 2 positions. I can't even imagine how bloated and useless other positions are. Like do we seriously need a jr chancellor to the vice chancellor or some shit like that. 
Gawd. I am so triggered by this. I still remembered the layers of red tape I had to go through to get paid as a GSI. 2 HR departments (Haas and CSS), recheck tax status with registrar, do the ""training"" again just because I didn't GSI in *summer*. Three different people handling your case to get training done.

All this while stressing out about your dissertation and trying to get co-authored work written/work with RAs.

Streamline the paper work and get rid of red tape bloat and then get rid of the irrelevant red tape staff. Pay academic staff and channel more funding to students.
People are not upset enough about the administrative apparatchiks at Berkeley. They don't do anything (like I know people say this and it's become a meme but in all truth they really don't), they eat money, and they take up space in terms of offices and buildings. 

Who are these people? Seriously, why are they here and what is their purpose?

It's also an issue of campus culture. Middle management is the source of all that is infuriating about administration. Really, it's the fault of top administration who want to sit in the chair without doing the job. Then it goes one step further and another... and another... before you know it, your deputy vice chancellor hires someone else to do his job for him, and on it goes... 
> sad

i fucking love rao
middle management bloat is an eater of nations. Fuck this beaureaucratic BULLSHIT! Management by fuckin dipshit mandarins who don't even like learning.

Students should be protesting this.
The administrative staff has grown from ~500 to ~1200 since the year 2000. I hope our ratings slip is a wake up call to Chancellor Christ that motivates her to clean house.
http://www.dailycal.org/2014/05/30/former-uc-berkeley-administrator-charged-grand-theft-embezzlement/
Spot on. Further more, there's a program on campus the school pours millions into that frequently goes over budget and always gets a free pass for going over budget. Hmm... perhaps that program should just learn to pay for itself (which would justify its supposed importance). Hmmm...
We should have the regents force UCLA to give us some of their $$$
Satish Rao has to be my favorite CS professor. People as chill as him are rare in this field.
Welcome to socialism
Assistant Vice Chancellor to the Vice Chancellor of Assistant Vice Chancellors
Personally, I think most of the graft is at the top.
Especially more to graduate students. Do you have a union, or anything in the works along those lines? The mistreatment of graduate students is terrifying.
Protests are rarely indigenous to the student population. Case in point, the middle management of the bloated college of chemistry didn't want to lose their jobs so they riled up their students and protested -- they won. 

And I think a lot of the recent protests are about the humanities and social sciences departments riling up their students to keep their departments relevant in the face of potential budget cuts. Seriously, students should realize that very little of their thoughts and opinions are really their own.

Middle management sucks but don't underestimate them -- they really are the eater of nations, and clever about keeping their little jobs. Stopping their proliferation is already an outrageously ambitious task, let alone scaling back.
Good b8 m8
I'd blame mismanagement and corruption before I go all the way to socialism.
socialism is when the government does stuff
nice 1
evidence?
College of Chem students had plenty of reasons to be upset about a dissolution of the college, there was no need to ""rile"" us. In any case I wouldn't really call anything that CoC students did a ""protest"".An undergraduate student did an online petition against it that became nearly viral, but other than that it consisted of students complaining about it on Facebook.
And the more the government does stuff the socialismer it gets
It's 2017! Who needs evidence when you can have feelings? 
Why do we need a CoC?
From the perspective of the undergrad chem and chem bio students: we don't want to form part of L&S. We don't want have the seven breadth requirement, crappy advising, and getting a BA while being science majors. It also makes the department unique from a historical stand point. Professors and graduate students also like the existence of CoC because it allows for easier collaboration between the Chem-E and chem departments. "
Who will be teaching CS61A next semester?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1638nql/who_will_be_teaching_cs61a_next_semester/,2023-08-27 18:39:53,"Hello, I was wondering who will be teaching cs61A next semester? I am currently enrolled in cs61a with Prof. Satish Rao but he honestly does not seem like that great of a lecturer or at explaining concepts. I will be dropping that class to instead focus on my other three classes: Data 8, Math 1a, and a GE, which is around 15 units for me. As a data science major, I want to also ensure I am prepared to take cs61A, so i will just be taking data 8 and focusing alot on math1a since i have never taken calculus before. 

Given this, does anyone know who will be teaching 61A next semester? I hope it is a better professor who can explain concepts better, such as Prof. DeNero. Does Spring semester 61A usually have equally good professors or not? Is there any disadvantage to taking 61A in the spring as opposed to taking it in the fall? Is spring 61A harder or about the same? Thanks","Idk bout Denero teaching next semester but you could always watch his old lectures parallel to what you’re learning in class
[deleted]
Those 3 technicals in the same semester would be very difficult for me, but anyways you can watch DeNeros lectures online. Also, I learned a lot of 61a by going to discussion (extra discussions too) and also lab assignments. Most of the time I didn’t understand what was going on in lecture, but there’s other ways to learn the information
slave unique spoon grab one piquant expansion label fragile direful -- mass deleted all reddit content via https://redact.dev
DeNero is goated and I don’t know if any other prof who is going to match him. Just hope DeNero opens his section to non-CS majors next sem.
In the draft schedule it says Denero but who knows
Or just watch his current lectures, they are streamed and prob recorded or even just go to his lectures
It’s ‘25 btw.
P.s. Rao is one of our best professors though I haven’t taken an official class with him, I’ve only watched sat in some of his lectures and occasionally bump into him. He’s personally told me he loves when students visit office hours and wish people asked more questions. So far there’s only been 2 days of 61A instruction this semester, have an open mind before coming to such a harsh judgement.
He’s teaching non CS students this semester
[deleted]
what if you’re only doing data 8 and math 1a and a ge? is that managable?
On EECS 101, I remember the post where they mentioned that DeNero's class is restricted to EECS/CS until adjustment period. Of course non-CS students an get in at that point,but I expected to see little movement given the popularity of DeNero over the other section.
Just trying to help you 🙄
Math 1a is tough, and data8 can be conceptually tough and some projects will be a bit long but both of these are manageable if you make a good schedule throughout the week for assignments and self or group study. 

61a next semester will be a good idea but I would wait another week or two, see how you hold up with juggling these 3 classes. it would still be good to take these 3 this semester since it would help with degree progress, but if it’s too much then data8 and math1a would be a good start for your data science degree. Wishing you a great start of the semester!
When is adjustment period? I’m non CS and I’m in from day 1. Was #80 on the waitlist
dang i’m kinda scared to take math 1a because i haven’t taken calculus before (even in high school) and im scared i may be lacking some fundamentals as i have only take up to pre calculus. should i enroll in math 32(precalculus) first or just try my best in math1a? also how time consuming and tough is data 8? its my first programming language (python) so i’m scared i might fall behind. thanks
Adjustment period started 08/14.
And you are right, he is a great teacher :)
Just do your best in 1a. It's hard to get below a C in most classes if you put in effort. Do all the work and grind old tests before exams, you'll most likely be fine."
CS or EECS for unit ceiling at Cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16haesd/cs_or_eecs_for_unit_ceiling_at_cal/,2023-09-12 19:08:13,"Hello, 

I'm considering transferring to Cal from a CCC for EECS or CS and I'm curious about the experiences of others in managing the 5-semester timeframe set by the CoE. 

Has anyone found this time limit restrictive, especially when aiming to enroll in a series of highly rated courses such as: 

\- CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory (offered by Satish Rao or Anant Sahai)

\- CS170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (by Christos Papadimitriou)

\- CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (taught by a team including Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, and Dan Klein)

\- CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning (with Johnathon Shewchuk)

\- CS161: Computer Security (Nick Weaver)

\- CS168: Networking (Scott Shenker)

\- CS186: Databases (Joe Hellerstein)

\- CS164: Programming Languages and Compilers (Paul Hilfinger)

\- CS162: Operating Systems (Ion Stoica)

\- CS184: Computer Graphics (Ren Ng)

Would it be better to apply for CS in the College of Letters since I received most of my credits through AP or dual enrollment during HS?

I would love to take all of these courses if feasible. Would it be better to consider taking some of them (if possible) or their equivalents during graduate school instead?

Thank you!","I don’t think it matters since CS is direct admit now. It seems doable in 5 semesters.
Typically you’ll want to take 2 techs a semester and transfers usually redo cs61a and Cs61C, many do 61b as well. Also, eecs16a and 16b are mandatory for EECS, so basically junior year is for lower divs. Then with three semesters left you can take 6 techs comfortably or 8/9 very uncomfortably (or using summers). There are two CCCs that can give you credit for 61C and 61B I think.
So does that mean that CS also must be completed in 5 semesters? Is it not in the College of Letters and Science?
The 5 semester ceiling is only for CoE transfer students in EECS. 

For L&S CS, you can go as many semesters as you want as long as you are under 130 units (for a single major).  In reality, it would be extremely difficult to go over say 6 semesters without going over 130 units.
No CS has a unit ceiling policy where you can keep extending if you have <= 130 units."
CS70 with Rao,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/goylrc/cs70_with_rao/,2020-05-22 21:18:17,How is cs70 with Professor Satish Rao? Is he a good professor?,"I enjoyed his lectures but they can be a bit fast but shows you what you need to know. Some people hate his lectures though. Probably either love or hate sort of thing. He sure does make a mean exam though.
I agree with the love/hate analysis. Personally I loved him. One of my favorite professors here for his unmatched humor and how he really tried to push the bounds of understanding during lecture. Like he on the regular goes more in depth in lecture than you need for tests, sort of like a statement that if you want to really understand something, it's out there for you to get without hand-holding. If you can read his slides without getting confused, then you have truly learned the material; I don't think you can apply the same test for other professors.
Watch some of his lectures first to see if you vibe with the style. I can tell you, I did not.
his lecture style is rapid-fire. it was hard for me to follow sometimes because I was trying to take notes via pen/paper. it's probably a better idea to have a tablet and just jot notes down on the slides he uses (lots of people do this). also, try to read the notes before going to lecture. he lectures assuming you've read them. you don't have to understand everything but at least have a high level understanding of the topic that will be lectured on. the exams were pretty difficult for me. i'm not sure if the exams were designed to be lengthy but I've heard people struggling to finish as well.
Not sure about 70, I had Rao for 188, and it was terribly boring. He seems like a perfectly nice and caring person, but his lectures were so ridiculously dry it tainted my view of AI. Mostly just because he seemed unprepared and was just reading off slides. Half the time it seemed like he was seeing the slides for the first time. I didn't find his exams or HW particularly difficult, but lectures were borderline unwatchable. I feel kind of bad saying this, cause he seems like a great guy, just not a great lecturer in my opinion."
Trying to decide on a Professor Recommendation,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/118r0yj/trying_to_decide_on_a_professor_recommendation/,2023-02-21 22:30:40,"I'm in the process of applying to transfer out of Berkeley to another school, and I'm figuring out which professors I should ask for a recommendation. I need two, and they specifically have to be from a math or science professor. My main problem is that all my classes were huge, and I honestly don't think attending office hours every so often helped much to get my professors to notice me. I was wondering if anyone had experiences on getting recommendations from the following professors, as well as advice on how to approach asking them for the recommendation. Currently, these are my only options:

1. Alexander Paulin(Took Math 1B last semester with him, got an A-)
2. John DeNero or Hany Farid(Currently taking CS61A with them, doing alright in the class)
3. Satish Rao(Currently taking CS70 with him, could do better, but not terrible)
4. Emiliano Gomez(Currently taking Math 53 with him, could do better in the class ngl)

Thank you for any help in advance.","Paulin for sure — I’d recommend him even if you got a lower grade. He’s a genuinely good guy who would always go out to help a student 

Denero would probably not agree to write you one given 61A is such a large class, or even if he does I bet it’ll be pretty generic and thus less impactful 

Not sure about Rao but I’ve heard good things from Gomez so I’d shoot my shot with him
Thank you so much for the input! I think I'm gonna take your word and reach out to Paulin & probably Gomez. I think it's a little easier to approach the latter, since I have class with him, but how do you suggest I approach Paulin? Should I just email him, go to one of his OHs, or something else? I'd also appreciate any tips on how I should say it."
Four EECS technicals for first semester?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hqj36e/four_eecs_technicals_for_first_semester/,2020-07-13 09:59:29,"Hi, I'm an incoming EECS freshman. Is it insane if I take CS 61A, CS 61B, CS 70, and EECS 16A first semester?

I have a lot of coding experience (I've built multiple apps) and I've won awards in coding competitions (Gold division in USACO). Plus I've done proofs before in a math summer program. And since the professors are John DeNero, Josh Hug, Satish Rao, and Gireeja Ranade respectively (which I've heard are the easier professors for each of those classes), is it doable?","Tbh tho... finishing nearly all CS prereqs in your first semester is some major clout. Might as well throw in ee16b in there too for the true speedrun
Denero is not easier for 61a, people just like his teaching style.
I could see 3 (say 61A, 70, 16A) if you’re a solid independent worker, but that still leaves you with no time for anything else.  The experience in general helps, but the coding expertise is somewhat mitigated in 61A because of all the templaticizing (for lack of a better word).
Frankly, if you've made usaco gold, you won't find 61a/b hard.

Have you made aime multiple times? Would you consider yourself to be a (very) strong math student? If so I'd say this is pretty doable. I know people with similar-ish backgrounds who've done 61a/16a/70 + breadth, and if I could redo my freshman fall I'd probably take that courseload. 61b will essentially be breadth-level workload for you with your background, since 1) you're a fast coder and hug's projects aren't that long and 2) usaco gold means all the data structures material will be review.

Also, it's not like you can do anything fun this fall anyways, might as well grind lol.
That is insane, even with your experience. It’s the amount of work those 4 classes together have that would make your life miserable.

At most take 3 technicals, and add a H/SS or AC or R&C for your last class if you are really rushing to get through your requirements. Also you should look through the class websites (just google them) to get an idea of what stuff might be new and maybe even take a look at the hw and projects.
Add CS189 with Sahai too while you're at it. Don't want you to miss out on a legendary teacher teaching some Machine Learning.
baaaad idea
If you're confident, you can do CS 61A, EECS 16A and CS 70 + a humanities class; wouldn't recommend adding CS 61B to that. But remember you have other requirements beyond the CS classes. More common dedicated EECS schedules are like CS 61A + EECS 16A + Math 53 + Humanities and CS 61B + CS 70 + EECS 16B + something else for the spring which is a more balanced schedule.
dont do it.
This was my friend's first semester schedule, except he had one more AC class. He was plat in USACO and did some google challenge (basically like you). You'll be fine :^) Good luck bear!
It’s quite possible you could do it, I had a friend who had similar CS experience going in and they got through that exact schedule their first semester pretty effortlessly. But I would say it’s a risk, and won’t get you exceptionally far ahead compared to taking three.

Although that’s far above what I or most people are capable of / ready for at Berkeley you seem to have a very strong background and people of that type can sometimes pull some crazy stuff off if they don’t get distracted or lose discipline from what I’ve seen from friends and classmates.
yeah would not do that. Is there a reason you want to take all 4 in the first semester?
F
if you're trying to do any clubs / research most definitely would not recommend this. it's not about the difficulty of the classes but rather the sheer workload - 61A/61B tend to have conflicting project deadlines - CS70 is a pain in the ass and EE16A isn't a walk in the park either. you could do 61A/70/16A if you have a strong discrete math/linear algebra background but don't push yourself too hard first semester - you are just discovering college after all!
With OP's background 61b will likely be lighter than most breadths. USACO gold means he already knows all the data structures material.
There's something to be said for balance and variety in a schedule beyond workload + I know Hug's projects are easier than Hilfinger (with whom I took 61B) but that's still going to be a decent amount of work even knowing the material."
"EECS professors worry that hundreds of students will not find seats. The Temporary Academic Support budget funding GSIs decreased this year by 33%. Satish Rao: ""Faculty are really, really appalled. They really want to teach these students and are being denied over really small sums of money.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/08/24/campus-budget-issue-prompts-concern-eecs-faculty-students-enrollment/,2016-08-24 22:22:18,,"This is blatantly absurd. Administrative decisions like this have the ability to cripple the university, send faculty fleeing, and cut alumni donations from a rather wealthy department. The numbers being discussed here, by the way, will seem so obscenely insignificant when compared to nearly any other campus budget decision--especially the newsworthy ones. Disgusted.  
Well, this sucks.
Christos Papadimitriou's comment on this article is incredible. Props to him, and Rao, for fighting for the undergrads who are getting screwed over this semester.

Seriously, I'm going to end up in a different CS course than what would be in my best interest and I'm graduating at the end of this semester, so goodbye future donations from me.

What do you think the most promising engineering major is right now?  I thought EECS was still a fairly lucrative major.
Exactly right, that's why I study humanities, that way I know for a fact I'll have a low paying job when I graduate. "
Is this a bad idea?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d9c6ws/is_this_a_bad_idea/,2024-06-06 00:04:37,"Context: I'm an incoming freshman with quite a bit of CS & Math experience. I have pretty much all the undergrad coursework for math & cs majors (except for 61A and 70) through my local CC and am coming in with 70 transfer units (basically a junior). I have experience taking large workloads in high school (10 course workloads: 6 AP's and 4 college courses concurrently for a year)

Do you think this is a reasonable schedule for my first semester or is it too many classes too close together. Also, if you have any recommendations for classes or specific professors please let me know.

https://preview.redd.it/44eiavg1fw4d1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=360c8ba442ea6849e644a25433f9fca136af0b7e","Whenever someone tells me they're gonna take 4 techs, I ask what they're taking and try to convince them to pick easier classes or make sure they can handle it. Whenever someone tells me they're gonna take 5 or more, I just sit back and say nothing because

1. they are cracked out of their goddamn minds, guaranteed
2. they literally always do fine, never seen one of em do poorly even with that much workload
3. I cannot stop them. nothing I say will change their minds.

So yeah, go ahead :)
huge difference if you're eecs or cs 

1. cs majors will not be able to enroll any of these upper divs until you finish 61ab 70

2. now if you are an eecs major, obviously i don't truly know how much cs and math you know but you can always look over the topics on all of their course websites to see what you know and don't know. that said it is honestly doable to do everything besides 186 if you put in the work. not to say 186 is incredibly difficult but the projects will definitely be time consuming and take up time needed for example 70 or 170 psets. if you believe you know much of the content in those classes many ppl can't stop you. but many ppl have a very similar hs background to you and they struggle with the triple crown 61b 16b 70. think of it what you will, the choice is ultimately yours.
Are you even going to be able to enroll in those upper divisions? I'm not sure what the policy is these days. Take out 188 and you'll be good btw, that class is not known for being a good use of time.
as someone who came into college with a similar amount of experience (in math it cs) you’re gonna want to enjoy your time in college but if you do this as soon as you start you’re gonna feel like you’re missing out. id say take it a bit easier, but you can prolly manage to get good grades in the classes if you really apply uourseld
First of all, you need your check if you are declared for CS from Day 1.  The rules are a bit different on this now that CS has moved to its own school.  If not, you can’t take any upper division classes until you are officially declared for CS. 

Secondly you need to understand the prerequisites.  170 is a complete hard stop without 70.  You shouldn’t take 186 without 61C.  188 is a no-go without 70. 

Thirdly, this is Berkeley.  The classes are infinitely harder than any course you have ever taken, even the beginning classes.  This is not community college, this is not some run of the mill university.  There are no easy courses in CS at Berkeley.  All CS classes will either have high workload, tremendous difficulty with average test scores around 50%, or in most cases, both. Don’t let the high GPAs fool you.  Even taking 61A and 70 together your very first semester is iffy unless you’ve done some sort of competitive math or equivalent. 

No one will recommend taking 4 CS technicals, much less 5.  My kid had a similar profile to you. Actually quite a few CS students have a similar profile. He actually took 4 technicals in 3 of his semesters at Berkeley. (Did it after freshman year).  He did pretty well a couple of the times, but one semester he had a nervous breakdown.  If you’re going to do so many technicals, do it after your first semester. 

One final note on registration - you won’t be able to get into 186 until maybe later, it’s already full.  The best laid plans of everyone is usually messed up because of demand and lack of resources.  And also depends tremendously on your registration position.  In other words, you should have backup classes in hand.
OP you are extremely underestimating the rigor of UC Berkeley. Quitely take 61A and 70 and explore the opportunities on campus. You have 4 years then why rushing to ruin your GPA right on the start. You can easily graduate in 3. If you are not EECS you can't take CS upper div anyways. No one stop you taking 4 upper div technicals once you are declared.
will you come in as declared in CS/EECS? if not then you won't be able to enroll in the upper div CS courses
if your high school/cc courses were known for being rigorous then you’re probably chilling, if not then i’d consider maybe swapping in an easier breadth class or some other requirement to be safe since you’ll end up having to take those anyways

honestly if i were you though i’d skip 188 to just do 4 techs this semester and use the time for a research lab or clubs, then do 189 next semester. Ive been told that 189 should end up kind of covering most 188 topics as long as ur a fast learner and willing to do some learning outside of lecture.
Go for it. If you crash and burn, well ya learned a lesson. If you succeed, then you know what you can handle and are going to go places.
Do you have comp math experience? What the other guy in this thread said basically.
I mean it depends on you. Tldr, this is roughly a 20-60 hrs per week workload depending on how good you are. 

61A is probably a non issue for you.

Cs70 is a non issue if you have comp math experience.

Cs170 is a non issue if you have competitive coding experience. 

Cs188 is a bit shallow, projects are spoon fed so don't take much time

Cs186 projects are somewhat of a waste of time.

Here is a rough breakdown of the time you'd need to spend per week on average (assuming you are cracked and watch lecures on 2x speed)

Cs61a - 3 hours
Cs70 - 3 hours
Cs170 - 4 hours 
Cs188 - 4 hours
Cs186 - 6 hours (debugging time)
Total = 20 hours per week

The times calculated are assuming you know the answer instantly for all homrwork problems and the only bottleneck is physically writing the answer out.

If you don't have prior experience, you can easily net +10 hours per week for each class due to getting stuck, being stupid, or having a bad teacher.
So you are potentially looking at 20+40 = 59 hours per week.

I mean you could go for this schedule if you want. You picked out 2 lower divs plus three easy upper divs. This seems like a schedule I would do if I could turn back time to freshman year.
For your first point, is it true even if you were admitted directly to cs?
yes
I would like to do research, but I don't know how I would get into any lab in my first semester. Is it just cold emailing or are there any programs open?
Yo suggesting five technicals could take only 20 hours of outside work time a week is actually bonkers. I’ve always seen the “for every credit hour, study for 2-4 hours outside of class” and while that specific measurement is def up for debate, that seems much more reasonable
yes, you have a reserved spot in the cdss cs major. But you aren’t declared until you finish ur pre reqs, so you can’t take any upper div cs (probably spring for you)
Ya, but u can look into 270 instead of 170, which is probably more interesting for you and is more project-based than exam-based. Grad classes are usually open to anyone that the Professor okays and ime that’s very easy to get
Tbh I don't know cuz the new CDSS policies aren't exactly clear, you can probably check your calcentral to see if the CS major is on your profile. That'll tell if you can apply to upper divs or not.

but please have fun for your first semester in college. this isn't high school where you're required to fill your schedule to the brim anymore. this also isn't high school in the sense that you can clown around for all your APs and grind study a night before tests. taking 5 tech finals isn't fun at all, let alone taking maybe 2 or 3 at 8am. explore other things while you're settling in - clubs, parties, recruiting (lol).

but also again you don't have to follow anything i said bc im not your advisor (although they would probably suggest you to take 2 max first semester so i wouldn't listen to them either). bumping what i said in point 2.
you my friend are a stud, i applaud you
Urap and cold emailing
I haven’t done upper div cs classes but if they are cracked and already have some related knowledge it’s not impossible. last semester i was taking 61B~1 hrs a week, 16B~5 hrs a week + 20 per exam, 70~20 hrs per exam and none on a normal week and physics 7b ~ 1 hr per week + 15 per exam so in total like 6 hrs a week plus 150 ish hours for studying for tests in total. 

The 2-4 hours per credit hour is probably reasonable for the average student but anyone willing to take 5 technicals is probably some level of cracked
I mean by this logic, 6 ap classes and 4 college courses simultaneously should be impossible. Some people really are just good. I dont blame you for thinking its unreasonable since thats understandable For example, as an average person, could you imagine running a mile in 3 minutes 43 seconds?

I measured time based on personal experience. I have personally taken harder schedules and know kids that are even more cracked. If you just look through LinkedIn and resumes of random people, you will also occasionally find these kinds of cracked ppl on accident.

Also cs70 can take 0 hours per week with the no homework option. You don't even need to study for exam or look at lectures if you have comp math experience. 

So this course loadout is more like 4 technicals. And technicals are actually much easier for some STEM kids than humanities. People always tout technicals as super hard, but for me technicals have always been far easier than english or history. This workload of 5 technicals versus 10 ap/college courseload might actually be a reduction in workload."
"EECS town hall: Students proposed L&S contribute funding to the EECS department proportional to the number of L&S students who take EECS courses. Satish Rao: ""It's the basic responsibility of [Cal] to give the money we need to teach you. Seeking private donors is a bit heroic but a bit sad.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/09/15/uc-berkeley-honor-societys-town-hall-addresses-electrical-engineering-computer-science-department-concerns/,2016-09-15 23:19:27,,"Do the other departments do the same thing? Everyone in engineering has to take math and science courses that are run by L&S but I never heard of math classes with this kind of problem with waitlists.
Why not just lower enrollment and make EECS™ more elite? Make the GPA cap 4.000000000 and we good fam.
L&S should add a surcharge to any CoE student in a math, physics, or stats course then. That is only fair. We pay you to take your classes, you pay us to take our classes.  
**EECS MASTER RACE**^save^us
Wait, L&S gets to offer a major that consists of courses in another College, and they don't contribute anything to it? That seems ridiculous. 

I'm unclear on how university funding is allocated, however. It may not be that cut and dry. Do the colleges get money per student enrolled? If so it would make sense for L&S to send EECS some of that money since CS majors are taking all of their major classes in EECS. 

The idea of scaling TAS funding with number of credit hours enrolled also seems somewhat appealing. Since the number of credit hours should be basically constant given a constant number of students, this should allow money to be distributed relatively appropriately among departments.

However, I see a few problems with this method. First is the credit hour levels of courses. MechE courses, for instance, are typically 3 units. That would mean that MechE courses would only get 75% of the funding that typical four unit courses would get, but I'm not convinced MechE courses need any less instructional support. Language classes, on the other hand, are 5 units. Do they need 25% more instructional support money than the average course? 

Another problem is in the manpower required for different courses. I would imagine that a physics course, which includes labs, requires more instructional support money than a class that doesn't need those materials. 
Samses's headline (and the article itself) really don't span the full range of opinions expressed at the town hall. Although math and science courses in L&S are considered common good courses and are properly funded to accomodate, the EECS funding problem is that the TAS budget is not designed to cover the explosion in enrollment. Three things have to happen with increases in enrollment:

1: More GSI's have to be acquired. This has been solved by training UGSI's, which scales with enrollment (GSI's roughly scale by number of professors).

2: More rooms have to be booked. This is easy: just book later and later into the night.

3: More GSI's have to be payed. This is where the problem lies.

Previously, the Temporary Academic Support (TAS) budget covered 2/3rd's of class costs, with the last third being covered by salary refunds from professors who take a year off to work in the industry. TAS budgeting is arbitrary and hasn't increased enough, and salary refunds scale with the number of professors (which is basically constant). Donations and industry relations fees are basically negligible. 

So, the options are either take in less students, or increase the TAS budget.

1: Taking in less students is philosophically unappealing. If students are willing to learn, the EECS department is happy to teach them. 

2: Increasing the TAS budget: this is where the sentiment at the townhall finished on.

It would fix the EECS department's woes if the TAS budget scaled with student credit hours (basically, total enrollment), but it is currently arbitrarily handed down from above on a year-to-year basis from administrators at the university level. EVCP Carol Christ has created a task force to recommend changes to TAS, and EECS is on that panel via prof. Demmel.

This leaves the question: what can a student do to help create systemic changes in how EECS is funded? The main option settled on was this:

1: Lobbying and activism. Lobbying above the department level, lobbying at the regents level, lobbying at the state government level; especially changing the perception that EECS is the department that is well funded due to wealthy industry connections. Also, increasing awareness of how terrible TAS is currently set up, and how it burns larger departments.

As an aside to all of this, there was also a few calls to make department finances and university finances more transparent, to allow students greater ability to be engaged in these questions.
See, unlike EECS, the Math department can only afford to have so many faculty because it offers these service courses; EECS on the other hand does not depend on these courses for faculty hiring.

[deleted]
Theoretically yes this could happen to any department with this much of an explosion in enrollment. EECS enrollment issues stem from mostly the L&S doorway into CS classes and nonmajors who want to take 61a,b etc. We should be encouraging ALL these people to take the classes they want, we just need more GSI's to account for the uptick in students.

I am well aware I do not have mathematical maturity required for the class, and it doesn't help that I am a freshman who wasn't ever good at math and has not taken any math courses at Cal yet. However, some such freshmen I know passed the course easily (even some who came in with at most AB calculus math experience). I don't think I'm ready to take Math54 either.

If not, would that negatively impact me? I don't want to get an A, I just want to get something that is not a C or lower like I would've gotten if I continued in the course. Thank you in advance!

[EECS Professor Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html) replied:

> If you feel like you are horrible at math, then this is a real warning sign for 70. Self-studying is a very hard way to build mathematical maturity. Classes are better for that. You need to take something that will take you from where you are, and improve your mathematical maturity. EE16A might help you in that direction (assuming you have already done the equivalents of Math 1A and 1B). As freshman-oriented courses, they are more gentle with their slope of mathematical difficulty.  
> 
> The math in CS70 is not some magic or esoterica. It is accessible to everyone, provided that you train for it. (Think of it like being able to run 3 miles. That is something that most humans can do, even if some people might be really out of shape when they start. They just have to train for longer and at a pace that will let their body adapt to the rising difficulty.)  Without talking to you, what you described sounds like someone who was stymied by the difficulty slope in 70 relative to your mathematical equivalent of athletic conditioning. Take EE16A and 16B first. Then the slope in 70 should be more accessible. There's no getting around working hard, but you have clearly shown that you are willing to do that.

He wasn't comfortable with communicating much less having a soft understanding of what was going on, he had to ensure that what he understood and communicated was true. Certainly, many details were not there, but a plan whose parts could actually be executed was laid out. Second, he was able to focus and bring these things together in those moments, in front of an audience. The combination of the desire to communicate accurately and the ability to focus to gather what context he needed into his mind to verify his explanation was amazing.

> In CS70, one needs to do this on some level. For example, think about a proof of Fermat's theorem; or $a^{p−1} = 1 (mod p)$ for non-zero $a$. Here, one needs to gather some ideas. Any non-zero $a$ has an inverse $(mod p)$, as $gcd(a, p) = 1$ when $p$ is prime. Thus, we can say that the set ${a, 2a, 3a, …, (p−1)a}$ consists of distint elements and thus must be the same set as ${1, …, (p−1)}$ modulo p. Then, we proceed by noting the product of the elements of the ""two"" sets are the same, but have different form. From here, can you finish?

Here, the proof is the same, one needs to work with the set ${x ∈ {1,…pq−1}|gcd(x , pq)=1}$ as they have inverses and do a bit more work. Oh my! But this is fine. You can do it! Just play with the ideas, a little bijection, a little bit about inverses. Turn over the proof a couple of times to see how it works. Teach someone the proof to see if you have it. But do try to  have it completely, if not then, eventually. Indeed, I sometimes sit up in the middle of the night because I got some aspect of some explanation wrong to some student.

> Hey OP, really sorry this had to happen to you. As someone taking 70 right now I understand the dreadful ""shaky"" feeling about the material- I felt the same in the few weeks leading up to the midterm. I also sunk a lot of time into reading the notes and extra resources. However, when it came to the first two or three homeworks I was a mess- couldn't even get started on some problems, and the ones I could do I ended up getting completely wrong.
> 
> In your post you don't mention office hours, homework parties, or study groups so I'm not sure if you tried those at all. If not, my advice would be to lean on those heavily next time you take it. What I found helped the most was a large amount of time face-to-face with someone who knew the material well- may that be a TA in OH who was going through the notes with me or a friend in my study group who was working with me to construct a solution to a HW problem. This really benefited me because the other person was able to gauge my understanding real-time, help me understand the stuff I was missing, and correct any misconceptions that I had. It worked really well- I ended up getting +1 std dev on the midterm. IMO learning CS 70 is a dialogue- you learn by bouncing my thoughts and ideas off other people and listening to the responses.
> 
> I agree with Prof. Sahai on the problem of self-studying- reading the notes and doing the HW in a vacuum allowed me to form these misconceptions that went unchecked until I talked it over with someone else. Perhaps you can find resources this semester to help you prepare even though you're not in the class. I know there are clubs that offer tutoring for CS 70 (HKN comes to mind).

## **Other discussion**

A student wrote:

> I had a different issue than the student response. I did the homeworks and spent a lot of time on them, and was getting everything, or so I thought (scored high on the homeworks). But I spent so much time on the homeworks that I wasn't prepared for the midterm, as weird as that sounds. Though I really enjoyed the homeworks, I wish I had more time in the day to explore and work on hw style problems. But I have to now be realistic with how much time I actually have and I have to allocate it towards doing well on the test. After keeping up with hw I ended up not having much time to really review and practice the faster style of the midterm, i.e., less in-depth but more questions, and time limited. I tend to be more methodical and slow-thinking but enjoy solving hard problems. Fast-style test taking isn't my forte but I hope if I prepare more for that I can do better (I've done better on other exams that require that kind of style before, but never had weekly homeworks for those classes that required so much time -- I'm doing the homework option). 
> 
> I ended up doing close to the mean on the first midterm, which for me was a huge disappointment. I feel like you have to ""deeper"" on the homeworks, and for more specific scenarios than the midterm requires, so I wasn't ready for the midterm. The Bieber hw problem did boost me from doing even worse though, because it was similar to one of the midterm questions. I plan to spend more time doing old exams in prep. for the 2nd midterm, but would welcome any tips or advice from others who have taken the course, or especially from Professor Rao. 

Satish Rao replied:

> For this midterm the homework is not due for a week after the midterm, so you will have more time to focus on preparing for the tests.

> The strategy on the midterms is to give more smaller problems. This is for a few reasons, first is that more questions increases the amount of data from which to ""measure"" a students knowledge and ability to work with the materials, another being that a ""large"" question like what you see on homework is problematic in that the piecing together of various concepts at that level is too much to expect on an exam and very noisy in that even for the same student on some days the insight comes quickly on another it just doesn't.      We do try to design them to capture the pieces of the
puzzles that you put together in the homeworks.  For example, testing the proof of Fermat's theorem may unwind into smaller questions about inverses, bijections, and reorganizing terms within a modular arithmetic framework.
> 
> The idea is that you worked with all of these pieces in your homework, so the time spent on your homework should be helpful for exam.   Still, the pacing for homework is truly very different than what we can test on the exam; read problems, digest, play with the ideas, be creative, etc.   Measuring student performance fairly is a difficult problem that Professors constantly struggle with.

> Studying old exams is good.  Other instructor exams are great for content, but maybe to attune to my style use my exams perhaps later in your studying cycle.  Discussions have more smaller idea problems that are akin to exams. Study those. Finally, do at least understand the solutions to homeworks.  We do have difficult homeworks in that it is difficult to come up with the solutions, but often the solutions are short (annoyingly so, I would imagine) so do at least try to scan over and understand the solutions to the homeworks; I wouldn't try to come up with them again necessarily though as that would likely take a lot of time.","I think the issue a lot of the professors are missing is that this might just be this person's first exposure to real math.  At least in the US, high school math classes tend to be the cookbook approach to math: you learn how to use a bunch of tools to solve textbook problems (which are carefully formulated to be easily solvable by direct application of those tools, and tend to have minimal relevance to the real world).  There is minimal exposure to how and why these tools actually work, where they came from, etc.  In particular, proofs or rigorous mathematical derivations are almost never seen or performed; when they are done, even the teacher usually has trouble with it.  I've seen the same thing happen in a linear algebra class full of engineers.  This was literally the first time many of these people have been exposed to actual math, and it was disastrous for many of them, even though linear algebra is generally fairly easy and intuitive.

Need Guidance for CS 61A. Is it better to choose small class with less/no support or larger class setting with more support?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15tyfpx/need_guidance_for_cs_61a_is_it_better_to_choose/,2023-08-17 13:17:44,"Welcome to CS 61A! There are two offerings of the course this fall, and there are some important differences between them that you should consider when choosing between them. You are currently enrolled/waitlisted in the smaller experimental offering, but there is still space available in the larger standard offering.

If after reading this email you plan to stay in the smaller experimental offering, please sign up for section by completing the form below by 11:59pm this Sunday 8/20.

Most weeks, CS 61A has three lectures, a discussion section, and a lab section. In discussion and lab sections, students practice solving problems using the concepts and techniques from lecture. Here are the differences between the two offerings of the course:

Lectures will be held in different rooms by different instructors, but will cover the same topics. The same set of lecture videos will be assigned for both offerings, and in both offerings you'll be expected to watch the videos and/or read the textbook before coming to lecture because live lecture will only discuss a subset of the video material.

Discussions will be quite different. In the smaller experimental offering in which you are enrolled, discussions will have only 6 to 8 students and will be held on Thursdays: 12:30-2, 2-3:30, or 3:30-5 (all on Berkeley time). There won't be an instructor in the room with you; instead, your group will work through practice problems together and can use text chat, voice chat, and screenshare to get help from a teaching assistant as needed. The larger offering will instead have discussions with around 30-40 students, and a teaching assistant will be in the room leading the discussion.

Lab sections have 30-40 students and will be held in Soda Hall. In the smaller experimental offering in which you are enrolled, an 80-minute lab will start each 30 minutes on Tuesday from 11am to 3:30pm. I'll be in the room only for the beginning part of the lab. After that, students will work with each other to solve the lab's practice problems. The larger offering of 61A will instead have a teaching assistant in the room the whole time.

In either offering of the course, students will have the option of enrolling in an online mega section for lab and discussion rather than an in-person lab and discussion. Mega section does not meet on a weekly basis. There will be videos released each week that cover the discussion material. Students in the mega section must complete and submit weekly lab assignments on their own, but are welcome to ask questions in office hours or on the course forum. Students in the mega section will automatically receive full attendance credit. Any Zoom-based mega section meetings will be webcast and recorded.","better to have denero, ppl hate him for his thoughts of the strike but he's arguably the best professor on campus.
I would take the smaller class with Denero. He’s a great professor and a smaller setting will allow him to really give your kid a better/more tailored experience. It’s a better opportunity for asking questions and hammering home concepts.
Note that 100% of the seats in DeNero's 61A are reserved for incoming CS intended, Eng undeclared, EECS, EECS/MSE, & EECS/NE. The other 61A is mostly reserved seats, some for the same people, but 399 are unreserved.
Looks like Satish Rao is instructor for larger class.

My son confirmed De Nero's class.
For clarification: This is for my Kid. I will leave up to him to decide then. He got De Nero's class and I don't know instructor for the larger class.
I got the same email and ended up choosing the smaller class it really depends on his learning style and preferences but I chose the smaller one bc it seems like it’d be more intimate and close knit with the other students. Also studying together and trying stuff out in a small group and having a TA on standby online sounds more appealing than having to fight 30+ other students for the TA but again it’s really just preference
It’s up to you. For me the smaller class seems more tight knit and for me the cs61a labs/discussions weren’t too bad. I don’t recall asking a TA for help.
Definitely go for Denero’s class. He is one of my favorite pre-req class professors!
Co-sign. Loved DeNero!
Your kid was probably aware of this, but if they didn't and managed to enroll in the course without fitting the criteria they could get unenrolled from the course.
He's qualified to be in De Nero class"

CS 70 (Satish Rao, Babak Ayazifar) [Rating: 6/10]
- Not my favorite course, but honestly nothing terrible about it either
- The content you learn is relatively useful
- Notes are very dense and hard to digest, but if you understand them you will do well
- Rao was okay at lecturing, active on Piazza, down to earth
- Ayazifar was a good lecturer, seemed passionate about teaching and made it interesting
- Homeworks were very long, ruined almost all of my Fridays/Saturdays
- You will do well if you put enough time into the class, but the amount of time it takes might not be worth it to some people
- How to do well: do past exams, be up-to-date on lectures, go to discussions to put concepts into practice
- Workload: 10-20 hours/week

DATA 100 (Fernando Perez, Alvin Wan) [Rating: 2/10]
- I really wanted to like this course: it went from being my favorite class this semester to being the worst class I have ever taken
- The content you learn is very practical and useful
- The lack of effort put into refreshing the recycled lectures was disheartening, but the lectures were otherwise good and not hard to follow
- Labs were well-written and generally useful
- Homeworks were still useful but not as well-written
- Discussions felt like a waste of time to me, basically a rehash of lecture but worse and the worksheets did not teach me much
- The midterm was @#$% and not at all representative of how well you learned the material
- The final project experience really depends on your group, I personally had to work way harder because of some group members who contributed nearly nothing
- How to do well: the reason the class sucked this semester is because you could understand the material perfectly well, work hard, and still get a bad grade. I personally ended up with a good grade, but sunk so much time into the final project that I didn't have time to study for my other classes. My recommendation is to take this course with a professor that probably cares more (e.g. Hug in Spring 2022)
- Workload: 8 hours/week normally, 25 hours/week during final project

PHYSICS 7B (Robert Birgeneau) [Rating: 2/10]
- Another one of my least favorite courses
- You don't learn much relevant material in this course (at least for computer science)
- Birgeneau seemed like a nice, well-intentioned professor, but unfortunately the lectures were almost useless in preparing you for exams
- Out of the 180-200 people enrolled in the class, only about 10 showed up to lecture near the end of the semester
- They sent out a survey for feedback on lectures since attendance was low, but there were only about 2 weeks of classes left, so this was quite insulting
- Discussions were also relatively useless if you didn't already understand the material—most people I knew only showed up to get the bonus points for attending >50% of discussions
- Labs were the most engaging part of the class for me and taught useful concepts, but there were only 4 and they did not help me prepare for exams
- Homeworks could have been useful for preparing for exams, but I was more concerned about getting a good grade since getting anything wrong lost points
- Exams tested nothing conceptual—the best way I can put it is that they were a test of how well you could memorize formulas and perform calculus calculations
- How to do well: the class was as close to a textbook as you could get. Read the textbook thoroughly, especially when it shows derivations. Do the example problems in each section because these will often show up on the exams
- Workload: 8-12 hours/week (depends on how long you spend on the textbook, whether there is an upcoming lab or exam)

ETHSTD 175 (Greg Choy) [Rating: 9/10]
- I liked this class a lot, it was refreshing compared to the rest of my classes this semester
- You learn about a lot of history and literature that you probably know/have heard/wouldn't be surprised about, but that you probably haven't discussed before
- Choy was a great lecturer, and super reasonable in his approach to teaching
- There are no assignments besides reading (which is quite heavy, but you could honestly get away with some light skimming)
- The ""midterms"" were super chill, could usually work in groups and were basically short essays that you had a week to work on
- The great thing about this class is that it's more concerned with you learning something than with scoring you—I learned even while writing and discussing the exam questions with my group and you can't really say that for many other classes
- There was an end-of-semester poetry presentation where you/your group gets to be the lecturer for ~30 min
- How to do well: just attend and pay attention in all lectures, take notes, do the readings and you will definitely do well. That being said, you get out of the class as much as you put in, so you may also want to participate by asking questions, discussing during class, etc.
- Workload: 6-12 hours/week (depends on what readings are assigned and how thoroughly you read them)","Yo its Christmas. Take a load off from thinking about school work and spend time with friends and family if you can. You deserve it!

In fact, the vast majority of the faculty at Berkeley are among the most respected in
their fields.  Pick an academic topic at random, and do some web searching, and
most of the time you'll find that one of the world experts is sitting within a few
hundred meters of you.  It's an exciting place to do research!

The low power radio that enables that to work was designed by a former ee140 student who founded a company right out of school and sold it to Apple five years later for a huge pile of money.  And the tools that everyone uses to design integrated circuits?  Many invented at Berkeley, and sold by companies co-founded by Berkeley faculty and grads.

I don't think he does research 
Two more fun things I can think of that came out of our students that aren't too common knowledge: cowsay and GIMP.

EECS™
Also GNU cannot really be claimed by Berkeley. It was founded by Richard Stallman when he was at MIT and is intentionally not affiliated with any university or company.
He used to (in fact, you can even see a list of some of the grad students he advised [here](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=50158)), but at some point he decided to focus only on teaching.
Sure. I think it is disingenuous to say that he is (or was) top 2-3 in any field. Nothing against the man, he is a great educator. 

I just find the list of professors given to be a bit... sophomoric? No Karp? Papadimitriou? Vazirani?
I actually have no idea how good Hilfinger's research was. But he's certainly not as famous as I would of expect of someone who was really leading their field, so you're probably right. But your initial comment was misleading (though technically correct since he no longer does research) and that's what I was addressing.

Also, I find it a little bit silly to try to say who is ""in the top 2-3 in their field."" So much depends on how you define ""their field."" And so much about what makes someone a great researcher is at least partly subjective. For instance, you mention Vazirani. What is his field? If it's complexity theory then there's way too many great complexity theorists to say that he's one of the top 2-3. If it's quantum computing then you could argue that he's in the top 2-3 since he helped found that area of research. But there's also tons of people doing great research in quantum computing, and it feels pretty arbitrary to say he's in the top 2-3.

I think it's enough to just say that for many professors at Berkeley, the research they did fundamentally changed their field."

As one of our colleagues put it in the faculty discussions on course managers, ""Oh, when I get a student request that requires administrative work, I just forward it to the appropriate TA.""  We have websites, piazzas, gradescopes, content repos, and associated practices that are learned and passed on. The content teams produce content where for some of us, we can simply review and comment on their output. Moreover, my undergraduates listen and are effective. Graduate students (engaged ones) contribute to content where their capabilities are most useful and in a capacity they learn from.

The lack of continuity in staff leads to problems and overwork, and graduate students in particular are overburdened to have to learn infrastructure and management of complexities that have little to do with their intellect and value and distract them far more from their research than doing content roles that they currently occupy. To be sure, I tend to try to insulate my graduate student TA's as I have done it before but it is still a lot of work.

>It's true that some students don't get in. One wonders why. I have experience with this. Students who have done poorly on the midterm often ask for time with me, and they receive it.  We go over their understanding and process. We go from question on the exam, to reading the notes in as relaxed a method as possible.  We work on improving their approach to learning; e.g., focus on understanding the basics, and using those basics to build up both intuition and mathematical power. An example, might be they should understand that .5 has no meaning in modular arithmetic. It's a bit uncomfortable for them,  in that it is different from manipulating equations or following recipes (which was drummed into them K-12) and asks them to understand the path. Still, they can (essentially)  always make progress in our meetings and often even have Eureka moments about what it means to know and the power to produce that knowing.

>But for whatever reason, even with this support, somehow the students do something different and don't get to the standard that earns them a B+. It is perhaps due to lack of interest or other issues. Personally, issues of background to me, is more  a problem of lower confidence than lack of prior knowledge. To be clear, attaining an A+ or A is something where previous knowledge helps considerably, but attaining a B+ is more of a confidence issue in my view.

While I personally let in everyone into my upper division courses, I indicate they are taught for our majors and keep that promise. This fair warning does communicate expectations to those who are not our majors and they  don't complain about level inordinately and this allows the courses to run more smoothly than if our majors were unprepared.

>The quality produced by this process is also impressive. We choose 1000 students who do as well as the 300 students in our EECS major.  Indeed, this appears true in our upper division courses not just in overall GPA.  The EECS major is the most competitive major on campus in terms of admission: the rate of admission (5-6%) is lower than MIT's or Caltech's.  Our declaration threshold is surprisingly (shockingly) much better in that it chooses a much larger group of comparable quality.  
>  
>Then again, it's perhaps not that shocking as admissions chooses students based on the sophomore and junior performance in high school. This is perhaps why L&S has the declaration after coming.  It takes time to explore and to develop as people. Freshman admissions selects for those who develop quickly. We are judging by their 15-17 year old behaviors. Our students are still young, but there is a lot of development in those couple of years. I raised three kids mostly as a single parent, it's true in my experience.

>In terms of harm to students who don't make it. Only a fraction take all three and those who take any subset of 61A and 61B and even 70 are  courses that offer invaluable skills in today's world and  fulfill requirements for several other majors.  It's a path optimized to be short. Thus, the delay to choosing the major is not long, for most it is one or two courses. Last semester in CS70, the undeclared L&S students who received a B or lower was 71. Let's take this as a proxy for those who don't make it, though it is probably an upper bound as grades tend to drop through the series. This estimate is roughly 15-20% of the population of around 1000 that become our majors,  so around 80-85% of those who try three courses make it. (Caveat: there is a small mathematical mistake which understates the percentage who make it, but correct mathematics is less intuitive and it's an estimate anyway.)

[Berkeley admissions](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/16/uc-berkeleys-push-for-more-diversity-shows-in-its-newly-admitted-class/) last year made remarkable progress in terms of diversity.  Two numbers that indicate interesting mechanisms for us are Pell Grant recipients which grew from an already large 4556 to  5106. Another is the first generation college applicants which grew from 3118 to 4106 students.  These two categories may well have to do with other improvements in diversity. These are large pools from which we can recruit from in our system; adjusting the GPA to be different for these categories is completely legal and reasonable. Moreover, to me, a poor student who achieves at a similar level to a wealthy student is inherently stronger (Indeed, I have been pushing for a publicly announced Pell Grant gpa threshold for declaration for almost two years).

from the first sentence i knew it was rao
I love Rao a bit more after reading this.
Wow I just read the whole thing, and I am amazed and in awe. 

I am so glad to have him as my professor for CS70.
Is he proposing there just be no change then? Or keep the declaring
Rao 🐐
based
Tbh, I think Rao is right to highlight the sadness that comes with dramatically reducing the class size of L&S CS. If we could sustainably maintain the status quo, I'd honestly prefer having large class sizes to small ones. But as the CS major continues to grow and funds get tighter, how long can we really sustain this? It's a sad situation but something has to change :/
After reading this, I can picture Rao saying ""Let there be light"" - WOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOO. And his kid is like dumbfounded
On point with the diversity thing. Increasing the RATE of URM doesn't necessarily mean MORE URM students are getting to study CS if the overall number drops as much.
I agree with his points that comp sci classes are very well taught for the class sizes. Berkeley is really pioneering in mass teaching styles, and could continue to improve educational methods. Lastly, is it really the best idea to reduce class size so drastically for such a influential major as computer science? 1000 grads a year is a world changing number, 300 is less so
I feel like his point about how students who do poorly on the midterm can get individual attention, and almost universally succeed works against the goal for larger class sizes. It’s much harder to get individual attention in such a large class, and there can be more focus on every individual student if there are less of them. Even with lots of staff, there are overloaded office hours for so many CS classes, and the whole system becomes a bureaucracy of its own. Berkeley as a whole is a huge, unfeeling beast that has very large cracks you can fall through, and the CS department is the exact same way. It makes you wonder if things could be different with the same level of funding for less students, like in the proposed changes.
I don't agree with everything here, but he makes a lot of good points.

I wonder if he has any data to back up his claim that the l&s CS cohort does as well as EECS (GPA-wise?). It would not surprise me at all if that were the case. I also think he's spot-on that college admissions is already a very noisy process (much noisier than a GPA cap), and removing the SAT will only worsen this.

At the same time, the problem with the status quo is not just the current number of students, it's the rate of growth. No department can ever handle constantly-increasing demand. There needs to be some way to control the number of CS majors.

Bit of an unrelated tangent, but I completely oppose the way college admissions is done in this country. Colleges should select people based on academic talent and potential, not based on their ""worthiness as a human."" I find it deeply disturbing that a bunch of 50 year olds sit in a room together and subjectively judge the ""stories"" and the personal qualities of teenagers they've never met, to determine who they deem worthy for a spot at Harvard or whatever. It's a stupid system with zero accountability under the guise of ""holistic admissions.""

We're also the only country in the world that does this to my knowledge. From my understanding of it, the UK system for college admissions is so much better.
damn he went off and i'm here for it
Something to consider, a lot of success stories out of eecs/l&s cs are built on top of other student's tears and rejections. Unless you force Berkeley CS clubs to accept 100+ students each year and run a research group with hundreds of undergraduate students, the fundamental problem of large class sizes isn't solved: fewer dollars spent per student. For the students who made the 3.3 cut, got into CSM, Got into Codebase/Codeology,MLAB... and got into FAANG, every step of the way, 10+ other students were rejected in their place, students who would be left with an empty resume and no internship. Simply put, even if Berkeley can provide the teaching funds for 2000+ students in both l&s and eecs, lots will still fail because they didn't have the right friends, their personality wasn't outgoing enough, had a bad interview at their dream club etc.... I don't think it's their fault of being complacent, accepting 2000 students and providing a cutthroat environment, and then claiming its a ""culture of excellence"" is doing a disservice to its students. How are these students supposed to compete with CMU/MIT students, who have plenty of resources for clubs, research projects, TAship? 

Also, there is also a human element to this. You reject a student who told all of their friends they were ""intended CS"", don't make the GPA cut. Do yall think they are going to be proud of their data science major? Do you think that a student would be able to tell their friends/family about their new major without a feeling of disqualification, guilt, and regret? It does more harm than ""they just have to change majors in their second year"". It hurts their self-confidence and crushes any kind of drive they have left to keep going. Do you think they will be able to tell an interviewer proudly that they majored in DS in Berkeley, in an industry filled with CAL graduates who know about the GPA cut? This is way crueler than politely telling a student before their freshman year that they are accepted to l&S except for CS. If told before coming to Berkeley, a student can choose other options if they really wanted to study CS, or orient themselves to a different field when coming to Berkeley. 

In short, I think we need to reduce the number of students. Everything is becoming super competitive, school is lacking resources. For discoverers, it is much better that they get accepted to the CS major (where you aren't judged based CS skills), have access to coding clubs/research opportunities, and get into a prestigious company after their 4 years. Compare this to accepting 10 discoverers, where they find that they were rejected to all of the clubs (due to students with prior experience), and only manages to have the ""lab assistant"" line on their resume, 3 students not making CS, and all of them having a miserable time in Berkeley and potentially not getting any jobs/internships. 

There is more to this than class funding. School is a holistic experience, not just classes.
Andrew Yang said it the best.

>The problem, is that colleges have a large amount of administrative bloat; the increase in the cost of tuition tracks with the increase in the number of administrators.

We're labeling the new CS declaration policy as a solution for budgeting issues when the most prominent budgeting issue (Bloated Administration) is consistently left unresolved. Perhaps the sad reality of the situation is that those who benefit most from an issue are less or not in any regard inclined to resolve the issue.
What's the new policy?
What a guy, glad i started attending CS70 lecture again this week lol
I disagree with his teaching and some of his other views, but I can get behind this one.
loved rao while taking 70, love him now!! what a great letter!
The new policy sounds awful. The great thing about CS L&S is that you have to prove yourself from taking actual CS courses rather than being judged by your SAT/ACT score and GPA you got when you were in high school.
His writing is pretty hard to comprehend. 

I read the whole thing twice and I'm still not sure what he's saying.
Excellent!
Major W
I'm sure if EECS could have gotten more money, they would have, right? While the new proposed plan does have serious hopes for improving diversity and student outcomes, it definitely seems like it was pushed forward right now anyways primarily due to the need to shrink the major due to budget issues. What exactly happened that the university is no longer able to support its largest major is an open question, but it seems as though the only option is to throw austerity measures at it until it floats.
Very thoughtful writeup. My one thought is: is the idea of the kids who would be barred from entry under the new policy really a representation of a destruction of value? Surely they can learn and produce just as much valuable work in another major/field that has the resources to accept them (which is nearly all of them). 

Of course, students feel drawn to particular disciplines and it is a shame to ever say “nope, go pick something else.” But I have to say that a significant number of students attempting to declare CS seem to do so for reasons more external than ones of passion for the discipline.

This issue is related to the general worthlessness attributed to many of the degrees offered through L&S, which motivates a disproportionate number of bright students to move to STEM. When it comes to student interest and incoming talent, the humanities and social sciences are suffering from a drought while CS and STEM in general are building dams to keep back a flood. And of course this is a self-reinforcing cycle.

So here we are as the EECS department worried about over-enrollment. How do we adapt to ever increasing demand, etc. But I contend that the root of the problem is not on the EECS side of things, or STEM in general, but on the other often overlooked fields housed within L&S. 

I do not think it is an issue of inherent worth; these disciplines and majors (purportedly) address important and intellectually rich subjects. So why then are students, and frankly the world in general, turned off to them in comparison to STEM? I really don’t know how to approach it. I know that there are issues of bad teaching and of poor scholarship, but I don’t really know why. The whole thing is rotting, and as a CS discoverer involved in other fields in the humanities and social sciences, it breaks my heart to see the disparity.
to be honest I'm not sure if CS costs a lot to sustain on a per student basis-as opposed to having to hire one professor to teach 20-30 students in a seminar like in English or something, CS can have one professor teach like 100 students. Money should follow the student not the department, IMO
It sounds like he's saying that the current system isn't too bad and could be made even better with funds to allow more people in/policies around pell grant recipients or something similar to help with diversity.
He's for increasing class sizes for the sake of all students who want to pursue CS, for CS potential that could be more developed from Berkeley, and for diversity in CS. He admits that finances is a very tricky and difficult issue to deal with (low-key calling the bureaucracy ... corrupt I think? lmao ... ) and that he doesn't really have a clear answer to this problem. But near the end, he says that they all should push and fight harder for increased output of educated CS students in however way possible. It's a relatively worded letter to explain why he's against cutting class sizes.
*Is he proposing*

*There just be no change then? Or*

*Keep the declaring*

Why can't funds just be redirected from other departments?  CS probably has one of the highest ROI for students of any major, so why not fund it in a way that reflects that?
It'd be hard to know until stats for it were actually published, but he makes a fair point.
Often in political arguments like this, ""diversity"" is cherry picked in whatever way to support your argument. DeNero has to [bring it up](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/02/18/uc-berkeley-computer-science-proposes-major-declaration-process/), but there's no evidence that the holistically benefitting students will persist at the same rates. (In the other hand, I'd assume lower division GPA correlates well to persistence as Rao suggests).

The key discussion is whether enrollment caps need to be present. The second is whether enrollment (if it needs to be capped) should be decided based on high school or college performance (which have a variety of trade offs).

I'm generally with Rao here. Just scale the program up to take more students. And my sense is that a GPA threshold to declare, while stressful, is more efficient at selecting students that will succeed than high school stage admissions.
I think having large classes is a mixed bag when it comes to getting individual attention. In both 70 and 170, I randomly stumbled upon discussion sections with literally 3 students in attendance. I do truly believe that if people took course staff's advice and tried out different TAs, they will find someone that fits their needs. And, with large classes, there will almost definitely be multiple sections per time slot, so the chances of you being forced into a bad section gets smaller.

I think office hours will continue to stay bad, because nothing I've heard about the proposal indicates the student to TA ratio will change.
GPA is actually higher for L and S CS vs EECS (3.53 vs 3.46) - see [https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/OPA/our-berkeley/gpa-by-major.html](https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/OPA/our-berkeley/gpa-by-major.html). Which actually makes sense since selecting for those with a high GPA will result in people having a high GPA.
LSCS actually does noticeably better; I’ve run the data every year since the major was 270 students and it’s grown to 1800+ in less than a decade. They perform better because they need a 3.3 GPA to declare and EECS are admitted directly from HS. 3.3 is higher than the EECS averages of those three courses and it’s led to a large group of phenomenal (18 A+ grades and national research awards phenomenal) students. 

Historically the major never increased beyond 400 so it becoming 1,800 with EECS around 1,400 makes it very challenging to fund because some departments would have to receive nothing. The two majors are larger than the entire student population (undergrad and grad) of CalTech; it’s actually 50% larger at this point. They have not received appropriate teaching funding in years which is why they invented gradescope and other tools—so they could meet demand. Unfortunately I do not think campus even has the money to direct without again starving maybe a dozen departments that are the size we in Eecs/LSCS were for decades. 

He makes beautiful arguments; that’s for sure. He makes great points too. I just haven’t decided yet since I see the sausage being made. The amount of pain those students who don’t make it experience is astonishing and it is far less stressful if you’re directly admitted. But I do prefer proving yourself at campus yet it sucks that you have to jump through an extra hoop just to study the field that often leads one to attend Cal in the first place.

To be fair, the biggest term in tuition increases is not an increase in administrators. It is disinvestment by the state. 

Administrative bloat comes after disinvestment. To be precise: tuition increases track reduction in state funding. Reductions in the educational experience track administrative bloat.
That was a confusing wall of text for non-cs people, but I'd also like to know what was proposed, that he's objecting to.
What are some of his ""other views?""
To be sure, he reuses a lot of phrases and perhaps isn't as concise as he should be. Indeed, he is not an English professor. To be sure, this is a bit of a wall of text. Indeed, he should probably switch up his word choice. To be sure, this is very much in-character for Rao.
Redirected isn't a good word, as much as ""appropriately allocated"".

If CS department grows in students, their teaching budget should increase too.

When people talk about ""sustainability"" it makes very little sense, as it sounds parasitic like it causes the budget to get worse and worse.

In reality, if there are N students, they will need to be taught in some department, so why not the one they want to be taught in? CS teaches more students for cheaper, it doesn't make sense to complain about it's growing cost.
You've been caught in a thought trap. 

Read the message and do a calculation. 40K students times 15K resident tuition per year = $600M.  The university only spends at most $150M on TAs. That gap is where the problem is. The solution is not about redirecting TA money from other departments. The campus is stealing students' money, spending it on administrative things less effective for learning than faculty and TAs, and then getting you to fight with each other instead of with them.
Selecting people based on actual CS class performance seems like a much better mechanism than high school performance.
Scaling the program is easier said than done fs
As a former TA for 61c, many in-person discussions ended up with an attendance fewer than 5-10 midway through the semester.  This typically was the case for almost a quarter of us, with some of the most talented TAs ending up teaching two or so people in discussion.
While office hours are swamped as heck, a reliable way to get support is to attend discussion (particularly one with lower attendance). The TA is usually happy to answer questions about earlier material, since there’s no point building off knowledge a student doesn’t have.
Also worth noting that a lot of TAs are willing to set up time for 1 on 1s if you reach out to them. Of course, this doesn't scale well if everyone does it.

In 170 we tried a few times to provide official channels for this (e.g. reaching out to the bottom n% of students after a midterm). It's a lot to ask of the staff though. I'm not sure if it's going to be sustainable to rely on what's basically enthusiastic unpaid labor.
:( Why do you say office hours are bad?
That's prob cuz of gen eds ngl lol
bro you should put all this on like a blog post with nice data visualization - this is really interesting
You are being tricked. It is not about redirecting money from other academic departments.

Berkeley has the money. They are just spending it on administration that is less effective than faculty and TAs. If you doubt this, just go to the salary database, and start looking.
not everything is about ""being asked this question on interviews"". It is more about having the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities in CAL and learn from them. Maybe your interviewer never asked you about CSM specifically, but he/she probably asked you to describe how you spent your 2\~3 years at CAL. If all the clubs rejected you, you have nothing to talk about, and classes are not usually enough to get you prepared for internships.

Trust me, I have seen tons of students getting rejected from CSM and everything else they applied to. Maybe your perception of CSM, research being easy to get in comes from making friends that are in CSM already? I don't think there are ""prestigious labs"" for undergrads to get in, they are all mostly the same. URAP's acceptance rate for EECS research has hovered very low this past year.

I think you just have been hanging out with smart students in EECS/L&S that haven't really struggled. I've seen far more tearful situations where students can't do extracurriculars in the area/field they want (web dev/mobile dev/machine learning...) because they have been trying for 2 years to get experience but are just getting rejected. Berkeley should make sure these students also have a shot at internships and full-time.

To put this into perspective: [https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-engineering](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-engineering)

Berkeley is one of the top feeder schools into engineering with 1300 undergrads, but when we divide the 1300 students out, the engineering job prospects for each student are lower than UCLA and the University of Washington.
That is a fair point.
I guess it is this: [https://www.dailycal.org/2021/02/18/uc-berkeley-computer-science-proposes-major-declaration-process/](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/02/18/uc-berkeley-computer-science-proposes-major-declaration-process/)

TLDR: Incoming students can apply to and be admitted directly into the CS major upon admission. (Similar to how EECS has been for decades?)
I thought I was at a 70 lecture for a moment HAHAHA Maybe it's from him teaching 70 so much, difficult conceptual stuff that just requires 5 different ways to explaining so that students have a better chance of understanding
Strong students would like some guarantee that they'll get into the major though. It's a balance between picking the right metric and picking metrics that get you strong students. Finances aside, I would have picked Cornell over Cal if I wasn't directly admitted since I knew I wanted to do EE/CS. The cost of spending two years and then getting rejected is super high.
They're talking about cutting the enrollment by about 50%, so we've already scaled up much larger than it will be. The mechanism for scaling the program is pretty much already in place.
Well office hours quality depends on the class, like everything else of course. But I just took CS 162 (operating systems) and my goodness was it bad. When you need help on an assignment, chances are there are a lot of other people who also need help. Especially in virtual times, the only way for staff to fairly help people is with the help queue, one by one, and if you don't get on the queue within like 20 seconds of it opening, you're probably not going to get helped within the TA's 2 hours shift. 61C (in person) was a shitshow whenever I tried going to get help that eventually I just gave up and decided banging my head against a wall was a more effective way to figure things out I guess.

Data 100 has tried to help this with the use of Gather, so students are provided a space and the opportunity to work with others on the same question while waiting for help. I think it's a great idea, if only students actually talked to each other while waiting.

In general, project based classes are more difficult to get help with. Classes with weekly assignments have more reasonable office hours (sometimes empty of less than a handful of people) in the parts of the week that aren't ~3 days before the assignment is due.
I don’t think I’m being tricked, though if it was sophisticated enough (the system) then it could; I’ve just been on campus in almost every role possible, including undergrad and grad.  

As a whole they certainly have the money, but the TAS (teaching) budget for campus does not receive enough money to cover the entire cost of teaching EECS and CS without having a shortfall somewhere else. The method by which TAS receives funds is above even my level of understanding. But I can say that those processes that high up (aka the very top) are so old that they are a culture and an ingrained factor in campus culture such that changing things (at that level) is nigh impossible. 

That being said, you’ve lit a fire so to speak and I’m going to probe that level with focused, goal-driven attention in order to see if it is truly as impossible as it feels in current practice at the department and college level. I fear it requires regents and vice-chancellor up approval which is a serious obstacle since the funds will likely have to come with some legitimate reduction in upper-administration (aka the people who have to take action and sign off on such a shift). Suffice it to say the system is *very* complex. Even current TAS allocations are done by large, often unexplained or even shared equations. 

Thanks!

Thanks.  Now what Rao said makes a lot more sense to me.
Getting rejected is not that high, and besides, acceptance into a major based on high school metrics is not fair to people who didn't get directly into the major.

Someone's SAT/ACT score is a much poorer predictor of success in CS classes than actually taking the CS classes as doing well.
It's already crowded af. The problem already exists on huge magnitude and the new policy would at least offer the opportunity to fix it retroactively.
I thought you were referring to 70 and 170 based off of the other context in the comment. I agree 61c and 162’s OH’s are impossible to get help from for some reason.
The TAS budget for campus is too small. Campus is stealing the money from tuition and spending it on administrative staff.

There is a formula negotiated with the Federal government ([https://spo.berkeley.edu/policy/fa.html](https://spo.berkeley.edu/policy/fa.html)) for calculating the legitimate level of administrative overhead. Campus is effectively charging \*far far\* more than that level on the resident tuition that students/parents/scholarships pay. The state (and non-resident tuition) pays for faculty time. Students pay a documents fee for the cost of keeping track of their paperwork.

If the Feds were paying the tuition dollars as part of a direct sponsored contract for instruction (instead of as tuition), then people at Berkeley would be going to jail. Students are paying resident tuition for classroom resources. But the laws governing a contract do not apply here, and so nobody goes to jail, and associate vice X's hire assistants and ""chiefs of staff"" and write reports to each other.

The carrier survey also has a 45% response rate in 2020. I'm not too sure how exactly the survey is conducted, but with a 45% response rate, I think it reflects the ""successful 45% of students"". Correct me if I'm wrong.

My overall point is, Berkeley needs to also consider the environment and opportunities has (both for discoverers and long-time coders). Although there are going to be brilliant students like you, there are also tons who will struggle with huge class sizes. The staff needs to figure out how to build an inclusive and less competitive environment for everyone, whether that be increasing opportunities or admitting fewer students.
>Getting rejected is not that high

It's a high cost, because your alternative was to have gone to a lower-tier school and majored in CS if that's where your passion lay.

This is overall a very difficult trade-off.

I personally always liked that Berkeley had both methods. EECS for students that already know they want to do CS in high school and L&S CS for students that find CS to be their passion while in college.

Capping an in-demand major is definitely the worse solution.
Well 70 and 170 were still pretty bad for those days leading up to the deadline. My back definitely took a beating from being hunched over and sitting on the ground for hours and hours. It was always a little funny to watch the grad students and professors hop over our legs to get to their offices because there wasn't enough room in the alcove.
Oh I’m well aware of the Vice X writing reports to each other. Each time they add one they also give them around 5-12 staff and a chief of staff (I almost became one but decided not to). 

As to the rest of the funding and the specifics around what money goes where—you seem to know a lot. I only made it to revising the TAS formula to be more fair (or provide funding more accurately) though it still doesn’t cover full costs. 

I don’t think we’re being lied to though; we aren’t even being told. We’ve asked for funding models and they’ve just not delivered them. 

What do you propose to change this? Do we even have any pull? Can the academic senate do anything? Or the TAS budget formula? No matter what the state provides it’s tiny in comparison to the rest of our funding; I KNOW it’s too small for us though it seems adequate for a large portion of campus. Is it even fixable on any level other than the VC-X (my new favorite title for them all haha).
[deleted]
Zero-base budgeting for everything administrative, with the decision as to which administrative services need to be purchased being made by a joint committee of the Senate and the Colleges/Depts; ratified by a final vote of the Senate each year. The power of the purse needs to move to the Senate. Next to each piece of administrative expense should be three numbers instead of dollars: how many graduate fellowships is this worth? how many GSIs? how many faculty positions? (for smaller class sizes and more research opportunities)

Spending money is about making choices, and choices have alternatives that were not chosen. Prices are about alternatives that are foreclosed by making a choice. Decisions need to be made with those foreclosed alternatives clearly in view.

There are lots of fine people in the Berkeley administration who are sincerely doing work that they believe is helpful. However, they might not be doing what the students and faculty actually need the most. When one is making a film, lots of very good takes end up on the cutting-room floor because they are not the best for telling the story.  The same is true for all other good work. This means that lots of administration is also going to simply be shed if it is not as compelling as another GSI or another graduate fellowship.
I totally get your point. I have an internship, in a research group too, and in no way am I being salty. I worked hard but I must admit, I was very very fortunate to get into these positions. I just saw so many intended CS students suffer, and that's why I'm writing this. Comparing CAL to peer institutions, it is easier to get research, get into clubs, etc in CMU and MIT. Of course students can just work on personal projects, but then why go to school? You are losing out on the university experience. I just didn't think just because we get funding to accommodate 2000+ l&s cs students, we should just go forward with it since our numbers are growing exponentially."

Contrary to what people may say, it may also be a good idea to go into debt.

My situation was probably different from yours in that I had built up a credit score and was eligible to apply for credit cards that gave 0% interest for 15-21 months. This allowed me to get access to about $20k in 0% interest (of course, I didn't use it all but it was something useful to have to pay for important expenses that financial aid didn't cover). Having a full time job also helped my chances of getting a credit card.

With 15-21 months of no interest (Citi Simplicity; Chase Slate; Discover 18 months), you will be able to focus on school while also being able to survive. Then you will have only paid a few months of interest before you get a job hopefully making a decent salary.

> I'm the author of the initial response thread). Oh, one more clarification I have to make. My decision to open these credit cards were carefully planned and I had written up a detailed plan on how I was going to manage the money. If done haphazardly, credit cards could be cause more problems than it solves.

A student commented:

> I just wanted to say that I wish you the best of luck with your situation. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to follow the EECS curriculum while supporting your family. All I know is that you must be extremely capable, smart, and hardworking if you've made it this far, and I'm sure that will help you a lot in your professional future. Keep going, you've made it so far!

## **Students' discussion**

A student commented:

> Are you white or Asian? If so, you're already privileged so this situation shouldn't be a problem. Just use your privilege!

A student commented:

> are you serious? No point to be a troll under this post

A student commented:

> Not a troll. Whites and Asians are privileged. They don't need help. Only minorities, LGBQT, etc. are victims. 

A student commented:

> Glad this page is not totally anonymous so at least staff members could know who this ridiculous person is ;)

A student commented:

> Let's please not make jokes here. This person (and the commmenter above) is revealing some highly personal information, and we should be mature about it. I, too, am not a fan of political correctness but this is the wrong forum to attack political correctness.

A student commented:

> I think it's relevant though. I have a slight feeling that the OP is Asian. He/she should know how the left views them: as overprivileged, monotonous automatons.

A student commented:

> What does this have to do with anything? OP is just asking for advice, and not once mentioned privilege or anything like that.

A student commented:

> Not sure how you assumed the OP was Asian. Also, it may be true the left views Asians and whites in the way you described. In fact, many posters in the ""Town halls too politically correct"" expressed that view. So that may be correct. However, by bringing this up, you're using the OP's plight to make a political point, which is not related to the discussion at all.

A student commented:

> At the risk of getting dragged into a fruitless debate, perhaps we should be mindful of the fact that everybody's personal situation and experiences are different. Trying to stereotype people, assign characteristics to arbitrary groups of people, and otherwise deny people their individual identities, thoughts, and feelings is unhelpful and harmful. This is regardless of whether it's done for comedic effect, to make a political point, or whether it stereotypes ""whites"", ""asians"", ""the left"", ""the right"", ""LGBQT people"".

A student commented:

> Asians aren't a monolithic group, either. Some groups are overall underprivileged, like southeast Asians.

An instructor replied:

> Why is this relevant or helpful? Please, try to be sensitive. This should be a supportive space; please try to be helpful and kind. The admins can see your names and we will not tolerate trolling.

Followup [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/5za3xf/eecs_101_piazza_instructor_some_people_are_using/) and [Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/hyq0br1u3kx7dg?cid=3521)","respect
I think OP is right, he should take a semester off and try to come back later. State of well-being comes first before studies, if you don't have your welfare taken care of before your studies, it will disturb your ability to study well. Definitely find out and petition the administration for extra semesters, meanwhile try to save as much as you can and try to find work. I don't know much about software job industry, but it's going to be tough. There wont be any guarantee finding a job but nevertheless do not give up and try to keep the work you already have. I do not recommend resorting to a shelter because from my experience the list to get in is very long and the environment is bit dangerous. Do not be discouraged from moving your family into a smaller apartment, people can definitely find ways to handle it. I am guessing OP's family don't work because they're immigrants or because of health issues. Nevertheless OP can try to save by getting handouts from food banks and churches, applying for programs like food stamps, getting discounts on utilities, and using public transit. 

TL;DR Don't be afraid to drop out and go for that software engineering job.
I don't want to identify myself otherwise I would post on the Piazza, but if the poster is from the greater Richmond area (and fucked up as this is, is Asian and is first or 1.5 gen) I might be able to give him some hook-ups for loans of up to ~$5k/semester at no interest until graduation.

(I'm also a transfer from a low-income family who needs to supplement household income. I quit my 30hr job and now I'm only working 15hr which is WAY more manageable)
Sigh at the one anon bringing in race into this smh
Take out loans rather than drop out imo. Graduating in several years with an EECS degree will more than pay for itself. 
We would have had free college with Bernie but we got a Drumpf instead. I'm so sorry about your situation. Please do set up a GoFundMe, and I will donate to it - it is the progressive thing to do while we are stuck in the dark ages with Drumpf.
if living in an apartment with your family is worst case scenario, it sounds like your family is living beyond its means. Have fewer kids next time?
Why does it matter if he is asian or not?
Financial aid for independent students covers tuition as well as housing. So college is basically free. Supporting a family on the other hand...
Any family is one diagnosis or cat accident away from this, potentially. Don't be such an asshole. 
You have no idea what you are talking about. You don't even understand the scenario described in the OP. 
tfw when you're too retarded to get into a decent uni and blame everything on affirmative action
Because that is how most Asians at Cal are- exclusive as fuck.
\>only losers are racist or sexist!

\>the people who hold all the power in society are discriminatory!

Make up your libshit mind lol. I went to ucsb. There were still too many dumbfucks there "
