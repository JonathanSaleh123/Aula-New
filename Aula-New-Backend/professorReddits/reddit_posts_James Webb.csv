Berkeley Connect,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wyvzqy/berkeley_connect/,2022-08-26 23:52:59,I’m looking for an easy 1 unit class and was considering a history berkeley connect course. I’m not a history major or know a lot of history in general but was told the connect classes are pretty chill. Would it be a bad idea to join the class with limited knowledge on the subject or is it not really a big deal? If anyone has experience with any connect courses please let me know your experience/opinion!,"It’s a great idea to join such a class you have limited knowledge in— you’ll learn lots!

My favorite class was a history course in fact! The course started from the big bang and covered 1 billion years each week until the present.
consider taking a decal!
That sounds super interesting :o What class was this if you don’t mind me asking?
Lol the big bang. I remember it like it was yesterday.
Is your middle name James Webb?"
