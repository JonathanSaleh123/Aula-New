Does this class schedule look okay? 5 classes and 20 units,https://i.redd.it/0ppfc51v2c5c1.png,2023-12-09 13:02:03,,"If you can find another alternative to anthro, then youâ€™ll have four day weekends â€¦ just fyi.
 no one needs 20 units this will suck
Define ""okay""
Maybe add another anthropology class
all work and no lunch makes you cranky
Add another
Enjoy
May Oski have mercy on your soul and your firstborn child's soul
!! it needs to be symmetric
FYI itâ€™s Gustavâ€™s first year teaching which is both good and bad. He taught one class this semester and it went well pretty easy except he stacked a couple projects at the end of the semester which was rough. He said he now knows not to do that for future classes. So heâ€™ll prbly tell you on the first day of class that the syllabus isnâ€™t fully perfect because itâ€™s the first time the class has been taught. But over all he was an easy grader and is always looking to give you the credit when he can. Anthro 114 will be rough.
Well, if you want to waste your time at Berkeley taking it easy, I guessâ€¦..
Twenty units is begging for trouble. Everything has to go perfectly inside and outside the classroom for 20 units to work well. Even if the planets align, you will still likely want to unalive yourself during midterms and finals because there wonâ€™t be enough hours in the day to do anything but disciplined schoolwork. It depends on what your goals are. Iâ€™ve done it once at cc before, and it was breaking me psychologically and physically between midterms and finals. Iâ€™ve worked 70-hour work weeks, too. Twenty units, to me, was equivalent to 70+ hour work weeks. I canâ€™t imagine doing that here at UC Berkeley, which has higher standards than any job or boss Iâ€™ve ever had. It sounds like you have a plan, though. In general, I donâ€™t recommend anyone ever take more than 16, if possible.
U pay tuition to take Jewish studies. Lmao
Gustav is the best I loved his primatology class so much this semester
Itâ€™s fine except you enrolled in these three months ago and the final is tomorrow! How did you forget, what will you do?!

(Youâ€™ll have this dream a lot after college)
I need a bio anthro and it would either be this course or paleo pathology which I know would k*ll me :(
I wanna minor and Iâ€™m going to be studying abroad which doesnâ€™t have any of my major courses. I also donâ€™t wanna pay for the summer
Hmm like will I be able to relax. Iâ€™m only gonna be one extracurricular 3-5 hours per week so Iâ€™m hoping I will have time to not just do school
wdym
Why do you say Anthro 114 with Hayden will be rough?
I might end up dropping the minor :( really not sure tho
Your comment history is all over the place. Time to see a therapist
Really trying to beat those anti semitism allegations huh
If itâ€™s paleopath with Dr. Agarwal itâ€™s a great class! Itâ€™s not that hard and there are no assignments or anything and itâ€™s mostly just the final project split up into parts. Attendance is mandatory but they just pass a sheet around you sign your name on butttt you can complete a discussion post for every class you miss! There are exams but theyâ€™re really not all that difficult and most, if not all info, can be found on the slides. 

Idk how you feel about 114 but Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re a fellow anthro major and if you love socio/cultural youâ€™ll have a great time. Prof. Hayden is a great lecturer and I had them when I took 114. 196 is going to be a seminar and itâ€™ll be pretty time consuming IMO. Iâ€™ve never taken a class with Prof. Smith but thereâ€™s usually a build up to a large project/presentation/deliverable at the end of the semester.
youâ€™ll be fine imo. iâ€™ve taken 20 units stem heavy and had a life. just manage your time well! everyone is different good luck! gob ears
Not the prof but the class itself is dense
Doesnâ€™t have to do with Jewish studies. My comment still stands with any type of ethnic study. Nothing out of college to do with it
Prof Smith is amazing.   I had her for 136B this semester and am really looking forward to 196 with her.    See you in 114 as well Iâ€™ve heard a lot of good things about Prof Hayden.
Thank you! The paleo pathology course is with another professor unfortunately :(
college of chemistry too? teach me ur ways iâ€™m at 19 for next semester
ðŸ˜¥
true in an institution of higher learning thereâ€™s no need to learn more of course why didnâ€™t I think of that"
