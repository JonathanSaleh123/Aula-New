Classes / professors that you enjoyed just sitting and listening to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17b3ntp/classes_professors_that_you_enjoyed_just_sitting/,2023-10-18 15:44:51,"For example, a few:

**Drugs and the Brain - David Presti**

**GEOG10AC (Worldings: Regions, Peoples and States) - Jon Kosek**

These were classes where most lectures I could just sit and enjoy the fascinating lecture delivered by a great and engaging speaker. Anyone have any other recommendations?","Davina Chan - Neuropsychology of Happiness  
She is an amazing professor and you can tell she loves teaching. Her slides are very detailed so there isn't any need to take notes, you can just sit in class and enjoy. That class transformed my life for real because of who the professor was, and it is the best class I've taken at Cal. I may not have believed in the power of mindfulness and meditation if it wasn't for the knowledge this class empowered me with.

&#x200B;

John Campbell - Philosophy of Mind.

I kind of think of his lectures like listening to a very interesting podcast and each week is a different episode of the general topic of philosophy of mind. He is Scottish so the way he speaks is very engaging, funny, and extremely knowledgable. You don't even need to take notes for the class, slides have minimal information because he mostly just wants to invite the class to have a discussion during lecture. It does help to do the readings of the week during the week as you go.  
The class explores free will and determinism through the compatibilist and incompatibilist views (Benjamin Libet), what we can say about moral responsibility and free will through first-order and second-order desires (Harry Frankfurt), the way we imagine transformative experiences (Laurie Paul), Locke's claim that what makes a person the same person over time is the psychological continuity of memory and consciousness, Descartes on the soul, functionalism, qualia, etc. He really brings you up to speed on the state-of-the-art literature on where the mind body problem is.
Anything by Laleh Behbehanian
John Campbell for PHILOS 3A he’s such an awesome guy you just can’t help but love him
Any class with Zook! I was a poli sci major with 0 interest in international relations, but I took every class I could with Zook and loved all of them!
Asad Ahmed - melc 180 or melc 146. Theres no hw, just two essays and the midterm and final. Great courses if you are interested in studying religion. His voice is calming as well.
Ryan Edwards
global 173 - darren zook
also i loved charles Marshall’s section of bio 1b but it is very content heavy
UGAB 192-T, Edible Education with Professor Will Rosenzweig. Great class!
Paulin Math 54
SOCIOL113AC with Professor Hurtubise. A really well spoken and inspirational man! After every lecture, the majority of the class applauded him (at least when I took it this summer). Highly recommend!
Are you a psych major? Neuropsychology of happiness looks great, but looks like it is only open to psych majors"

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"
