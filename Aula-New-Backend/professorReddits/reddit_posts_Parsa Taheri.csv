prof Parsa Taheri - Intro to Solids MecEng C85/ CivEng C30?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vzor20/prof_parsa_taheri_intro_to_solids_meceng_c85/,2022-07-15 06:28:32,Has anyone taken Introduction To Solid Mechanics with Parsa Taheri? His ratemyprof is not good for e7 but some people are saying he's better in solids.,"I was taking E7 with him but he couldn't manage the class because he was teacher it first time. He was reading over the slides and boring.
When I asked my friend who were taking both E7 and C30 they said he is completely different person in C30, more fun and relatively easy.
So I recommend him for C30 not E7.
P.S: Are you MecE or CivE? I am CivE
Oh cool, I'm MecE. Do you know how difficult it is to get a good grade in his C30 class?
I never heard of anyone getting A-. My friend got B+.
B- is easy. Average grade is B."
