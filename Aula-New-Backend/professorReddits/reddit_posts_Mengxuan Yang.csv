@People taking 185 with Mengxuan Yang,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16yyd79/people_taking_185_with_mengxuan_yang/,2023-10-03 10:42:56,How is his teaching? I'm trying to pick a 104 prof.,"/srs  
I am in Yang's 185, He lectures pretty well (but again he just recites stein), it is probably best practice to read the textbook before his lecture beforehand to keep up. Personally he lectures better than who I had for 104. Yang mentioned he teaches 104 with Rudin so keep that in mind. 

At least for 185, the grades are binned to 80% A and no +/- . btime says his distros are relatively normal/easier.
Take Wodzicki
>Yang mentioned he teaches 104 with Rudin so keep that in mind.

who's rudin
I am taking Yangâ€™s 104 right now. Do you know if he curved the class last time and if yes what was the grade cutoff for an A when you took 185"
Real Analysis Profs??,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16yyexb/real_analysis_profs/,2023-10-03 10:44:51,"I'm trying to take 104 next semester, but all the lectures are taught by visiting professors? so if anyone knows anything about the following:

* Anuj Kumar
* Krutika Tawri
* Zhiyan Ding
* Sergei Korotkikh
* Mengxuan Yang

I'm so scared pls help ðŸ¥²","Tawri >>>>
No reason to be scared, most of the visiting professors (aka postdocs) are very good teachers.
avoid chinese profs, theyre usually very tough
why?
Thanks for the info! What do you like about Tawri?"
Best Instructor for Math 185?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uhnymp/best_instructor_for_math_185/,2022-05-03 12:34:40,"Out of Rachel Webb, Mengxuan Yang, Tony Feng, Krutika Tawri, Zhiyan Ding.","Where did you find whoâ€™s teaching??
I'm with Mengxuan. I do not recommend.

Mengxuan is gonna teach math 104 next semester. Could you give me some comments on his way of teaching?
Just curious, why? Iâ€™m thinking about switching out of Tawriâ€™s class.
Tawri is terrible I do not recommend either. The problem s 185 is a core math class and all of the professors are all associate professors or visiting. I'm taking it with Rachel Webb lets hope this professor is better
Feels like he doesnâ€™t know the material well enough to explain it. The entire time he was talking it felt like 1 long, jumbled, run-on sentence.
I wanted to enroll in her class but itâ€™s closed sadly! I might just have to stick it out with Tawri.
Let us know how it goes on Monday!!
I know this is a year late but how was Tawri as a professor? Planning on taking her for 104 next semester

Tawri is super nice, she gives little homework and teaches the material well. But she is not as generous with her grade distribution compared to the other professors"
Best instructor for math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y9htuz/best_instructor_for_math_104/,2022-10-20 19:54:50,"Out of Krutika Tawri, Ryan Hass, Khalilah Beal-Uribe, Mengxuan Yang, Zhuhai Ding, Olga Holtz. Appreciate any comments on teaching styles and fairness of the exams. 
I heard a lot of good things about Hass. Very outstanding. Don't if I should choose him since other smart math majors would def choose him and the class is curved.","Hass is an all around great choice. As you seem familiar, I won't elaborate apart from noting that his 104 is on the easier side. What I can say is this: absolutely do *not* take Beal. Awful and apathetic.

Holtz is the only other option who is a regular faculty member. She's known to be quite tough, but definitely thorough and reasonable. If you want to take a deep dive into analysis, she's the best option.

All the rest are postdocs/visiting scholars who are brand new.
I have Krutika Tawri for 185 rn. The lectures are easy to understand and the pace is decent. Hws are long in terms of number of problems, but the difficulty is not hard. The midterm was also not too difficult. I would recommend taking 104 with them. Dunno about the othersâ€¦
Bro hass all the wayyyy. Idk abt his being on the easier side cuz his exams are def challenging, but i can understand that his lectures and explaining concepts make understanding 104 possible. Honestly, just take Hass.
Hi! Haas's class already filled up for non-math majors :/. If I'm looking for a easier grade (because my GPA matters quite a bit to me), which one of the other professors would you recommend?

But she also j reads off the book? And sometimes she j skips proofs of important theorems. I do agree with the rest of ur comment tho. IMO she might be good at lecturing but she's not good at teaching.
Yang, Ding, and Tawri are all new postdocs, so I can't comment on their style/experience at all, sadly.
I am in the same boat as you. Where do you end up with?
Her 110 is considered challenging. You'll definitely experience linear algebra in its full force. But 110 is an amazing class, and Olga will give it the energy it deserves.
Yeah ur right. Thatâ€™s def a fair criticism. What I wanna say is that, if someone else is a solid 10/10 choice, go w them. But, they make a solid backup, and as far as profs go, you can very easily do way way worse, or so has been my experience.

I believe she uses Axler, yes."
