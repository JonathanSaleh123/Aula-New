Shaq 100%, Cuban is definitely the best technical choice but imagine telling people Shaq spoke at your commencement ceremony?
Why are so many from Shark Tank? And why so many sports players? Are these really the only people available for a commencement speech?
Steven Curry for the clout.
Steph wtf
Shaq
Can this weak ass school get lebron on there??
Wait, I’m a rising senior but I haven’t gotten this email.
Jennifer Garner is so random lmao.  Also, fuck Kevin O'Leary.
1) Eric Schmidt

2) Mark Cuban

3) Steph Curry
why is everyone glazing mark cuban so much jeez louise
i like how no one has said Chris Pine so far LMAO

Are we already forgetting about Kevin O Leary’s enthusiastic participation in the FTX clusterfuck?
Eric schmidt or you dumb
Shark tank is so cringe
Alex morgannnnnn yal wild for mark cuban. I want an athlete who cares about business bro. We could here some dope stories from athletes that got the mental game on lock in the industry.
Majorie Taylor Green
STEPH STEPH
Where do u even vote
Why no Guy Fieri?
Cuban, the Ayn Rand fanboy?   What is wrong with you…really?   Shark Tank?
Eric Schmidt obviously is the best option but all the zoomers here will probably choose Cuban. Embarrassing and incredibly depressing how far that generation has fallen.
Shaq for sure
Nah I think shaq would be best
is none of the above an option? this commencement would literally just be capitalist propaganda 😭. but if i had to choose i’d go with shaq or steve kerr
ㅓ
cuban would be really cool so everyone can clown the mavs. shaq would also be really dope.
Wait, are all of them Berkeley grads?
Mark

Steve Kerr or Stephen curry
shaq, Steph, or Mark cuban
Did jennifer garner go to cal? Lol
Immediately voted for cuban
Yoooooo that’d be the bomb
Cillian Murphy
Yeh, that's what I think too. Like, the clout would be insane getting to name drop shaq
don't care
[deleted]
my thoughts exactly. honestly kinda depressing that all are either business or sports related.
For me it was in my personal email not my Berkeley email. Idk if you’ve check there or it could be in your spam folder
this, except shaq for curry (bro has literally become a festival dj i want to hear him speak)
only arts person on there. christ that’s fucked up.
agreed
Would fit well with FTX being the sponsor on the field at Memorial
the billionaire doesn't care about business?
We got an email from Senior Class Council titled “Commencement Speaker Survey”
Bruh capitalist propaganda?😂😂
kyrie is curry's dad
No only the ones that say “alum”
He was the recent commencement speaker for the English department back in May!
nah u gotta look more into shaq and how he’s built businesses and invested his money. his influence goes way beyond the basketball court
It wasn’t anywhere in my emails (both personal and Berkeley)
Ok makes sense! Totally missed it"
