Best Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tzjiou/best_professors/,2022-04-08 19:31:18,Which professors in general are a must-take during our time here at Cal? (Regardless of department),"James Campbell
John DeNero
Fillipenko for Astron C10

Presti for the Brain classes

Adhikari for Data C140

DeNero for CS 61A/Data 8

Wagner for Data 8 / CS 161

Hug for CS 61B / Data 100 / CS 186

Odean for UGBA 135 (one of the two that taught the class was awesome, the other not so awesome, I think Odean was the awesome one I got Odean and Selinger mixed up all the time).
Catterson. Literal godsend .
Tom Courtade was pretty amazing for EECS 126/127. Also Mike Zaletel for Physics 5A and Physics 112.
Josh Hug
Paulin
ALEXANDER PAULIN- structured lectures, notes, nice exams and SUCH A HELPFUL PERSON
I would add, for their importance in contributions to society:

Prof Robert Reich for PUBPOL C103 Wealth and Poverty.  Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

Profs Christine and David Romer for Econ 2.  Christine served in the Obama administration as the Chair for the Council of Economic Advisers. 

Prof David Card, Econ C142 Applied Econometrics.  Nobel Prize winner in Economics for 2021.

Prof Jennifer Doudna, Bio 1A (probably never again though), Nobel Prize winner 2020 for Chemistry.

Prof Saul Perlmutter, LS 22, Nobel Prize winner for Physics 2011

Prof Randy Schekman, Bio 1A, Nobel Prize winner for Medicine 2013
Thomas Courtade - (EECS 16A/126/127)

Brian DeLay - (History 7A)

Nikhil Svristasa - (Math 54/55/224A)

Jelani Nelson - (CS 170/270)
In before all the Paulin and Denero comments
My favorite were David Presti and Terrence Deacon
TERRY FUCKING JOHNSON, teaches BioE104 and BioE 10(intro to BioE). He‚Äôs leaving us this semester but his last lecture is quite literally a bioengineering event. Hands down the best prof I‚Äôve had. Can‚Äôt believe he was not mentioned here
Prof McFarlane narratve writing
Professor Wendy Brown for Political Science (Modern Political Theory)
Robin Ball- MCB Department
i think hass is pretty good for math classes. Really liked yun song for stat 135, but he rarely teaches it.
Alex Fillipenko, John Denero, David Whitney, Andrew Packard (RIP), Paul Li

Edit: Stephen Hinshaw
Anant Sahai
There are several really good civ engineering profs. The two that come to mind is Claudia Ostertag and Evan Variano. I just really enjoyed coming to class and learning from them. Extremely nice, personable, super smart people. Love them
Karen Nakamura anthro 189
Weaver
Darcy Grigsby for art history, she is phenomenal and makes you want to LOVE art history. Take HA C11 with her (she has an award for teaching after all).
[deleted]
In the music department: Matthew Hough (hard classes but a very good teacher), Robert Yamasato, Amadeus Regucera
John Kaiser sociol150
Denero, Adhikari, Rao
Gireeja Ranade for EECS16A/B
David Landreth in English. Man uses the word ‚Äúcool‚Äù more than any human I‚Äôve ever met, and his energy is just ‚ú®üëçüèª
Underrated, but Whitney for CogSci
Paul Li for Cog Sci 1
I thought Daniel Sargent was the best in the History department.
Professor Grace Gu is fantastic to take practically any class under, and Pete Mardsen for Chem 1A was absolutely unmatched. 

A lot of the other MVPs have already been mentioned
  Joe for JOMAMA 100
Charman for any physics class he‚Äôs teaching
Darren Zook for any global studies class
Hilfinger for 61B
Richard Borcherds for mathematics.
Professor Kaur for econ 174
Robert Reich
Lee Bernstein
Robert Reich
Paulin
The Romers for Econ 2
Wendy Brown for Poli Sci 4
(I think they may all be retired now)
I like John Arnold and bediako
Noel Perkins is a new prof who just came from UMich but let me tell you this man has a gift for teaching. If you ever have a hard technical class, try to take it with him if you can (ME only to my knowledge)
Wes Holliday, super nice and caring prof. Love him!
You can assume that if a Prof is on either of these lists, they‚Äôre pretty awesome.

https://teaching.berkeley.edu/node/240

https://teaching.berkeley.edu/programs/distinguished-teaching-award/past-dta-recipients
Sociology - Mary Kelsey
Math- Michael Wong
Michael Ball - CS 88
Paulin if you have to take math classes
Emmanuel Saez does a good job of answering everyone's questions
Carlos Norena, Daniel Sargent and Nicolas Tackett in the history department
Zohdi

Dames

Casey

All in ME
Only been here a year, but **Pamela Fox** is genuinely one of the nicest/most approachable people I've met. I would 100% recommend taking a class with her. Also **Mat Pyle** was incredible (and very enthusiastic to talk to you about his work), even if he did get off track a lot in class.
Khalid Kadir
Satish Rao/Babak Ayazifar CS70
steven connolly bioe
Prof Stephanie Jones Rogers!! Took two history classes with her she‚Äôs the best. 

Also Dan Neumark - yeah pchem sucks but neumark is the only professor who can make that lecture engaging.
Yun Song,
Kannan Ramchandran, 
Babak Ayazifar,
Josh Hug,
Jelanie Nelson,
Alessandro Chiessa,
Thomas Courtade
Dr. Hug. Not sure if he's still there. It's been awhile since I graduated lol
Eric Stanley for Trans 100, excellent lectures and energy!
Dr. Blonder for Bio 1B or IB 153, he is literally so amazing.
Hiroshi Murayama. I took his intro to quantum field theory class and it kind of made me fall back in love with physics at a point when I was pretty burnt out. He's super kind and an amazing lecturer, really skilled at explaining complex concepts in a comprehensible way.
Sofia villas-boas
Darren Zook! You will not regret taking a class with him
I was a physics major so here‚Äôs my opinion. By far the two best professors I‚Äôve had were Professor Irfan Siddiqi and Professor Michael Crommie. I had them for Physics 137A and Physics 137B. Even though it was quantum mechanics, those were some of the classes I ended up doing the best in. They‚Äôre both funny, entertaining, and explain unintuitive concepts in an accessible way for undergraduates. All professors could learn from them.

Username checks out ü§£
Forgot to add one more, Jelani Nelson for CS 170.  Awesome lecturer, great person, in the news lately for Karen fighting.
Can't speak to the rest, but +1 vote for Adhikari
Fillipenko is the greatest
No hilfinger? Sadge
Alexander Paulin for Math 1B/ Math 54.
I also had Zalatel for 5A and he was fantastic. Really great lecturer!
[deleted]
robert reich and his class are completely overrated
Yeah Scheckman is maybe the worst lecturer I‚Äôve ever had.
+1 for MacFarlane.
Yes her intro to physio is awesome
I second this. I recommend that everyone, not just cs majors take at least one of his classes
Seconding this
I 100% SECOND THIS.
was looking for this commentüôåüôåüôå
Rao - wonderful human being, one of the best in OH, inspired me to work my ass off in 70 - but a poor lecturer.  Similar category to Hilfinger without the sarcasm.
Definitely not Rao
I would say he‚Äôs a excellent lecturer , but I wouldn‚Äôt categorize him in the ‚Äúmust-take‚Äù category.  I‚Äôm probably just being picky about this, but in my time at Berkeley I had a lot of classes, including Paul Li, with outstanding professors and lecturers, but only a few which I would elevate to GOAT status.
I have Pete marsden for chem 3al this sem and 3b next sem so happy he‚Äôs my favorite professor so far
I had Grace Gu for solid mechanics. That class moves at the pace of a snail and the material is incredibly boring but she's a good enough lecturer to almost make up for it.
bediako underrated
Casey is the bomb
it is so funny to me I got downvoted for this LOL

absolute boss
STATS 134 (the probability class she used to teach) was a really hard class for me, but man Adhikari's lectures were great. I made sure to never miss them.
Crystal clear lectures and presentation, even for some of the more advanced topics. I don‚Äôt think there was a single lecture where a large portion of the class seemed confused en-masse. My understanding is that this is uncommon among professors who teach 126/127.
I might have taken it with you lol, I took her for Statics (ME C85) and Composites* (ME 127)*"
