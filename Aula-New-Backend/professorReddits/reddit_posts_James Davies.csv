UCD (University Honors Program and $30k merit scholarship) vs. UCB,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1281l80/ucd_university_honors_program_and_30k_merit/,2023-03-31 15:17:32,"Hello,

**Here is some background:** I have been blessed with two very amazing options for college and I am having a difficult time deciding what exactly it is that I should do. I live in Sacramento, so both campuses are very close to my home (within 2 hours), so proximity is not necessarily an issue. My major at both is Mathematics and I am hoping to get a minor or some sort of focus in Computer Science. I would love to work a tech job or something along those lines. Also, my parents have saved enough money to cover the cost of schooling for me, so money is not necessarily the issue. *However, my parents offered me cash for any merit-based scholarship that I could receive.*

**My Dilemma:** With all of that being said, I was accepted into both UC Berkeley and UC Davis. At UC Davis I was selected to join the University Honors Program (which I would definitely do if I were to attend) as well as the James and Leta Fulmor Scholarship which grants a total of $30k if I maintain a 3.25 GPA. I like both campuses quite a bit, but have always been more of a rural guy (though I am very open to living in the city). **My question is, is the prestige of** **UC Berkeley** **enough to give up the scholarship and honors program?** I am worried that if I do end up choosing UC Davis, then I will not have as much opportunity as I would at UC Berkeley since I want to get a job in tech. I would love some opinions on this, because I don‚Äôt know what exactly to do from here. Thank you!","If you want to work in tech, my recommendation is going to Berkeley. $30k sounds like a lot of money now, but I think you should be able to recoup that fairly quickly working in big tech.

Major tech companies recruit very heavily out of UC Berkeley and the alumni network is quite strong. $30k might honesty end up being in the ‚Äúsigning bonus‚Äù territory if you end up working at some companies.
Congrats on your acceptances! Ultimately, you are facing great options and this is a pretty big choice. It would be easy for me to give you a good reason to go to Berkeley, but there are also plenty of good reasons to go to Davis. At the end of the day, *you* really have to be content, happy, or excited about the school that you attend.

My biggest piece of advice would be to spend the next month touring both campuses, talking to current students, and asking about what being there is actually like. Stats and projections are important, but ultimately if you feel completely better about one than the other, then that's your answer.

I wish you luck and keep us updated with what you decide or if you need advice!
Same circumstance as me haha. I got into UC Berkeley's BSC housing program, so I'll only pay a bit over 4k a year now for housing, so that helped me ease my mind in choosing Berkeley.  I got the acceptance in February for the early admits. So I was just stressing in March when I got my acceptance from Davis.

I am also worried about grade deflation and the competitiveness, but from what I've heard from students it's just stereotypes."
Asking Berkeley residents who are the most capable of being non-biased (and most readily receptive of the truth),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pz4mhz/asking_berkeley_residents_who_are_the_most/,2021-10-01 02:45:27," I have a deep confession to make to a noble girl by the name of UCSB. It is this: UCSB is the angelic (i.e. Sam Raimi's) Mary Jane Watson of our universe.

This position makes the most sense. UCSB and UCSC are the only girl UCs; of that, UCSC represents Aunt May as befitting of their slug-gishness. UCB and UCLA are the cutthroat and mentally ill Osborns, with UCLA explicitly played by James Franco (the Bruin) and UCB being the elder figure of the Osborns. UCSD represents Aquaman and he exists in DC, not MARVEL. UC Davis represents Firenze from Harry Potter.

**UCSB has the only masked-hero mascot of the UCs, meaning that it is the UC with the most right to the principles of Spider-Man**. With the most ethical and righteous of the Gauchos representing masked heroes, UCSB herself - nested in a notably German and Dutch county - is clearly the heavenly archetype giftedly portrayed by a Swedish+German superstar by the name of Kirsten Dunst. Finally, UCSB and its students are only half alive - *half of themselves* \- without one another.

It is rare that a connection would make so much majestic sense, and I will point this out to my fellow UCSB students. To reduce as much confirmation bias as possible, however, I would also like to ask the opinion of Berkeley students - see if you guys are seeing the same things I have pointed out.

Norman Osborn was a crazed maniac who tried to kill Peter Parker and those whom he loved, but I think you guys are more ethically capable than that. Thank you so much and please enjoy these treats after sharing your agreements and/or corrections.

"At public university in California, only 13 percent of students are white",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dt0amj/at_public_university_in_california_only_13/,2019-11-07 08:43:01,"At the University of California ‚Äì Merced, demographic statistics at the public university in Northern California show only about 13 percent of its student population is white, the rest are students of color.

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)  
[**UC Santa Barbara: White**](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/common.data.set.2014.15.pdf)  
[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it ‚Äúproudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,‚Äù its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced‚Äôs student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion‚Äôs share of the student body at 3,022 students ‚Äì or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

üì∑Next up? ‚ÄúNonresident aliens,‚Äù defined as students who are not U.S. citizens ‚Äî either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either ‚Äútwo or more races‚Äù or Native American, and 1 percent ‚Äúdeclined to state.‚Äù

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students ‚Äì more than the African American student population.

‚ÄúUC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren‚Äôt exposed to higher education opportunities early on,‚Äù campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added ‚Äúundocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don‚Äôt know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.‚Äù

[**RELATED:¬†Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a ‚ÄúHispanic-serving institution‚Äù designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED:¬†Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California‚Äôs demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown‚Äôs office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

‚ÄúAs the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,‚Äù the governor‚Äôs office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says ‚Äúit really depends on the context‚Äù and that ‚Äúour distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.‚Äù

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

Just look at his username
The same people who care about affirmative action, quotas, bonus SAT points, and racial preferences.

Next question?
I would have rather avoided that cringe
despite being 13% of the population, white people commit 50% of the complaining about this topic
Then why not make a post arguing against that instead of just acting like a damn racist (like your username basically confirms)
Asians have the highest average SAT scores buddy....Whites get preference over asians...that's not fair...a fair system would be allowing high IQ people, regardless of invariant biological features, an easy path to citizenship in the US and allowing low to slightly above average people to move elsewhere to work in some shitty manufacturing job... Less pay but low cost of living...agree?

***racist (like your username basically confirms)***

I should come up with a post complain about people who make mistaken assumptions.

What makes you think I haven't complained about those racist, discriminatory policies?
Pretty much agree but I am not interested in more people moving to the US, especially non European stock people.
 Whites are 63% of the population, down from 90% pre 1965 Hart Celler Act. Down to 50% in 2042 and who knows how much by the end of the century.

Whites will disappear from the WORLD in three centuries.

Holy shit man you said you never said anything racist before when I called you a twat earlier today for calling latin americans ""illegal immigrants"" in our own sub

You lying liar.
cope
""Illegals Immigrants"" are illegal immigrants and the where they come from is irrelevant.

TRUE OR FALSE: Most illegals are from Latin American countries.

Preferring your own country to remain as it is is normal, common, natural, ethical, moral, and expected. EVERY country has or has had ethnic, religious, or racial requirements for naturalization. For example, unless you are Japanese or Jewish you can't become a citizen of Japan or Israel.

 Mexican Immigration Policy through the years.

* 1917 - Shorter naturalization times for Latin Americans
* 1921 -  restricts Chinese immigration
* 1923 -  excludes Indians
* 1924 -  excludes blacks
* 1926 -  excludes gypsies
* 1926 - Exclusion of those who ""constitute a danger of physical degeneration for our race""
* 1927 - Exclusion of Palestinians, Arabs, Syrians, Lebanese, Armenians and Turks
* 1929 - Confidential circular excludes Poles and Russians
* 1931 - Confidential circular excludes Hungarians
* 1933 - Exclusion or restrictions of blacks, Malays, Indians, the 'yellow race' (East Asians, except Japanese), Soviets, gypsies, Poles, Lithuanians, Czechs, Slovacks, Syrians, Lebanese, Palestinians, Armenians, Arabs and Turks
* 1934 - Exclusion or restrictions extended to Aboriginals, Latvians, Bulgarians, Romanians, Persians, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Albanians, Afghans, Ethiopians, Algerians, Egyptians, Moroccans and Jews.
* 1939 - Shorter naturalization times for Spaniards
* 1947 - promotes a preference for ""assimilable"" foreigners
* 1993 - Shorter naturalization times for Portuguese (granted to Latin Americans and Iberians due to historical and cultural connections

PERSONAL ATTACK: REPORTED

Wrong again. I never wrote ANYTHING about equating. It's purely preference. Just like just about EVERY other country has. If you and your wife where (are) white I GUARANTEE you that you would PREFER your kid marry someone white - just like EVERY other set of same race parents would. It's natural and normal.
