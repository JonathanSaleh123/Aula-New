AC course for summer: ETHSTD 11AC or ASAMST 20AC? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cohvh8/ac_course_for_summer_ethstd_11ac_or_asamst_20ac/,2024-05-09 22:20:31,"Hi,

I need help with which to choose. I am planning to take one of these online options for Summer A session. ETHSTD 11AC ( Profs: Keith Feldman and Juana Rodriguez) or ASAMST 20AC (Harvey Dong)? I am doing some minor medical treatment, and I might be little tired. Easier or less load class would be real nice. If you have taken any of them, please share your input. 

Thank you in advance. ","Asamst 20ac you have to do a bit of work, but cool class. Nothing you canâ€™t handle"
