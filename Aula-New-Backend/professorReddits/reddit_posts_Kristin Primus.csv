cog sci 1 and philos25b recorded?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/194pfl3/cog_sci_1_and_philos25b_recorded/,2024-01-11 23:36:03,"im currently in philos25b (with Kristin Primus) trying to swap into cogsci1b (#24 on waitlsit, 10 spots in the class open). the class times overlap with each other and im not sure if im going to be able to get off of the cog sci waitlist so was wondering if either of the two are recorded so i can attend one in person!","hi! when I took cogsci1b a few semesters ago with Professor Croom, lectures weren’t recorded but all the slides were posted, and assignments were pretty much taken directly from the slides. i didn’t even end up going to lecture after the first or second week, so in my opinion it’s totally doable!
Philos 25b is definitely not recorded"
