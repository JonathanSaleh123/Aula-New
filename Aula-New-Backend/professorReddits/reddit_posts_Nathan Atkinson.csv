"Professor Nate Atkinson, instructor for RHET 100: Writing at the University for Transfer Students sponsored by Art of Writing. AMA!",https://i.redd.it/gnn662rmto3b1.jpg,2023-06-02 16:16:21,"This is Mark Basta, Program Associate for Art of Writing, a resource available to all Cal students! Our seminars, workshops, tutoring programs, and events build a collaborative writing community across the disciplines, and approach writing as a teachable art. 
[RHET 100](https://artofwriting.berkeley.edu/course/rhet-100-writing-at-the-university-a-writing-seminar-for-transfer-students/)is the only class at Cal specifically designed for transfer students. Prof Atkinson will be answering any questions you have about the course, Art of Writing, or just general questions! Note that this course is offered in the Summer 2023.
We will be answering all your questions on Tuesday, June 6!
Feel free to ask about anything, but please keep it as respectful as possible.","Nate is the BEST! I took his class a year ago and it was so much fun!
What are top 5-10 resources to make me more effective at persuasion? I have some drama with door dash and also need to be able to argue for a raise and other benefits with my job. What tips can you give those applying for grad school in effective persuasive writing for their applications? My friend is applying so hope you have some good advice and resources! Thanks!
Why are there R&C classes that donâ€™t mention the theme until classes start and itâ€™s too late. I hope the Rhetorics department burns down for this unacceptable trickery.
Iâ€™ve taken my R&C requirements and I donâ€™t have time to take another dedicated writing class, what would you recommend I do to keep working on my writing?
If you are not wrong, you are the guy who ran for ASUC Senate Mark Basta (talking about guy who made post not professor). This guy is amazing. ASUC gonna miss your intellect.
What makes the class specialized for transfer students?
What is even rhetoric never heard before? What you guys do? What are career opportunities?
PSA for anyone who stumbles upon this post: This man is a fucking amazing instructor
How do you see ChatGPT changing the landscape

What are your thoughts on the schoolâ€™s mascot?
Can you recommend any other helpful classes for transfer students? Also, any tips you can provide in helping with the transition to CAL.
Thatâ€™s a big question! I donâ€™t think I have a top 10, but I can say that the most important thing to remember about persuasion is that you need to know your audience. So rather than researching persuasion, you and your friend should research the people youâ€™re trying to persuade. What do they have at stake in the situation? What kinds of arguments will they be receptive to? Good luck!
R&C classes are often the last courses scheduled within a department, which means theyâ€™re also the last courses to be assigned instructors. As a result, the descriptions often come late. All that said, as a transfer student you probably donâ€™t need to worry about R&C classes. Check with the undergraduate advisor for your major about that!
I would recommend looking for classes in the Departments of Rhetoric and English that have a Writing Fellow attached. Writing Fellows are course-embedded tutors that work with students on their writing for that class, and in general. Feel free to email me at my work address in the Fall and Iâ€™ll let you know which classes have Writing Fellowsâ€¦ But also, take my class this summerâ€¦ Itâ€™s great for anyone who wants to become better at writing in the university and beyond!
Thatâ€™s me! Thank you so much for your kind words, and I hope I can continue working for all the students even outside an official elected position!
I designed the class because having been a transfer student myself, I know that the one of the biggest challenges I faced was figuring out what professors wanted to see in an essay. I had to figure it out through trial and error, and it was super stressful! So, this class is set up to help transfer students to figure this out before they step onto campus.
Rhetoric is the study of persuasion and its effects. Itâ€™s a bit like philosophy, but rather than looking for eternal truths we look for how meaning is produced in particular situations. Rhetoric majors go on to work in a variety of fields including advertising, technical and professional writing, law, politics, and of course, academia. Itâ€™s also frequently half of a double major.
Iâ€™m wary of making predictions about the long-term effects of new technology, but the current effect of ChatGPT is that itâ€™s forcing us to examine our assumptions about the relationship between writing and thinking. Thatâ€™s a good thing!
I'm afraid it's not free... Rather, it's a standard summer course.
I fear and respect our mascot. Legend.
Sexy beast knew youâ€™d show up
I canâ€™t speak to which classes are best for transfer students. The most important consideration should be interestâ€¦ Look for classes on topics you care about. As for general advice, take advantage of office hours early in the semester. Use them to find out more about what the professor about the course, and about the university. You donâ€™t need to arrive with a specific question or issue. Office hours are a chance to talk more generally, and your profs should be able to provide you with advice on how to make the most of your time at Berkeley.
Thanks for your answer. Unfortunately Iâ€™m left unsatisfied, though. Any book or resource you can offer at all? Just remember everything you know makes sense to you because youâ€™ve already learned it, but weâ€™re starting at the first step. You must have learned things from somewhere, so what are some resources? Thanks!
Awesome. Thanks!
Sure! *Influence* by Caldini offers a fine account of the psychology of persuasion. For some techniques, you could look at *Thank You For Arguing* by Heinrichs. Between those two books you'll have more than enough information to work from. That having been said, you'll see that both of those books, and really all rhetoric books going back to  Aristotle, stress that understanding audience is central. That's because the techniques offered by books on persuasion and argument will fall flat if they're not adapted to the audience.
Wow, Iâ€™ve gotta say that this comment is not a very persuasive way to get someone to give you something you want â€¦ The first step advice you were given was to think about the audience and whatâ€™s in it for them, but your comment emphasizes only yourself and your stakes. ðŸ˜‚
Wow cool thanks this helps a lot. Thanks! Iâ€™m satisfied :)
I mean I was pretty clear about needing advice wasnâ€™t I lol this is just an example of how badly I need the help"
