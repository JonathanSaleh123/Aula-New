Dev psych (w/ Fei Xu) experience?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17wbmw1/dev_psych_w_fei_xu_experience/,2023-11-15 18:33:28,Anybody have it? What was it like? I’m trying not to let rate my professor steer me away before registration,"Some people say the lectures are boring, but I took it last year and to me the lectures and exams were all pretty straightforward, and the workload was fine. Try get a good gsi tho cuz the final paper relies heavily on the gsi’s instructions being clear."
Dev psych (psych 140) with Fei Xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/110weq8/dev_psych_psych_140_with_fei_xu/,2023-02-12 17:54:19,"Hi guys! I’m taking the class listed above and I’m trying to figure out if I need to actually read and take notes on the textbook. The chapters are very long and she’s a pretty good lecturer, but I’m not sure if she tests on random details in the book. Anyone taken this class before?

Thanks!","i took it last semester and found the lectures to be sufficient but i did already have a lot of background knowledge on the material. i found that the tests correlated well with the lecture material.
Thank you! I work in a dev lab so I’m hoping that will help w the background knowledge. Does she test on random stuff in the textbook like random experiments?
yeah that should definitely help. i don’t remember her doing so.
Did you ever take the class? And if so, how was it??"
