Math 55 Nikhil Srivastava Past Syllabus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c1sm6b/math_55_nikhil_srivastava_past_syllabus/,2024-04-11 15:36:50,"I plan on taking Math 55 with Nikhil Srivastava in the fall. Does anyone have his past syllabus from recent years, especially on his grading breakdown? Any advice on taking his class and did you enjoy his lecturing style/class in general? Thank you!","hes goat
he has an amazing mind and is a great professor. I, and others, found it extremely hard though (I recall in the final there were many students who got caught cheating :/)
To see his lecture style check out his recordings  
[https://www.youtube.com/@nikhilsrivastava599/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@nikhilsrivastava599/videos)
Grading breakdown in fa21 was:
- 5% hw
- 15% quizzes
- 20% each of two midterms
- 40% final
""5% Homework, 15% Quizzes, 20% each midterm, 40% Final. The lower midterm score will be replaced by the final exam score, if it helps.""
was hw graded based on completion?
half completion half correctness, so you were guaranteed half credit if you turned in all the problems"
"Any insight on these professors?: Lin Lin, Ming Gu, Nikhil Srivastava",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4ls1nu/any_insight_on_these_professors_lin_lin_ming_gu/,2016-05-30 15:42:22,"I'm planning on taking Math 54 in the fall, and it looks like Lin Lin, Ming Gu, and Nikhil Srivastava are the only available professors. Has anyone taken these professors before? If so, how would you rate them? I have found Gu & Srivastava on RateMyProfessor, but have yet to find any ratings for Lin Lin.","this was asked [a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4kj67g/best_math_54_professor/)
Ming Gu is an awful lecturer and you will probably need to learn the material from the textbook if you take him. He does curve pretty generously though, or at least he did in Math 128A when I took him.
Really? I had him and thought he was delightful. The only thing I can think of that might be a turn off is he has a Chinese accent, but if you're an EECS major and can't understand Chinese/Indian/Eastern European accents, then RIP."
Math 54 Spring,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/j61bdm/math_54_spring/,2020-10-06 01:16:18,"Katrin Wehrheim or Nikhil Srivastava? How was your experience with each of them? Who has the “easier tests” and which one should I choose to take Math 54 with?

I’m an international student so Wehrheim’s time suits better for me as compared to Srivastava’s, which is really early in the morning for me (think 4-5am ish).

Thank you!","dont know much about Srivastava but Wehrheim’s 54 was sooo easy, barely any homework (smth like 5 easy textbook problems a week) and the exams seemed to be easier than other profs from what i heard, and their lectures are also pretty good as well! might’ve helped that i took it with the adjunct course, but even then i barely put any effort into the class itself and got an easy A
Hot take but Srivastava is actually a rlly good lecturer so if u wanna learn the material well i recommend Srivastava
>Comment

yep! I took 54 with Wehrheim fall 2019, and it was a good experience. I also had an amazing GSI, so that made things better. We had 4 point weekly quizzes and assignments (m-w-f), but they're all definitely doable. Exams are doable too. I also have pdfs of both textbooks, so lmk if you need them.
If you don't mind, can you talk a bit about how things are weighted in that class?
This is Wehrheim's website from Fall '19: [https://math.berkeley.edu/\~katrin/teach/54/index.shtml](https://math.berkeley.edu/~katrin/teach/54/index.shtml)

You can navigate to logistics to find the weights!"
Best Math 54 Professor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4kj67g/best_math_54_professor/,2016-05-22 09:10:11,"This fall 3 professors are teaching Math 54 -- Ming Gu, Nikhil Srivastava, and Lin Lin. Gu has terrible ratings on ratemyprofessor so I think I'll try to avoid him, but Srivastava and Lin have hardly any ratings if any at all. Who would you take?","If neither of them have good ratings, why not attend both of their lectures for the first week or so and decide which has the better teaching style for you?
I recommend taking the class with the understanding that you will learn only from the textbook. With that in mind, choose the professor with the kindest tests.
I'm taking it with Srivastava personally but I got stuck with an 8 AM discussion RIP :(
Don't know about these other professors but can confirm Gu sucks. Lectures would be more clear if he just did them in Chinese.
Doesn't matter. Try to take the supplemental class if they offer it. If Bon-Soon is still around, you will likely get an A in that class if you put in the effort. He's the best math teacher I've had at Berkeley, not sure if he's still around though..
I've heard many good things about Srivastava's teaching. Also I've met him and he's a really nice guy as well as insightful and good at explaining things.
Lin is a little hard to understand. Srivastava taught Math 55 this past semester and I heard good things about him.
Anyone have any experience with Vojta (H54)?
Sahai, EE 16A
Didn't know you could do this but I'll probably try it out.
So basically I should go into it assuming that I will learn almost everything from the textbook... because the professors are all bad?
What do you think of Srivastava? (if you're currently in his class)
Homework instructions unclear. Accidentally learned Chinese.
Can you explain the supplemental class more?
I had Vojta for H113 last semester. He is a bit dry and mostly follows the book, and he may seem unapproachable or boring. But he is very clear, has excellent and organized boardwork, and gives fair tests. He promptly posts all the homework material and exam information online. Also, his curve was nicer than I expected.

Maybe you can go to the first few classes and see if you like his teaching style.
Not because professors are bad, but learning math from a lecture is like trying to learn to swim from youtube videos. 
I mean that's not the worst takeaway
I believe they labeled it as Math 98 - Adjunct (like most other supplemental classes). There is typically very limited space in the class, I think we had about 20-25 for a full size Math 54 class.

Bon-Soon is a legend. The guy absolutely lives math, yes lives. He has an uncanny ability to make the material fun and understandable despite his corny jokes. We had practice midterms and tests to go along with our class. By the midway point of the semester, I had stopped going to actual lecture and just went to 98 with Bon-Soon.

Just checked and he has since moved on.. to UCLA of all places. Either way, look to take the adjunct class if possible. Easier to learn in a smaller environment than the massive Dwinelle classes."
Pov,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/z5svlb/pov/,2022-11-26 21:38:36,"Alexander Paulin is the best UG math professor at UCB.

Who agrees?","Course evals - head over with this energy
mark haiman is really really awesome

paulin also great. one time I saw him on edwards field at 8:00 am on a monday... dude ran something like 15 laps at top speed. it was scary to watch
The only large class lecturer who ever learned my name ❤️
It is truly unfortunate his approach to teaching is not shared more often among Professors and Lecturers.
this is srivastava erasure and i will not stand for it
[deleted]
Sung Jin Oh was a great professor too
NIKHIL BEST PROF!!
not sure if this is satire but f’(x) for derivative is not complicated at all and is taught in highschool calc
It says ""Sorry, nobody on Reddit goes by that name.""
they are talking about integration by parts, which I agree is weird; i've never seen it written that way. But it's not any more complicated than the usual stuff and is, in fact, entirely synonymous, so I do not think it is a big deal
I’m a calculus tutor, and have seen a few students use the f’(x) g(x) method, i mean it’s completely the same thing. it’s just a another way of writing the same thing, yes it may be longer to write but if a student truly understands what integration by parts is, the notation really doesn’t matter.

Paulin W professor
Idk but his approach was fairly straightforward for me to understand as someone who hadn't done Calc in high school
yes thats what i mean"
