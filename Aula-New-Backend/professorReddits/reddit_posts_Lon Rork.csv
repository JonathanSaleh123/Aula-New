Any feedback on Physed 32 ? How tough is the final exam?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/190t1hi/any_feedback_on_physed_32_how_tough_is_the_final/,2024-01-07 06:15:28,Itâ€™s with Lon Rork. Is 8 a.m actually doable ðŸ˜Š,"My friend attended class the first few times before moving to another breadth, but they told me that it's actually just a literal discussion of the material for that week kinda like office hours. Entirely optional. I believe last semester it was Mondays 6-9pm.
No, 8 am in January is madness. No grade is worth it. Just sleep some more.
Thanks for replying! I was despairing that no one thought to answer ðŸ˜Œ"
