Seminar Recommendation,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hdw16k/seminar_recommendation/,2020-06-22 09:55:17,"Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at Cal, and I'm debating between these freshman seminars: 

Human Neuropsychology by Robert Knights

Reimagining Biology in Light of the Microbiome by Britt Koskella

Any recommendations? Thanks!","Seminars tend to be a single iteration type of deal, so it's mostly about which topic you find the most fascinating, or which professor you want to take a class from. Read the syllabi or email the profs asking for a topic list if you can't decide.
Thanks!"
