How’s professor David Levine for UGBA 101B?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k9eqdn/hows_professor_david_levine_for_ugba_101b/,2020-12-08 14:32:53,,"Had him last spring. He’s a very interesting professor haha. Ngl I didn’t learn a thing in class and he puts too much weight on participating and keeping up with current news which is good but in terms of actual macroecon... it’s pretty lacking. Oh also he’ll take shots of tequila randomly to start class which is... ya.
Lmaooo wow, but how hard was it to get a good grade in that class?
Mmm I wouldn’t know cause I pnp’d the class.. but I do remember case assignments were a big part of the grade as well as participation. Material is a LOT easier than Econ 100b, so as long as you’re proactively participating and find a good group for the cases you should be chill (don’t even remember if we had exams, but if so, they were not bad at all but also probbaly not that heavily weighted)
Omg that sounds great! Btw are you a haas major?
Nope! Took it for the economics major req
I see! Btw is it normal to be on the waitlist for a long time Bc most seats are reserved for haas ppl?
Oh 100%. Basically every haas class if you’re not in haas, you can expect to wait til 1-2 weeks into the next semester when they open up seating if there are open reserved seats :/
omg 1-2 weeks? Can u still catch up with the course work?"
