Anyone know anything about Econ 148? The data econ class,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y9mvde/anyone_know_anything_about_econ_148_the_data_econ/,2022-10-21 00:21:46,Cant see it on berkeleytime,"Itâ€™s a new class for Spring 2023. You may need ECON 140 Econometrics as prerequisite. I usually avoid taking new class as the course structure is not well developed yet
Is this class's exam online or inperson?
It's a new class - I've heard it's basically supposed to be data 100 for economists, sort-of like an upper-div version of data 88E
Do you know who the prof is
The prof is Eric Van Dusen, 140 is not a prerequisite. The only prerequisite is data 8
How did you find it?
Is Van Dusen a good prof
he's great!!! one of the best profs I've had, easy to understand and funny
hi do you know if this class can also fulfill CID requirement for ds major?"
