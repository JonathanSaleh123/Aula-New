Class Recommendation: NucEng24,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ekwgra/class_recommendation_nuceng24/,2020-01-06 08:35:45,"I'm posting because in Spring 2019 I took (on a whim) a really great freshman seminar called ""Radioactivity And Society"" with prof. Eric Norman. Apparently nobody knows about the class because there were like five people enrolled total, so I'm hoping to get some word around. I would've posted on ratemyprofessors but there apparently isn't a page set up for Dr. Norman. So if you still have space for 1 unit in your Spring schedule (or next spring, probably), definitely give this class a shot.",
Will I manage?,https://i.redd.it/8mcc59lx1sbb1.png,2023-07-13 11:41:15,Will this be manageable for a freshman? I'm tryna maintain a 3.5gpa or above as well.,"If I see another redditor that's gonna say that this is doable, I swear to fucking god. This is not doable under any circumstance if you consider you mental health, a balanced life, and a guaranteed higher GPA a key priority. You're gonna have to work on Physics 2 hours a day, Chemistry for an an hour and a half, math for an hour and half, and english for about an average of an hour a day. Please save Physics for another semester and protect your GPA. Only your grades show up on your transcripts, not how fast you finished your techs.
What's your major
background is kinda important especially because a bunch of those are weeders. if you're willing to spend all of your time outside of classes doing busy work you could take a shot, personally i'd save physics for another sem.
What would you recommend replacing physics with? Physics was a backup to engineering 26, I'm WL'd on that. Chemistry I just want to do as well. Also thanks for an honest answer I was thinking it's too much, just got no idea how hard anything is.
Applied math with a focus on engineering or astrophysics. I'm undecided so I'm doing as many prereqs as I can while staying in the unit limit.
Physics is a replacement for engineering 26 since I'm on the WL for that at spot 5. I'm hoping that I'll be able to get it instead.
Either a 1 unit decal course or an easy elective that can help satisfy your AC requirement. I'm also telling you this without knowing your overall plan in terms of either finishing some stuff early or if you wanna front load classes to accomplish some research down the road. Regardless, chemistry, math, english and some other bullshit class is already enough. I also want to take the moment to say that in this sub, ppl always say that something is either ""doable"" or ""not impossible"" but, frankly, I think alot of people are out of touch of reality in terms of what a proper healthy workload is. I think you'll do well if you earn all A's on a lighter workload, take up some extracurriculars, and develop some relationships with professors to get a chance at having research down the road. Doesn't make sense to take more techs right now.
Hm gotcha, I mean this is a heavy load but not impossible. I definitely wouldn't recommend doing physics 7a and chem 1a at the same time typically but I get you're trying to figure out what you wanna do. Although if you're not doing chem1AL it shouldn't be as bad, not sure if that was intentional or not. If you're more into physics then might just be better to swap out chem for something else though
i'd like my chances for getting into e26, a bunch of ppl will drop. 7a is a pretty gigantic jump in workload compared to that so i wouldn't exactly recommend that schedule. not entirely impossible but you will hate yourself.
Alright. I'm most likely gonna replace Chem 1A since I want to knock out ME Minor requirements, and physics would be more useful for my later plans."
