Where can I find cheap spices and groceries?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6una7t/where_can_i_find_cheap_spices_and_groceries/,2017-08-18 22:11:55,"I'm a noob who doesn't know the area and is having a hard time finding affordable food. I'm used to 99c bags of bay leaves and $2 bags of sugar, but it seems like prices are really inflated around campus. Any grocery stores that are an AC transit ride away for good priced food for cooking? ","The Berkeley Bowl? It is fill your own bag and Pat by weight. Not sure how affordable it is.
Lhasa Karnak has bulk herbs and is near campus. Otherwise, have you tried Grocery Outlet? Used to be one in Berkeley, not sure how far away the other locations are. For standard stuff like sugar I often order online from Walmart. 
Go to Berkeley Bowl, go to the non-organic produce section, and buy what's in season. The produce (per lb) is actually super cheap. There are always at least 1-2 fruits and 1-2 veggies on special for around $.50/lb. The bulk bins are hit or miss-- long grain brown rice is $.50/lb, which is awesome, but you can also pay $20/ lb for dried mushrooms and gogi berries and whatnot. Berkeley Bowl is a great place to shop the sales for cheap stuff, but they carry everything and you can also go super fancy/ gourmet. 

For packaged foods and pre-prepared stuff, go to Safeway or TJ's. If you can do Safeway, do that. Register your club card online and get the app-- it's super easy to search deals and add coupons that way, and they will send you targeted specials. 

The farmer's market produce is amazing but much much more expensive than what you'd pay in a non-organic grocery store, so I wouldn't recommend that for cheap finds. 

Try the Student Food Collective-- decent prices for local, organic produce & bulk bins, close to campus, but the packaged stuff in the back can be expensive. 
There's a 99c store on university and san pablo
Trader Joes is pretty great.  There's a solid one just west of campus and a larger one in Oakland down College.  I don't know much about their spice selection specifically, but from what I've seen in passing it's standard at least.
I would go to some Mexican/Latino stores on San Pablo; they're not far from the school and you can get there by bus. Everything is pretty cheap
bombay spice house and other indian shops down university for spices, lentils, and rice in bulk
Trader Joe's

The Dollar Tree
Everything is more expensive in the bay area, including food.   We moved out of the bay area for 3 years and came back.  Food is definitely more expensive here.

You might try the farmers market.  Maybe that's cheaper.
Costco? You have to buy in bulk, but the per unit price is often very good if you can split the massive quantity with roommates or something.  

Edit: turns out it's nowhere near an actual transit line, so probably not a good option. 
Trader Joe's is selling a dozen eggs for 50 cents this weekend! Easily accessible from the 51B line. 
Also they opened a Sprouts on the Albany/Berkeley border. I think the 52 goes there.
Dollar tree on Shattuck has most basic spices but probably not all you would find in a supermarket like Safeway. The spices at dollar tree are a dollar though whereas those at Safeway are at least $3 each 
Berkeley bowl is a more expensive, more hipster version of Whole Foods.
Grocery Outlet is gone now in Berkeley. Really quite sad I miss it dearly. 
holy shit thanks man!
I think you meant dollar tree, right? Is there 99c here? I thought that was an LA thing?
Farmer's market, cheaper? Try $10 for a dozen eggs.
Berkeley Bowl produce is relatively cheap (compared to Trader Joe's and Safeway, I've checked prices) but I wouldn't get anything else there.
More expensive than Whole Foods? Not from my experience, not by a long way.
If you go to Berkeley Bowl for anything other than fruits and vegetables, you're going to pay roughly the same, if not more than the comparable item at Safeway. Berkeley Bowl is really best for quality produce. If I need meat, I usually buy them from Koreana Plaza as they seem to have better prices than Berkeley Bowl.

I've also read online that there really isn't any differentiators between dollar store spices and fancy stuff, so I'd go with what's cheap unless someone else has more information on this?

Only if you're buying processed foods. Anything in a package will not be worth it.

Produce and most of the bulk section is where it's at. For a vegetarian that cooks from scratch - Berkeley Bowl is the winner hands down. 
Dollar Tree is on Shattuck. There is a 99c store at University and San Pablo. 
Ouch.  Maybe not then.
Not a huge difference between most ground spices but the difference between ground and whole is pretty large.
More people need to know about Koreana Plaza.
shhhh,  we need to keep it a secret
