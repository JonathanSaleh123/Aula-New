History 100ac Bonnie Morris,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/z869yd/history_100ac_bonnie_morris/,2022-11-29 13:10:01,Hello I'm having trouble with this class so I'm worried about the finals Can anyone in history 100 ac please share your lecture notes or any advice your professor has given you on how to prepare or take the finals?,did you ever get help? I need notes for the last 3 class periods (covid). üôè
history 100ac midterm,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1761m7b/history_100ac_midterm/,2023-10-12 01:05:12,"whoever is in bonnie morris' history 100ac class, she said blue and green books are allowed for midterm right? or was it just a green book? i have a couple extra blue books that were given to me from some ppl who didn't need it anymore and wasn't sure if i could just use that. Is there a difference ?",I had her last fall and I‚Äôm pretty sure she said either was okay back then. I remember writing the paper for the final in a blue book. they‚Äôre pretty much the same except the green book is more eco friendly and made with recycled materials
Professor Hidetaka Hirota for History 7A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14afswv/professor_hidetaka_hirota_for_history_7a/,2023-06-15 15:40:46,I‚Äôm an incoming Freshman and am planning on taking History 7A this semester but saw there were no reviews on Hirota. Has anyone had any experiences with him/ know how rigorous his courses are? Or would it be better to take History 100AC with Bonnie Morris? Thanks :),"I‚Äôm taking Hirota for History 137AC in the summer. He‚Äôs a good professor, very approachable and acknowledge in US History. There is 2 papers for 137AC, so I assume there will be at least 2 in a normal semester. For each will be 5 pages double spaced. Your sources will come from the readings he will assign which are not lengthy at all, so you don‚Äôt have to do outside research for a paper. No midterm but one final. In History 137AC his final is all short answer questions based on a book he wanted us to read. This might be different for 7A. Overall fair professor. You should definitely take him. He‚Äôs chill. I hope this helps. 


40% on papers.
30% final

Edit: I thought about it. There really should only be 2 papers. I highly doubt there would be more. Since I see History 7A is only two days. You probably just have two reading each week. Max 3.
did you take it online? I'm hoping to take History 137AC this summer with Professor Hirota. So in terms of commitment is just two papers and a book?
Yes it is an online class, final is online. You just need to go to the lectures on Zoom. The commitment is just two papers and two books.

Unfortunately the final is very time restraint, hopefully he changed it because a lot of students complained about it in my class, but it will 400-500 word ‚Äúdiscussions‚Äù about each book and connecting it to the class lectures and with page numbers of quotes from the book (30% each) . Then finally a comprehensive essay(40% of final grade) , 700-900 words using 6 lectures as reference. In 1 hour 30 minutes. I didn‚Äôt finish and got a 70 (completed the two book essays and intro paragraph for the comprehensive) but still got a B+ in the class. Not hard besides the final time restraints.
hii i'm also taking history 137ac over the summer. just wondering, does he record lecture at all? or is there some kind of attendance policy for lecture? i will be in a different time zone, and so i won't be able to attend lecture, but i was hoping there would be a replay that i can watch. also, if you have the syllabus, could you send it to me? thank you so much!
Yes, when I took it the lectures were recorded but you would have 3-4 days after the initial lecture date to watch it then afterward it would be deleted. There is a ‚Äúin class discussion part‚Äù worth 10% but again I wasn‚Äôt able to participate much but still ended up with a good grade. 

Please send me your email privately and I can send you the syllabus.
just sent u my email! tyy"
History 100AC Shoutout!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/olpgv6/history_100ac_shoutout/,2021-07-16 13:35:43,"If you're looking for an AC or an upper div HS/SS course (or both) for Fall 2021, I want to recommend History 100AC: Sports and Gender in US History, taught by Prof. Bonnie Morris! I took it freshman year and was worried about the niche topic (I had very little sports interest) but ended up really enjoying it and learning a lot at the same time! There is also minimal homework/testing aside from readings and the midterm and final exams, so it might be a good fit if you want to take an interesting class with fewer formal assignments.

Course: [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2021-fall-history-100ac-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2021-fall-history-100ac-001-lec-001)","I don‚Äôt think I read any text for this course and got an A. Highly recommend. U watch movies too lol
a little late to this but I didn‚Äôt get into the classes I wanted yesterday and I was stuck scrambling for a class and found virtually nothing (im a freshman btw). Would you recommend I take this as a freshman? I know we‚Äôre discouraged from taking upper divs but this sounds both interesting and pretty light workload compared to other classes. I‚Äôd appreciate your opinion?
would u say this is an easier class to get an A in?
No reason why you can‚Äôt take any upper division breadth/elective classes, unless it has some prereq.
I definitely second what ProfessorPlum168 said, and I don't think you should worry too much about the class being upper division. I took it freshmen year as well, but found it very manageable. Of course, if you're still a little worried, you could try scoping a back up class in case you go to this one and don't like it and drop it!
I'd say it was pretty easy to get an A, because I kept up with the lectures and then did the readings for good measure too. There were only 2 or 3 exams/papers which were graded, so you have to make sure you demonstrate understanding and do well on those."
to all my humanities lovers...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u28qd1/to_all_my_humanities_lovers/,2022-04-12 13:33:53,"what's been your favorite class at cal in the humanities department? i'm looking for classes that genuinely get you thinking, ""wow i never imagined that..""","not popular but Slavic 170. Djordje is the fucking best T\_T and it was interesting to learn about Yugoslav literature. Additionally, ASAMST 128AC, Anthro 149, Global 173, and Anthro 119 all taught me revolutionary things about the world I'd never even heard of
English 178A law and literature blew my mind
Phil 133
I really loved ANTHRO 3AC! Make sure to take it with Karl.
rhetoric 165 with professor NA Weston. best class ive ever taken in my life
I loved NATAMST20A with Beth Piatote!
pls take psychc162--it's literally a class that teaches you how to be happier. what more could u need :)
Take an art history class with literally any of the professors.
History 100AC (Sports and Gender) with Prof. Bonnie Morris!
Hi I am thinking of going into Slavic Studies at Berkeley. It‚Äôs been rly hard finding information from students about the major! Pls let me know what info you know about the major!! Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
JAPAN 177, it‚Äôs a japanese literature class that talked about the concept of ‚Äúurami‚Äù, which roughly translate to rancor but has really interesting cultural implications. We read Japanese short stories, books and watched films about urami and then presented our own pieces in other cultures that resembled urami, which was my favorite part of the course because people presented all sorts of stuff like rap songs and drawings. I honestly enjoyed that class so much, even as a stem major."

I would greatly appreciate any recommendation. Thank you!","You can use BerkeleyTime for AC as Requirements, and sort by Average Grade
Not on your list but GWS100AC with Professor Barnes was one of my favorite classes at Cal.
Why does it need to be upper division?
I really enjoyed soc 111 and 130 with Joanna Reed! I would say 130 was a little more interesting
Cool! Def. been wanting to take that class.
to fulfill the Humanities Upper Division Requirement. Of the 6 humanities requirements, two must be Upper Division. I am set on taking INDONES100A which fulfills one of the Upper Div requirements. I need one more Upper Div"
