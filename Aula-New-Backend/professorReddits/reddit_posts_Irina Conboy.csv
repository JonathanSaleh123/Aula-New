Rate my schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15f2yar/rate_my_schedule/,2023-07-31 22:14:31,"Does this seem doable? For reference, I got a B+ in 61a and took an algebra-based physics class in high school. I've also self-studied the discrete math portion of 70.

Does anyone have experience with stat 33b? Also can someone send me a recent syllabus for BioE 114? The last syllabus on TBP is from a covid semester.

Rather tough but doable. Would recommend taking an easier schedule, probably swap out a technical with a breadth.

Is it doable, yes. 
Is it going to be tough, yes. 
Your going to be in straight grind mode the whole semester."
