Has anyone taken Econ C175 with Joshua Goldstein?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kxlc11/has_anyone_taken_econ_c175_with_joshua_goldstein/,2021-01-14 18:52:14,Seems like an interesting class (economic demography) but his RMP ratings are shitty and I don't need to deal with an awful professor when my other econ elective choices have better professors. Shame as the topic seems interesting :/,"For future students:

I'm taking it with Goldstein right now. He is a good lecturer, very easy to listen to, incorporates the audience, etc. I've asked him questions after class and he is a pretty nice guy. Not sure why he has bad ratings, I very much enjoy this class.
I took it with Ryan Edwards and really liked the course mainly for its material. I feel like it wouldn't be super professor-dependent, but I'm not sure.
Also wondering this. The Berkeleytime distribution isn't stellar as well, but I really want to take the course because it seems interesting!
How was the workload/exams?
Workload was totally fine, there was a weekly lab which I gave myself ~3 hours before the deadline to do, and still got a B+ on most of them lol. If you just start a little earlier and ask gsis stuff, then it’s very doable to get an A.

Exams aren’t too bad. I only went to lecture, didn’t study very much, and got a B+ on most of them.

If you’re unhappy with a B+, consider the fact that you can PNP the class. That’s what I did. I’d much rather take a cool class and PNP it than take a stupid boring class for a grade."
