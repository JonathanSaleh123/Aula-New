"Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center is ""open to any person of African descent"". African American studies professor Nikki Jones said one way to understand campus climate is what Yale professor Elijah Anderson described as ""white space,"" or a public space predominantly occupied by white individuals",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/03/20/black-student-union-ensures-comfort-community-resource-center/,2017-03-21 20:45:35,,"25%= the predominant population? Does this person know that over 40% of the school is Asian?
So, like, is this even legal?  Public funds being used on literally segregated spaces?  Or is it just fine, because white privilege slavery blah blah blah, even though a plurality of us are Asian?
This is fucked up.

25 years ago, when I was at Cal, it still wasn't ""predominantly"" white, at least in my recollection (I didn't actually go check the statistics).  The SF Bay Area has been ethnically diverse a lot longer than much of the rest of the country and it's public university reflects that.  I'm proud of that.  Still,  I'm sympathetic to the need to feel a sense of community for under represented minorities (and wondering the campus these days, I definitely get the impression that black students are under represented).  Cal is not necessarily a ""white space"", but it's overwhelmingly not a black one.  The concept of ""white space"" can be stretched to apply to any situation where people of a particular ethnicity find themselves severely under represented.
I say we have a Sit in!   Judge me not by my color of my skin but of the content of my character.
