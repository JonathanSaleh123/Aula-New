Motivational Commencement Speech,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kddeka/motivational_commencement_speech/,2020-12-14 19:07:09,"I got nothing but love for you fellow golden bears, and I will miss this place deeply. I know it might be hard to feel that way now, but you got this! For those in the dark rather than near the light at the end of the tunnel, I hope you grow to love this wonderful school and feel that love reciprocated before you graduate. You deserve it.

I was just informed that due to COVID-19 my department won't be having a commencement. But this speech went through multiple drafts with professors and I think it expresses a ubiquitous sense of Cal even if it is department specific. I feel really sad that I can't give this speech anymore, so thank you for reading it.

I hope ya'll enjoy!   


>I would like to share a modified piece of an essay I wrote, which asked me to answer “What do I like the most about being a Cal student?” — trust me it was a hard prompt to answer.  
>  
>The intellectual challenge and spiritual growth that has led to me loving myself more is what I appreciate most about being a Cal student. I finished one of my UC application essays, for better or worse, by writing “I deeply desire to transfer into a student body where I am closer to the average and to be surrounded by others who are manifestly even more brilliant. I am someone who, instead of feeling dismay or envy, would relish the opportunity. The University of California is known for its stressful, competitive, rigorous environment; and with a smile, I would love every second of it.” This is still as true today as it was for me three years ago.   
>  
>Berkeley beats the best of its students, grinds down the genius inherent in us all, but its graduates leave polished and refined. Like a blacksmith whose repeated blows form an alloy into something greater than the sum of its parts, Cal does the same semester after semester. In first grade, I could not read. I was illiterate and almost held back, I could not read simple words such as “the” or “group” much less “velocity”. By middle school, I was devouring books like 1984 and Catch-22.  However, I continued to struggle with being a differently abled learner, and considered myself horrible at math. To this point, I never passed pre-calculus.  
>  
>Each of us encountered barriers and obstacles getting in, and even once we were here. It took seven long years of community college before I made it into Cal: failing classes, facing eviction and no home because of raucous housemates, and going hungry or eating only rice and beans for weeks because of insufficient financial aid, were all obstacles I faced. However, I now feel materially and emotionally secure at Cal. Before UC Berkeley, I experienced the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune; the polite but feigned response that I was a physics and political science major—but at a community college. I felt the pangs of self-doubt and remorse as my high school friends got degrees, spouses, and jobs, as I struggled through second semester calculus.   
>  
>Regardless of our background, we have each faced unique struggles and been brought together by the unique opportunity to attend what Hans Bethe described as “The greatest school of theoretical physics America has ever known.” We have tunneled through seemingly impenetrable barriers, and proven our infinite potential.  
>  
>Cal has a beautiful campus, rich cultural history, and a myriad activities for every facet and face present in its student body. However, it is the sheer genius of my cohorts, the impossibly dense and long required readings, the professor designed problem sets with no solutions available online, the introduction to graduate level material by the end of each semester, the long nights in libraries, and the sum integral daily struggle, that makes me most proud to be a Golden Bear.   
>  
>When I was fretting recently, over whether I was on track to secure a successful career, two faculty laughed and told me not to worry, and I want to share their message because it applies to all of us: “You’re graduating from UC Berkeley, you’ve already made it, people will look at that and it will open doors for you all over the world.” So I say to you, graduating class of 2020: no more imposter syndrome! We have each carried out Nobel Prize winning experiments in 111B and conquered the combined works of Dr. David J. Griffiths. To each their own, we’ve found our personal Carnot Efficiency and, in doing so, pushed ourselves to do more work and go farther than we ever thought possible.   
>  
>Wherever life takes us in the coming years, we are each and all already successes. You owe it to yourselves to acknowledge that. So please, be a fully charged capacitor and continue to let the positive current flow. Celebrate today, and give yourselves, and the blue and gold clad bear next to you, a heartfelt hug and pat on the back, because you’ve made it; and forever and always: Go Bears!

p.s. The speech actually starts out with ""I dislike it when people make graduation speeches about themselves, we are here as a group, and a cohort. You could say that at graduation, this hard barrier, our group’s velocity has finally matched our phase velocity, and at this time, it’s appropriate for some total internal reflection. Thus, I would like to share a modified piece of an essay I wrote, which asked me to answer “What do I like the most about being a Cal student?” but I took this out because that joke is so obscure for a non-physics audience I felt it detracted from the overall message. I also took out another physics centric-paragraph in the middle for similar reasons.

TL&DR: ""Berkeley beats the best of its students, grinds down the genius inherent in us all, but its graduates leave polished and refined. Like a blacksmith who’s repeated blows form an alloy into something greater than the sum of its parts, Cal does the same semester after semester. ""","i love u and polisci + physics is so cool
This part had me chuckling:

> the professor designed problem sets with no solutions available online 

Feels like a pretty Cal thing.

Your story's extremely inspiring, OP, and it's revealing of the caliber of students at this school. Proud to call you a Golden Bear, and congrats on graduating!!
Sweet
Beautiful
Thank you. Really needed this right now as I was loosing steam to carry on my studies. I’m a transfer student too. I did four years at a community college as well. Congratulations on graduating!!
Very inspiring!  Thanks for sharing and congrats! 🥳🎉🎂🎈🎁❤️"
