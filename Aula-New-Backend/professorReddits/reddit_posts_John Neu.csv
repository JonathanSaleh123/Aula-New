there are a few on www.xnxx.com 
by far my favorite teacher at Cal
Out of curiosity, what classes did you have with him? I had him for Math 53 and hated the lectures. He seemed like an alright guy, but he was too crazy and didn't really lecture well imo
math 121b

i think he was born to teach that class"
