Engineering students: There's a new Sheriff in town.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3cub61/engineering_students_theres_a_new_sheriff_in_town/,2015-07-10 14:00:05,"Normally when one thinks of pain and suffering, names like Roberto Horrid-witz, Andrew ""No Slackard"" Packard and Panos Pappa-clobber-us come to mind (to be fair: I like Packard). Or if you're a mathy person, Alexander Givental (that name needs no modification to incite anxiety).

However, there is some significantly fierce competition coming out of the EE department. Our subject in question is Behnam Behroozpour. He's a 2nd year PhD candidate and is teaching EE40 this summer (somehow I haven't taken it yet). He's a real classy guy. He's excellent at simultaneously being arrogant and unclear.

Here's a peek at the fun you're missing out on: 

1) Piazza for everything: homework assignments/lecture notes/prelab instructions. There is no bCourses page - it's currently unpublished. He said he'll publish it later.

2) ""Homework should precede the lecture."" He says we'll learn more. So yes, we're completing problems for homework and haven't gone over the theory at all in lecture. The content in the homework usually precedes the lecture by about 1 week. To be fair, I've heard this is a Maharbiz thing so maybe Behnam has been told to do that.

3) He told international students/non-Berkeley students that they should try to team up with Berkeley students so the homework goes faster (and let me tell you, there are *smart* kids in the class who don't go to Berkeley).

4) Actually we don't use Piazza for everything: We use Gradescope to submit the homework and edxEDGE for lab videos and the actual lab assignments are emailed to us a few minutes prior to starting the lab so we can't work on them at home (despite what the syllabus says). There's also the videos that Prof Maharbiz made.

5) The [Midterm 1 review](http://i.imgur.com/8LoffwV.jpg) that was posted on Piazza has a picture of a dragon with his face on it, breathing fire onto students. I'm not sure if he made it, or if a GSI did. He's the type who calls on students, and if they don't know the answer, he'll ask them to repeat the question back to the class to ensure they were listening. Again, *classy* is the word. 

6) The midterm was laughable and shows how out of touch he is with students. He had to give the entire class extra time because 97% of people didn't have a chance. I won't go into the details. I'm at the point where a B-/B+ won't hurt/help me much... but I could sense the stress that some of the lower division students felt who are trying to declare their major, and that's why I posted this. 

He's clearly a smart guy, but a real egomaniac and on track to be disliked by a lot of students. Avoid.

edit: spelling","Adderall, not even once.
is he single?
*4th year Ph.D. candidate 
When a PhD candidate a few years ago, I took analysis under Giventhal, and I am so grateful that he didn't make an effort to dumb shit down. He was definitely a hard ass, and that was easily the toughest course I've ever taken. But it made taking subsequent courses like grad level micro econ so much easier, unlike a number of my peers who sailed through their respective analysis courses with other instructors but had to altogether drop out of micro econ.
>""Homework should precede the lecture."" He says we'll learn more. So yes, we're completing problems for homework and haven't gone over the theory at all in lecture. The content in the homework usually precedes the lecture by about 1 week.    

Can't stand profs that do that. The only class I've ever failed in my life was a java class back in the day that did that. The prof failed anyone that didn't get >75% on at least 80% of the homework.
Wow this is a really in depth post mostly about things that are total nonissues. Is piazza that hard to figure out? Are you triggered by MS paint?
I think you're attributing a lot more to your instructor than is actually the case.

1. EE40 has been run on Piazza and bCourses for a while now. This actually allows the instructors to address students' concerns more effectively since EE40 is a lot more GSI-driven than most other courses. 

2. You're right about Maharbiz doing this and you *will* learn more by spending more time with the material. Unfortunately this can be a frustrating process, but engineering is 75% teaching yourself new stuff, so just become excellent at it. In EE40, if you're not learning mainly from the book, you're missing about 50% of the material. Lecture is just too short to teach you everything you need to learn.

4. Again, this isn't something that's new this summer. It's always been that way. 

5. This is just a joke saying ""welcome Berkeley EE, it's not a walk through cupcake fields."" It's recycled from previous semesters.

6. EE40 exams are ALWAYS a shit-show. It's a Berkeley right of passage. Just look at past semester midterms (some had problems which couldn't be solved unless you made some very strange logical leaps). The class is curved so just do your best and you'll do just fine. 

What? I'm pretty sure EE 40 is always like that, no matter who's teaching. 
Do you even EECS?

I had Horrowitz and Packard for E7, and I thought they were both wonderful.
I can definitely see the merit in teaching difficult material in this manner to people who are proficient in math but I died a little in his lower division math 53 course. I just did not enjoy the inconsistency between what he taught in lecture, the homework which was straight out of the textbook, the quizzes and discussion material which were completely dependent on the GSI, and the exams which he created himself. Looking back I really should have just sought out a different GSI since having a GSI who has a teaching style that differs from how you are comfortable learning is practically death if you aren't fairly good at the math he is teaching.
Agreed. It doesn't make any sense either, the student should at least have some background knowledge from lecture before starting on hw.
Uh... since when can you rotate an image at some arbitrary angle in MS paint? It's clearly photoshop, bruh.
Would agree on Piazza and Gradescope. That is literally how it was run last semester and it really should not be a problem. Piazza is an invaluable resource and it really does not matter whether the material is on Piazza or BCourses aside from personal preference/comfort. Gradescope is widely used in both CS and EE lower division classes; not really sure why that is a problem either. 

Additionally, unless the labs take a lot longer than the time allotted, it shouldn't matter whether they give you the assignment ahead of time or right before lab. That's what lab time is for.

I can't really comment on anything else mentioned. Benham was the head GSI last semester and only guest lectured a couple times (of which I think I only attended once) while Maharbiz was out. But the resources used really should not pose a problem unless they are terribly terribly broken.
This. 

Piazza, Gradescope, and edX (for lab videos) were all used last semester too. They never use bCourses in CS/EE classes...

Also I honestly haven't heard of any of the other professors mentioned besides Givental. I had Hilfinger so eh.
FA14 61B average grade: B+
E7 is a cakewalk.
You thinking this is photoshop shows how out of touch with grad students you are. Anyone who has been to grad school will tell you that grad students live and die by MS PowerPoint 
Well then, are you triggered by Photoshop?
Not true. http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/47255/math-behind-rotation-in-ms-paint
oh god, my school's reputation is falling. I might not ever be able to feel good about my elite education again. you know how undergrad degrees basically trump every other kind of credential? yea, this is a tragedy. 


pls halp hilfinger. 
""The average grade for this distribution is a B+, based on 378 grades submitted. Move your mouse over the bars to view how many of each grade were submitted.""

378 grades is approx 1/4 of CS 61B enrollment.

There are more F's than A+'s in the complete distributions.
Correct it is, but that it irrelevant.  I thought that they were both good professors and taught the content well.
He is gimped by using GIMP."
