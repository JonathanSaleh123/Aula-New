Who is Ivonne del Valle,https://v.redd.it/5ny0x0b5fopb1,2023-09-21 14:26:13,Curious what happened to get a protest like this,"A professor from Spanish and Portuguese who was harassed, whose complaints were ignored, and placed on leave.
Hey, so for anyone curious about this case, here is a plain text version of the entire story pieced together by reporter Katherine Mangan.  I highly recommend people read the entire article. Ivonne del Valle comes off as a pretty horrible actor, in need of serious help:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gqrxt/new\_ivonne\_del\_valle\_article\_behind\_paywall/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gqrxt/new_ivonne_del_valle_article_behind_paywall/?sort=new)

Long story short, multiple investigations have found no merit to professor del Valle's accusations, some of which border on seriously delusional. And contrary to the protestors claims, de Valle is the one who has been found guilty of sexual harassment, not the other professor.

Here are some highlights from the article:

1. ""UC-Berkeley’s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination conducted **three separate Title IX investigations** on the case — in 2019, 2021, and 2022. **All found that \[professor del Valle\] had either harassed \[the other professor\] or violated orders not to contact him.""**
2. ""In November 2019, **Berkeley’s harassment-prevention office concluded that it was “more likely than not” — the preponderance-of-evidence standard used in policy-violation cases — that del Valle had engaged in conduct that amounted to stalking, sexual harassment, and retaliation...** for \[the other professor's\] having reported her to the university.""
3. ""Berkeley opened a second investigation. In a report issued that November, it concluded that del Valle had violated the university’s 2020 no-contact order on four separate occasions: when **she left derogatory messages about Clover near his mother’s house and also at that of a neighbor, sent emails to his peers and colleagues, and created a Twitter account that tried to follow Clover’s students.**""
4. ""In late 2020 and early 2021, Clover’s mother, Carol J. Clover, an emerita professor at Berkeley, reported that **someone had dumped what looked like chunks of rotten pineapple covered with oil at her doorstep and chalked insults about her son on the sidewalk in front of her home.** Her security camera captured fuzzy footage of someone investigators later concluded, **“more likely than not,” was del Valle... Del Valle told The Chronicle that she takes responsibility for those actions and that she was punished for them with a nine-month unpaid suspension.""**
5. ""That spring and summer, del Valle also unleashed a cascade of angry, expletive-laden emails and voice mails at Clover, the investigation said. In one voice mail, the 2019 investigation reported, del Valle said: “You need to still call me and apologize or you’ll see what I’m going to do. I’m not afraid of you. ... I’m not afraid of anything because I am right.” **Del Valle keyed Clover’s car, and sprayed messages in silver paint inside the hall of his apartment building and on his front door calling him a “sex addict” and “sick harasser.”**

I sincerely hope that the University is able to keep her off campus, and that the students and faculty enabling her continuing harassment of this professor take a long look in the mirror.

Why is she on administrative leave? Seems off brand for Berkeley to suspend a professor without legitimate reason
It’s so annoying when they block the gate lmao, I used to truck them if I was running late to something when I went to cal
All the people in the comments complaining about how disruptive they are like they’d have bothered to find out about the issue and do reading without this disruption bringing it to their attention
What's clear are simps and sheltered women are idiots. This woman has admitted to her wrongdoings.  She claimed she was hacked and she wasn't.  I'm guessing she wanted a date and he turned her down.
Good to see the students of berkeley opening a dialogue with the university, educating the student body on what had occurred, working towards a solution, working with staff, supporting the hurt parties in question (either financially or monetarily), and outlining preventative policies for the future.

Instead of standing there like a bump on a log, inconveniencing their peers and yelling at people, they chose real action.
I hate when they block the gates, make me not listen fr
[deleted]
when did it become acceptable to block the gate for any old protest?
The professor that she is afraid to name is a workhorse for the Democratic Party so even if everyone knew him there would not only be no consequences but she would be forced to settle out of court.
Actually she’s completely delusional https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-harassment-case-that-has-berkeley-at-a-boil
Incorrect. A professor suffering from mental delusion, who made false accusations which **are not supported** in any way by reality, was suitably placed on medical leave.
[deleted]
She wasn't harrased. She said her devices where hack and they weren't.  She's a nut. The students are obviously stupid. 

https://www.kqed.org/news/11965822/uc-berkeley-students-threaten-hunger-strike-to-reinstate-professor-suspended-for-stalking
You mean Spain and Portugal. Ironically the 2 of the largest colonizing countries of the westward migration. I wonder what the conversation was between professors that stirred up all the trouble.
Is that why she got arrested for stalking?
she a nutjob and her supports may be bigger nutjobs
Are you able to admit now you were completely wrong? She admitted to keying his car, leaving things outside his door, and reaching out to his mom, partner, and friends.
I feel sorry for her, it genuinely sounds like she is having a psychiatric breakdown, but yeah the things she describes are simply not possible.
*plain* text.
It sounds like she has been rehabilitated, let her go back to work!
They didnt want to take action because the professor that was harassing her has a lot of leverage at Berkeley. He used the leverage that he has in this school to avoid any consequences and made her the bad guy instead. Not very Berkeley of Berkeley to do this
Getting arrested for repeatedly stalking someone seems like a legitimate reason to fire a professor.
well, there probably is a reason then.
Did you not do any research. It's hilarious if this was a man you all would be destroying him. She has admitted to all her bs. She was actually arrested. Spraying apartment halls, keying cars, harassing his mom, send emails and text even though she had a no contact order against her.
>They have offered her a path to return to work. She refuses to accept an 18 month suspension. She will only accept being fired or exonerated.  And by all accounts there is no evidence to support exoneration. She stalked students, and a mother.

""legitimate reason""? dude read the facts she is stalking harassing and making threats against him, his mother, and students. in what world is that okay? the only thing she claims is that he ""hacked her phone"" and was harassing her through social media... which is the most outlandish thing ive ever heard if a humanities professor suddenly developed the technical prowess to hack her phone and laptop and then start targeting his tweets and his follower's tweets against her... textbook paranoid delulu behavior... 

&#x200B;

I feel sorry for her and it seems like she has genuine mental issues.
Like the Stanford band member in the end zone.
Extra funny now that attention has been brought to this and it turns out Ivonne is the bad guy lol
They’ve been contacting the university for years, and I wasn’t there but before they blocked the gate (which wasn’t even for an hour) they actually had speakers and people explaining the situation on the sproul steps. They passed out flyers and had a petition recently signed by latine staff on campus and still aren’t being heard, so they needed to do something that would inconvenience people to get noticed. It’s only an inconvenience to those who were easily able to go around, because they were fs letting disabled people/elderly go(this I was there to witness). If you look at the Instagram by searching the name you’ll notice that steps have been taken and they still haven’t been heard.
> like a bump on a log

more like a burning spilling hemorrhoid on a beautiful face.
couldn't agree more. at least leave the passage ways on the side open. idk why people think inconveniencing other students is the way to go. its like the climate protesters that stand in front of traffic. great cause, but nobody likes those people
I mean, that's how protests work. You inconvenience people to force their attention to your issue. Sather gate is THE protest spot on campus. A huge percentage of the student body walks through there daily.
Old timer here...

Lol
Do you… do you not know how a protest works my dude?
Do you happen to have a link that shows the article if I dont have a chronicle subscription
LMAO sure. She is not mentally okay, therefore she ""was suitably placed on medical leave"": either fully ignorant of the details of the case or intentionally protecting the monster Joshua Clover who has already an extensive history of harassment yet protected by nepotism -- i.e., his social circles equally corrupted as that bastard. Truth will surface sooner or later.
Good scholars usually don’t get arrested for stalking.
You're joking, right?  I laughed myself to tears reading that post.
Duh, she's all about colonialism. If students take Mexican studies or colonialism they're not smart.
She just sees him as a white supervillain, promise.
I feel as sorry for her as i do for anyone stalking and harassing someone (to the point they constantly fear for their personal safety) for 5 years which is not at all. 

It's sad she's got serious mental illness but she's been abusing this man for 5 years with no end in sight.
I caught this after I put it up and thought I corrected it. Thanks for the reminder.
They have offered her a path to return to work. She refuses to accept an 18 month suspension. She will only accept being fired or exonerated.  And by all accounts there is no evidence to support exoneration. She stalked students, and a mother.
It sounds like she f#cked around and found out. She’s probably an incredible professor and researcher, but when you continue to break laws you’re going to pay a price.
If this was a male prof stalking and harassing a female professor, yall would be saying he should go to prison.
Who is this fella and why aren’t we talking about him instead of her
Is there any evidence that she was being harassed? What form did this harassment take? What you're saying doesn't make a lot of sense.
https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/s/5bKR8Mf8iq
Seriously how the fuck is this getting upvoted so much? This makes me wary of humanity. She has literally admitted to keying his car, harassing contacts in his life, harassing him, vandalizing his mother’s property. She had been reported and found guilty by Berkley multiple times over the last 4 years
so ageism and ableism nice . you either go all the way or don't.
Some insane professor who keyed another profs car and got into Twitter arguments with him got put on paid leave, clearly a reason to annoy your fellow students.
This is a bad take and you should feel bad.
berkeley students going to the free speech movement school while complaining about the culture that made it happen:
You're confusing protest and civil disobedience. You can protest by holding a sign on a street corner just fine, you don't need to inconvenience anyone. If you want to engage in civil disobedience for attention, sure, you can do that, but you should expect to be criminally prosecuted for it.

You don't have any right to inconvenience people to get them to pay attention to you. You only have a right to speech. If that speech bores people, come up with better speech.
Or could get the support of the student body by passing out leaflets with info of the issue and action for your cause to the students/people passing through the Gate.

Many are unaware of the reasons of the protest so it seems fruitless. Was the professor fired for calling out harassment? Or retaliating against the harasser? Or harassed for giving her students easy As?
[deleted]
you all were shit heels too? you literally wouldn't let others pass?

do you now own very expensive real estate near campus and block new housing developments?

https://archive.ph/OvTjX
False she admitted to stalking, keying his property, and going to his house. 

https://www.kqed.org/news/11965822/uc-berkeley-students-threaten-hunger-strike-to-reinstate-professor-suspended-for-stalking
He rejected her romantically and she went nuts. Classic tale.
studying any ethnic studies or colonialism is a fast track to being jobless or working as a bartender/waiter
she sounds like a typical racist
>If this was a male prof stalking and harassing a female

This is often a ridiculous premise but swg i think if the genders were reversed there'd be rallies to see her fired rather than reinstated. Heck, she's even being allowed to return but she wants to return with her name cleared!

I'm really bewildered by who could possibly be defending her, their brains are broken.
I went to the info session and they had the professor talking to us through zoom explaining her situation. She never mentioned his name but if im not mistaken she mentioned he was actually a professor at Davis. Im sure she didn’t mention his name for legal reasons
Because he didn’t get arrested? If a male professor had been arrested for STALKING someone of the opposite sex, you’d be screeching about the safety of students right now.
Why is this getting downvoted when it’s 100% accurate?!
Grow up
You’re the one defending a mentally unhinged lunatic who stalks people.
you think free-speech protests in the 60s were convenient for people?
No, I'm not. Civil disobedience has nothing to do with inconveniencing people, it's about purposefully breaking laws.
[deleted]
how often do you grab flyers being distributed on sproul? do you approach those people or alter your path to avoid them? how often does a photo of a flyer ended up on reddit? 

on the other hand, this video of a protest (that i didn’t see in person) ended up on my feed *because* it disrupted campus life, and in turn, i learned about an injustice that occurred. 

protests work and they are worth the inconvenience they cause.
Look I agree that it's exceptionally annoying, but people make your argument every single time a protest happens, and this is how protests have been done for decades. It works. If an issue inconveniences people enough, they'll do something about it.
Aren't I the one who's sposed to be shaking his fist at the clouds and telling ""get off my lawn!""?
del Valle went to his mom’s house. That is abuse of an innocent woman, deemed to be worthy of abuse specifically and only for her gender.  It is no different than attacking a daughter to force a gambler to pay his debts. The mother was simply a gendered object to del Valle.

Del Valle has been offered an 18 month suspension. She deserves worse than that for what she did to this poor woman. But del Valle has refused to accept this extremely generous offer.
She did admit transparently to stalk and attack yet not out of nothingness. What credibility might she have after no history of harassment, whereas that monster, Joshua Clover, does have cases of accused harassment yet protected as if nothing has happened? That so-called professors' supporters might likely say, conveniently, like a pack of wolves dressed in sheep skin, ""there is always a first time"" or ""the best are sometimes the worst."" Unlike his other victims, this one did open her mouth, and in the absence of support from UC Berkeley authorities, Dr. del Valle resorted to her own means of justice.

Unlike the coward Clover, who must be celebrating in secret his self-characterization of playing the victim here, she did admit her unethical approach to handling this situation, but that does not negate the monster Clover's original intellectual taunts via another user's Twitter (his friend who likewise behaves cowardly) from actually generating those reactions from our professor. Truth will surface, Clover: SO, to allude to your intellectual taunts, YOU get ready soon.
He was a professor at UCMerced
[deleted]
Some were, some weren't, I'm sure. What's your point? Reading between the lines here, is it that whatever people did in the 60s was legal protest, so blocking roads is legal protest now? I assure you, plenty of Vietnam war protestors were arrested for doing things they weren't supposed to do. Some of what they did was constitutionally protected protest that consisted of pure speech, some was more than protest and crossed the line to becoming a crime.

Maybe the resistance I'm sensing from you is coming from a conviction that you can't effectively communicate anything just by talking to people. I think you underestimate the power of words used effectively, if that's the case, but in any event, the law doesn't care. It just is what it is. You don't have a right to effectively change people's minds, you have a right to use pure speech.
What did you think obstructing people was? This is disorderly conduct, probably some other things besides, but I would have to go meandering through the statutes to check.
The people who famously went to jail all the time for acts of civil disobedience? That civil rights movement? They knew the score, my friend.

I'm not sure what problem people are having here. The legal right to protest extends to speech. ""You inconvenience people to force their attention to your issue."" Isn't generally speech; it's going to involve breaking the law in some way. That's civil disobedience. You can do it if you believe it's worth it, but part of civil disobedience is accepting the consequences of breaking laws.

It feels like maybe the downvoters think they should be able to break laws without any consequences in order to force people to pay attention to whatever their issue of choice is. That's just not how it works. Society wouldn't function if everyone had the legal right to disrupt it as much as they wanted for whatever reason they wanted.

Thinking that *you* get to disrupt everyone else's lives because of *your* issue is short-sighted and selfish. Whatever cause you believe in, regardless of its merits, doesn't give you a golden ticket to be immune to the rules that govern everybody. Accepting that you need to follow the same rules as everybody else is part of growing up and maturing into an adult.
Of course protest is what we endure for the price of freedom.

Why shouldn’t I grab a flyer if someone is sincerely seeking support of a cause? What’s the problem with that? And it’s my judgment to whether to agree to it.

Seems the tactic isn’t to seek support of the student body but to get the attention of the administration.

A protest by seeking support or inconvenience is still going to get to your feed either way.
What makes you think ann injustice occurred just because you read a biased article? The professor is unhinged and was arrested for stalking someone and keying their car and even showing up at their mother’s house.
Yeah I feel like people will default to ignoring or not caring. We get in this haze of just going through life not paying attention. So to be forced to interface with stuff is sometimes the easiest way to become more aware
[deleted]
not on my front lawn. yes.
Yeah, she should be terminated.
Could you post three tweets of Clover’s that you feel justify keying his car and stalking him?
So do you have any details or--dare I ask--evidence of any of CLover's alleged ""history of harassment?""
What did Clover do to del Valle? I read the reports it didn't mention anything.
Guys I found Ivonne's sockpuppet account.
I agree, I’ve been researching Clover and he’s a POS. And the people who are believing right off the bat that Ivonne is crazy in this whole scenario, really are too swayed by mainstream media that only focuses on drama. Jesus, it’s not hard to believe that there is corruption everywhere and it’s very plausible that this privileged white man is being protected. He’s said some nasty shit and I wholeheartedly believe he’s definitely done things that she’s said he’s done.
Ohhh, that makes more sense
You’re so brave
my point is that blocking access on sather gate, in the eyes of most people, isn’t civil disobedience… they’re not sitting in the halls of administration or preventing classes - their impact is you read the sign and walk around. its a totally different flavor of protests compared to say those “just stop oil” protests in traffic arteries.. and they are most certainly entitled to protest within the campus of the school, it is a public campus of course
You’re attacking someone’s communication ability?! You’re gonna be a shit lawyer, isn’t that called an ad hominem logical fallacy? You should know better.
I'm not sure why you're arguing with me about this. This is how protesting has been done since basically the inception of protesting. Clearly it works.
[deleted]
Your evidence for him being a POS stalker is that you “wholeheartedly believe” he is? 

Do you have any real evidence? What have you dug up in your research?
He is a POS, but not for the reasons you would support.  Meanwhile, this woman is clearly a lunatic, evidence of which is available from her own admissions.
Exactly!
If they aren't really stopping anyone from doing anything, that's more of a protest than civil disobedience. But then they're not really inconveniencing anyone, either.
No, that's not what happened there at all. Try a re-read.
Sheesh.  They don't even work at the same university.  del Valle is at UC Berkeley.  Clover is 65 miles away at UC Davis.  She actually had to drive long distances to stalk and harass him vandalize his apartment and key his car.  That is seriously obsessive.
This is true, although there is a delicious bit of irony in this case.  Clover is a hard-core, foaming at the mouth full-on dedicated marxist agitator.  He embraces completely all aspects of grievance culture absurdity, all BLM lunacy, believes that Mao was right to murder millions, believes it should be lawful for minorities to outright kill any policeman on sight, and so on.  He has never met any form of extremist leftist propaganda he did not propound, nor has he.ever hesitated to call for the murder of people in the name of marxist ""revolution"".  He is also, of course, a committed supporter of hamas and anything they do.  He should garner no sympathy because he advocates for arbitrary and violent ends for anyone who dares question the propaganda nonsense he vomits forth.
Okay will do!"
KQED article on Professor Ivonne del Valle protesters,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17io6sh/kqed_article_on_professor_ivonne_del_valle/,2023-10-28 14:57:07,[https://www.kqed.org/news/11965822/uc-berkeley-students-threaten-hunger-strike-to-reinstate-professor-suspended-for-stalking](https://www.kqed.org/news/11965822/uc-berkeley-students-threaten-hunger-strike-to-reinstate-professor-suspended-for-stalking),"Just taking into account things she has directly admitted to, it is absolutely textbook harassment and stalking from OPHD's perspective.  Ignoring a no-contact directive is also a big deal. It's also ridiculous how the protestors' statements are just repackaged standard rapist/harasser apologist language and I doubt they even realize it.

""But she says organizers still stand by del Valle, and that it’s not her place to judge a woman’s actions when in turmoil and isolated.""  = ""they were going through a lot personally at the time of the assault/harassment, they weren't thinking straight and didn't mean it""

""because they paint Professor Ivonne in a way that personally I’ve never seen"" = ""But he seems like such a nice guy, he couldn't have assaulted or harassed anyone""

These assault/harassment excuses show up literally all the time, they're bullshit then and they're bullshit here.
A hunger strike? lmao
is this a cult?
Just fire her already.
This is hard to read. Supporting someone who has potentially delusional thinking doesn't mean validating said thoughts and actions that spur from that.
How does anyone support someone with a history like that? Maybe she had a mental breakdown
See kids, adults can be cringe too!
del Valle acknowledged some of the behavior described in the investigative reports, including keying Clover’s car, vandalizing the area outside his apartment door, contacting his friends, posting an image of his partner online and leaving messages outside the home of his mother.

She is horrible
It definitely seems she is dealing with mental issues.  There is obsessive behavior that does not seem rational…but probably very real to her
This deeply mentally unhealthy woman needs to get a life and stop trying to play professor politics because she couldn't get any dick.
This woman is mentally ill and needs professional help before she seriously hurts herself or someone else. Absolutely insane that 1) these students are supporting her, and 2) Berkeley won't do the right thing and fire her. 

*The earliest investigated complaint goes back to May 2018, when del Valle, who met Clover after he gave a talk at UC Berkeley, began sending him Twitter messages saying someone was bothering her and calling her names, according to the investigative report.*  
  
*In December that same year, del Valle acknowledged in the investigation knocking on Clover’s apartment door and telling him she “was not leaving until he opened the door and explained what he was doing by hacking her.”*  
  
*While sitting outside Clover’s apartment, according to the report, del Valle slid a note under his door that said, “If you make me leave, it’ll be worse” and then later left him a voicemail, saying, “I can do whatever the fuck I want piece of shit” and “You need to still call me and apologize or you’ll see what I’m going to do.”*  
  
*Soon after that, del Valle vandalized Clover’s car and residence, investigators found. Del Valle also acknowledges those actions in the report.*  
  
*Clover told investigators he moved out of his apartment building in large part because of a “persistent sense of and considerable lack of safety.”*  
  
*He said in the report that the whole experience has been psychologically destructive. He described a hyper vigilance that is “accompanied by an anxiety that is similarly corrosive. It’s miserable and I don’t think it will ever go away.”*  
  
*In a settlement agreement in 2020, del Valle agreed not to contact Clover or any of his friends, family, relatives or students. But the following year, del Valle violated that agreement, according to the second investigation conducted by UC Berkeley in 2021, when she left messages outside and near the home of Clover’s mother, among other violations.*
Oh, but she's a first generation Mexican!  Can't discipline her lunacy!

LMAO.
Holy shit. The sexism and racism is these comments is incredible. Firstly, as with all Title IX cases, everything inside the hearing is confidential. Secondly, be aware, that due to overwhelming bias in research on men’s experience of psychosis, it’s only just come to light recently that women are twice as likely as men to experience late onset psychosis (40-60) and there are very few resources for support. Nobody talks about it. Do we just think women - who are capable enough to be professors - are just that close to unstable that it takes years and a Title IX case for them to be placed on leave and for the university to (not really) help? No wonder only a third of professors on this campus are women. Screw that.
I'm not saying that what she did was right or justified, but you guys calling her deeply mentally unwell and delusional are just going to ignore the fact that her phone was, in fact, found to be compromised?
Lol go on hunger strike and see who cares then
Just found out about this. I think she's not well mentally despite being a good professor, so I feel for the students. I do remember one of the students protesting from my time in Berkeley in 2014, he was a protestor then too, so I know they group is like an extremist sect.
It’s incredibly telling how captive Cal is to its students (customers). They are afraid to fire this woman because of the PR optics, which is about as spineless as you can get.

I could see why some overpriced liberal arts school in the middle of nowhere would be afraid, but Cal could sever its ties with these types of dogmatic clowns and still have brilliant applicants beating down the door. In fact, the people making these big stinks are often the least talented students on campus.

Just rip the bandaid off already, and stop tolerating this bullshit for fear of some Twitter mob or a handful of deranged protesters. You’re UC Berkeley, have some fucking self respect.
Yes
Not exactly an easy feat with her being tenured.
it does though. she shouldn’t be reinstated if she’s delusional enough to harass students.
She’s brown and she teaches about colonialism. That’s all it takes. Those two things make her an infallible god in the eyes of a self-hating white kid at Berkeley
She sounds like my schizophrenic ex. Definitely.
Is the angle here that she should be reinstated because she was experiencing psychosis? And that we don’t know how that psychosis affected her because she’s a middle-aged woman and we don’t understand how they experience psychosis? Otherwise I have literally no idea what argument you’re making. I want to understand. Can you help me understand?
Are you really trying to convince us that medical research is showing us, for the first time, women can experience psychosis? Women have been locked away in asylums for centuries, and called psychotic and hysterical, for merely not behaving or having physical health problems. The vast majority of ALL medical research is conducted on males, and medical students are only taught the symptoms that present in males. Doctors routinely fail to recognize heart attacks in women, and recommend reducing stress. They used to think only men got MS…until the MRI showed lesions on the brain, and all of those women they diagnosed as “hysterical” had MS. In fact, women outnumber men with this condition 4:1.
>KQED could not substantiate del Valle’s allegations that her devices had been hacked by Clover or anyone else. She provided documentation of an analysis of her laptop and cell phone, which found the phone had been compromised, but the computer showed no evidence of hacking or cyber attack. The analysis falls short of proving that any particular person, including Clover, illegally accessed her devices.

Someone who knows more than me please explain, but does compromised mean that someone did hack, or could it be malware accidentally downloaded? Legit not sure.
Did you read the more in-depth article on this?

https://archive.ph/wE1y3

It goes into much more detail on the sequence of events and makes it pretty hard to conclude anything other than this woman clearly experiencing some chronic paranoid delusions.  

Her hacking claims *were* investigated by UC cyber security, which found nothing.  She replaced her phone and laptop, and her home internet multiple times, changed all her passwords, etc, and remained convinced, even after doing so, that this UC Davis prof was still engaged in a conspired, multi-year covert operation, requiring sophisticated hacking of her devices and involving a coordinated participation of at least one other person, in order to harass/gaslight her (to what end?  Who can say)

Note:  This article doesn't mention her phone having been confirmed compromised.  The only thing I can find on that is from the KQED article, which doesn't go into any detail or elaborate on what exactly the compromise was or what exactly was found.

In any case, there is zero evidence anywhere linking Clover to any hacks of any kind of her devices, nor any evidence even remotely indicating that he was intentionally harassing/stalking her.  

It doesn't take a PhD in psychology to conclude that this woman is clearly paranoid and mentally unwell.  If it turns out that she was right all along, this would be be Hollywood movie material.
Those chonks could definitely stand to miss a meal or three.
Amen to that. Well said. UCB is embarrassing itself by being manipulated by this self-indulgent woman. Get it in front of the Regents and let them fire her. Four years of wasted administrative resources…
She's tenured. You can't just ""rip the band-aid off."" If you read the article they mentioned that the school might go that route but it is a very lengthy process to fire a tenured professor as it has to go from committee, to the school's chancellor, and finally the UC Board of Regents before they can fire her. So it has nothing to do with ""fear"" but the instead the safeguards against firing a tenured professor.
I didn't say otherwise? People saying they're protesting on her behalf should realize that validating some potential delusions isn't helpful for her well-being.
Yeah this is so true every time I see a brown person at Berkeley there’s at least twenty white kids bowing to them
No, I think she should remain on leave. My angle is that she should have been placed on medical leave earlier and she is clearly experiencing a major health episode. The comments are pretty foul - “she couldn’t get dick” - and disrespectful to both the professors involved in what seems like a frightening episode of stalking and harassment. 

But as a professor, I’m not sure what she could have done once she was that unwell. The University needs better procedures for getting medical leave - the burden of which is entirely on faculty members, and has a massive impact on your reputation - especially discrimination against middle aged women. How did it ever get this far? Do they just think that their female professors are just normally extremely paranoid and behave like this in professional settings? It’s little known that women are more likely to develop late onset psychosis (and men, more likely during their early twenties) and so we tend to approach this as “bitches be crazy”, as opposed to “bitches need early intervention and mental health support”: suicide peaks in women between 45 and 65 - https://womensmentalhealth.org/posts/suicidality-midlife/
No. What I’m trying to tell you is that there is virtually no discussion about women experiencing mental health crisis in middle age - often for the first time due to fluctuating hormonal levels. There is a lot of discussion at the student level about mental health and young people - as there should be - but the university does little to support the onset of serious mid-life mental illness, least of all acknowledging gender difference in the aging process. This isn’t controversial. If anything, you’re making my point for me - it’s much easier to accept that women are hysterical than it is for them to have a serious illness which needs intervention.
The analysis shows that it bears further investigation, because there are credible signs that a crime may have taken place.  That's why it's contrasted against the computer NOT showing evidence of being hacked or cyber attacked.  This is both spelled out in explicitly in the clause where it's stated where the phone has been compromised, and inferred from the latter two contextual clauses.  

Let's say a woman calls the police after coming home from weekend work trip saying that she is the victim of someone breaking into her home.  Police arrive and find her standing in front of her house and say, well, how do you know that a crime has taken place?  And she says, because I didn't leave that window open when I left and it wasn't open when Amazon delivered a package and took a picture of the delivered package this morning with the window in frame.  I'm pretty sure it's my stalker.

And the police/reporter who tagged along says, well, you don't know if anyone has actually been in your house, much less your stalker. 

If someone had taken her seriously and looked into the matter, for a law enforcement agency, determining IF a hack or cyber attack has taken place is relatively trivial, proximate to time.  Determining who is another matter entirely.
You can absolutely fire tenured professors for harassment and other legal offenses and even ethical offenses.  You can’t fire them for political or subject matter choices deemed cultural “offenses”. Tenure is a mechanism for academic freedom, not a wholesale immunity from consequences.
I think there’s an additional step, too! I’m pretty side the person has to be voted out by the Academic Senate.
Reddit amazes me. All you did was explain the process and how it's a little more complicated than getting rid of her.... And you got downvotes... What the hell 🤣 take it!! Take the one ""I'm sad for humanity"" upvote I can give ya
To be fair I couldn’t tell which side your first comment was taking lol

Im brown but I haven’t gotten anyone bowing to me 😭

Wish I did though :(
Got it thanks for clarifying.
I’m less sympathetic to this comparison when del Valle has admitted to engaging in harassment at a person’s home and their mother’s
Here is the basis for thinking she was hacked by Clover:

*Del Valle says after sending messages to friends on her phone or computer, tweets from the professor on similar topics would appear. She cites writing a message to a relative mentioning trucks, and then a Twitter account she claimed belonged to Clover tweeted about “similar trucks” that same day.*
I'm not saying you can't fire her(please do), just that because she is tenured firing her, even for something like harassment, takes a lot longer than normal because there are protections to make sure it isn't for cultural ""offenses."" That is, they have to go up the ladder slowly proving again and again that the school wants to fire her for harassment and no other reason.
That's ok!
You might be being too nice. Tell the white kids that you hate them and that they’re evil recipients of the spoils of slavery and I guarantee they will start kissing your ass.
you may not be the right kind of brown (read: not black or hispanic), so sorry :(
Need more woke
Rules are different for engineering and business colleges (and anyone in them is an oppressor).
On a gut level, a part of me agrees with you but your sentiment on this matter effectively demonstrates in one sentence the insidious nature of the alleged actions - it elicits several automatic responses that shits down any objective processes even before they begin.  

If you examin your own position, you would see that it is illogical.  Hypothetically, if the hacking and stalking were to have taken place, then her subsequent actions have no bearing on whether or not his actions were criminal.  Indeed, since these type of things are designed to provide a seemingly irrational or unprovoked response in some form of public demonstration, it seems all the more sinister, because the victim is just unwittingly following the script the writer wrote. 

Think about all you could do to manipulate a person's life, emotions, relationships and state of mind by just being able to in turn the mic on on their smartphone at your whim without your knowledge, or read their screen.  You can buy those prepackaged stalkerware apps on the dark web for as little as fifty bucks.  Takes fifteen seconds to inject it into someone's smartphone via USB if you know what you're doing.  Don't believe me?  Go look for yourself and see how easy it is.  It's so easy,  an eight year old could do it.  In fact, there are videos of eight year olds planting tracking software on their parents', phones.  

And once you have smartphone audiovisual access, what else in your life don't you have access to?
Are you suggesting that this is all a conspiratorial set up?
I don't think so.  

There must have been forensic evidence of a substantial security exposure on one device (the phone) and not the other (the computer) for the article and/or relevant investigating authority to have drawn a distinction between the two.  It wouldn't make any sense to draw the conclusion based on strength of circumstantial evidence alone to say one of two devices was hacked and the other was not.  Presumably, one device compromise usually but not always opens the door for the other.

Stalkerware for screen, mic, and keylogging for phones can range from incredibly simple and effective to enormously sophisticated and complex in design and education; as cheap as a couple of drinks at your bar and trivially easy to install if you have physical access to the phone.  Some exploits require less than 30 seconds of connection via USB to deliver payload that then later becomes almost impossible for kill, some surviving even full OS version upgrades and factory resets.
They proved it 3 times already, I just don’t understand why they haven’t started the process yet
Damn, I’m Asian 😭
Im the right kind of brown and no one even talks to me…
My only social interaction at Cal have been my professors and GSIs
In the court system, there have (I agree, some very questionable) been situations where both sides of a bad situation/conflict have been charged/been found at fault. I disagree that just because she has been harmed, does not mean that she could be accountable for other behaviors.
I'm suggesting that if this is the basis of her reasoning she was hacked Clover, she is delusional.
I'm not saying she didn't have malware on her device, I'm saying this is the basis for her thinking the malware was installed by Clover.
You are,  by definition, white or white-adjacent, therefore qualifying as one of the oppressors."
New Ivonne del Valle article behind paywall,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17gqrxt,2023-10-26 00:13:18,"This article was posted today to the chronicle of higher education but it’s behind a paywall:

Does anyone have a recommendation for a way to get access, or does anyone with access wanna post more of it? From these screenshots I found, the situation seems much more complex than I originally thought","By  Katherine Mangan

October 25, 2023

Ivonne del Valle said she was considering Joshua Clover as a participant in a forthcoming conference when she sat in on his panel presentation at the University of California at Berkeley in the spring of 2018.Clover, a professor of English and comparative literature at UC’s Davis campus, studied class struggles and had written a book about riots and worker revolts. Del Valle’s colleague thought he’d be a good fit for an event they were planning on the student and worker uprisings of 1968 in Mexico and elsewhere around the world.After the presentation, del Valle, a tenured associate professor of colonial studies in Berkeley’s department of Spanish and Portuguese, approached him and suggested they get together to talk about the conference. Clover agreed, and two weeks later, they met at the Prizefighter Bar at the northwest tip of Oakland. She had beer; he had wine.

Clover would later tell investigators he felt “uncomfortable with the interaction” with del Valle and ended the conversation early. She began talking as though the meeting were a date, he said, and became “visibly flustered” when he mentioned his partner. Del Valle remembered it differently. She considered it a social meeting with a colleague, she said, and she’d suggested wrapping it up because Clover had said he had a reading group to join afterward.From there, things went rapidly downhill.Del Valle, who had been following Clover for a few months on Twitter before they met, thought afterward that he was obliquely insulting a few of her colleagues on the platform without naming them. He was becoming irritated with what he described as “confusing” messages she was sending him privately about how someone was bothering her.

The dispute, which has jolted the lives and careers of two scholars highly respected in their fields, began where so many of higher-education’s fiercest fights have been waged, on the platform formerly known as Twitter. There, del Valle became convinced that tweets from Clover’s account, and another one she felt was associated with the professor, were delivering a series of coded — and deeply personal — taunts. By the time the dispute spiraled off the computer screen, del Valle was delivering messages instead in silver spray paint and mashed pineapple.The events that followed raise difficult questions. Among them: At a time when much of academic culture is lived on social media, where identities can be masked and threats veiled, how does a university respond to a professor’s seemingly far-fetched allegations about what happens there?The Chronicle has pieced together the following account based on extensive interviews with del Valle, hundreds of pages of documents, including letters, correspondences, and screenshots she shared, along with reports Clover provided from three Title IX investigations. Del Valle’s supporters have also offered testimonies from 48 current and former students, many of whom spoke with The Chronicle, about the professor’s contributions as a mentor and scholar. Efforts to reach Clover’s supporters were less successful, since he hasn’t been speaking publicly about the dispute. The Chronicle reached out to several of his colleagues in the English department at Davis, as well as to a few supporters who weighed in on social media. The only one who responded referred the email to the university’s public-relations office.

When del Valle first approached The Chronicle in late August to urge a reporter to look into her case, she declined to identify the person she accused of hacking her phone and laptop and electronically stalking her. She identified him only as a professor at another University of California campus. The Chronicle later identified him as Joshua Clover.A tenured professor with appointments in English and comparative literature, Clover is well known in literary circles as a poet, columnist, and political theorist who directs the university’s Marxist Institute for Research. Del Valle is also well known in her field, as an expert in colonial Latin American studies and as a mentor to students who, like herself, are immigrants and the first in their families to attend college.
Just for future reference, there’s some site called 12 foot ladder that lets you bypass paywalls for most newspapers I think
Wow - so she had one normal in-person interaction with this guy, then decided he was stalking her based on seeing tweets that were vaguely about the same topics as things she encountered in life, and harassed him physically and online for years in response?

Curious to hear from anyone who’s been part of the “Justice for Ivonne” protests - is there more to the story than this, or was this information just not available? It seems pretty open and shut that the university’s treated her more than fairly, unless there’s some real evidence this article neglects showing that she really was hacked or harassed.

If not, it’s crazy to learn that the multiple “Justice” protests I’ve seen/heard have all been in SUPPORT of the unstable sexual harasser in this situation.
This woman sounds like a lunatic honestly.
Sounds like psychosis.

But hey, [gotta protest something](https://youtu.be/4IUxK_0WLbg?si=fYoPVJGPefSCixMB) amirite?

All I had to do was make a free account to see it
Apparently a group in support of Professor Del Valle is staging another protest on the UC Berkeley campus tomorrow (Saturday, 10/28/23), meeting in the morning at the Campanile (aka Sather Tower). The group states it intends to shut down the 1:00 p.m. football game tomorrow between the California Golden Bears and USC Trojans, unless Del Valle has been reinstated by the university. I saw a flyer posted on campus, advertising this protest.

Yes, it is a complex situation.  This led me to Google the complainant, Joshua Clover.   Apparently he has created a lot of controversy all by himself!
**Part 2:**

UC-Berkeley’s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination conducted three separate Title IX investigations on the case — in 2019, 2021, and 2022. All found that she had either harassed Clover or violated orders not to contact him. Del Valle is on paid administrative leave, banned from teaching, advising, and entering nonpublic parts of the campus. Clover told The Chronicle that Berkeley’s interim Title IX officer has said Clover is not prohibited from sharing the reports from those investigations. He confirmed that he was the complainant but declined to comment further for this article.

In an email to a handful of del Valle’s supporters, he wrote that the charges included “multiple instances of stalking, sexual harassment, retaliation, and violation of no-contact directives directed against me, my family, and my students; many many charges across many many years.”Del Valle said that, to the contrary, she’s the victim of sexual harassment by Clover. None of the investigations found evidence that Clover had stalked or harassed del Valle. She contends that’s because the university never gave her complaints the attention they did Clover’s, or fulfilled her request to perform a forensic evaluation of her phone and laptop to see if they’d been hacked.

That her university is punishing her as a harasser is “an ironic reversal of the reasons for which Title IX regulations were created,” she wrote in notes she prepared to explain her side of what would become a tangled, yearslong dispute. “Not a single thing I have done or supposedly done is romantic or sexual in nature. The opposite is true. They have all been defense against humiliating abuse and sexual harassment.”

Janet Gilmore, a campus spokeswoman, said privacy policies prevent her from discussing the specific complaints. As a campus, she added, Berkeley is “committed to ensuring that individuals are treated fairly.”But both Clover and del Valle have accused UC-Berkeley of mishandling the investigations by not responding promptly and consequentially to their complaints.

In the weeks and months after Clover told del Valle to stop contacting him, she said, she became unsettled by what she felt were similarities between what she was communicating on her cellphone and laptop and tweets she attributed to Clover. She would message a friend, she said, and within hours, a post would pop up on Clover’s Twitter feed — or another she was convinced he had access to — that seemed to be indirectly referencing it. She wrote about planning to see a friend named Isis and he posted about a restaurant with the same name, she said. She was searching on the web for a good place for French lessons, and he tweeted “Moving on to daily vous, daily ils elles”. She had a cellphone conversation with her son about Kendrick Lamar’s song “Humble” and over the next two days, the word “humble” appeared on the two Twitter feeds where she accused Clover of stalking her.Where many would see coincidences, del Valle saw a pattern of harassment.

By August 2018, she wrote in an email to The Chronicle — after wondering “if what she “was seeing was even possible” or whether she “was going crazy” — she concluded that Clover had hacked her phone and was electronically stalking her. “It was not until I kept seeing references not only to what I was doing on my phone (WhatsApp messages, texts, photographs I took, etc.) but also to activity on my computer (web searches, Word documents, etc.) that I realized the extent of the surveillance to which I was being subjected,” del Valle wrote in the summary notes she shared with The Chronicle.

One day she took her phone to the shower to play music. A few hours later, she said, a Twitter account with the handle u/toomuchistrue posted, “Are those your two? They’re huge!”

Clover told investigators he had nothing to do with that Twitter account. Its owner is not Clover, but David C. Porter, a writer living in upstate New York. Porter denied that his frequent daily posts (30,700 since 2018, according to his page on the platform now known as X) had anything to do with del Valle, whom he has never met. He also denied posting any references to large breasts. He wrote in an email that he first became aware of del Valle five years ago “when she started replying to random posts of mine with bizarre, cryptic invectives. ... Eventually it became clear to me that she thought my account was just a sockpuppet being run by Prof. Clover, to send seemingly-innocuous coded messages taunting and mocking her.

”Porter wrote that he had nothing to do with Clover either, aside from following him on Twitter in 2018 while a graduate student in cinema studies at New York University. Clover, he said, “was (is) a communist academic, and those are my sort of people.” The only interaction they had, Porter said, was when Clover contacted Porter to apologize “for any stress or anxiety her stalking and harassment might have caused me, and to let me know he was taking steps to counteract it.”

Del Valle said that in the summer of 2018, she messaged the u/toomuchistrue account and asked who managed it, and received a reply that said it was Clover. She said Clover, in a private message, confirmed that. Asked whether Clover ever had access to his Twitter account, Porter wrote: “No one but me has ever posted on it. I’m not in the habit of sharing my passwords with others.”In her many interactions with campus authorities and the police, she’s been trying to convince them otherwise, that Clover’s personal Twitter account and the u/toomuchistrue account were simultaneously posting comments that indirectly referred to things she was writing and talking about. When she saw the tweet she described after her shower, she became convinced that Clover had access to her phone’s camera. (The tweet, she said, has since been removed, and she didn’t take screenshots of most of the posts she found disturbing because “I didn’t know the extent of the nightmare this would become.”)In October 2018, del Valle had her then-husband accompany her to the local police department in Albany, Calif., where she filed a report. She said officers told her cyberstalking cases were tough to investigate and they couldn’t take it on.She would return to the police department at least a half-dozen times after that, pleading with officers to open a case. She told them that Clover had been taunting and mocking her on Twitter, referring to things she was doing that he could only know if he had hacked her devices.The police officers, she said, treated her as “delusional.”
She’s a LUNATIC.

Imagine if she was a male professor and had been arrested for stalking a woman, keying their car and showing up at their mother’s house. The student body would be screeching about what a danger it was to the student body to have such a maniac on campus. 

It’s a *brown woman* who teaches about *colonialism*, though, so it just HAS to be a much larger conspiracy, and all the protest-addicted white nerds at Berkeley have a new holy war.
Happy Cake day!

People protest to protest.

For sexual harassment, against sexual harassment. Why wait for the facts when they don’t matter to you?
So naturally, the Berkeley students had to try to shut down the game today in support of her. 

I swear, it’s like they’re mentally unable to pick a worthy martyr.
Do they have a website or something? I'd be really interested to see if any of them have seen this article, and if so, what they are telling themselves to keep this going.
https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?&url=https://www.chronicle.com/issue/
What specifically do you think makes this situation ""complex""? If Katherine Mangan's article covered everything accurately, the case seems pretty straightforward. Professor del Valle acted horribly towards this other professor, and may lose her job as a result. What are the rest of us missing?
Not really complex, she’s attributing her delusional thinking to someone who has nothing to do with it deriving a paranoiac conspiracy about the relation of his tweets and her messages by him actively electronically stalking her. Which she has no evidence of. Maybe they come across the same topics despite never interacting because they are Berkeley social science academics with similar interests in social Justice and art, but idk the situation is just complex 🤷‍♂️🫢
It doesn’t seem complex at all. You just don’t like the guy who was getting harassed.
**Part 3:**

A spokesman for the police department did not return requests for comment. But the university’s 2022 investigation report quoted an Albany police officer as saying that del Valle had made “outlandish accusations against this UC professor,” including allegations about being hacked: “As I recall, she was saying he was harassing her because she’ll think something, and then he’ll tweet something.”Del Valle vehemently denied saying that, and she wrote a letter to the police chief calling the officer’s treatment of her “rude, discriminating, and misogynistic.”

At one point, she said, she told the police: “If you don’t do anything, I’m going to have to do it myself. This situation is unsustainable.”

In November, del Valle tweeted to Clover’s partner that he had hacked her electronics and was stalking her.

She said that after she had repeatedly complained to Berkeley’s technology office, staff members switched out her laptop in November 2018. Since her hacking suspicions were first aroused that year, she switched her cellphone and laptop once and her home internet systems three times, a 2019 investigative report said. She also changed her passwords. Still, she said, the Twitter activity she found suspicious continued. She said that she tried to find someone to do a forensic analysis of her devices but that it would have cost $15,000 to $20,000.

In December 2018, according to the investigation and del Valle’s own account to The Chronicle, she entered Clover’s locked apartment building when someone opened the door for her, and she knocked at his door. When he told her through the closed door to leave, she responded that she was going to stay until he explained why he had hacked her. She sat outside his door for at least an hour, reading a book and sliding four hand-written notes under his door. One said: “If you make me leave, it’ll be worse. I’ll keep doing this you can be sure of that.”

Clover, who had a friend escort him past del Valle and out of the building, complained to Berkeley’s harassment-prevention office, which ordered her not to have any contact with him.“I did things I’m not proud of,” del Valle told The Chronicle. “I’d been asking for help in so many places and no one was paying attention or listening to me. And I’m the one who was turned into the pariah.”By the time she visited UC-Berkeley’s cybersecurity office in March 2019, “I felt completely violated, stripped of all privacy, and increasingly depressed,” del Valle wrote in her summary account. The person she spoke to there, she said, told her that it was possible, but hard, for someone to essentially create “a sort of replica of her computer.” She said he told her it was also a federal crime.

In the 2019 investigative report, a representative from Berkeley’s cybersecurity office said that when del Valle stopped by in March of that year, it was “beyond unclear she’d been hacked by anyone.” He said he advised del Valle to “disconnect from social media for one month” and “seek help.”

Del Valle said she did disconnect several times, but whenever she returned, she was still seeing references to herself. “I can only behave as if the elephant in the room is not there for so long,” she wrote in an email.

Gilmore, the Berkeley spokeswoman, wrote that the university takes hacking concerns seriously, requires all employees to complete cybersecurity training where “they are instructed to alert their manager or campus IT staff if they believe their campus computer has been compromised,” and will fix or replace a computer determined to have been compromised.

Even with the new laptop, del Valle said, she continued to see tweets she attributed to Clover that mirrored what she was writing and talking to friends about. In 2019, she reached out to UC-Davis’s harassment-prevention office, but she was told several months later that there wasn’t enough evidence for a formal investigation of her hacking allegations.

A spokesman for the Davis campus, Bill Kisliuk, said that while privacy restrictions prevent him from discussing the specific complaints, the university deals promptly with reports of inappropriate behavior. “When the allegations reported warrant doing so, the appropriate departments perform comprehensive reviews, gathering statements from parties and witnesses and considering any other evidence brought to their attention,” he added. When university policies are violated, “corrective action” is taken.

The Chronicle reached out to a cybersecurity company, BlueVoyant, to ask whether the scenarios del Valle was describing were possible. Certain types of malicious software or spyware, called keyloggers, can record every keystroke made by the user and send the information back to the individual or group operating it, Austin Berglas, global head of professional services, wrote in an email. Remote-access trojans can take over certain device functions, such as cameras. But Mr. Berglas said it was “not very likely” that someone who’d changed devices would continue to be infected “unless the victim has done everything from one account (such as gmail) and stores everything in the cloud and never changed passwords.”
She's clearly a hero, bro! Brown woman can't be crazy, not possible (sarcasm) The guy who didn't do anything wrong is also a turd but clearly this broad is yapping
Thanks!
I was at the game. At first, I thought they were protesting over the Israel/Palestine conflict, but then I saw the word ""Ivonne"" on one of their shirts and I was like holy shit, you've *got* to be kidding me.
They do have a website! It's linked on their Instagram page, @  justice4ivonne
Sorry, I reread the article this afternoon and you are right, Professor Ivonne del Valle acted horribly towards Professor Joshua Clover.  At least they don't work in the same department or the same UC campus (he is at UC Davis).  We've had similar things happen here at Chico State, and they never seem to be handled correctly.
**Part 4:**

The more del Valle felt her complaints were being ignored, the more she made her presence known. In June 2019, investigators said, she acknowledged creating Twitter accounts to “denounce” Clover and urged the police to investigate. She impersonated Clover in tweets claiming to be a “dirty old man” and containing sexual references like the ones she alleged Clover regularly made on Twitter.

That spring and summer, del Valle also unleashed a cascade of angry, expletive-laden emails and voice mails at Clover, the investigation said. In one voice mail, the 2019 investigation reported, del Valle said: “You need to still call me and apologize or you’ll see what I’m going to do. I’m not afraid of you. ... I’m not afraid of anything because I am right.” Del Valle keyed Clover’s car, and sprayed messages in silver paint inside the hall of his apartment building and on his front door calling him a “sex addict” and “sick harasser.”

Clover eventually moved out of the building, the report said, at least in part because he feared for his safety.In the 2019 report from Berkeley’s harassment-prevention office, Clover said that after del Valle’s actions escalated, he started checking outside his doors, parking his car far from home, and leaning on friends for support. “There is a mental toll by being stalked,” he told the investigator. He added that he felt “remarkably unsupported” by UC-Berkeley.

Clover did not call the police when del Valle’s virtual threats turned to vandalism. He has made no secret of his disdain for police officers. In 2019 he took renewed heat for saying on Twitter in 2014 that he was “thankful that every living cop will one day be dead” and in a 2016 interview that cops “need to be killed.” The university’s chancellor, Gary S. May, condemned those remarks but ultimately decided they were protected by the First Amendment. (Clover recently co-wrote an opinion essay in The Chronicle Review opposing colleges’ involvement with police-training academies.)

In November 2019, Berkeley’s harassment-prevention office concluded that it was “more likely than not” — the preponderance-of-evidence standard used in policy-violation cases — that del Valle had engaged in conduct that amounted to stalking, sexual harassment, and retaliation against Clover for his having reported her to the university.

It found “insufficient evidence” that del Valle’s devices had been hacked, and even if they had, it said it wouldn’t justify her actions. The office ordered del Valle to have no contact with the UC-Davis professor. Two months later, Berkeley put her on paid leave for the spring 2020 semester and banned her from campus. She was told she should have no formal contact with her students.It probably didn’t help that the Covid pandemic was making everyone feel isolated at that point, sucking many farther down the internet rabbit hole. Twitter was an avenue for connection when — especially for del Valle, who’d been banned from campus — so many other avenues had been blocked. There, in an environment not known for civility or restraint, one could spend hours trying to decipher cryptic conversations and hidden meanings. It was a world where del Valle remained deeply immersed even as she returned to teaching, remotely, for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters.

Her academic schedule included three undergraduate classes, a graduate seminar, 13 dissertation committees, and publishing. During that time, she said, she continued to be haunted by Twitter posts that appeared to be referring to her daily activities.In late 2020 and early 2021, Clover’s mother, Carol J. Clover, an emerita professor at Berkeley, reported that someone had dumped what looked like chunks of rotten pineapple covered with oil at her doorstep and chalked insults about her son on the sidewalk in front of her home. Her security camera captured fuzzy footage of someone investigators later concluded, “more likely than not,” was del Valle.

Del Valle told The Chronicle that she takes responsibility for those actions and that she was punished for them with a nine-month unpaid suspension. And she clarified that the pineapple was from a batch of tepache — a traditional Mexican cider made from fermented pineapple skins. She said she had made it but didn’t like it, then dumped it on Carol Clover’s doorstep because she partially blames her for the discipline that’s been meted out so far.

Carol Clover is described in a Berkeley podcast as “a longtime friend and colleague” of Carol T. Christ, chancellor of the Berkeley campus, and del Valle feels that’s why she’s being punished severely for her escalating actions. (Berkeley officials cited privacy policies in declining to comment on del Valle’s punishment.) Clover’s mother could not be reached for comment, but in the 2021 report, she told Berkeley investigators that she and her neighbors were worried enough about the messages left in their neighborhood that they chipped in to buy another security camera.

In November 2020, feeling increasingly isolated and depressed, del Valle told a few friends, in an email she shared with The Chronicle, that she was thinking about suicide. She expressed her wish “to say goodnight forever.” The next day, the u/toomuchistrue Twitter account posted a crude illustration of a woman with her head on a railroad track, saying “half the girls on this website do this every day of the week.” Porter wrote, in an email to The Chronicle, that the illustration had nothing to do with del Valle. He said he was making a joking reference to how, during the pandemic, stir-crazy acquaintances were “equating various forms of taboo violence with mundane everyday experiences.”

Meanwhile, del Valle’s supporters were taking steps to try to get her banishment overturned. In September 2021, a group of her then-current and former students wrote the vice provost at the time, Benjamin E. Hermalin, to express the central role they said del Valle played in the department of Spanish and Portuguese. Describing her as a caring, kind mentor, they wrote that “her presence in the department is fundamental to the success of students currently working with her” on various dissertation projects, as well as securing research grants and internships. In addition to having an “unmatched expertise in Mexico,” they wrote, she connected students and scholars through her interdisciplinary teaching and research.

That same year, at Clover’s request, Berkeley opened a second investigation. In a report issued that November, it concluded that del Valle had violated the university’s 2020 no-contact order on four separate occasions: when she left derogatory messages about Clover near his mother’s house and also at that of a neighbor, sent emails to his peers and colleagues, and created a Twitter account that tried to follow Clover’s students.“Respondent was forthcoming and credible in stating that her initial and continuing motivation for engaging in the conduct towards complainant was her perception that complainant had hacked her electronic devices and had been surveilling her life since August 2018 and she wanted him to stop,” the report said. At some point, the report stated, her primary motivation “became commingled with her irritation and disbelief” about being reported to the Title IX office when she felt she was the victim.When she reads the reports of her conduct at that time, del Valle said, “it feels awful.” She described herself as “a very rational person” who has had to work on controlling her temper, which she admits can be “explosive.” “I behaved in a way I never should have,” she said, “but I’ve been punished enough.”
Yeah, after I read a little more about the guy she was harassing, I hate him too 😂
Thx. They have posted on their website a story by the Daily Californian, but of course not the more comprehensive story by the Chronicle of Higher Education. FWIW, the website says people taking part in today’s event -the action to prevent the Cal/USC football game from proceeding- will start gathering at the Campanile at 11:00 today.
**Part 5:**

In November 2021, del Valle left for Mexico to move in with her mother, whom she partially supports. She said she was offered a four-month teaching position as a visiting associate professor at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where she’d taught before arriving at Berkeley in 2009. That offer, included in a letter she shared with The Chronicle, was later rescinded. She said a representative of Michigan’s anti-harassment office told her in a phone conversation in December 2021 that UC-Berkeley officials had notified Michigan about the investigation against her. The dean who had offered her the position told The Chronicle by email that the offer “was rescinded at the level of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts” and that he could not “attest to the motivation.” Administrators from that college did not immediately reply to a request for confirmation.In December, 12 faculty members wrote Berkeley’s chancellor and then-vice provost, asking them to reconsider the case against her. “For more than three years, Professor del Valle believed herself to be the victim of sexual harassment and surveillance,” the faculty members wrote, but when she reported her concerns, none of the many law-enforcement and university entities investigated potential evidence on her devices “and thus there was no evidence to support her case, nor, it should be said, any evidence to disprove her claims.”

“After three years of suffering without support, Professor del Valle sought to stop the harassment by writing to acquaintances of the person who is now her accuser,” the statement went on. “This desperate effort — again, one born from her years of suffering cyberstalking and harassment — led to disciplinary actions.” It’s unclear whether the faculty members were aware of the other actions del Valle is accused of committing.

In January 2022, the university put her on involuntary medical leave.

Four months later, del Valle was suspended without pay or benefits for nine months, largely for the pineapple, chalking, and related incidents. During that time, she said, she continued to be unsettled by posts that cropped up on Twitter, including this one, on October 10:

The following day, del Valle said, an administrator from Berkeley’s harassment-prevention office emailed her that another round of evidence in her case was going to be considered.

Clover felt UC-Berkeley wasn’t doing enough to protect him. He told investigators in 2022 that the administration’s failure to take his complaints seriously enough “has only led to more and more dangerous behavior.” He said he and his partner worried that del Valle’s virtual threats could become physical.The protracted ordeal, he said, had made him “infinitely vigilant in my life about safety in ways that I find corrosive and destructive.” It had also affected his work, he said. Social media is important for disseminating his work as a writer, and his ability to use it “has been cut off to a large extent.”

In November 2022, a third Title IX investigation found that del Valle’s social-media activities had violated Berkeley’s sexual-harassment policy. In February 2023, her suspension was converted to a paid involuntary leave, but she continued to be banned from campus and from any formal contact with her students.This year, Berkeley’s current vice provost, Victoria Plaut, extended her administrative leave three times, according to documents del Valle shared with The Chronicle. But in July, del Valle said, Plaut told her she was recommending her dismissal. She was offered a settlement, del Valle said, of an 18-month unpaid suspension, starting October 1, during which she would not be permitted to visit non-public parts of the campus, except the library; serve on any committees, including dissertation committees; or talk about the complainant. The other possibility that loomed over her, del Valle said, was being brought before the university’s Privilege and Tenure Committee, which could recommend firing her.

The university, she said, recently rejected her lawyer’s “counteroffer” of a six-month suspension. As she waits for her status to be resolved, del Valle said she’s in a better place emotionally than she was when she sat outside Clover’s door and dumped tepache on his mother’s doorstep. The professor’s mental health has come under scrutiny throughout the protracted saga. The Albany police officer, she said, treated her as “delusional”; Joshua and Carol Clover have told Berkeley authorities del Valle was unwell and needed help; a friend of Clover’s posted on X that del Valle had formed “a deeply parasocial obsessive twitter fixation ‘relationship’ with him” and needed to be stopped. Del Valle said she’s tired of being diagnosed as mentally ill. She’s been seeing a therapist once a week. She still insists that the online intrusions she described were very real.

Her supporters have continued to stage protests. In August, about 50 students, alumni, and university employees marched to the chancellor’s office. In an open letter to Chancellor Christ, a group of mostly undergraduate students from various Latinx student groups demanded that del Valle’s concerns be taken seriously. “The disciplinary process has gone far beyond any reasonable ‘punishment’ and has turned into a modern day witch hunt,” they wrote. Given the chancellor’s stated aspiration to have Berkeley join the ranks of colleges classified as Hispanic-serving institutions, the university “needs to start treating our Latinx professors with respect.”

A student-led town-hall meeting on September 14 at the Berkeley campus’s Multicultural Community Center drew about 80 students, alumni, and faculty and staff members, and around 15 more people who, like del Valle, joined by Zoom. “I’m talking here from a place of deep discomfort,” del Valle said, her voice breaking. “This is not easy for me to do, but I have to.” Everything she had worked for, she said, “can easily be taken away by a white person with power.”Among those who spoke during the September event was Carlos Macías Prieto, who worked with del Valle from 2013 to 2020, when she was his doctoral-dissertation adviser. He said he chose Berkeley because of del Valle, who took him under his wing when he was an undocumented student, wrote a letter of recommendation to get him into the graduate program, and then supported him throughout. He said she pulled money from her private funds to support his research when, as an undocumented student, he qualified for fellowships but not for financial support.

Her mentorship and guidance led to early job offers from prestigious colleges, he said. Even before finishing his dissertation, he was hired by Williams College, where he’s now a tenure-track assistant professor of Spanish.

“I wouldn’t be the scholar I am today if it wasn’t for her,” he said in an interview with The Chronicle.Last month Clover circulated the three Title IX investigation reports to several of del Valle’s faculty colleagues and supporters and encouraged them to forward the files to anyone “who might find them useful.” Prieto had already seen those reports — del Valle said she shared them with her supporters — and he is unswayed by Berkeley’s conclusions.

So is Alejandra Decker, who calls del Valle “the most inspiring role model and mentor I have ever had.” Del Valle is her primary dissertation adviser and continued to work with her when Berkeley placed her on unpaid leave. “Most of her students come from underrepresented groups and we all gravitate to her,” Decker said.With their mentor and teacher banned from campus for more than two years, Decker said, “there always seemed to be an expectation that the students would just manage and go on and substitute a committee member and figure it out on their own. There was never an acknowledgment that this had shattered our sense of belonging and set back our academic progress.”The testimony of Prieto and Decker does not change the facts of the case — some undisputed, some very much contested. But it highlights the breadth of the damage done by the yearslong struggle, and the depth of the challenge Berkeley has faced: one professor left feeling unsafe in his home, another swearing her pleas have gone unheard, and students wondering where they stand.
Thank you for taking the time to post the text.
Yea, no problem. I really hope this stuff reaches her supporters and makes them rethink at least some of their worldviews.
The message I'm getting from her supporters is ""we don't care about what she did, we like her as a person and she's the same racial group as us so what she does to others shouldn't matter.""    

I almost see some parallels with those cheering when OJ Simpson was pronounced not guilty of murder."
More Del Valle protests at the UCB Symphony Orchestra,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17ndo20,2023-11-03 21:15:06,"

Context: One of the pieces tonight had acompanying narration, Chancellor Christ was the guest narrator. The protesters seem to feel she is responsible for Del Valle’s suspension, and that her response to the USC vs Cal games (which resulted in protestors arrests) was also bad. Just the messanger, I’m not staking claims on any side. Though, I will add this [KQED article](https://www.kqed.org/news/11965822/uc-berkeley-students-threaten-hunger-strike-to-reinstate-professor-suspended-for-stalking) as well about the circumstances of Del Valle’s suspension.","Hey, so for anyone curious about this case, I'll repost this here. Below is a plain text version of the entire story pieced together by reporter Katherine Mangan.  I highly recommend people read the entire article. Ivonne del Valle comes off as a pretty horrible actor, in need of serious help:

  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gqrxt/new\_ivonne\_del\_valle\_article\_behind\_paywall/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gqrxt/new_ivonne_del_valle_article_behind_paywall/?sort=new)

  
Long story short, multiple investigations have found no merit to professor del Valle's accusations, some of which border on seriously delusional. And contrary to the protestors claims, de Valle is the one who has been found guilty of sexual harassment, not the other professor.

  
Here are some highlights from the article:

>  
1. **""UC-Berkeley’s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination conducted three separate Title IX investigations on the case** — in 2019, 2021, and 2022. **All found that \[professor del Valle\] had either harassed \[the other professor\] or violated orders not to contact him.""**  
>  
>  
2. ""In November 2019, **Berkeley’s harassment-prevention office concluded that it was “more likely than not”** — the preponderance-of-evidence standard used in policy-violation cases — **that del Valle had engaged in conduct that amounted to stalking, sexual harassment, and retaliation...** for \[the other professor's\] having reported her to the university.""  
>  
>  
3. ""Berkeley opened a second investigation. In a report issued that November, it concluded that **del Valle had violated the university’s 2020 no-contact order on four separate occasions: when she left derogatory messages about Clover near his mother’s house and also at that of a neighbor, sent emails to his peers and colleagues, and created a Twitter account that tried to follow Clover’s students.""**  
>  
>  
4. ""In late 2020 and early 2021, **Clover’s mother**, Carol J. Clover, an emerita professor at Berkeley, **reported that someone had dumped what looked like chunks of rotten pineapple covered with oil at her doorstep and chalked insults about her son on the sidewalk in front of her home. Her security camera captured fuzzy footage of someone investigators later concluded, “more likely than not,” was del Valle...** Del Valle told The Chronicle that she takes responsibility for those actions and that she was punished for them with a nine-month unpaid suspension.""  
>  
>  
5. ""That spring and summer, **del Valle also unleashed a cascade of angry, expletive-laden emails and voice mails at Clover,** the investigation said. In one voice mail, the 2019 investigation reported, **del Valle said: “You need to still call me and apologize or you’ll see what I’m going to do. I’m not afraid of you. ... I’m not afraid of anything because I am right.” Del Valle keyed Clover’s car, and sprayed messages in silver paint inside the hall of his apartment building and on his front door calling him a “sex addict” and “sick harasser.”**

  
Really insane that these people still keep doing these protests. I hope they have a change of heart.
[deleted]
Hello people, I was playing in the Orchestra at the time it occurred. They hired a security guard but apparently he was in the bathroom the whole time lmao. Also, they just stood there for like 20 minutes and no one made them leave, so they eventually just got up and left. They were chanting on their way out and throwing off the whole orchestra too. It was a little funny but also a little annoying. Thankfully I don't think they ruined the whole show.
is this some kind of cult?
[deleted]
Bruh students pay $5 for the concert at least pay some respect for your fellas.
Find something else to protest… this isn’t it
not the hill to die on
carol christ looks so sad in the first picture :(
I honestly wonder if the protestors think that people will support Del Valle when they learn about the case because it seems like everyone who learns a bit about the case comes to the conclusion that the University did the right thing.
We have a symphony?
Annoying
This was outrageous. These imbeciles, with the sense of respect comparable to that of a fucking toad, had to choose a concert to do this. These students have spent hours of their precious time to prepare for this glorious moment and they absolutely did not deserve their moment to be pissed on by such rats. The worst part was that they shouted some random shit from their bilious mouths while the orchestra was still playing. Not even a swine would have the audacity to oink that hard in a concert. This event has made me seriously question the decency of some human beings. 

I’m astonished at how well the orchestra reacted though, they gave zero shits about these unworthy fools and kept on playing. It was a wonderful concert!
Collective IQ of 30
I disagree with the way the protesters were handled at the game. They were allowed to sit on the field for way too long. These children should’ve been taken off the field 10 minutes earlier. And after this shit, maybe they should look at a suspension.
They’ve pretty much lost the little respect I’ve had for them
Berkeley is embarrassing
What is it that Professor Clover is said to have done to Professor Del Valle?

The KQED article said in 2014 he made some anti-police statements and Del Valley’s graffiti referred to him as a sex addict.

These articles seem to show that Del Valle is an amazing scholar and teacher who flipped out in a “Fatal Attraction” woman scorned sort of way.

So what the hell did Clover do?
After seeing these protests and giving them the benefit of the doubt because obviously there is a dearth of Latinx professors, then reading these articles, looking at their rebuttal on their IG, and then looking at the rest of their IG… 

Until they produce the evidence they say they have that the other professor had hacked all her accounts and was coordinating a tweet campaign to gaslight her, which I doubt they have or will, I believe that these students are continuing and expanding the harassment that Ivonne Del Valle committed. 

The statements they are making about the other professor, the things they are saying about the chancellor, the stalking tactics they are using to harass the chancellor and defame the other professor, sound just like the stalking behavior of Del Valle from the articles. 

If anything the tactics they are continuing to use show us why it is not safe to have Ivonne Del Valle here for the rest of us.
Bit strange but sure
I've grown so immune and weary of disruptive protests I have made it a point not to support whatever they're protesting against. It's like someone getting in my face and demanding respect and attention, not happening! Ask nicely and I might actually join your cause.
Lol when wokesters go even more mad than they already are. I'm Hispanic and I approve of that crazy professor being suspended.
These people are absolute clowns.
I love Berkeley.
I can’t protest cuz EECS127 is killing me 😭😭😭
Nothing new . Hispanic are nothing for Berkeley
I know no one will probably care but no one is contesting that she didn’t do this. She accepted the punishments , what is now happening is that between her last punishment and now, she hasn’t violated anything and they revisited her case to prolong the suspension. 
There is also questionable biases with chancellor Christ. Best friends with the mother of the harasser. Swift response to investigate Del Valle when the same wasn’t afforded to her after reporting for 2 years. Berkeley said she was hacked but made no efforts to investigate the hacking. Christ says it is out of her hands but in reality she makes the final decision. When asked what to do with protesters from usc game, she made the decision to send them to Santa Rita when historically protestors would rarely be sent there (they were peacefully protesting)

Wow this lady is insane. Hope the administration does not cave to these childish protestors
I am confused about this situation. There is factual information that proved that she failed to respect court orders as well as her admitting to do so. There are more than a single occurrence. Now, we do not exactly know what happened with her and that UC Davis professor but it is clear she definitely failed to respect guidelines given to her so I believe the school did the right thing. What are these students protesting about then ?
Martyr complexes 🙄
aww they must be really afraid of covid
What is her and her supporters response to this article? 

Would be very helpful to see what they think.
Wow. This needs more upvotes
Your post is significantly more informative than the protestors blocking me from getting to my class on time.
The students protesting for her reinstatement are just as delusional as del Valle. This woman harassed and a man for years and then also went after his mother and we’re supposed to absolve her actions because he’s white and she’s hispanic? Can you imagine a white man saying that their actions are inconsequential because of their race?
Is this the same Clover who said cops need to be killed?
more like pathetic
Indeed.  Cult of personality.
I talked to one of the PA/hall people who were standing by the emergency exit doors front row. For her part, she said “I didn’t want to cause anymore trouble,” presuming that forcefully removing them would’ve caused far more of a scene than the awkward silence that ensued.
Seems like it. She is literally a weirdo stalker who violated court orders multiple times. Can’t help but think  there is literally a 0.000% chance that if a male professor did any one of these things anyone would be protesting for them as if they are being unfairly treated for their own egregious action by getting suspended lol. I would think this would be grounds for immediately firing
Have you checked out their instagram? It’s culty af.
Yes, identity politics is a cult.

She’s a psychotic stalker with no remorse for her violent harassment but they are compelled to defend her (and attack those who justly discipline her) because they are racist identity politics thugs.
The things her supporters were saying just reminded me of what supporters of like famous/successful men who turn out to be sexual predators say. Like it doesn't matter how talented, or funny, or kind they are to you- that has no relation to how they act in private.
How quickly people disrespect others just to get a point across (even worse when their point is shit)
for context, there are many moments of pause during the piece to let the instruments play between her narration. There definitely were moments though when she had to stop speaking because the protestors were chanting. Can’t say if she was sad though, she kinda just seemed a little begrudged from my pov in the front row.
They had a great performance! They’re performing the same program tomorrow night (11/4) at 8PM. Please buy tickets to support them :D
this is a normal thing to say to another person. I think you should text a friend and show them what you said
“ChatGPT, generate a comment disapproving of a group of protesters. Use the prose of a verbose, edgy thirteen year old with a superiority complex. Make sure the tone is condescending and overly aggressive.” (I also don’t agree with the protesters)
Even 30 is too high
[deleted]
This is what identity politics obsession does to a school.  Tip of the iceberg.  Only going to get worse unless they make changes.
From what I have read, it seems to have started because he may have allegedly turned down an advance from her over dinner/drinks, or backed out of a collaboration between them. After that is when she evidently started noticing ""coincidences"" of him allegedly insulting her online.

I've been following this story since I saw it posted in a gradschool sub and I love drama, but the impetus for this whole thing was something extremely innocuous and trivial. I get the sense that del Valle is profoundly mentally ill and in desperate need of psychiatric intervention. 

It's really bizarre that these students are supporting her given what is well known and documented about the facts of the case. 

Here is an article that discusses it: [https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-harassment-case-that-has-berkeley-at-a-boil](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-harassment-case-that-has-berkeley-at-a-boil), and a reddit thread with the text: [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gqrxt/new\_ivonne\_del\_valle\_article\_behind\_paywall/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gqrxt/new_ivonne_del_valle_article_behind_paywall/)
W EECS127
I’m mexican and I don’t agree with the protests at all, but I’d suggest you check your punctuation before coming for all hispanics, how’d you get into Berkeley?
I don’t know about you, but I don’t want a mentally unstable serial stalker and sexual harasser on campus as a professor….
They have this video up on their Instagram page as a response. 
https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cy9z-nbrfrt/?igshid=MW5tMXM5MjJwZm5qbg==
Her supporters are as delusional as she is.
Yea, same guy.
Yeah, that was a good idea, the awkward silence was really funny
The guy was complaining about UCB not doing enough, but I feel like if he had gotten the cops involved when she showed up at his apartment and vandalized his property and then if she was arrested, she definitely would have been fired right?
I hope society is beginning to wake up to your first statement.  People seem way, way more insane these days than a mere decade ago. Internet plus ID politics, blech.
Ikr Low key if you want to make a point at least try to be smart about it. I wouldn’t have had an opinion on the matter if they didn’t bother me irl but now they are just begging for a bad rap.
Genuinely interested
I’m going tonight. Thanks for letting me know about it!!!
I agree that del Valle isn't right and the protestors are being assholes btw
It is most definitely specific to Berkeley. It’s been that way for over 50 years.
what changes do you propose
Wow, starting to wonder if she has BPD (borderline personality disorder).
So their issue with the article is that it only contains facts…?
Thank you for sharing that🙏 

I could agree with their point that she has been punished, let her come back. They should just lead with that. What gives me pause is that they start to make claims like she had her own investigation and that other women have been saying this about the same guy.

So, they say she took accountability and everything should move forward BUT this guy actually did this and they have evidence that other people are experiencing the same thing. Those 2 statements can’t exist together, if she is still making these allegations then she hasn’t really stopped and therefore hasn’t taken accountability OR they sided with the wrong person and they need to produce the receipts.

I would be more inclined to believe them if they had been the ones to mention all this, but they waited until after these articles came out.

Additionally, yes, the article has a bias, we all do. They have a bias for their professor also, it is expected. 

I would be very happy to agree with them that this very unique professor that they are so loyal to has suffered enough and should come back. However the facts that they are still making these claims about the other professor to me says that she is still making these claims to them and now through them, thus she is not done.

They are trying to have this both ways, either produce the evidence you say you have and exonerate her OR ask her to return because this has been enough.
They seem to act like the university fired her because of her specific acts, when it seems like in reality the university fired her because she’s obviously mentally ill and remorseless. I think if she owned up to her delusions rather than just her actions and committed to getting treatment it may have turned out different
They are students like you and me with biases like you and me. They are biased through their relationship with her.

It appears to me that she is using them to expand the harassment of everyone she feels has wronged her. They are using her same methods of defamation and threats. They have even been arrested for it.

It appears she is abusing her influence over them for their detriment and for her campaign of retribution. It makes everything all that much more worse.
Ah, I knew I recognized him from somewhere

Students whine and complain about identity politics stuff at almost every college. It's actually probably worse at small, private liberal arts schools, at least according to what I have seen.
Sadly I don’t have the answers (well at least not now as I’m about to sleep).  But I do think the book Coddling of the American Mind had some good ideas about how to address campus radicalization and echo chambers.  

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/

https://www.thecoddling.com/
In short, yes.

They subscribe to a belief system that dictates that all claims are necessarily subjective, and that all interpersonal disputes should be adjudicated by deferring to identity markers. There's never any definitive truth, just competing personal narratives.

There might not be any material evidence that Clover did anything bad to del Valle. Her claims might seem legitimately delusional. But she is a Latinx woman and he is a white man and so her truth will always override his. 

I'm an academic and I've seen less extreme situations like this play out dozen of times over the last decade. I try telling outsiders how extreme and insane it is but it's hard to describe accurately without sounding like I'm exaggerating.
OH WOW GUYS ITS ONLY $5 FOR STUDENTS! I just watched a bit of your performance tonight, looks totally worth it
Coddling, influence, or simple echo chamber.  All powered by advert revenue.

There is a collective fragility that speaks of nearly zero uncontrolled exposure to others, aka interface through computer versus face to face communication. Social media has encouraged overly emo whining about the smallest of issues (micro-aggressions) with the simple motive of pumping traffic for higher ad revenue.  Social media and the cellphone have changed peoples behavior and mental heath for the worse on a massive scale.

Anecdotal evidence: our most senior HR person recently retired, and in a private conversation commented on how over the last decade, their office time was becoming consumed by counseling a growing percentage of mild to severely depressed, lonely yet self-isolated employees.  HR's response was to sponsor more meetings and furnish refreshments, but the impact was lost due to telecommuting: young people in particular preferred to ""call it in"".

&#x200B;","I asked them to publish the evidence and they deleted my comment
When I first saw the protesters I was cautiously sympathetic to their cause, because the story they told about their professor seemed plausible and aligned with my beliefs on how university systems/bureaucracies operated.


After reading the article it’s very clear that Del Valle is in the wrong. Even if you just take the information that *Del Valle herself* has provided, it still paints her as a delusional/paranoid harasser.


Sadly, I don’t think the message will really get through to the protesters. They have committed so heavily to this issue that admitting they were wrong would take a massive amount of humility and would still be incredibly embarrassing. However, I don’t think they’ll have much public support anymore, given how the truth is so easily accessible now.
I was so embarrassed for them at the football game yesterday. Don't they know they are just bring more attention to what a psycho she is?
I second 80m80. Acknowledging that Del Valle is wrong is going to take a lot of humility. I don’t think they’ll recognize it, but if they do I’d have much more respect for them than what they’re doing right now
Couldn't bring myself to listen to that whole thing, so here's a (machine generated) transcript. Split in two comments because it's that long. There's two speakers at points, which might make the transcript a little hard to follow, sorry.

> 
 Gladys, why are we here doing this video? We're here because I think that it's time that people heard our side. I've seen a lot of questions online asking why we are supporting Yvonne, calling us delusional, manipulated and manipulators, so multi-talented individuals. In part, I wanted to put my face out there because I'm not ashamed to be a part of this struggle. I believe in it and despite what people are saying who don't have all of the information, I stand by it. I was going to ask you, why do you think that people are basically portraying Yvonne that way? Why is that they don't have all the information? I mean, in part, it's not, you know, with certain media outlets, it's not that they don't have the information, it's about what they do with it, it's about the ways in which systems of power continue to reproduce this violence on certain people. So, I mean, we wanted to clarify a few of the points, you know, because we've been a part of this from the beginning and have talked to Yvonne, know Yvonne, have seen a lot of the evidence. I wanted personally to clarify a lot of, I think, the inaccuracies that are present in these articles. And I mean, I would like to begin with, there is this sense, especially with the Chronicle article, there's this sense that it's, you know, simply… One, now that I will be like enumerating, like the stuff that you're like going to say, you know, it's just a visual aid. You're saying especially with this article. With the Chronicle article, I think that for some people, it gives the impression that it is just sort of presenting facts almost objectively. But I, so I'm an instructor at UC Berkeley, I teach reading and composition. And one of the first things that we teach our students is to be critical of the texts that they're reading, to ask questions about, especially within official documents, you know, which voices are privileged, which voices are silenced. And I just, I think I'm so saddened by like seeing the reaction to it, because I just think to me, it is so obvious that there is bias within this article. The ways in which one party gets to simply be and act and fear and exist and the other one seems and thinks and believes and says she feels, right? It's obvious whose experiences are being legitimized and whose experiences aren't. And maybe you're asking yourself, well, clearly one of those experiences happened and the other one didn't. But it's something as simple as he feared for his partner versus, you know, she said she was afraid or whatever. And that that is not about the like the data that we're arguing. That is about a particular journalist's like depiction, right? Their particular bias toward one subject versus the other. That's the first. Just to get a little bit into the nitty gritty that you don't see in that article is are things like, you know, I think people just gloss over the fact that an investigation, a forensic investigation by the university was never actually conducted. Anyone did. She she did have someone conduct a forensic investigation on on the things that she could. Obviously, the university owns the computer and they own like her email address, but things like her phone and whatnot. And that forensic analysis, despite what KQD like does, actually does conclude that there is evidence of tampering with her devices. And that's information that was handed both to university and to the Chronicle. And both of them decided that they weren't going to take it into consideration because they couldn't independently verify it. And maybe this is a simple response, but if you want to independently verify something, you should probably pay someone to do an independent like investigation. Right. But that wasn't done. Yeah. And I just and also to that, it's like, I'm sorry, Berkeley, do not believe in hacking because five years ago you were hacked and you lost all of your students' private information and had to send out a campus wide apology and give us a call. And give us like one year of some bullshit cybersecurity program. So that's one to the third one. OK, we're in the third one now. Professor Yvonne had given the Chronicle this document that she had created that was listing all of the injustices in which she which she faced during the investigation. And I also maybe this I just want to be very clear, you know, this campaign has always been about her reinstatement. It's not it's not about rehashing what has happened because those concerns. And I understand that for a lot of you, they are so fresh because a lot of this information is coming to life. But those concerns have had audience and they have had responses from the university for years. Right. Yvonne has been punished for years and continues to be punished. And they're currently trying to take away her tenure. And for those of you that don't know, in the entire 150 year history of the University of California system, and that means all of the University of California, Berkeley, Davis, San Diego, Los Angeles, all of them. Do you know how many professors have had their tenure removed? Eight. I might be off by one or two, but I'm pretty close. It is an extremely rare occurrence. I know Harvard just removed someone's tenure for the first time in their history. And a lot of us know professors that have passed through our campus that have faced multiple sexual harassment violations from students that have physically struck other professors on campus that have taught classes high off their asses for years. And none of them have had their tenure removed. And that's not to say that I'm advocating for tenure to never get removed. But I do think at the very least we need to ask the question, why her? One of the injustices that we're fighting is just the severity of the punishment. That's one. And then I'm sorry. There's just so many things going through my head. We have time.

That sounds about right.
I agree completely. From the Chronicles article, it seems very likely that Del Valle is experiencing a mental health crisis. I had a roommate who experienced something similar: he became convinced that our neighbors were somehow reading his text messages and hacking his grindr and then making references to those private conversations to taunt him. He eventually was diagnosed and treated for a mental health condition, but not before his paranoid behavior escalated and he caused real harm to another roommate. If del Valle is experiencing something similar, and it sounds like she might be, then I hope she gets the support she needs. But protesting for her return to campus and validating what are likely paranoid delusions is the last thing she needs.
Thanks for the transcripts. And I agree, I think it takes a pretty rare kind of person to be able to admit when they were wrong on something that was so heated and so public. Unfortunately, these don't seem to be those kind of people, and this video response they put out shows that for now at least, they're going to keep defending del Valle. 

It is really interesting to watch the response, tho. If there are any psych students out there following this, it could honestly make for a really interesting case study in group think. 

I'm not the first to notice it, but insular political groups like this share a lot in common with fringe religious groups, and it's pretty disturbing to watch how everything - otherwise common moral intuitions, generally accepted and well reasoned argument and facts - becomes subordinate to serving their political goals. 

Again, I really hope these people change their minds, but my feeling is that in departments that specialize in things like ""colonial studies,"" the students and faculty are so indoctrinated that we probably won't make much headway. Honestly it's just another reason departments like this really need to be reorganized under different leadership.
Exactly
Same. When I realized what they were actually protesting, I cringed so hard.
Lol yep.  I saw it pop up in my news feed after the and game, then shared it with my cal alumni network.  I suspect I wasn't the only one.  So many more people now know who this crazy B is, and not in a good way 🤣
> Yes. OK. Right. And this document and this document that she gave the Chronicle, it just it I think it is very, very regulatory about the ways in which the investigation itself was biased. For example, right, like family or like close relations of the other party were allowed to testify as witnesses to events or to this person's whereabouts or what have you, whereas Yvonne's son wasn't allowed to testify because he might be biased. Well, what is it? Is like a family member bias or are they not? Also, oh, this one this one has eaten at me for months, like for as long as I've known it. One of the one of the cases against Yvonne for breaking the no contact rule is because she tweeted at the police to help her with her stalker and she added his Twitter handle. And this person, I mean, I guess I'm just going to say it because it's been released at this point. Joshua Clover has like maintained throughout the entire investigation that that is not his Twitter handle. The administration throughout the entire investigation has maintained that it is not his Twitter handle. And yet her tweeting that Twitter handle, not naming him, but tweeting the handle is her breaking the no contact order. That just doesn't even make sense because if it's not his Twitter handle, then you can't punish her for that. And if it is his Twitter handle, then you have to take seriously everything that that account tweets as coming from him. It is just this constant double standard. And actually, I can tell you why they why they accepted it, because I'm pretty sure this is actually written in the report because she believed that it was his Twitter handle. Then she was breaking the no contact order. But, you know, it's been my understanding that this administration doesn't care about what she believes. It doesn't take seriously what she believes. So why are they using what she believes against her? There are just so many instances like this, right? Like certain evidence that gets handed over for an incident has like a video has like the wrong date on it. And when Yvonne points this out, the investigators like, oh, the dates don't matter. But then when they're asking about her whereabouts, the dates are incredibly important. And I just want to be clear that our our campaign is focusing on giving voice where they're just a voice that just hasn't been been heard. Right. And is focusing on the ways in which this administration has mishandled this case. Like enough is enough. She's been punished. However you feel about it, she's she's been punished. And it's time for us to focus on on the good that Yvonne can do. So I myself am a first generation like Mexican woman. And I can tell you that the chances of me actually graduating with this Ph.D. are amongst the lowest of any demographic. So for Carol Chris to insinuate that we could simply replace Yvonne as though we're just there's so many of us just out there. So many of her just out there is absurd. Yvonne has been committed to her students, to her community and supporting them throughout her entire career. And we are asking that she be allowed to continue to support us because a lot of us have nowhere to turn to within our own departments. No one that understands the ways in which our backgrounds affect our relationship to the academy, affect our relationship to scholarship. Yes. You have other questions, please. Yeah, no. And I was going to say that it's like besides even demographic, it's like Yvonne's human personality, because it's actually weird to see so many students like backing up like a professor. Yeah, right. Yeah. I mean, it's multifaceted, right? She's also just an incredibly personable professor, like treats you like a person, treats you like you have more value than what you're producing. And also, like her scholarship is amazing, right? Like she actually is doing that radical work that so many people profess to be doing. There's just it would just be such a huge loss for this community. Oh, and the other thing and I think this one might be like she's not replaceable. You're not replaceable. It's like we are like being told. Yeah. I mean, how many professors would have 13 students be arrested for their reinstatement? I cannot think of that many. I frankly wouldn't do it for anyone else. But I was going to say the other thing. And again, you know, it's not my I don't know. It almost feels to me like I shouldn't have to prove to someone that this is actually happening to her, that it's enough for them to understand that despite what may or may not have happened, that the university just completely closed doors, didn't respond to emails, didn't return phone calls, didn't notify her of any decision. She moved back to the bay this semester thinking that she was going to teach a class. That class was on our course list. It was advertised. Students were enrolled. Her syllabus was up. And it wasn't until two weeks before that she was told that actually she wasn't going to be teaching that class. And the students weren't told until I think maybe a few days before. Suddenly they had a different professor. They had a different reading list. They had a totally different class. Right. There's just been a complete lack of communication. There's been a complete lack of care toward her. And I I think in part I just want to believe that that's enough. That understanding, that mistreatment, that isolation is enough. But for those of you that like, you know, continue to assert that she's crazy, this is something that was never made public because, I mean, this campaign in particular is trying to care for its members and it's trying to disrespect people's privacy. So, you know, I won't share names, but Professor Yvonne is not the only nor the first woman to make these accusations against Joshua Clover. And that's information that both the university and the clinical had and have not followed up on it. There are multiple people who have, you know, come come to either Yvonne or one of us talking about their experiences with him. The fear that they feel. So, yes, 100 percent. I believe her. And if I were to think that she were crazy, then I would have to accept that fact that crazy is spreading. That particular kind of crazy might be contagious amongst women.
How tf did your word salad spewing ass get hired as an instructor here?

This entire comment reads as a poorly generated AI response. I’ve heard crackheads on the street make more coherent statements.
> this struggle **session**
&#x200B;

1. Clover's mother was harassed by Ivonne at her home. As I understand it, that's why she was interviewed for the article. What new information is Ivonne's son going to bring to this case?
2. Who, specifically, has ""come forward with similar accusations""? What, specifically, were the ""similar accusations""?
3. Who conducted this investigation? Can we see the report? What does ""tampering"" mean? She had a virus? Malware? What evidence is there that the other professor had anything to do with it?

I don't think these are ""valid points,"" they're unsubstantiated rumors meant to muddy the waters.
Students werw Charged w trespassing
That was a giant word salad that didn’t bring new evidence in del Valle’s favor to light or refute any of the evidence in Clover’s favor. She left rotting food and antagonizing messages at his mom’s house to the point where uninvolved neighbors started to feel threatened and she posted pics of Clover’s partner on social media. There's more I'm not even bringing up. She vandalized the area outside his home and property repeatedly until he had to move for his own safety. How are we going to ignore all of this and blame the situation on racism, sexism, and discrimination? It's also so ironic that the speaker tries to use the school attempting to remove her tenure as some big trump card. “Why are they attempting to punish her in a way that is so severe and rare in academia?"" That alone should prompt you into realizing ""oh, her actions were BAD bad"" but it somehow got spun into an ideology war
I really get the feeling listening to people with this woman's politics that things are true or false not because they cohere with any facts, but are true and false only if they agree with their political positions. 

So we can wind up with a situation where professor del Valle is by all acounts (including her own) harassing and stalking another professor, is threatening him, and is making claims everyone acknowledges are delusional, but nevertheless \*she is the one being victimized\* because, in the words of the woman in the #justice4Ivonne video, ""with certain media outlets, it's not that they don't have the information, it's about what they do with it, it's about the ways in which systems of power continue to reproduce this violence on certain people.""

I'm not familiar with the syllabus of any of the classes this department puts out, but from what little ""colonial studies"" work I've read, this is a really predictable outcome of people taking this ""scholarship"" seriously.
I completely agree. It’s just so ironic about how they talk about how information is being withheld and has an agenda when they’re doing the exact same thing by withholding all these details to make del Valle come across better. 

They keep detracting and talking about all the good she’s done and how kind she is to them, but that's not relevant to the claims of harassment and stalking. Just because someone was nice to some groups of people doesn’t mean they are to others. Her being a good teacher and colleague can coexist with her being a horrifying stalker. 

As someone who is also in an underrepresented minority group, I understand the want to uplift historically oppressed peoples, but blind worship is not the way to go about it.
Yep! 

Systemic racism is a thing. Misogyny is a thing. They don’t seem to be at play here as much as her own shitty actions. 

Like, let’s not pretend that if she were a white man, these *exact same people* would be condemning her behavior in an instant. They would have applauded her being removed from campus. 

Just because she is a member of minority communities does not mean her belonging to those groups should serve as a get-out-of-jail-free card. She fucked up. Actions have consequences. Her termination is a consequence of her actions. 

Fringe groups like these leave no room for nuance in their reasonings. It’s wild to see them continue to defend her even knowing what she did. Like???
Yea, I mean, even that might be giving them a little too much credit. I think behind a lot of these people's claims to want to support ""people of color"" or the ""subaltern,"" or ""colonized people"" is typically just a pretty nepotistic defense of their own clique's job prospects. I think scholars like Adolf Reed are basically right that these politics are more about protecting upper middle class academics hussles (or like, the top 1% of lefty journalists and actors) than about helping any oppressed people - and this case is just, such a good example of that.

They dress it up in a bunch of pretty language but at the end of the day I think theres just sort of an understanding among them that the sort of wild stuff they preach just isn't going to make it unless they can intimidate other people into accepting it/giving them jobs/funding. The whole #justice4Ivonne video you can see the woman like smirking and holding back laughter. I'm pretty sure she knows what she's saying is bullshit and just doesn't care, cause telling the truth was never the point."
The Harassment Case that Has Berkeley at a Boil (Professors del Valle and Clover's Case),https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-harassment-case-that-has-berkeley-at-a-boil?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_8122117_nl_Academe-Today_date_20231026&cid=at&sra=true,2023-10-26 09:24:34,,"Reading this, I think she really needs mental help and even she knows it to an extent.

I mean, a lot of the Twitter “coincidences” mentioned in the article were just instances of her reaching to try to find a connection to fit her narrative. It also can be attributed to the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.

Hopefully, she gets help and the other dude gets peace.

And she’s lucky that the other professor is vehemently anti-police because a lot of the things she did can be punished by jail time.
I was pretty close to Professor Del Valle as an undergrad (almost wrote my thesis with her before I chose another department) and found her a really supportive, inspiring professor. From that perspective of studying with her alone and not knowing everything in all of these reports I can see why so many students would rally behind her. A really upsetting thing to read and I hope she gets the support she needs. Obviously it goes without saying that she behaved unacceptably.

Reading this brings back memories of the handful of people I have known with worsening schizophrenia and paranoia.

It's infuriating that so many people continue to support this insanity, presumably for ideological reasons.
If del Valle believed that ""the person she accused\[Clover\] of hacking her phone and laptop""  then she should have reported these 'crimes' to the police \[and probably the FBI\].

""she \[del Valle\] felt were similarities between what she was communicating on her cellphone and laptop and tweets she attributed to Clover. She would message a friend, she said, and within hours, a post would pop up on Clover’s Twitter feed — or another she was convinced he had access to — that seemed to be indirectly referencing it"" -- this perception is called ""apophenia"" \[1\].

The weirdest part of this for me is del Valle's apparent harassment of Clover's mom, who is also a Berkeley professor. Is she jealous of his mom?
Thank you for sharing your experience. :)
A lot of people are unable to reconcile that a person can have both virtuous and problematic aspects to their behavior. I also hope she finds the help she needs to recover; it'd not only benefit Del Valle and Clover, but it would also serve as a teaching moment for those of Del Valle's supporters who see this as a good vs evil issue and not a ""people are complex"" one.
It should be noted how disgusting it is to mold a students mind to your delusions. They should just let the professors fight to the death, since Clover thinks police should be murdered, and she thinks white people are evil. Fuck em!
Sits outside his home for hours and creates fake twitter accounts impersonating him. I have really soured on this Professor del Valle.
I’m glad protesters blocked Spraul for a good reason.
[deleted]
I hope that people bear in mind Prof. Del Valle's actions, reported perceptions, and UC's assessments of same when the topic of ""believe women"" is discussed.
Why didn’t Prof. Clover contact the police?
I am white and Prof Del Valle was nothing but individually supportive and kind to me in my several semesters studying with her. In fact, I often found her remarkably moderate in her generosity toward even the objectively brutal conquistadores we studied. 

It’s a sad situation of where the question at stake is how to respond to her mental health crisis and the appropriate consequences for her bad behavior. It’s not about your lame little grievance politics.
> of course the students protesting on her behalf probably hadn’t seen the full scope

It's not going to change anyone's position, any more than more evidence or convictions will change the mind of a Trump supporter. ""Religious belief"" is irrational no matter whether on the ""left"" or ""right."" (I don't even know what to name the ""sides"" these days.) But continuing to call the disciplinary actions ""racism"" and ""sexism"" just weakens the anti-racism and anti-sexism cause.

> However lines were crossed that I doubt she can come back from (to berkeley, at least).

If it is really clinical paranoia, I'm afraid her problems are bigger than getting back her Cal job.
He is extremely anti-police himself, and has made some rather incendiary anti-police comments. So they're not his go-to.

But I agree with you, the police are a tax-funded public service, and most of us, whether pro- or anti-police, occasionally need protection from crazy and/or violent people.
Thanks, I Googled Prof. Clover and saw his remarks about police.
He knows what they'd do lol prob ignore his call!"
