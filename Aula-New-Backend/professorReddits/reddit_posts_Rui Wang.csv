MATH 113 w/ Rui Wang,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ka2a9/math_113_w_rui_wang/,2023-05-17 11:33:15,Has anyone taken MATH 113 with Rui Wang? I noticed that she has pretty high bins in her class. Are her exams easier?,"[removed]

Which prof for Math 110 this summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dkg5w7/which_prof_for_math_110_this_summer/,2024-06-20 09:40:04,"Any thoughts on Rui Wang (lecturer), Michael Kielstra or Harper Wells (both grad students) for 110 this summer?

Currently enrolled in Rui Wang's class, her RateMyProf says she's very sweet and I don't doubt that, but she doesn't seem very communicative over bCourses or email. I was out sick and couldn't attend the first two lectures.

Also dm me if you want to study together - I need to do well in this class!!",
Math 113 and 185,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bwby00/math_113_and_185/,2024-04-05 00:22:07,"Should I take them concurrently next semester?

Also I'm not sure which prof should I pick for each. Right now 113 has Mladenov and Rui Wang, and 185 has Pasqualotto, Korotkikh, and Jikang Wang. If you've taken classes with them, how was your experience?","I think it's okay to take these two classes concurrently. 

I took a class with Rui Wang before, tho not on algebra. I think her teaching was okay, but in terms of logistics it was pretty chaotic and she was also not very responsive. Overall a pretty meh experience.
i previously had a bad experience with mladenov with his class being quite difficult but curious about the 185 profs
no you will die"
Applied math upper div order,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1b8cdox/applied_math_upper_div_order/,2024-03-06 13:51:56,"I have 113, 128a, and 185 left. Whats the best order to take them? For 113, the professors are Voiculescu and rui wang, and both have horrible reviews rmp. Should I just take 128a with persson first?","185 last but for the other 2 pick whichever has a better professor and do that first
If you've taken 104 already, you can do them in any order. Just take the class with the best (least bad) professor that semester
wait where r u able to see who the 113 profs are
Thx, did u take any with these 3 profs?
Nah, doing 104 and 110 rn. I just did a lot of research into the recommended order.
110 with frenkel? How was mt?
Honestly did well, feeling +1 sd 

But I grinded linear algebra harder than any other course since it’s the most useful upper div for math by far sooo"
Incoming data science freshman schedule. Thoughts or Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xx9lv/incoming_data_science_freshman_schedule_thoughts/,2023-07-12 11:55:32,"1. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler (mixed reviews on RMP but seems like a hard professor), CS 61A with Prof. John Denero (not sure if I’ll enroll as a DS major and with 300 waitlist max), and EPS 7 Climate Change and Computer science mentors (not sure how to enroll in CSM)

2. Math 1A with Prof. Richard Bamler, DATA C8 w/ Prof. Swupnil Sahai, EPS 50 Planet Earth w/ Michael Manga

3. Math 32 (Precalculus) w/ Prof. Rui Wang (bad reviews on RMP but not suer if I should enroll in precalculus since I want to do well in calculus at Cal), CS 10 w/ Dan Garcia (friendlier pace than CS 61A) and some other random GE course

4. Math 32 w/ Prof. Rui Wang (again, has bad reviews on RMP), Data C8, and some random GE.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone could review and give thoughts on my incoming freshman schedule for the fall semester? As well as any opinions on anything I should change? I am an incoming data science major. I have some configurations of what my schedule would look like. 

Also, could anyone recommend any easy and fun 7-breadth courses? That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",I like the first one with Data 8 instead of EPS 7
Help: Which Professor should I take for Math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/djhxai/help_which_professor_should_i_take_for_math_104/,2019-10-17 20:54:00,"Currently my options are; **Nicholas Miller, Mariusz Wodzicki, Ryan A Hass,**  **Yu-Wei Fan,**  **Sebastian Eterovic, Rui Wang,**  **Philip J Wood**

Thanks for the help!","Not wodzicki if you value your sanity.  I've heard very good about Hass.
I have Hass right now for 104 and he’s a wonderful teacher! Lectures are very example based, and he walks around the classroom chatting with students. Neat notes for if you miss a class, very fair midterm 1 (aside from one question but whatever), and generally available.
Echoing the comments about Hass - he's a very engaging lecturer which I find relatively uncommon among professors, and his assignments are reasonable
Can vouch for Yu-Wei Fan! amazing chalkboard work, his clarity in lecture is superb, and he answers every question thoughtfully and precisely. Every student who’s gone to his office hours lauds him for his helpfulness.

He is also great at managing admin stuff, keeping us students well informed about what material will be covered, and about upcoming deadlines. 

11/10 in my book. And I come from CC, where I feel like I had great professors, but was definitely coddled.
Not Wang. She means well but the language barrier and accent makes her hard to understand, at least for me.
Rui Wang, and I cannot stress this enough. Crystal clear lecturer (unless you have an issue with her accent - see another comment below) and is incredibly helpful during office hours and always open to questions. Of all the classes I've taken at cal so far, analysis with Professor Wang probably made me smarter more than any other class has. I found it difficult initially, but that is by virtue of the difficulty of the material and my inexperience coming into the class - not because of quality of instruction. She uses Rudin, and will give you a rigorous foundation in basic topological concepts that should prepare you well for 202 A/B. She structures the class logically, so that you get a complete treatment of the constructions of the reals, and almost everything is generalised to topological spaces and metric spaces, unlike other sections which may just state a completeness axiom for the reals, and then specify all work to the reals for the majority of the semester and do some basic work with metric spaces in the last two weeks (making for a very boring, and much easier class). You will also get some very basic introductory concepts in functional analysis which few of the other sections bother introducing at all (equicontinuity, uniform convergence, arzela ascoli).  I would take her again in a heartbeat. The only possible qualm you may have is her accent, and that the class is rather fast paced if you do not have any background in proof based math at the level of abstraction that 104 goes into (I did not. Many others found the pace just right or too slow even). I for one, did not find her accent particularly hard to follow."
