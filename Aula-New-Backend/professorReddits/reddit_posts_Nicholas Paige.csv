French 80,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xizvfu/french_80/,2022-09-19 22:15:46,"Hi, 

Has anyone taken French 80 under Nicholas Paige know how the midterm is formatted? For all I know, there is MCQ, Essay, T/F, and short answer FRQ. How should one go about studying for it?  What are the questions like and what the content is on?   
Thanks.","Took it with Paige a few semesters ago during Covid. The questions were on the broad strokes material of the class. Things like being able to identify which year an old map of Paris mustve been from by deducing from the structure of the walls, which major landmarks were associated with which events and monarchs, which alternate names some buildings/locations have gone by, the context and meaning of the paintings studied in class, major characters and themes from the readings, etc. The FRQs had us analyze some of the readings and also explain some of the transformations that Paris went through. Iirc the average grade is pretty high so donâ€™t stress it too much, especially if youre taking it PNP"
