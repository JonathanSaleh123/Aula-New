UCSD student looking for some Hindi guidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l251fu/ucsd_student_looking_for_some_hindi_guidance/,2021-01-21 10:59:23,"Has anyone here taken the Hindi 15 intensive elementary Hindi class over the summer. This year its with Nora melnikova. I really wanna learn Hindi because I don’t speak Hindi at all but sd doesn’t offer classes for beginners. Any reviews on the teacher itself? I would love if someone who took it before could tell me if they found the class worth it. Also like up till what level could you converse at by the end of it? Basic phrases or only some words or you could carry a simple convo or like what? Or just advice from anyone who’s studied hindi at cal and their thoughts/ opinions on this. Thanks in advance!!

Edit: Cant find anything about the class in Berkeleytime and theres like 2 rate my professor reviews for the a different class so im really relying on other peoples testimonies here. Its quite a bit of money for me but I will happily spend it on this course if I could just really know its worth it. Please please someone come through or just boost/upvote this post if you dont have info so it could get to someone who does","Maybe Berkeleytime can give you a better idea of grade distributions?

Hi sorry might be a stupid question but whats Berkeley time??
fuck off bot
If you just google Berkeleytime it'll come up. 

But it's just a website with all of Berkeley's courses and their grade distributions over the years."
