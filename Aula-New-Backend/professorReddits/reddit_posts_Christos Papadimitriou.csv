CS or EECS for unit ceiling at Cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16haesd/cs_or_eecs_for_unit_ceiling_at_cal/,2023-09-12 19:08:13,"Hello, 

I'm considering transferring to Cal from a CCC for EECS or CS and I'm curious about the experiences of others in managing the 5-semester timeframe set by the CoE. 

Has anyone found this time limit restrictive, especially when aiming to enroll in a series of highly rated courses such as: 

\- CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory (offered by Satish Rao or Anant Sahai)

\- CS170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (by Christos Papadimitriou)

\- CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (taught by a team including Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, and Dan Klein)

\- CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning (with Johnathon Shewchuk)

\- CS161: Computer Security (Nick Weaver)

\- CS168: Networking (Scott Shenker)

\- CS186: Databases (Joe Hellerstein)

\- CS164: Programming Languages and Compilers (Paul Hilfinger)

\- CS162: Operating Systems (Ion Stoica)

\- CS184: Computer Graphics (Ren Ng)

Would it be better to apply for CS in the College of Letters since I received most of my credits through AP or dual enrollment during HS?

I would love to take all of these courses if feasible. Would it be better to consider taking some of them (if possible) or their equivalents during graduate school instead?

Thank you!","I don’t think it matters since CS is direct admit now. It seems doable in 5 semesters.
Typically you’ll want to take 2 techs a semester and transfers usually redo cs61a and Cs61C, many do 61b as well. Also, eecs16a and 16b are mandatory for EECS, so basically junior year is for lower divs. Then with three semesters left you can take 6 techs comfortably or 8/9 very uncomfortably (or using summers). There are two CCCs that can give you credit for 61C and 61B I think.
So does that mean that CS also must be completed in 5 semesters? Is it not in the College of Letters and Science?
The 5 semester ceiling is only for CoE transfer students in EECS. 

For L&S CS, you can go as many semesters as you want as long as you are under 130 units (for a single major).  In reality, it would be extremely difficult to go over say 6 semesters without going over 130 units.
No CS has a unit ceiling policy where you can keep extending if you have <= 130 units."
"Christos Papadimitriou on EECS budget: ""Mr Mogulof says the issue is complicated. It can be solved this semester by an increase in the budget that equals the cost of the Chancellor's fence ... or for the salaries of three of the 700 recently hired highly-paid non-teaching administrative employees.""",http://www.dailycal.org/2016/08/24/campus-budget-issue-prompts-concern-eecs-faculty-students-enrollment/#comment-2860247694,2016-08-25 23:13:41,,"i wish CS students would protest decreasing the TA budget
I'm always surprised by how little attention the issue of administrative bloat in the UC system has gotten during a period when class sizes and tuition keep rising. [UC Berkeley's full-time administrative staff has risen from 519 to 1281 in the last 15 years] (http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-berkeley-deficit-20160421-story.html) during a time when the size of the full-time faculty has remained relatively stagnant.

I have a very hard time believing that we need 2.5 times as many administrators to run the university as we did 15 years ago. What do these extra 700 people do that was not necessary back in 2000? Assuming a mean administrator salary of $60,000 (which is probably low-balling it), an additional 700 administrators comes out to ~$5600 per student over four years.

> Mogulof is completely false on Prof Rao. I received Rao's email and actually took the time to carefully read his research. If by ""full picture"" Mogulof means deficit regarding the massive football stadium along with other sports enhancements then that is ridiculous. Mogulof, by being dishonest, is not helping the administration's image. Prof Rao is very systematic, reserved, and logical (in fact he teaches logic in his lower div CS class). If Rao is saying something, I would believe him.

> EDIT: I do not mean to attack Mr. Mogulof as a person but rather the administration's refusal to prioritize educating its students. Professor Rao is not the only person to be saying this. Many staffers in EECS along with Professor Papadimitriou all agree that our TAS is not enough.

[EECS Professor Christos Papadimitriou](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~christos/) responded [here](http://www.dailycal.org/2016/08/24/campus-budget-issue-prompts-concern-eecs-faculty-students-enrollment/#comment-2860247694):

> Actually, Prof. Rao is, if anything, a bit too cautious and modest in his statements. To accommodate demand and serve the students, CS faculty have been teaching over the past several years nearly twice their regular load. They have developed novel techniques for scaling their classes to the size needed to serve student demand. They hire graduate and mostly undergraduate TAs who work much harder than before, and often at a fraction of the compensation, happy to help out their fellow students. And they are now stretching even further to accommodate the waiting lists, 2500 long until earlier today. The only missing ingredient is a pittance, which the administration is refusing with intrasigence.
> 
> Mr Mogulof says that the issue is complicated. Of course it is, the question is, who is complicating it? It can be solved, for this semester, by an increase in the TAS budget that equals the cost of the Chancellor's fence, or 0.4% of the tuition increase, over the past decade, of the students in the waiting lists, or for the salaries of three of the 700 recently hired highly-paid non-teaching administrative employees.

Honestly the Chancellor shouldn't live on campus. I wouldn't even want to if I was the Chancellor; give me a standard residence in the City of Berkeley where I am not at risk from vandals. Convert the building to a reception hall/historic museum type of building (it was built more than 100 years ago) and maybe the vandalism will go down. Spending 700k on a fence is god awful ridiculous when the students have real needs that need to be addressed and Berkeley's quality of education is at stake.
This is what happens when back-office personnel have more access to budget-makers than the actual students/faculty. It's easier to allocate more to get their immediate complaints off your back and just tell the people you're there to serve to make do with less.

People want the university to encapsulate every aspect of their life. From educating them, to entertaining them,  to housing them, to feeding them, to providing healthcare services, to running a free gym, to caring about their mental well being, to  preventing discrimination, to preventing crimes, etc. All of that is additional staff. Students will campaign for these increased all-encompassing resources and celebrate each additional center/office added. At the end of the day though it all adds up.
Yesterday during 170 lecture, Papad explained very well how tuition increases and enrollment increases not aligning with TAS increases is the main cause. It is very visible now, more than ever before, because of Wheeler being closed so limiting class sizes is easy for admin to do and that leads to people not getting into classes. It makes me furious because most of the time people watch lectures online anyway, so the only constraint should be TA hiring, and that is very visible now. 
The fence is dumb, but it's nothing compared to the whole budget deficit. People are scapegoating far bigger institutional problems on a dumb fence. 

Also, if the Chancellor didn't get a campus residence, this would be factored into his salary. He would probably continue being harassed at his private residence and since that's job-related UCPD would cover it. 
Oftentimes, the administration will quietly take a stance on some issue like funding, and an outspoken response from the community can shame them into recanting because they don't actually want to make a fuss.  Look at the proposed College of Chemistry dissolution -- it was just a proposed idea, but the CoC community made such a huge deal out of it and started getting into the news, so the administration dropped the idea to placate them before they started creating too much bad press.

That's really what it's all about -- bad press.  Protests generally aren't successful because they sway the administration's mind, they succeed because they paint the chancellor's office in such a bad light that they'll acquiesce just to make it stop.
/u/spectredev /u/Paradigmist More attention does help accelerate solving issues like these. Here is an update post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/50fk2y/michaeldavid_sasson_expanding_cs61a_161_162_and/)."
This is the only answer I've seen him endorse,https://i.redd.it/wgw2euv8nayx.png,2016-11-17 19:02:17,,"Jesus. Has it really gotten so competitive that people need to delete their own questions and answers on piazza? 
Yeah. This happens all the time.
huh? In my experience this never happens
Why would it be competitive in that way?  Do you lose points for asking questions?  Do other students opinions of you matter in some way?  Or are people just so afraid of looking unknowledge-able for purely personal reasons?
Bullshit. Just type ""nevermind"" into Piazza right now. Here's another example http://imgur.com/BdDg6A0

and another: http://imgur.com/a/eiJP7

and another: http://imgur.com/a/Jp1ZX

I could do this all day.
i think it's liking pulling a GSI to the side to ask a question: so you get the answer but noone else does 
I guess it's so competitive that allowing others to learn from your questions is detrimental now.  Man, I'd hate to be EECS.
I don't think people are doing that on purpose... Anyhow that didn't happen to me when I was taking 170, nor did it happen in other upper divisions like 186/168. As a matter of fact there are people (students/TAs/professors) who are always willing to help for all the classes I just mentioned.
This is not true at all, the EECS community is one of the most collaborative and helpful at Berkeley. Just look at HKN/UPE tutoring 5 days a week 9am-5pm, or guerilla sections, or CSM, or any of the other clubs, and those are just organized efforts, if you go to Soda or Cory you'll see groups working together at any time of the day, if you go on Piazza you'll see people rushing to answer other peoples' questions at any time of the day. This is a natural result of what happens when your GPA doesn't matter too much or even at all, unlike in pre-med. OP's picture is just someone being stupid. 

/somewhatdefensive
Yeah. It's that you help other people by letting them see your answer. It's not that bad though. Most answers stay up.
As someone who answers their own questions a lot on Piazza, I can confirm most of these 'neverminds' are questions whose answers are usually really stupid (e.g. forgetting to increment a counter, totally misreading the question, etc.) or the original post author was just too lazy to write out a solution when they figured it out.

I do think people aren't the best about helping others - e.g. sometimes my questions just sit there unanswered forever - but I attribute it mostly to laziness.
Of course it happened on purpose! A question isn't just 'accidentally' edited to 'Nevermind'. I don't care if you don't remember seeing it; if you were in an EECS class right now, and you typed 'nevermind', I guarantee you would find this shit.
Jesus. I don't say this often, but poor EECS majors. I can't imagine having that kind of competition.
pretty much, I don't think it's malicious like OP says
This is ridiculous. You can see all the revision history for this post including the original question.
here you go: http://imgur.com/a/wE4Lh

people actually posted what went wrong after ""nevermind""
+1, under ""Question history""
What about the first and third images I posted? The OPs in those follow-up threads get notifications whenever someone replies, and they did not help them. 
So? You said that it never happens. Showing that the opposite sometimes happens is not a valid argument.
more likely due to laziness, I do that from time to time
fair enough, I should've clarified that my argument is that it is not due to ""gotten so competitive"". Otherwise people won't actually revise their answer and provide a solution.
""I do that from time to time"" is just your testimonial. You can't say that generalizes to the EECS population
but you can...?
Ok. By that logic, I'll say, ""I don't do that from time to time"" --><-- contradiction"
