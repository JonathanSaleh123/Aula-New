Standing Out In A Graduate Application To Berkley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n45z7p/standing_out_in_a_graduate_application_to_berkley/,2021-05-03 13:09:54,"Hi guys,

I apologise if I'm not posting this in the right place but I just wanted to ask if anyone had any tips about standing out in a history graduate application? I'm from the UK and I graduated from a Russel Group university with a First Class degree in History (I think this roughly translates to a 3.8-4.0 GPA score). I've received a merit based scholarship to study a History and Politics terminal MA at the University of Missouri's Kinder Institute which begins this year.

I didn't really know much about the American university system before applying to Missouri but that specific programme was recommended to me by my undergraduate tutor. Since I've looked into things a bit more, I've fallen in love with UC Berkeley's graduate programme, particularly due to the work of Waldo E. Martin. However, I feel like my profile isn't necessarily strong enough for admittance to Berkeley. Therefore, I was just wondering if anyone had any advice about things I could do during my masters degree to improve my chances of admittance?

Thank you very much!","Begin communication with professors you’d like to be your mentor. Send a short email to potential mentors expressing genuine interest in their research and advising. PhD admissions are facilitated by faculty.  After the interview process, faculty come together and determine whether you’re fit to be in the program. You need at least 1 faculty “champion” that will be sufficiently impressed by your interviews and qualifications. This can occur during your interviews or better yet, way beforehand through emails or zoom meetings with professors before you even apply. I know several PhD students here who impressed faculty members before applying and got great suggestions on which PhD programs were better suited for them and also got them a leg up in the admissions process. I don’t know if associate or assistant professors have the same power to be your champion as a professor.
Can't help much, but one piece of advice I can give is to spell the university name correctly on the application: ""UC Berkeley""
That's great, thank you very much for your help. Would you say it's best to contact professors around September/October?
Apologise, I'll edit my post.
Great advice above. I’d note that history departments don’t usually have formal interviews, so establishing relationships with faculty during the application process can be extra important. There is tons of advice about how to do this in r/gradadmissions, though hopefully your MA advisor will be the best resource for this.

I would suggest that you find at least two professors with whom you’d like to work at any university, since folks can leave or retire. On your applications, you will want to make a strong case about your “fit” in the department, in addition to expressing your interest in the work of one specific scholar. Martin is a super senior scholar and will have lots of folks interested in working with him (if he doesn’t retire soon?? might be something to find out...); fortunately, Berkeley history is a powerhouse when it comes to Americanists. 

During your MA, get your languages in order, get some experience with a few methodologies, and start narrowing down a research agenda for your doctoral work. Sounds like you are going into your MA with a strong profile, and being intentional about training and research experience this next year will only make your application stronger! 

I did a year abroad at KCL from Berkeley (ages ago) and have only been back a few times since graduating; can’t wait to visit the UK again...
No worries! I was stressed about making that mistake myself and wouldn’t want you to send a wrong impression over something silly like that.
Thank you very much! This is really helpful. I might aim for someone a little less senior than Martin as that is a very good point. On my application is there any particular way I should show my training with certain methodologies? For example, in my undergraduate dissertation I worked quite extensively with oral testimony and with certain specific archives. Should I try to highlight in my statement that I already have experience with these sorts of methodologies and that intend to carry this experience forward with my doctoral research?

I was a bit worried about the institutions from which my degrees are/will be from not being 'prestigious' enough, so that's really nice to hear that you think my profile seems strong. 

I'm glad you enjoyed the UK! The campus of KCL is really lovely. I'm from up north and if you ever get the chance I'd recommend exploring Manchester and the Peak District or going further up to Scotland. There's some super beautiful nature spots in these areas and the cities are great!
