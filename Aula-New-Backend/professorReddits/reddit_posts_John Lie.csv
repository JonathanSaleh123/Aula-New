Why is John Perez the Chair of UC Regents when he lied about being a Berkeley grad throughout his whole career?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hp379r/why_is_john_perez_the_chair_of_uc_regents_when_he/,2020-07-10 20:33:33,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/news/amp/Assembly-Speaker-John-Perez-a-Cal-dropout-not-2371239.php,"[deleted]
I concur with OP, this is rank academic fraud. If any postgraduate program or employer found out about someone who did something like this, they would likely be fired immediately.
Unlike most regents he actually comes back to campus regularly and participates in campus discussions and listens to the issues students are facing.

He does his job, the rest do not.
lol what an irrelevant and insignificant thing to get mad over
I like how you‚Äôre willing to call out academic fraud yet advocate for financial fraud (marking off campus vs living at home) all these downvotes clearly show how people are ok with fraud as long as benefits themselves üòÇ
He dropped out because of family problems, but somewhere along his early political career lied and said he graduated with a BA; that lie was then promoted on his campaign material. I don‚Äôt think he meant for it get out of hand though. Awkward.

I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to say with him being chair of the UC Board of Regents and not a true UC grad; many regents have zero affiliation with the system and are the governor‚Äôs politics appointees. Perez himself was a state Speaker.
Expose her!!
I‚Äôm not mad. I‚Äôm just asking a question lol edit: oh it‚Äôs you.
but he is living off campus and paying rent?
Come on. He kept the lie going for 20 years.  I‚Äôm sure he dropped out because of low grades.  His career turned out well and stop spreading the lie when he had reached his goals. He might had never become speaker if he had not lied about graduating from Berkeley.
Idk doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs a snitch lol
legit tho. you phrase the question as if ""lying about being a berkeley grad"" is a make or break thing. lets overlook the fact that he probably graduated from college like 20 or 30 years ago, and that he's held office for many years, and that John Perez himself made the effort to make this correction, that he did not graduate from UC Berkeley
He literally goes around telling people ‚Äúif you live at home, check off that you‚Äôre ‚Äúoff campus‚Äù and not ‚Äúliving at home‚Äù so you get better financial aid.
dude people lie about this shit all the time... nobody cares that you lied about college if you‚Äôre good at your job. is it dishonest sure.... but david geffen forged his ucla transcripts (never even attended) and is one of their biggest donors.
Not snitching rewards corruption
It took him 20 years to correct himself....

Edit: copy pasta.  Come on. He kept the lie going for 20 years.  I‚Äôm sure he dropped out because of low grades.  His career turned out well and stop spreading the lie when he had reached his goals. He might had never become speaker if he had not lied about graduating from Berkeley.
Some people (especially those from low income families that usually are on financial aid) have to support their families at home. Just because someone isn't living on their own doesn't mean they don't have living expenses. And during this time of massive economic instability where millions have lost their jobs, that difference in financial aid can save a family from going homeless or starving. Lastly, our school has made statements recently supporting the idea that they will financially support students living off campus regardless of where you live, and have even said to put off campus housing to ensure you get aid. You should not get all riled up at someone whose living situation you know nothing about. Worry about yourself.
What‚Äôs the point of going to college then if anyone can just lie they attended Berkeley or UCLA? lol
They don‚Äôt want to see the people succeed...
im sorry, i dont see a time travel machine lying around do u? yeah 20 years is a long time but at least he had the courage to do it.

and anyways ""took 20 years to correct himself"" = 2011. it's been a while. why do want to defame this person for some small slight. it matters 0. why do you care
i mean i agree with that. i‚Äôve questioned spending 4 years going to college just because that‚Äôs what i was told to do (by parents, ‚Äúsociety‚Äù, friends etc)

For jobs that do require a degree, like stem related stuff it makes sense. but for politics/entertainment etc. nobody gives a shit. it‚Äôs like don draper in mad men when he gets called out and his boss doesn‚Äôt care

Edit: i‚Äôm also not advocating one way or another for the people who are upset....just pointing out that this happens and most business don‚Äôt care...

You're not factually incorrect; most politicians, managers, etc. don't really use anything they may have studied in college. I don't know enough about this situation to make judgement on whether he deserves his job, but regardless of whether or not it affects his job performance, it's understandable that people would be upset by this. To those that work hard to earn a degree, lying about it feels like a slap in the face, let alone taking a job that makes choices impacting those same students.
you are nitpicking over the semantics of what word i decided to use rather than any of the main points that i made

i'm not even arguing whether or not what OP is doing is legal, so why did you interpret my use of ""defamation"" with the legal definition?
[deleted]
techniques exist to make the truth look good or bad. let me ask, which sounds better: ""John Perez, the Chair of UC Regents"" or ""John Perez, the guy who lied about being a Berkeley grad throughout his whole career""

here's another example from OP themselves. ""I‚Äôm sure he dropped out because of low grades."" technically the truth bc this is what OP is thinking. here's an example from you. ""If it's not a big deal, then he shouldn't be ashamed of it."" this is a true statement, but who said that Perez is ashamed of it? where did you get that?

if you want to talk ""factual information"" then OP is the one lying because Perez himself came forward and made the effort to correct this. 

yes, lying in general is a bad thing, but generalizations lack context and because they're so general they mean very little. in this specific case the way Perez conducted himself is not fucked up, so this ""crime"" is not a big deal. he lied in 1990 ish, came clean in like 2011 or so, and started leading a university system in 2019. do you believe that people can reform, given enough time?"

International Christian Church and Shincheonji Activity at UC Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/lv38tt/international_christian_church_and_shincheonji/,2021-02-28 23:45:02,"(Edited and updated. This is a very long post, but it has very important information regarding the International Christian Church-affiliated Disciples Reaching and Evangelizing All Mankind (DREAM) ministry and various Shincheonji-affiliated ministries and groups, such as NorCal Missions, that are active at UC Berkeley and other campuses across the Bay Area and nearby regions. I decided to only keep this post and delete to separate versions where I only talk about the International Christian Church activity at UC Berkeley in one post and about Shincheonji activity at UC Berkeley in the other post.) 

Currently there is a campus ministry affiliated with the International Christian Church (ICC) (a cult that split off from the International Church of Christ (ICOC) and which has a chapter in the SF Bay Area known as the SF Bay International Christian Church (SFBICC)) called Disciples Reaching and Evangelizing All Mankind (DREAM) recruiting people at UC Berkeley and within the San Francisco Bay Area. The ICC also has other campus ministries at other colleges and universities, whether it goes by DREAM or by another name such as Soaring Eagles. They have been active at UC Berkeley for several years and are still active today. One way to identify DREAM or other ICC-affiliated campus ministries and groups is if the recruiters tell people they can't be Christian or be saved until they disciple anyone, give up certain things, follow and obey all the teachings of Jesus, and be baptized into the ICC. Also, ICC-affiliated ministries and groups like DREAM will have one-way Bible studies (members teaching things to recruits) and ICC members will take notes and give them to the recruits at the end of each Bible study lesson. The ICC is led by Kip McKean, and its Bible studies use a book by him called ""First Principles."" ICC groups may call their Bible studies ""Bible talks.""

Another cult that claims to be Christian, which is more secretive and initially less aggressive than the ICC, is Shincheonji (SCJ). Shincheonji has also been active at UC Berkeley for a few years and is still active at UC Berkeley, as well as at other colleges and universities within the San Francisco Bay Area and nearby areas. Shincheonji recruiters will not initially reveal the name of their campus ministry or group to anyone until they have progressed in the Bible studies with SCJ. SCJ recruiters will also not tell anyone what church or denomination they're affiliated with until one has completed all the lessons with SCJ. There are several ways to identify SCJ-affiliated groups:

\- The Bible studies begin with introductory lessons, followed by small class lessons (lasts about 6 to 9 months), followed by large class lessons (lasts about 1 year)

\- The Bible lessons mention about ""history, moral teaching/instruction, prophecy, fulfillment""

\- In some of the later lessons (though I never got that far but I learned about it in my research on SCJ), teachers and leaders will usually tell students not to tell anyone outside the group about the lessons or about the group itself

\- The Bible lessons are heavy on parables and on the knowledge and understanding of parables, and teach that one must know and understand the parables to receive salvation, as well as teaching about ""the Language of Heaven"", meaning parables, and teach about secret knowledge

\- Bible lessons are in classroom format, with teachers and students. The teachers will occasionally use whiteboards or pieces of paper to write notes and draw pictures of what they're teaching. The Bible lessons will generally be in one direction only (teacher to student)

\- Notes are to be taken, but only through handwriting. Taking pictures of what's on the whiteboard or the piece of paper is forbidden. One also can only use a physical copy of the Bible

\- ""Hand clapping for God"" at the end of each Bible lesson is a custom everyone must do at the end of the closing prayer

\- Bible lessons talk heavily and frequently about spiritual harvests, spiritual food, fields, birds, vines, among other things

\- In later Bible lessons, there will be more weird unbiblical teachings, such as teachings about the ""Promised Pastor"" and about the ""New John."" These two terms refer to the leader and founder of Shincheonji, Manhee Lee. Additionally, they will also teach later on when one goes further in the Bible studies that lying is okay under circumstances and take various Bible verses out of context to justify lying, despite the fact that the Bible clearly teaches that lying is a sin (I never got to this point when I studied the Bible with Shincheonji members, but this is based on my research on Shincheonji and its affiliated groups after I left NorCal Missions, which is the current name for one of SCJ's groups in the Bay Area and nearby regions)

\- The Bible study group teaches that one cannot be sure of their faith or that they were truly saved until they do everything Jesus tells people to do in Scripture, according to what the Bible study group teaches, in addition to knowing and understanding all the parables

\- Teachers and leaders don't let any student learn most Bible lessons individually nor do they explain certain lessons to students individually because they say the lessons can only be taught in the small class or the large class

\- Discussions and questions about the Bible or any theological concept are generally discouraged or even forbidden unless if the student agrees with what the teacher tells them. Otherwise, the teachers may accuse students of stirring up doubt or of wanting to argue or debate with them, or they might stop talking to those students

Additionally, SCJ-affiliated groups will occasionally change their names to avoid being exposed as being affiliated with SCJ or once those groups have been exposed as being affiliated with SCJ. Shincheonji in the Bay Area and nearby regions have a church or mission center called the San Francisco Zion Church. Within the Bay Area, SCJ groups are known as NorCal Missions and True Vine SF, and SCJ also runs a website called Bible Study For All. Other names that various SCJ-affiliated groups went by in the Bay Area and nearby regions include Ignite Ministry, True Vine Ministries, Religare, Global Light, Revive Sacramento, Zion Missionary, and Christians of NorCal. One other group in the Bay Area that I found out online that I suspect was another SCJ group is Revival SJSU.

Currently cults such as Shincheonji and the ICC are recruiting UC Berkeley students, alumni, faculty, and staff through Instagram and other social media platforms due to the COVID pandemic and restrictions and all other activities are online due to the pandemic and restrictions. They especially target Christians, and have been trying to recruit people from Intervarsity, Cru, Bridges International, the Newman Hall, and other campus ministries. In addition, these two cults, along with several other cults in the Bay Area and nearby areas, are also recruiting people who are neither students, alumni, faculty, nor staff of UC Berkeley within the Bay Area and nearby areas, in person and online. Shincheonji members in the United States are also recruiting people from other parts of the US and from other countries through Instagram, as I have observed.

If you are studying the Bible with an SCJ-affiliated group such as NorCal Missions or with an ICC-affiliated group such as DREAM, quickly leave that group and encourage anyone in an SCJ-affiliated group or an ICC-affiliated group including those you know to leave that group. Like DREAM and other ICC-affiliated Bible study groups, Shincheonji-affiliated groups such as NorCal Missions are not healthy Bible study groups for anyone, whether or not they're Christian, and they will not help Christians grow in their faith in God.

Manipulation, control of people's lives, sleep deprivation, gaslighting, deception, dishonesty such as lying, and unquestioned obedience to leaders are all present within the ICC and Shincheonji.","Great advice. Definitely would caution Christians or people interested in Christianity about DREAM. Baptismal regeneration is heresy denied by the Christian Protestant faith. I also had a friend who had their faith shaken by DREAM through their one-on-one ""studies"" so please be wary. DREAM does NOT represent the Protestant Christian faith!
yo, do you got a tldr?

For new students, pro tip: a quick test to tell if a Christian fellowship is solid is if they are a member of Unity in Christ, which is the organization that represents Christian fellowships at Cal. This group has representatives from all the major Protestant fellowships on campus, and UiC checks member organizations for good doctrine, practice, etc. :) if you're Catholic, check out Newman Hall, the parish at Berkeley.
I was approached by DREAM ministry at the end of August 2020 near Sproul. They seemed like a kind group of gals and I was looking for a new church group. I had previously been a part of Klesis (which is a part of the Gracepoint church), but my parents found some VERY troubling information online and were worried they had cult-like tendencies. I even mentioned this briefly to the girls and they seemed to understand how it can be hard to find the right ministry at college. Anyways, I agreed to attend a Bible study and was excited to join a new group. The zoom Bible study started off with a member sharing a VERY personal story about familial loss and mental health struggles. She then went on to explain how joining the DREAM ministry and becoming a Christian helped her mental health issues completely go away. This story kind of worried me, as I am a Christian who believes mental illnesses are real and scientifically proven. However I tried to remain nonjudgemental since she didn‚Äôt necessarily say being Christian is the cure to mental illnesses as a whole. As the meeting went on I quickly learned that this group would not be the right fit. They only wanted to discuss sin and asked me to give my interpretations of various scriptures. Most of the scriptures were straight forward but they tried to tell me my interpretations were wrong and then would repeat what I had just said. When I told them I wanted to join a youth group to better my biblical knowledge they essentially rebuked me and said I‚Äôm not a Christian due to my imperfect Bible knowledge. At the end they asked to schedule another Bible study 2 days later. I ended up deciding to not move further with their ministry and told them I would be pursuing another church on campus. However, the SAME group of girls approached me over 5 times throughout 2020-2021 near Sproul. When I told them I had already talked with them or that I already have a church they were still incessant. One of my friends who is Hindu was approached by the same group. They were extremely rude and completely disrespected her religion without any shame, despite the fact that my friend was being very polite. I hope this group will not be allowed to subject further Berkeley students to their extreme views
https://youtu.be/WboggjN_G-4
I actually had a conversation about someone from the DREAM Ministry by Sproul. He told me that you don't have to be a member of ICC to be a saved Christian and that it's a lie made up about them. Haven't heard of Shincheonji, but ICC didn't seem like a cult as opposed to just taking the Bible seriously.

I looked at their statement of faith at [http://sfbicc.org/](http://sfbicc.org/) and there doesn't seem to be anything more than basic Bible principles. If the OP or anyone else has experience about them claiming to be exclusively saved or anything else against the Bible I would love to know. Or, if anyone has any info about unbiblical or extra-biblical practices they do which aren't mentioned on their website I wold love to know.

u/Seeker-of-Christ
I've been a part of the ICC for about 2 months now and I've only experienced love and friendship. I've judged them harshly because I've heard of them being a ""cult"" but I've still found no sound reason to leave.

I will definitely leave though if I see unbiblical teachings.
I had my faith shaken while I was studying with DREAM, as well as with NorCal Missions, and I would like to say that Shincheonji groups like NorCal Missions, Ignite Ministry, and Christians of NorCal do not represent the Protestant Christian faith either. I believe it's also important to warn people about Shincheonji affiliated groups besides warning people about DREAM, as I'm concerned not as many Christians or others are aware about Shincheonji as much as they're aware of DREAM and the ICC. Shincheonji groups are generally more secretive about themselves and don't initially reveal their names or who they're really affiliated with until one has completed their Bible study lessons
Nooooo not Heresy!!!
There are ""Christian"" groups that exist on campus that have dangerous, cult-like recruitment and teaching practices. If you are interested in joining a campus ministry group, do not join these ones, joint other ones that are better.
Same yeah. Don‚Äôt quite get what‚Äôs going on lol
While this post may be very long, the post has some very important information about the ICC and Shincheonji, because there are various cults at UC Berkeley and other SF Bay Area colleges and universities including those that claim to be Christian. ICC and Shincheonji are one of those cults that claim to be Christian, and they have successfully recruited some university students including UC Berkeley students and brainwashed them. I was being recruited into both the ICC and Shincheonji by their respective members until I realized their Bible study groups were not Christian at all, and learned that they were part of two different cults
I don't know anything about Christians on Campus, except the fact that they work with other campus ministries at other universities and colleges, such as Christian Students at SFSU. I actually checked out Bible studies with CS at SFSU in person back in 2019 and online in 2020. In 2020, when I went on the Zoom call with members of CS at SFSU to study the Bible, I noticed that they had a very weird way of praying where they rocked their heads back and forth. I spoke with some people who studied with CS at SFSU and they told me the group had unbiblical teachings and followed the teachings of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, and that CS at SFSU was affiliated with a church called the Church in San Francisco on 19th Ave. They also said that the church itself believed that there should be only one church in every city and that one has to get baptized into their church to be saved. I quickly left CS at SFSU, but I don't know much about it to know whether or not it's part of a cult or is unbiblical. Is Christians on Campus similar to Christian Students at SFSU, and did you notice anything like manipulation, unquestioned obedience to the leader(s), cutting off contact with people outside Christians on Campus and the church it's affiliated with, or any other characteristics of a cult?
Hey, I would be glad to show some extra-biblical stances they have! Namely, the fact that they add human works into salvation. The Protestant faith has long denied that baptism is necessary for salvation, but the ICC strongly affirms this. Adding to the finished work of Christ is heresy. Although it's subtle, if you look at their Statement of Faith, namely their stance on salvation, they quietly add the condition that one must be baptized to be saved.
DREAM people will not actually tell you what they actually believe when they're recruiting people, until one progresses in the Bible studies with DREAM. Furthermore, when I tried to refute some ICC teachings when I studied the Bible with DREAM, one of the members seemed to agree at me first, but then I noticed he was being dishonest. Some other people who studied with DREAM and who I talked to also said that they experienced lying from DREAM members and were told by DREAM members to be baptized with the ICC or else they'll go to Hell. 

The ICC and Shincheonji are both not very clear in how they describe themselves and what they say they believe on their websites. Whatever they say they believe on their websites isn't necessarily what they actually teach.

Can you give an update?
I would agree. I studied the Bible with a Bible study group online that I wasn't aware of its name until I got an email from them saying I was waitlisted for a large class. I learned it was called NorCal Missions (the current name for one of SCJ's affiliated groups). When I left NorCal Missions I learned that they were affiliated with Shincheonji after researching on SCJ and comparing NCM to SCJ. I also studied the Bible with DREAM but quickly left after I saw its aggressive nature, found one of their teachings to be unbiblical, and I learned that it was affiliated with the ICC cult. I also believe it's a good idea to join a church-based Bible study group at a healthy, biblically sound church, besides joining a healthy campus ministry group

I know my Bible decently well and I am well aware that there are a plethora of versus which say baptism is necessary for the forgiveness of sins, which I understood before attending Cal. There are some which say believing is necessary, some which say repenting is necessary, some which say Baptism is necessary, and some which say all or one of those is necessary. Reading the Bible after a while I understood that one isn't incorrect and the other correct, but they are all correct. I don't agree that ""the Protestant faith"" has long denied baptism for salvation because there are many churches that believe Acts 2:38, Mark 16:16 (from Jesus' mouth) and many others. Paul said he had to be baptized to wash away his sins. At the end of the day it's the first command for Christians so there's not really any question about whether baptism should be done at all. Now I'm not trying to debate here, but simply make it clear that the Bible *does* say in multiple accounts that baptism is necessary to wash away sins, especially in context. It says that Baptism is not a work of man, but a work of God. That's why I see ICC as simply a group dedicated to following the Bible.

I eventually decided not to be a part of them because they seemed to be overly cautious regarding sexuality and dating for their own sakes. Such as the fact that they will never permit any man to be alone with any woman unless they are married. This isn't in the Bible, and they admitted to me that it in itself wasn't a sin, but they hold this for the sake of their own temptations. I didn't need that however, because I can perfectly well spend time with a girl as just a friend without temptation, and in fact imo it fosters an unhealthy mentality of women being a ""forbidden fruit"" in my view so I decided they weren't the best for me.
They follow the guidelines laid out for salvation but dont limit it as the only way.

God can do save anyone anyway, but it does literally say in acts to: ""repent, be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins; then you will be filled with the Holy Spirit.""
Honestly, it's been the best decision I've ever made. The people are so loving and kind. They want to see you grow spiritually. I haven't found anything taught that is unbiblical. I love my church a ton.

I regret nothing. :)

Maybe I should define the term ""Protestant"" more, in which I mean Christianity that broke away from the RCC during the Reformation. I am aware that the RCC still affirms baptismal salvation, and although the Protestant faith is quite diverse, very few would affirm that baptism is mandatory for salvation. I respect how you said you're not trying to debate, but I would like to add some of my thoughts.

I will not deny that baptism is an important ordinance, commanded by God. If you profess to be a follower of Christ, you should seek baptism. However, the physical immersion into water has no saving properties. Paul in Romans 6 mentions that all who were baptized into Christ Jesus are dead to their old ways and raised to walk in the newness of life in the Spirit. Paul is not talking about an immersion in water, but an immersion in Christ (baptism literally means immersion in Greek). Just being baptized in water does not make you dead to your sin. One needs a spiritual baptism, conferred only by God, to be saved. Even the ever so popular 1 Peter 3:21 says it's not the physical act (""removal of dirt from the body"") that saves but the appeal for a good conscience, which is done before water baptism by the Spirit causing belief in an unregenerate heart. Peter ties in baptism to salvation because the two are very related, but Peter clarifies by saying it is not the act but the heart behind baptism that saves.

Even in Matthew 3, John the Baptist preaches a water baptism for repentance, but he acknowledges that it is Christ who baptizes with the saving Holy Spirit. When Christ was baptized, it was not that He needed it to be saved, but that it was to fulfill all righteousness, that He would be identified with His people, to be amongst those who did need repentance. It was an outward display, followed by another outward display of the Spirit recognizing Christ. Christ has already established that baptism is an outward display of obedience. 

This is obviously a point of contention that has existed for a long time. Although the RCC may affirm the necessity of baptism in salvation, I think you'll find that the majority of the Protestant faith denounces it being a part of salvation, but as an outward display of obedience after one has already been saved by grace and grace alone. Sola Gratia is a foundation that the Reformers have fought tooth and nail for, and I believe it is good to recognize this if one considers themselves a Protestant. I'll end with the classic John 3:16 ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.""
Hey how‚Äôs it going so far? I‚Äôm thinking about getting with the ICC.
When I was referring to Paul I meant Acts 22:16. 

I see what you are saying, which is why at the end of the day it's most important for all true Christians to simply follow Jesus's command and be baptized, regardless of our beliefs on the technicalities.

But it's also easy to see how ICC can take a stance regarding baptism which the Bible is seemingly clear on to many other people as well. I am eager to hear what other people's experiences are with them and if they have been manipulative or pressuring in any way for someone to do something involuntarily. It just didn't sit right with me that the OP is a brand new account made to bash other groups and ""cult-label"" when my experience with them has been everything but the opposite (the ICC @ Cal, I have no experience with the other one).
Best decision of my life. I love the people so much."

My investigation yielded some shocking results, there is much more to these protests than can be seen at first glance. This might sound crazy at first but stick through to the end and trust me. These protests and the ensuing fight did not small organic locally organized movement but one of international conspiratorial origins. There are big players in the world who want to interfere in our politics, beliefs and lives. They don't care about us or anything other than making sure their beliefs and ideologies ""win."" This protest and clash was simply a battle in their war to spread their ideologies and beliefs further down our throats. They want us to accept their viewpoint and disregard everything else. 

Not just that, I have another shocking revelation that I have discovered. I'm fairly confident that the university itself is in on this. They have been spreading this ideology for many years by radicalizing these young and malleable people by disseminating unethical concepts and beliefs that have caused this situation. The most shocking revelation I have uncovered is that these protests are not caused by the people you might have heard before. I believe that it was not caused by George Soros, Charles Koch, President Trump, **John Oliver**, Steve Bannon, Jorge Ramos, Milo, Anderson Cooper, The Illuminati, The **Easter Bunny Spicer** or Shia LeBeouf.

The real people manipulating the media and society to help push, create and encourage protests like this weekends and future ones? **PepsiCo.** 

Now, this might be confusing for you. Why would PepsiCo want to be a part of doing such crazy acts? And how the hell has the university been working with this corporation? Continue reading to further understand the truth.

Pepsi is the official drink of UC Berkeley. In 2011 the company and the the university [signed a ten year deal to sell Pepsi products on campus.](http://www.dailycal.org/2011/08/21/campus-signs-letter-of-intent-for-new-pepsi-beverage-contract/)[ Pepsi paid for this dirty deal with the univerity with a measly 15k a year in donations for ""sustainability.""](https://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/beverage2.pdf) As we all know **Daddy Dirks** is an amoral neoliberal shill. After joining as Chancellor in 2012, and noticing that we were in bed with Big Soda. Thinking that simply spreading our legs wasn't enough, he wanted to let them take our cornhole. He came in during a period terrible budget shortfalls. The UC system was put in a tough spot with the state cutting funds and so they turned to alternative avenues to find funds. They tried all sorts of paths, including attempting a secret plan to take the public universities private. See [columns like this in the Daily Cal](http://www.dailycal.org/2012/04/23/who-said-privatization-was-bad/) in an attempt to try to sell the idea of corporate (Pepsi) takeover of the UC system as a smart idea. [Their botched attempt to make a corporate logo.](http://www.aiga.org/the-uc-logo-controversy)

They chose to cut a secret deal with their already strong sponsor Pepsi to try to close the funding/budget gap. The deal was to subliminally manipulate and spread Pepsi's message to all students and general Berkeley residents. Dirks is the person who was able to run away with our public funds. You think if he was able to brainwash the UC Regents and the IRS he wouldn't be able to do the same to us? Wake up sheeple! Cal's most recent marketing hashtag is #InThisGen. Pepsi's most famous slogan? The Choice of a New Generation. There are no such things as coincidences. 

Pepsi's interest in this is to take global market share from Coca-Cola. Being #2 for so long has been rough on the company culture and morale. The current CEO is [**Indra Nooyi**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Indra_Nooyi) a person with esteemed credentials, but like Pepsi, are from the number two private university. (Yale) not the best causing her to always strive for number one. She decided, along with the rest of the PepsiCo board to push forward an ambitious plan to change the world as we know it. 

Pepsi knows that everything is advertising. Modern culture is dependent on the intersection of two things, place and people. For place, everyone looks to **America** to dictate the world's culture. America looks to California to dictate the country's culture. For people everyone looks to the young since they're the most important group there is. Where are large groups of young people located in California? **Universities**. PepsiCo believed if they took over California Universities they could overtake the world. In 2014 [Pepsi signed a deal with UC Davis.](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/pepsi-deal-bring-10-million-university/) In 2015 they [took over USC.](http://www.dailygamecock.com/article/2015/08/pepsi-wins-usc-dining-contract) 

PepsiCo deliberately released the **Kendall Jenner** ad last week because they knew people would be outraged. They times the releasing of the ad so that enough time would pass that people would get the pop culture reference it would still be quite apparent in their minds. They timed it so that it would all come to head at protests this weekend. They spread their **message** because of the ensuing publicity. From now on, whenever protests occur their brand will be associated. The reason they chose to release this in time for the Berkeley protests? 

Even though Pepsi was gaining a stronghold in California and our state's universities, our residents strongly fought back. Berkeley fought against big soda and won. [The soda tax was passed in **2014** and in 2016 proved that big soda was wrong.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/23/491104093/berkeleys-soda-tax-appears-to-cut-consumption-of-sugary-drinks) They saw that their allies, neoliberal shill Dirks, California, and Berkeley were turning their backs on them in favor of more righteous progressive agenda's and enacted an attempt of malicious revenge. Think how people were wondering if there were paid protestors? THEY WERE RIGHT! Just that these people were paid for by PepsiCo. It's definitive.

[This piece of high quality independent journalism is the kind this country and world needs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u3uhKxNPNg&feature=youtu.be) This piece of independent journalism shows how even in a time with the country so divided on what we can believe and what we cannot because of biased and lying media, we can count on ordinary citizens documenting and showing us the truth. An **inspiration** showing us the journalism of the future.

That said, watch it twice if you don't catch the bias in there. Though on first watch the video might seem like a fully independent citizen journalist documenting **the facts**, he has actually been advertising for Pepsi the whole time! Pepsi has attempted to take over the last bastion of our democracy. The integrity of all independent citizen journalists are now under attack. It is even possible that after watching the ad he himself has been brainwashed into advertising for Pepsi without knowing it. Kendall Jenner implanted subliminal messaging into his skull! The horror! 

Knowing that there will be protests in Berkeley and elsewhere for the next couple of years they have positioned themselves in a very profitable position. They are encouraging these events that undermine our democracy and way of life in an effort to sell us sweet soft drinks. PepsiCo has been planning and playing fourth dimensional chess similarly t how our president played **7th** dimensional chess and won himself the presidency. Wake up sheeple! Don't fall for Big Soda's game! If we do not wake up in time our entire way of life and world might burn because of big soda's greed!

How do we know that you're not a Pepsi shill
Submit this as an opinion piece to the Daily Cal, or at the very least the Daily Clog.
