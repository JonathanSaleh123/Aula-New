8-hr TA positions to be reinstated temporarily for 2020-21 school year with 29% of full GSI Fee Remission,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fstbw0/8hr_ta_positions_to_be_reinstated_temporarily_for/,2020-03-31 22:18:03,"Here's the text of the email that was recently sent:

""Dear Students,

We are writing to update you on our ongoing conversations about implementation of the recent arbitration decision regarding tuition and fee remission for undergraduate GSIs. As many of you know, the EECS and Statistics Departments have undergone massive increases in their teaching loads over the past few years. In response, the Departments implemented a teaching model that relied heavily on 20% FTE UGSIs (20% FTE means 8 hours per week). An independent arbitrator for the grievance filed by UAW 2865 – the Union of 19,000 GSIs, readers, and tutors at UC – decided that the University had violated the UC-UAW 2865 Collective Bargaining Agreement by not providing tuition and fee remission to these UGSIs, and that all EECS and Data Science UGSIs were to receive tuition and fee remissions moving forward.

In working together to implement this decision in ways that potentially mitigate disruptions to the EECS and Data Science programs, the Union, the EECS Department, Statistics Department, and Data Science Education Program (DSEP) have come to a resolution for the 2020-2021 academic year. As much as possible, the Departments and DSEP will continue their current hiring practice, which includes hiring many undergraduate students into 20% FTE UGSI positions. Those who are hired into these 20% FTE UGSI positions in the next academic year (2020-21) will receive a partial tuition and fee remission equivalent to 29% of the full tuition and fee remission typically granted to GSIs. This agreement is a temporary, one-year measure intended to give the Departments and DSEP more time to implement full fee remission for UGSIs and secure greater resources for UGSI and GSI positions in future academic years.

We look forward to continuing to work together to ensure that all Academic Student Employees have their contractually-mandated pay and benefits and that the Departments and DSEP have adequate resources to fund the GSIs, readers, and tutors who are critical to its teaching mission. To that end, the Union, Departments and DSEP will continue working together to advocate at multiple levels to ensure we have the funding needed to continue to support undergraduate education into the future.

Sincerely,

Jeffrey Bokor EECS, Department Chair

interested to hear how they'll change things after the upcoming year though
nice. Could this mean that the CS gpa cap is not going up for the class of 24?
Exactly!!! I wish they would understand this.
how do more ta positions affect the gpa cut-off?
how do ta positions affect the gpa cutoff?
Probably indirectly. The more TAs they can rely on to take on instruction, the fewer students they need to filter out with high GPA cut-offs.
Less TA's means that they can teach less kids, which would mean they have to let less kids into the program. People are speculating harsher grade cutoffs, rather than a higher GPA cutoff though."
