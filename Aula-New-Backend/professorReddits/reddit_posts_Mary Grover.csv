Is it a bad idea to take an online course during the school year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vusfn8/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_take_an_online_course_during/,2022-07-08 20:26:06,"There's a college writing course for my R&C Part A requirement that seems cool but is only online (College Writing R1A, by Mary Grover). Online classes were sketchy at my high school, is it the same here? Also is there anywhere on campus where I can participate in online courses so that I don't have to walk back to my dorm in Clark Kerr?","Depends how you do in online classes. Personally I can’t pay attention if I do it online. I have to be engaged and inside the environment so I opt for in person classes.
i haven’t found a cafe w good wifi. if you are just listening you can go to a library but if you have to speak no where on campus that i’ve been too has been good.
Are you in L&S? Do you know you can take online classes at the same time in any community college? CC online classes are relatively easy and only has an essay as a final, and it's asynchronous.
Just based on my years of having to deal with global video meetings in lieu of actual get-togethers, the type of class that would be bad for online would be those that needed a lot of white boarding interaction amongst teacher AND students. Other than that, I think that most classes are generally ok online as long as you can be engaged 100%, have good internet connectivity, and have a quiet place free of distractions where you can talk.  Which one or all 3 can be problematic for a college student.
Awesome thanks!
Rip, but thanks!
No I'm in engineering, thanks though. It's just that the topic seems interesting and I like the book list, I'm not super set on this particular class.
Thanks! And happy cake day!"
