Good prof’s may have a higher grade average
I took this class! Was pretty interesting material and just a few essays. Grades were very fair."

DEMOG C126 or HIST 100D,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pg3fsh/demog_c126_or_hist_100d/,2021-09-01 14:23:42,Does anyone know which class is less work? Just got off the waitlist for DEMOG C126 with Ryan Edwards. I'm also in HIST 100D with Sandra Eder. Not sure which class to stay in. If anyone has taken either one of these classes let me know.,
