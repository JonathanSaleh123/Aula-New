"Berkeley children will no longer be toting home fish—such as goldfish or betta fish—as carnival prizes because of new legislation passed by City Council. Inspired by a PETA investigation, Simone Stevens, a high school student and former intern for Councilmember Kriss Worthington, proposed the idea.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/22/full-scale-reform-berkeley-bans-fish-as-prizes-at-carnivals/,2017-10-23 23:38:04,,"Educate people on how to handle fish, and why its important to care for animals OR use state violence to limit individual freedom in strange ways by now requiring police inspect carnivals for fish. whew! They made the right choice.

Mass incarceration is evil, but also, we need to criminalize more things.
I'm interested to hear your thoughts on the recent CA legislation that aims to ban puppy mill dogs from being sold in pet stores. I love animals myself and I like to think that the fish in this case (and dogs following the CA bill) will have somewhat more of a shot at a quality life as a result, but I'm trying to mediate my optimism a little bit and can see why other people might think of these measures as infringing on freedoms. 
Goldfish and Betta fish, particularly the goldies, really do suffer as a result of improper captivity conditions. I think it's also pretty easy to see that puppy mills are not good for dogs.

That said, this legislation is absolutely ineffective at solving any tangible problems. This is literally ""dummy legislation."" As the guy above you said, there are basically 2 possibilities that could arise from this:

1) Berkeley sends out cops/regulators to inspect carnivals for ""contraband goldfish""

2) This bill goes completely unenforced because the cost of doing option 1 is too much to be worth it

I'm leaning towards option 2 as the most likely outcome. I'm not worried about a police state here, and it's a little silly to call the sale of goldfish an ""individual freedom."" 

But what worries me about this is that the city of Berkeley is patting themselves on the back for wasting everyone's time and accomplishing nothing. There are 225 cities in the US bigger than Berkeley, and thousands more with a more established county fair. Each one of those cities is completely unaffected by this. I get that the Berkeley municipal gov't can only set laws for the city of Berkeley.... But cmon Berkeley isn't exactly setting any sort precedent here, that would be laughable. I mean, it's fucking Berkeley, how many fucking carnivals do we have here? How is this at all supposed to make other communities look at us as ""model legislation."" This bill is pointless as fuck and it's sad that the legislature feels like it accomplished something with this.

 What would have been better? How about setting up a statewide petition to increase to discussion for a ban? Or even better, and short of a ban (bans never work, see: Sharkfin soup in Chinatown), how about just educating people on how to properly care for their fish? How about creating a market incentive for carnivals to stop using fish as prizes? There are so many options out there. Berkeley didn't consider them, and looks stupid for so.

Of course, as a mammal, I empathize alot more with the dogs than fish. I think how industrial society treats animals is horrifying. 

There are two proposed solutions, neither of which is awesome:

1. ) Use government. Make things illegal. Enforce them.

Or

2.) Use culture. Make things socially unacceptable. Use Peer Pressure and public mores.

The problem with 1 is that its expensive. You have to have cops / inspectors / bureaucrats in peoples homes, barnes, pet stores to make sure laws are being followed. Also, human suffering has to be inflicted when people don't comply. As part of a larger program of enforcing morality, this result is curtailing of individual freedom, and mass incarceration, disproportionately of the poor, and of minorities. Using government this way becomes easier the more centralized production and consumption becomes. IE. With one pet store chain, Pet Co. , its easier to monitor dog living conditions than with individual breeders. 

2 has a different set of challenges. While few people would agree abusing an animal is moral, capitalism is well suited to hiding abuses behind a price tag. The premise of capitalism is that everything we need to determine weather to buy or not is implicit in price tag. However, are ability to socially regulate requires information outside the price tag. So social regulation is harder. But, I think social regulation doesn't require bringing government into everyday life, or mass incarceration. Ultimately, cultural change is harder to effect than law, but infinitely easier to enforce - you don't need to. 

My solution is to make public the abuses of puppy mill companies, and educate people on how to handle dogs/ where to acquire dogs, and how people are treating dogs.

Yep! I think you outlined your points very clearly. Hopefully, people will learn to take better care of their fishy friends. I remember my high school teacher giving me the goldfish that were ""abandoned"" by students after the school carnival--they're still going strong!! Thanks for the thoughtful response.
>they're still going strong!!

That's awesome! Fish are supposed to have good long lives, it's just most of the time people don't take proper care of them, so they die very quickly and people just assume that they're ""disposable pets."" It's awesome that yours found their way to the right person :)"
"In the past two months, Berkeley City Council agenda saw two proposals that grabbed the community's attention — one to prohibit the use of fish as carnival prizes and another to legalize the display of female breasts — both devised by high school senior and Kriss Worthington's intern Simone Stevens.",http://www.dailycal.org/2017/10/29/bigger-city-lines-simone-stevens-high-school-senior-behind-free-nipple-proposal-berkeley/,2017-10-30 22:07:16,,"I'm all for legal boobs, but I won a goldfish as a carnival prize when I was a kid and it lived for like 6 years. Boo fish ban!
Can't wait to see nasty tweaker chicks walking around topless all summer. Will really add to the flavor of Berkeley.
As if homeless people needed more reason to be a public nuisance
In response to a number of the posts here, I really don't think its about whether the boobs are to your liking. That's almost entirely beside the point.
You *think* you're all for legal boobs. What you don't realize is the *quality* of the boobs you'll be seeing on a regular basis. 
are boobs gonna be a nuisance? 
Hey man I went to the Dore Alley festival this year. You wanna talk about some saggy boobs. Wow.... 

That festival is like 90% men, but the women who let it all hang out, really let it ALL HANG OUT... 
No, he means the homeless fish "
