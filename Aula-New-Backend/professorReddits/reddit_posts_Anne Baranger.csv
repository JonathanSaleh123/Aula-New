Chemistry 135 or mcb 102,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/osxfsd/chemistry_135_or_mcb_102/,2021-07-27 16:03:17,"Hi! I’m having a really hard time deciding between these two classes to satisfy my bio chem requirement. Heard bad things about mcb 102 and someone suggested I take chem 135 instead who is taught by Anne baranger. I was just curious if anyone who has taken either or both has any insight on difficulty, workload, and grading for either class? Thank you veso much!","The general advice on this is take 135 if you’re better at/enjoy ochem/mechanism stuff, and 102 if you prefer memorization. Good luck!
I'm taking biochem this fall. Yeah I heard MCB 102 was terrible. I initially enrolled in Chem 135, but I think it requires quite a bit of ochem knowledge particularly 3B which is not my strong suit. So, I ended up enrolling in MCB C100A after briefly glancing at the syllabus and exams and looking at professor ratings."
