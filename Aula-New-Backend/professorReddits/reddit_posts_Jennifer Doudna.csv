Berkeley‚Äôs Jennifer Doudna wins Nobel in Chemistry for CRISPR!,https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Technology/wireStory/panel-announce-2020-nobel-prize-chemistry-73466890,2020-10-07 03:03:52,,"Holy moly, incredibly well deserved! Amazing we have such brilliant faculty and we're able to learn from true pioneers of the field
We're 2-0 now, suck it Stanford
I have been waiting for this moment just so I can tell people I took a class from a nobel prize winner. Where's my bio1a squad?
Suck it Feng Zhang! Glad the true inventors got the prize.
WHOA FINALLY THIS IS AWESOME

GO TEAM DOUDNA AND GO BEARS!

ETA:  THIS IS A FUCKING AWESOME DAY TO BE A WOMAN IN STEM
GO BEARS!!!
Yo we baggin tho
She can park in the ‚ÄúNobel Prize Winner only‚Äù spot now LOL
We‚Äôre past ‚Äúwomen in STEM.‚Äù We‚Äôre at ‚Äúwomen LEAD STEM.‚Äù
holy shit this one is huge.
We straight killin' it this year!
GO BEARS!!!!
I wonder if this will help them in their patent fight:

""The entire worldwide scientific community gave us an award for inventing this, are you sure you're right patent office?""
They better rank us our rightful #1
Y E S ! ! !
Had her for Bio 1A before CRISPR, been calling this for years. Go Bears!
More alumni money inbound!
one good part of 2020 :') go bears!
Who is  Virginijus ≈†ik≈°nys?
Eyyyyy lesgoo
Stanfuuurd
Would've been a tad better if she had actually taught the genetics section when I took it, lol.
Ayy Bio 1A gang represent
okay yes but also why remind me of bio1aüòî
Didn't know that ≈†ik≈°nys was awarded too?
109 and 26 lead on stanfurd, but who‚Äôs counting tho üò§üòé
We bagging for real doe
You‚Äôre being downvoted but I believe this is one of the criteria that goes into USNWR Rankings.
He totally should have gotten a share of the prize!
I know right? I'm happy that Doudna and Charpentier were recognized but Siksnys and his team made the discovery pretty much contemporaneously and should have been recognized for their contribution.

So did Cal"
Jennifer Doudna wins the Nobel Prize!!,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/health/nobel-prize-2020-winner-chemistry-scn-intl/index.html,2020-10-07 03:07:54,,"Amazing! And they left out Feng Zhang from MIT/ Broad so that battle is finally over. Big win for Berkeley!
Apparently this is the first time two women have shared a Nobel Prize. Absolutely incredible
Two more for the collection. Im proud to be a bear
Yeah, this is a no-brainer if you follow biology at all. Congrats Professor! Took Chem 3A from her I think.
Stonks
Queen shit, finally
So deserved :) Go Bears!
Go Bears! We‚Äôre gonna need a bigger parking lot haha.
Glad to see Feng Zhang wasn't included. The true pioneers of this work were Doudna and Charpentier in their 2012 paper, so including Zhang who published his results significantly later would have been inappropiate
That's not how patents work!
Oh and coincidentally immediately after the Twitter-sponsored metoo 'movement' got in full swing. Pinning CRISPR down to two people, regardless of their sex, is a disgace.
Preach, brother!
Zhang published his results together with George Church. There would have been no reason to exclude Church. But the committee can award it to only three people. So it was the right decision to exclude him.

Really depends what you define as pioneer. Surely the dozens of scientists who were working on CRISPR before Doudna and Charpentier had ever heard of it (nevermind published on it) should also be called pioneers?
Hey man glad you‚Äôre figuring out how the Nobel prize works
wut
That‚Äôs true of every major scientific discovery of the past 75 years
Yea, Nature covers this in their article. Unfortunately a lot of the early players were omitted, partially because the award was phrased as the development of CRISPR for genome editing applications, so the ppl who first discovered the repeats or characterized the Cas genes aren't included.
Why are you only saying this for these two winners? I don't see you commenting this dumb shit about any other Noble Prize winners. Are you just sexist?
Are you just a child who reaches for any attempt at slurring another person because you disagree with them? Painfully predictable...."
