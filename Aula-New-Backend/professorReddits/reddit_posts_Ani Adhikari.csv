Cal Day was...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12wx86a/cal_day_was/,2023-04-23 17:59:35,"great!

&#x200B;

Two highlights among many great moments worth mentioning. 

&#x200B;

1. Olufemi Ogundele set the tone for the day. Whatever they pay this man for his job, it's less than he deserves. The other speakers were decent but exactly what you expect from an address like this. Dean Ogundele was riveting, emotional and direct. What a great speaker and what a great start to four years of UC Berkeley. Go Bears.
2. [Ani Adhikari](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ani-adhikari)'s talk on the Statistics and Data Science departments was good enough that had I done nothing else while at Cal Day, it would have been worth showing up. She's fantastic. Everything she had to say was motivating, warm and useful. 

So...a big thank you to UC Berkeley and all the students that participated--everyone we talked to was helpful and engaged. If I wasn't already sold on UCB, I'd have bought in by the end of the day.","Ogundele’s talk was 🔥🔥🔥. He made us all feel so proud and happy to be there. What a leader!
ill see u next year baby bear!
Yay, glad you like Cal Day! Your first of many:) Welcome to Cal! GO BEARS!
Last year’s video is available in the Cal Admissions YouTube channel, https://youtu.be/yVxcPruInLQ. This year’s clip may show up there eventually
Idk man kips was the highlight
Adhikari's talk was amazing! I'm super lucky to have wandered in bc i'm not even a DS major lmao.
Do you think the staff reads this subreddit
[deleted]
who goes to cal day and thinks the speakers are the most hype aspect ??? did you go to the frats ?
I agree. He's the real deal.
Ability to give great speeches doesn’t mean he’s a good leader. Example: Hitler
It is not much of a stretch that Prof Adhikari is GOAT level as a teacher at Berkeley.
do you have a link or recording of it?
We do. :)
Doubtful
They did have a professional cameraperson filming the event. I'm sure somewhere it exists.
I heard someone fell off the roof of one of them so I steered clear!
academic bureaucrats are hell. this is one thing you will learn here at cal over four years.

Data100 or data140,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/19addqe/data100_or_data140/,2024-01-18 23:16:50,"CS major, trying to decide which one to take. Did good in 70 (A), not sure which one of these classes will be more beneficial long term as a person interested in SWE. 

I've seen great reviews for adhikari's 140, but wow it seems intense and I'm not sure how much it will pay off to learn the material in the long run? 

Any insights, suggestions or personal experiences regarding picking between these two courses and SWE type career goals?","If you’re only interested in SWE type stuff then 100 is probably slightly better since you likely wont be using heavy probability from 140 but 100 is more general.
If you’re considering ML or robotics as a CS major then 140 becomes super useful
Neither. The 160’s series are better at it for SWE.
For SWE you really don’t need either tbh
Bruh… shoulda enrolled in the 160s or 180s series course instead.
Thanks I appreciate it, gonna go w 100.
Dude I know, I just declared and I'm feeling lucky to have gotten a spot in 61c. I've got time to take the 160s and 180s but those data sci classes were my only choice besides 188 which I've heard is pointless.
I understand. Either 100 or 140 is still useful. 100 good for front-end and DS stuff. 140 good for DS/ml stuff."
STAT 88,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cg76eu/stat_88/,2019-07-21 19:00:56,"Do you need to have Data 8 as a prereq to enroll in STAT 88 or can you take it with Data 8 at the same time. Also, was wondering how hard the course is with professor Ani Adhikari and little CS knowledge! I've taken Linear Algebra and Differential equations at CC and 1 stats course. Thanks!","Would also like some insight into the difficulty of taking Stat 88 concurrently with Data 8 or would it easier to take Stat 88 the semester after?
Can be taken concurrently afaik

Any advice for PROB 140?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/l3rsg1/any_advice_for_prob_140/,2021-01-23 19:47:19,I have prof. Adhikari and am currently dying in the class even though it’s been only the first week. Does anyone have any advice for this class or how to approach a probability question ? I feel like sometimes I overthink the problem and/or not taking into account of something.,"DRAW the problems out! I’m a visual learner and the only way I passed the class was by drawing the problems out. I’m choosing x things— I’m going to draw x blanks, how many choices/what’s the probability for each? 

For me, discussion was probably the most important resource because we practiced how to actually do the problems and my TA was a godsend.

In lecture, if its live, write down what she says, but review it later so that you understand where everything came from. 

Don’t be afraid to ask Piazza for detailed help wherever something confuses you. Yes, this is really scary, but do it anyway— your fellow students will help you out, and don’t forget to find a study group to do homework together!
Are you taking it for a probability requirement? I took it last semester and didn’t have a hard time during the first week or two but later mega regretted not switching to stat 134. It will get much more difficult later on imo. 

If you really wanna stick to the class id recommend putting a shit ton of time doing practice questions in the textbook. Also OH are kinda tight so sitting in one office hour after another to get all your questions answered might be another time commitment. Good luck!!
Especially if you’ve had no previous experience or exposure to probability, the first few weeks will be difficult as you learn a new subject. Like coding, probability has a lot of terminology and rules you have to learn, but once you’ve been around it for a few weeks, you’ll feel a lot better.

As far as the content goes, 140 is up there for some of the most difficult to understand. I’d recommend the basics (reading the textbook, going to lecture, taking notes, asking questions, doing the labs/homework etc.) Adhikari can be intimidating at times, but she is an incredible professor who cares deeply about the subject and her students. 

Also if for nothing else, stick around for Markov Chains. That concept is a lot of fun to learn, as are others. While it no doubt can be frustrating at times, probability is very rewarding once you understand the problems you are working with.
Prof Adhikari has a lot of advice on her website, it includes a [sample](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ani/s134s17/prereq.pdf) prerequisite set of problems and [advice](http://prob140.org/prereqs/), applicable to both 134 and 140, that requires a somewhat thorough understanding of Calc in addition to some decent basic knowledge of statistical concepts.  This is a calculus based course and those that skated by in their calc courses are going to have a hard time in this class.  Adhikari in her lectures usually does a fantastic job applying real world examples so if you take her lectures to heart things should be easier to understand.

My understanding is that the content itself in 134 and 140 is roughly the same - 140 obviously has the computing part of it and more inference.  So 134 might be less workload but the difficulty will be similar to 140.  And highly unlikely that any prof that teaches 134 will be better that Prof A for 140.
Use p/np to ur advantage
Heyy!!! I’m in the similar position rn. Now that you’re done, do you have any advices for me? How difficult it is to pass this class?
Thank you ! I’ve been trying to draw things out and it’s been helping. OH has been a little bit weird lately but I’m hoping to go to it more throughout the semester!
yes this is for the probability requirement. i was thinking of going to 134 since there was also an adjunct but waitlist is still pretty large for the class and it doesn’t seem like it’s getting better.

it’s also hard for me because it’s harder to really try to confirm my logic or my approach to a problem with someone given the virtual setting. Just haven’t been able to fully adapt to this new setting tbh.
yeah. probability was something I was never really into but I’m hoping to do well this semester. It’s the logic/approach that I’m struggling on. it’s hard to know if I’m going on the right direction since it’s virtual so interaction is pretty limited to get feedback on. Even in OH, it’s still difficult. But I’m hoping that things get better !
sigh. ive used a lot of my PNP lately and so can’t for this one ):"
Stat 134 + adjunct or Data 140?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ub3afp/stat_134_adjunct_or_data_140/,2022-04-24 13:16:44,"Hello. I'm an DS major wondering whether I should take Data 140 or Stat 134. I know that data 140 has  the better lecturer in Adhikari but it doesn't provide an adjunct course, while stat 134 does. I really want to understand the concepts and do well in probability, so I am wondering which one is better for my learning ability. 

&#x200B;

I am a bit of a slow learner and if data 140 had an adjunct it would be a no-brainer for me, but since it doesn't I'm a little torn.

&#x200B;

Any advice appreciated!","Data 140 did offer tutoring when I took it, although yeah the class did move at a pretty quick pace for me.
I'm taking Stat 134 right now but I'm not personally in the adjunct course. I've heard amazing things about the adjunct and they even post a lot of their material for students outside of the adjunct, and they meet once a week I believe, and go through the problems a lot more than the class itself does.

Not being in the adjunct for Stat 134 makes it really easy to fall behind since the first midterm can be clobbered and the second midterm isn't worth very much and is take-home. The homework is also all based on completion and is only like 8 short problems long a week.
Thanks for the feedback! Where is tutoring offered?
great info. Much appreciated!
Do you think getting B- in Stat 134 or Data 140 are doable? I require that in order to declare in Statistics major. In conjunction I may take CS 61B and Scandin R5B (reading comprehension course). That way I can declare in DS or Stats depending if I can survive in CS 61B or get a good grade in Stat 134/140. Thanks!
It is through the class itself, I think they sent out a sign up form through email and posted on ed/piazza."
What is everyone thinking of Stat 88 so far?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f1lxcz/what_is_everyone_thinking_of_stat_88_so_far/,2020-02-09 21:45:27,"I heard great things about stat 88 from people who took it last year, as with any Adhikari courses, but my experience has been sub-par so far. I feel like Lucas is a very nice professor that adds humor into his lectures once in a while, but teaching wise, it has been very... interesting. After the quiz on Thursday, a good chunk of my friends dropped from the class, and I saw that enrollment started emptying out a lot. I feel pretty lost honestly, and I am also considering switching out to stat 20. I was wondering how other people felt about the course so far, because there has been a mixed response from the people I talked to so far. Please do say if you feel that the course it easy because I might just be the outlier and I'm trying to see what the majority opinion.","I'm sticking with it. So far the content hasn't been that bad, and I think if it helps, he and the tutors do really good job making all things unclear clear at office hours at the SLC.
Lucas is a nice professor, go talk to him in office hours. His lectures might not be the most clear/concise but he's very approachable."
Time conflict enrollment for 127/140,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bsxacw/time_conflict_enrollment_for_127140/,2024-04-01 00:20:17,"For context, I am an Applied Math/Data Science double major and I am taking Data 100 and Data 140 next semester. I also plan on taking EECS 127 in preparation for CS 189 the following semester. However, there is a time conflict between EECS 127 and Data 140, since lectures are on T/Th 9:30-11:00 am. Would it be possible to enroll in both of these if the professor accepts? Can they override a time conflict? My other option would be to simply take Math 170 instead of EECS 127, but I’ve heard it covers more important optimization concepts for ML.",Really bad idea to not attend any Data 140 classes if Prof Adhikari is teaching it.  Plus you don’t really need 127 for the Prof Shewchuk version of 189.  The probability class (like 140) is much more important for 189.
Class Review : Stat 88,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eedwa4/class_review_stat_88/,2019-12-22 18:02:59,"Hello everyone,

Stat 88 received a complete overhaul this semester with a newly written textbook, and an increase to the unit course load from 2 to 3. Given this, I thought I would give a review on the class from the perspective of someone who had never taken AP stats or had any stats exposure.

Also quick disclaimer: Lucas will be teaching this in Spring 2020 so my experience can and will probably deviate from future class's experiences. Additionally, Adhikari kicked out anyone who was not concurrently enrolled in or had not taken Data8 in the past. Also, if you had taken Stat 134/140, she also kicked them out because she said those students would have an unfair advantage and recommended they take other upper div stats courses.

**PEERS:** Anecdotally, I would say a majority of people were pre-haas or cs kids looking to cop a data science major/minor. Also (I'm a transfer), There were also not that many transfer students compared to a class like Stat 20 (which imho, meant tougher competition).

**WORKLOAD:** I would definitely say that the homework and textbook exercises required a pretty considerable time commitment. I'd say pretty much everyone I interacted with in office hours, or before/after lecture hours/discussion peeps I talked to agreed that this should have been a 4 unit class and some kids I talked to also voiced their regret as to not having taken stat 20 instead. And it was kind of hard to justify spending more time on a 3-unit class versus a 4-unit class when obviously the 4-unit class matters more towards our gpa for declaring majors or whatnot --  I'd say this was a pretty big reason in some kids falling behind in material (those taking cs61a/b/etc or other important major-related courses).

**LECTURES:** Honestly, Adhikari lectures -- not much more needs to be said. Though I will say that I knew some kids who stopped/never attended lecture and read the textbook instead and they did perfectly fine.

**TEXTBOOK:** The textbook was written week by week, by Adhikari. Honestly, I was pretty amazed at how thorough and well written the book was for having been written on the fly. Book is really great and definitely did its job. I'm used to math textbooks being useless and resorting to khan academy or w.e., but this book did a really great job.

**QUIZZES AND EXAMS:** Though the homework and textbook exercises were pretty time-consuming, I actually felt like the quizzes and exams were really fair. If you followed along with homework/textbook exercises, you probably did 'ok' at the minimum on these. First midterm had an insanely good performance result because the midterm length was 50 minutes and Adhikari wrote questions to account for time-length. Also there's a clobber policy so the final can replace your midterm grade. Fortunately, I have extreme testing anxiety so I made really dumb mistakes on both.

**GSI/OFFICE HOURS/PIAZZA:** The Course staff was really really outstanding. Plenty of office hours to get help, and they, along with Professor Adhikari were super responsive on Piazza. They were also hiring tutors for next semester, though I did not apply. No criticisms at all about this.

**WOULD I RECOMMEND SOMEONE TO TAKE STAT88?:** Definitely. Though there were times I disliked the workload, I'm so glad to have taken the course and I feel like I'm really prepared for future statistics related courses. I would definitely tell people to not underestimate the course just cause it's 3 units though. Be prepared to keep up with material and homework or you will fall behind because there will be no curve to save you. There's plenty of pre-haas kids who are really grindy for that dank gpa and would be more than grateful to you if you plan on making this class a low priority. Also, this class fulfills the stat requirement for the econ major **AND** can be used for the data science minor, while stat 20 **does not** as far as I know.

**TIPS I HAVE FOR FUTURE STAT88 STUDENTS:** Take advantage of piazza, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Also, it seemed like everyone in the class formed facebook messenger groups and banded together for problem sets and to make study groups so that would be a great idea. This is especially true for those of you who have never had any prior exposure to stats/probability... **READ THE TEXTBOOK**

Anyways overall, I really enjoyed the class and would take it again if I were to go back in time. Feel free to ask any questions if you're curious. This ended up being super rambly, but I really hope y'all don't take this as too whiny and I genuinely hope this class gets the popularity it deserves!","Great review! Would personally like to see more content like this on our subreddit.
This is awesome! Thanks for sharing!
Thanks for the review.

Small correction, seems like Econ still will accept Stats 20. Though I may be misreading the requirements.
I also took the class, and I would second all of this. The most important thing for me was reading the textbook and doing the exercises (I didn't go to lectures). If you read the entire book and do all the questions, chances are you'll understand it pretty well. I didn't really do the homeworks all on my own or study for the quizzes and I got a B on the midterm and ultimately went into the final with a B+, but I studied the book for a solid couple days during dead week and did well on the final (which thankfully clobbered) and got an A. So I'd just say read the book and do the exercises throughout the semester instead of all at once lmao
I second this.
i think they are saying that the data minor will not accept stat 20"
DATA 100 vs STAT 140,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qecizl/data_100_vs_stat_140/,2021-10-23 13:12:12,"Is it doable to take STAT 140 after DATA 8 if I'm going to be taking EECS16A concurrently (as opposed to going into the class already having taken the class?). Would taking DATA100 be a better idea if I haven't taken a math class at Berkeley yet? The main reason I'm considering taking 140 now is that I'm using it as prep for CS70, which I'm taking in the fall (if I take DATA100 now, I'd probably just have to self-study 140 over the summer). Does it even make sense to take STAT140 before DATA100 (will there be any overlap in the classes?) 

I've heard 140 does a better job at preparing people for CS70/CS upper divs compared to something like STAT134, and I really enjoyed Adhikari's teaching in DATA 8 this semester so I think it would be great to have her as a professor again. I also know a lot of people take DATA100 and STAT140 together, but I'm taking CS61b and EECS16a this upcoming semester so the combination sounds like it would suck all joy out of my soul. Which class would be best to take this semester? Would it be more helpful just to take STAT 140 at the same time as CS70 during the fall?","I'm taking STAT 140 right now and so far there hasn't been too much linear algebra. You could probably take it, but the class can be somewhat difficult.  I'm also taking DATA 100, and I would say there has been more linear algebra in that class than 140, so I'd probably hold off on 100.
i'm taking both and 100 uses more linear algebra. 140 feels like overkill for cs70 though
i took data8 now in data100. highly recommend data100. i think this past week or 2, getting to linear regression and feature engineering really won me over, unexpectedly.

ill admit at times its probably too big brain (for me) but if you have 3 minutes [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTCCEEgaeE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTCCEEgaeE) this lecture right here 16.5 from Lecture 16 of this week, its not too far beyond where data8 left off but its really cool and understandable.

my 0.02 is data100 is the move.

&#x200B;

edit: [https://ds100.org/fa21/lecture/lec16/](https://ds100.org/fa21/lecture/lec16/)

the videos labeled 16.5 and 16.8 are the ones i would show you to motivate you to take data100. there hella short but watch them at 2x if you will.  then smash that enroll in data100 button
I’m taking Data 100 and Stat140 this sem. Data 100 and Stat 140

Feeling very nervous about taking these two together (Hug and Adhikari). Any advice for a junior? 61b was challenging for me so wondering how I can better set myself up for the spring.
Oh wow really? Does DATA 100 just assume prior knowledge in linear algebra? How do you think you would compare the workload/difficulty of the two classes?
Thanks for the response! Do the parts of 100 that use linear algebra come later in the course, or do they assume you have linalg experience entering the class? What's the workload like for each?
in d100 right now as well. as of rn im enrolled in 140 for spring, but i might just wait til next fall. curious what are your thoughts on 140?
Thanks for taking the time to write this reply! I honestly didn't understand half of what was going on in that video lmao (it does seem pretty cool though). What is the workload of the class like so far? Would you say the content covered in DATA 8 transitions pretty smoothly into the topics taught in 100?
I'm also taking STAT140 as preparation but I'm already struggling in the class lmao
They do expect you to be somewhat familiar with linear algebra as it comes in handy for regression stuff. I would say DATA 140 is more work though for sure. I think DATA 100 while taking 16A is probably still doable though. I don’t think you can go too wrong with either course tbh.
they do expect you to know some linear algebra. you could probably pick up enough to do well if you studied during the winter break. and they start using it about 20% of the way through
they give you all the help you need to succeed in the class, but you have to put the time in to actually do well
Honestly data 8 hasn’t been super relevant so far besides maybe some intuition with tables in general that you could probably pick up immediately anyways. Edit: forgot about the linear regression, that relates nicely. Workload isn’t that hard but they do have a lab and a hw each week which gets a bit annoying sometimes. But in terms of time spent it’s not that much
I also didn't understand half of what was going on in that video until about the third time I watched it, but it's actually really great content delivery and everything up to that point builds up to it well!

I say data8 provides a solid basis for much of data100, and does transition smoothly into the topics of data100. The assignments are VERY similar in nature, we're coding lots of familiar things from data8.

The other part is linear algebra and python(cs88/61a). I would suggest getting into linear algebra if you haven't taken a linear algebra course before. I don't know how people who are taking linear algebra for the first time concurrently feel, but I'm glad I have familiarity with linear algebra.

edit: I glossed over your linAlg /no math at Cal yet. Since you'll be taking 16a I'd say get into linear algebra. a \~lazy recommendation would be from the Lay textbook

Lay 1.1-5, 1.7-1.9, 2.1-2.3, (3.1-3.3 SKIM/SKIP), $$$4.1-4.17$$$

Take a look at chapter 1 sooner than later. It's not conceptual. The concepts in 4.1-4.7 are really where linear algebra gets formed. If you can even get to about 4.3 that would be nice, right here is where I recall the 3blue1brown series tying in nicely. Heck you can cold start watching 3blue1brown  today and it'll probably help when you tackle linear algebra. 

if Lay text interests you its easy to download, feel free to pm if you need help with that!
Thanks so much for the reply! I'm still pretty conflicted as to which one I should take but it's helpful to hear about what the courses are like lmao. If you have any tips for preparing for/doing well in either class, I'd love to hear them as well
Okay, I'm thinking of going with 100 then and studying over winter break. Thanks man!
Sorry I didn't see this until now, but thanks for the advice! I'm enrolled in DATA 100 as of right now and it's good to know there's somewhere I can start from when I begin preparing. Is Lay's textbook usually used to teach linalg at Cal? Will everything in the book be sufficient to cover what we need to know for 16A?
If you take 140 make sure to use the resources and help given to you. The course staff have been very helpful. Also 140 is a class where you probably can’t afford to fall behind so make sure you’re keeping up with the material. For 100, a good chunk of your grade this year is hw and labs(around 45%). Not sure if that will be the case next semester but if it is make sure to do the hw carefully. The midterm and final project is the rest of the grade(Again might not be the case next semester). We haven’t done those yet this semester, so I can’t really say anything for that.
Yes Math 54 uses Lay. The Lay text is a very good presentation, although 3blue1brown and googling other sources usually helps if something seems iffy. A few examples:

[https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/linear-independence.html](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/linear-independence.html)  is a good, similar reference. And here's a good example; learning the nuts and bolts of linear independence. You can space bar through this page quickly, I would also suggest looking at the 'Checking Linear Independence' tab.

[https://math.okstate.edu/people/binegar/4063-5023/4063-5023-l02.pdf](https://math.okstate.edu/people/binegar/4063-5023/4063-5023-l02.pdf) Now if you go to page 5 of this pdf, I'm not sure if this will seem intimidating, but this is where linear algebra kind of starts, or re-starts, where you are talking about the same thing but with more attention to

\-vector spaces/subspaces

\-linear independence proofs

\-spanning

imho, Lay and the first reference are similar and useful. The second reference, or those types of references, may take some time to get used to, but know that it relates very well to the first two. anywho, if you get a chance to skim those and have any questions let me know :)

&#x200B;

edit: regarding 16a: in h54 we didn't cover circuits, and I think 16a has its own course materials for circuits and other applications as well. However, I remember Lay's sections on applications (circuits and other things) not being useful to me. I gave those parts of Lay an attempt and quickly moved on, but I didn't NEED the applications the way EECS majors taking 16a will.
I think I might go with DATA 100 then and self-study linear algebra a bit beforehand since 140 sounds pretty heavy and I don't want to completely overwhelm myself next semester. Thanks for the help! (and good luck on midterms!)
Check the data piazza but they may be enforcing pre and coreqs. It says here at the bottom lin alg is a corequisite: https://ds100.org/
Yeah, I'm taking EECS16A at the same time anyway so I was wondering if the linalg I pick up while taking that class would be enough for me to understand the topics in DATA100. I meet the prereq/coreqs for both classes; I was just wondering which one I'd do better in given my current experience :)"
How good are the professors for data science?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/131eyg7/how_good_are_the_professors_for_data_science/,2023-04-27 19:22:52,"Hello, so I got admitted to Cal Berkeley as a data science major and I went to Cal day where the data science informations event was very captivating for me. I was wondering just how good the Data science professors are, as well as the computer science and statistics professors are? I am still deciding between Berkeley data science and Vanderbilt computer science and I heard vanderbilt has mediocre tech connections and cs professors so juts wnated to know how good they were. I also wanted to know how good their connections are, especially given that its in the bay. thanks!","They are goood especially Ani Adhikari.
The data science professors here basically invented the field and that is not a joke or exaggeration.
“Cal Berkeley”
All the cs and ds professors here are pretty cracked
yeah she was one of the speakers at the data science if information center and she was really good. i was kinda inspired to go to berkeley data science because of her but still deciding between berkeley and vanderbilt computer science
wait can you elaborate?
is that not how you call your school? 💀💀
Always take the cs option
Idk much about vanderbilt so can’t help you with that
Schools across the country use our Data Science curicculum (their own variation of courses like Data 8) for their own Data Science programs because of how good they are.

Fernando Perez (Data 100 Professor) developed Jupyter notebook, which is one of the most widely used platforms when it comes to Data Science (the other being Google CoLab).

Those are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head right now, but there’s definitely more things our Data Science professors have done that have contributed significantly to what the field is today.

Additionally, Undegrad Data Science here at Berkeley is unique compared to other colleges. You learn most, if not all, of the skills other students learn when pursing Graduate/Doctorate programs in Data Science.
It’s cal or Berkeley never both
We usually call it Oskiland
No you just said the same thing twice

Stats w21?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/42xnir/stats_w21/,2016-01-27 06:17:46,"I'm a spring transfer who is applying to the economics major and who decided it would be a good idea to take stat 134. While Adhikari is definitely a good teacher, the material is just way above my league and it's taking me a long time to internalize the concepts. While I enjoy math, I'm slow at it and I'm terrified that because of this class I won't get into the major.

I'm seeing if there are any other stat classes I can add after the first week. Stats 20 seems pretty filled up. The other easiest option I have is Stat w21, which is online. I hate online classes but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this one? Is it feasible if you just manage your time? Does the SLC answer questions related to this class? 

And of course, do you think there are any other stat classes that are easier, that fulfill the econ major requirement, and I might be able to get in to at this point?","I was a GSI for that class a couple of years ago. GO TO OFFICE HOURS if you want help. All of us GSIs along with the professor 'in charge' found it kind of boring because we experienced very little foot traffic.
I took it last Spring and it was pretty easy. There's homework due every few days so you're forced to stay on top of your assignments/readings.

"fall 2022 course review: cs170, data140, cs61c",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/100duku/fall_2022_course_review_cs170_data140_cs61c/,2022-12-31 22:44:59,"**CS170 (Nelson/Demmel):** 

*Rating*: 5.1/5

*Content*: In 170, you cover really interesting theory concepts including time complexity analysis, algorithms for graph traversals & shortest paths, dynamic programming, duality, and reductions to NP-Complete problems. I'd consider the pace to be pretty reasonable -- there are times when the class moves quickly through certain algorithms, but for larger things (like linear programming, reductions, dp) you're given a few lectures to sort of grasp the topic. The homeworks are generally interesting problems -- although often there are 1-2 very difficult questions -- and I'd definitely recommend having a study group to work on the homework together with. There's also a project where you get to write algorithms to find some solutions to a NP-complete problem, which is super super cool.

*Teaching:*

**Nelson** is likely the best professor I've had. He does a really good job of taking concepts and starting from the beginning, while also showing how to build intuition to understand why an algorithm works. He sees pitfalls people can run into as he's teaching and addresses them, and is really good at tying new concepts back and ""bringing it all together."" He's also just fun to listen to and seems really passionate about most things; I really loved attending his live lectures. 

**Demmel** is definitely an above average lecturer. One thing I really enjoy that he does is show a lot of real-world examples of how to apply some algorithm, and help visualize things that are often stuck in theory. The downsides of this is that there were a few points where it really felt like stuff was ""proof by example"", and as someone interested in the reasoning behind stuff, meant that there was a bit of textbook reading kind of required to supplement that. He also sometimes starts his lectures with 20 minutes about what he is going to be talking about during the lecture, which can feel a little bit like a waste of time; I think connecting things together at the end, after we've learned the concepts, might be a bit better. Having said that, he is very receptive to questions and seems to also enjoy teaching.

**Course Staff**: I feel like I learned so much from discussion -- I attended a few but the discussion TA I ended up going with (Wilson) was so good at summarizing key topics and helping us figure out how to apply them to the problems. Feel like discussion helped me keep on pace with the class a lot, and was often pretty useful for homeworks as well. The one thing that **really bothered me** about this class was office hours -- it felt like the course staff I interacted with there either didn't understand how to arrive at the solution to a problem, or didn't want to take the time to explain it; it felt like there was a lot of ""ok this is just how u solve it"" and not a lot of help with conceptual understanding, which I found frustrating. I do think homework parties were very cute though, and was a good initiative to have here.

*Difficulty*: This class definitely takes a lot of time, but it does feel like time invested pays off -- like the concepts are difficult and oftentimes hard to grasp at first, but it doesn't feel like exams or homeworks are there to ""trick"" you; if you watch lecture, take notes on relevant DPV things you don't understand, and put time into understanding discussion problems then you'll see results. 

*Usefulness*: I think the coding portions of the homeworks are probably the most useful thing you can do (after 61b) if you want to prep for tech interviews. I was recruiting while taking this class and I'd literally learn something and then code it in an interview the next week. I'd say biggest topics here were time complexity analysis, BFS/DFS/Dijkstra's, and also sometimes dynamic programming. Also, generally, I think understanding some of this stuff -- like what is NP-Complete? what is a dual? etc -- is good because these were always concepts people talked about before that I had 0 clue about.

*TLDR?* Would highly recommend this class. Probably my favorite class at Cal.

**Data140 (Adhikari):**

*Rating*: 5/5

*Content*: In 140, you get a really in-depth understanding of probability. You explore really cool problems ranging from stuff you might have seen before, ""what is the expected value of this dice roll?"" (eventually, ""what is the expected value of a dice roll with possible values based on a different dice roll""), to things you've likely not thought about, ""if I don't know the rate at which this coin is heads, how do I update my predictions as I simulate to make a good guess?"". The class shows a lot of interesting results for stuff you've likely not seen before -- poissonizing the binomial, and seeing the math behind that (& that two results are independent), is probably the first thing that blew my mind here. Really beneficial to gain a broader understanding of the likelihood of things happening, focusing on probability & the math behind it but also inference, regression & predictions, and things that happen to simulations over time.

*Teaching*: 

**Adhikari** is a really great professor, and the reason there's a ""likely"" in my comments about Nelson above -- the two are probably tied for my favorite professor at Cal. The thing she does really well is understand where students are going to get stuck, and take a lot of steps to make sure that you don't get stuck there. She teaches probability in a very different way than your past courses probably have, focusing on the ""why"" and the conceptual reasons behind it, which helps so much in, again, building the intuition that is needed to solve problems (rather than just trying to pattern match). She also seems to genuinely care about students, and is one of few professors I know who's super active on Ed answering questions; her communication through the strike especially was really above-and-beyond. Would highly recommend taking the course with her.

**Course Staff**: I only had positive interactions with course staff -- I feel like there was a lot of really good OH support that helped with both the conceptual but also how to approach problems, and showed you what to consider. Weirdly, OH doesn't really have any sort of queue system most of the time so it can take some time to receive help, since you just kind of have to hope the course staff there goes to you next. For discussion, my TA (Ziyue) was also really good at explaining problems and walking through all the relevant steps, and it definitely felt beneficial, if sometimes a little slow (in terms of covering very similar problems).

*Difficulty*: Very much like 170, this class takes a lot of time, but it does again feel like time invested pays off. For homeworks, they take a lot of time -- I do think one of the complaints I have with this class is that homeworks at times feel like ""oh you did a really basic application of this idea in discussion, now go solve a super hard-and-complicated version that is not always super motivated"". You learn a lot of cool results in homeworks and labs, which is great, but I do think the gap between discussions and homeworks should be closed a bit by having discussions show more difficult applications. For exams and quizzes, they're super reasonable and feel very motivated by the material you've prepared -- if you review homeworks, textbook problems, and past exams (if applicable), you will see results.

*Usefulness*: I think a lot of this probability stuff is very useful to build on, especially through using some of it in machine learning. The class also emphasizes problems that are pretty useful for quantitative trading interviews, so if that's a path you're exploring, this is probably a class to take. Honestly, also just loved all these concepts, and think the class is very very worth taking just to get a better conceptual understanding of it all.

*TLDR?:* Definitely also take this class. I think this class was branded to me as ""easier 126"" but I feel like because some stuff was a bit slowed down, it really helped me to get conceptual intuition that some of my friends in 126 didn't seem to get. I also heard of it as a ""harder 134"" but looking at what my friends learned from 134, if you're actually interested in probability -- and it's applications to cs/ds -- 140 beats it by a lot.

**CS61C (Garcia/Yan):**

*Rating:* 2.5/5

*Content:* This class has a small introduction to C (primarily just learning abt stack/heap and memory allocation, as well as why it's 'faster' than python), stuff about number representations an floating point, introduction to the assembly language risc-v, understanding CPUs and datapath pipelining, and then covers caches, virtual memory, parallelism, etc. Basically the computer architecture. 

*Teaching:* 

**Garcia:** Garcia is a very passionate lecturer, and he clearly cares a lot about teaching. His teaching is very ""big ideas"" oriented -- this is cool most of the time, but can get very frustrating when he spends more time on history than on understanding the deeper-level of how does this thing actually get implemented and why does that implementation work. This leads to a disconnect where HWs/Discussions seem to often be the first place you learn actual implementations of material or how things work -- which is generally not what is supposed to happen -- but it happens because the depth of lecture can be pretty low, focusing more on breadth. Having said that, he brings a lot of fun to the classroom, and keeps people excited, while also connecting with students.

**Yan:** Yan is a good lecturer -- she also seems to care a lot about students and has a really good way of explaining things that articulates kind of both what we're expected to know, but also goes a bit deeper. Her lectures are good, and generally communicate the necessary info we need to know, although sometimes also run into this ""big ideas"" problem.

*Difficulty:* The course content itself is difficult -- it covers a lot of things in a pretty fast-paced manner. The course, as it was run this semester, however, was not. The midterm was designed to be super short (completable by TAs in 15 min) and primarily ""C and D-level questions"". The final was also very short (4 pages) and, partially due to strike, tested concepts at a low level. Here, it didn't feel like time put in equalled results -- felt a lot more like you didn't have to put much time at all to do well, and fully understanding the concepts didn't help you at all; the only thing you have to worry about is like small arithmetic errors, which is pretty frustrating. Content was just not tested effectively. The reasoning behind this is likely the 'As for all' thing they were doing -- which is an interesting idea in theory -- but was not implemented super well. The messaging itself was kind of sad, because it made you feel like you had to get an A to feel competent, and it ended up meaning that you could get a super good grade without putting much effort at all, which harms understanding pretty heavily. The main difficult thing ended up being having to learn all the key concepts through HW guide videos to answer those questions, and then trying to do well on projects, which really only tested a small portion of things.

*Usefulness:* I'm sure this class is super useful in regular semesters. Some of the stuff seemed pretty cool, especially understanding how the CPU worked. However, I feel like I exited not learning a lot, because the reduced difficulty of everything meant it felt like there was no reward to actually getting the concepts, and it ended up being pretty easy to pattern match on HWs with the guide videos, or get through everything (besides projects) with minimal understanding, so there was no real incentive to learn more.

*TLDR:* If you want an A, or grades are generally important to you, take this class in a semester with 'As for all'. If you want to gain a deeper understanding of concepts, I'd recommend waiting it out, though.


Hopefully all of this info is helpful to people. Feel free to ask questions below, and leave your own reviews for these courses. And Happy New Year!","wtf is this As for all bullshit
Did you find the workload doable for these 3? Cuz I am gonna take 61c, Data 140 and math 110. I want to add breadths but I am afraid it’s too much work.
[deleted]
3) 61c: was the difficulty of the course different in only the midterm and final? (so hw/lab was the same?) If so, you also mention ""The main difficult thing ended up being having to learn all the key concepts through HW guide videos to answer those questions, and then trying to do well on projects, which really only tested a small portion of things"" so I don't see how the class harms understanding since I think the bulk of understanding comes from hw/project.  
""However, I feel like I exited not learning a lot, because the reduced difficulty of everything meant it felt like there was no reward to actually getting the concepts, and it ended up being pretty easy to pattern match on HWs with the guide videos, or get through everything (besides projects) with minimal understanding""

So it sounds like the actual hw was easier?
were you the one to score 100% on both Data140 MT and Final?
Sounds like a slogan for freshmen who obsess over their GPA
Ya, I found this to be doable. There were some weeks where it felt like a lot but I also had some weeks with a lot of free time. Also, note that I have a job for 20 hours a week, so if you don't have that, I feel like you'll def be good with this and some breadths.
I am not very good at thinking about how time passes (mostly because when I work on something, I am p bad at focusing so i do like four things at a time & also I tend to like not have a consistent schedule week-by-week). In terms of general workload, I thought 170 took the most time by far (HWs are many hours, reading book and understanding stuff + lectures takes time), 140 was a lot less (some 70 knowledge carried me through this, HW still took a few hours though for sure), and 61C was very minimal (outside of projects, which I would grind in a day of just focusing on project). 


For 140, I think the thing Adhikari did was focus on the proofs. Like really walking us through the math behind why something worked, and pointing out common mistakes along the way. I think a specific example from this semester is the lecture where she talked about birthday paradox/matching problem, and different ways to approach and understand that. I think being walked through that conceptual stuff was what helped me the most, but totally understand people learn differently :)) I think also for base understanding I did have CS70 knowledge, so maybe she didn't start from the basics and I didn't notice -- but I don't remember ever having a feeling that I just had to ""accept"" everything.

As for discussion, I do think my TA did a good job helping us think about what questions we should ask here when thinking about how to approach a problem, and next steps. Ya, there was some times where it felt like walkthrough, but I think she paused for understanding and gave time for people to talk with groups and try to solve stuff together, although I agree there could have been more for sure.
oh, to clarify, by a ""few"" i meant I tried a few different TAs :)) I'll answer the rest of the qs after new year hehe
For HW, there were these HW guide videos that I mentioned you could basically pattern match, and HW is unlimited tries -- so it's pretty easy to do well on the HW if you just guess a bunch of times; the difficulty in that sentence refers to trying to understand why the answer is right, if that makes sense. Like to ""get it"" was difficult (especially without as much corresponding lecture help, but to ""do well"" was not so much. I think projects were great (although we didn't do the parallelism one, because of strike, which was so sad), but they don't test all parts of the course -- so I gained really in-depth knowledge of specific things for sure but there was a bunch missing. Maybe part of this is just because we didn't get the 4th project but also if you look at topics vs what projects cover, you'll see a project really can't go over all the key points.

Hopefully that makes a bit of sense lol, but totally down to clarify more :)
No, not at all LOL
Thanks!
Just curious, what kind of part time job are you working on? I am also looking for part time work.
You did these three classes with a 20 hour work week? That's impressive I'm ngl. I'm planning my schedule for next spring and was thinking of these exact classes but the workload seems daunting
[deleted]
do you know if the semester had different homeworks? or was the hw guide a new thing this semester?
I don't think you're dumb at all. I definitely had to spend a lot of time reading up on stuff and solving problems on my own -- discussion by itself is not enough, since there has to be some level of like self-learning and frustration with the content to grow. I guess I kind of just expect that to happen though, since that's part of the process of learning -- I just felt like discussion helped me a bit in guiding some of that frustration and also gave me points to start for when I was working on my own.
Ya, the guides are made during the semester. I think homeworks are also changed slightly, but not totally sure.
Doesn't that mean you could just not look at the hw guide in order to feel like you learned
I mean ya, I also could have just learned all the concepts myself on my own time -- you can do this in any class. I just felt the class struggled with giving an incentive for people to develop content understanding. 

Also, as I said, I felt there wasn't enough actually lower-level work in lecture to understand sometimes what the homeworks were even asking, so HW guides were necessary, and sometimes detrimental.
ah i see. ty for answering! i wonder how previous semesters did hw since garcia has taught the class a lot, so if his lectures dont go to the needed depth, then yikes"
