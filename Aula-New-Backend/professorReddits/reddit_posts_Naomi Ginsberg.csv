Would like help choosing my PChem class please!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/175njr8/would_like_help_choosing_my_pchem_class_please/,2023-10-11 13:08:53,"Hello everyone,

I am working on my spring schedule right now and am trying to figure out whether to take Chem 120A or Chem120B (both Physical Chem). They aren't required to take in sequence, but from those who have taken them is it better to do so? 

The professors for 120A are Hendrik Utzat and Stephen Robert Leone, whom I can't find any information on regarding their teaching styles, and 120B is just Naomi S Ginsberg who has pretty decent ratings on RateMyProfessor. 

I am also taking MCB110 so I am just trying to find as okay of a balance as possible, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!","120B is way harder than A, so pick your poison. Both are pretty challenging courses, so it will be tough either way
If you go to the [CoC website](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/chem/) you can see that 120B does has a prerequisite of 120A. So while you can ignore that, don't.
Utzat is a relatively young/new professor. Had him for 120A last semester. Topics were cool, but through material super fast andâ€¦ all i can say is that his lack of experience shows ðŸ˜°"
