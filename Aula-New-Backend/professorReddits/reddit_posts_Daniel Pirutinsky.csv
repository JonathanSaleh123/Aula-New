engin 120 Daniel Pirutinsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q9me8k/engin_120_daniel_pirutinsky/,2021-10-16 15:47:00,I can't find any information about Pirutinsky. Can anyone share their experience?,"Mmm he’s a very nice person but for engin120 in s21, he often oversimplified the content and I felt like I didn’t learn much from him
I had Pirutinsky when he taught IEOR 172. He is a good professor -- engaging lectures and the course seemed well structured.
Does Anyone know how difficult is this class? This is my first econ type class at berkeley.
Off topic, but Happy Cake Day!!! 🎂🎊🎉🎁🌺
Really nice professor! Makes the content really light and digestable.
I don't like him. I have took his graduate courses, really a mess. Like other people said, oversimplifying question and skip essential parts. Don't know why IEOR as a the best ORIE department in US hire some professor like him.
Don't know what semester you took him in but I found that while he is a very nice person, his lectures are very surface level and it's impossible to do well in the course without engaging heavily with the textbook"
UPPER DIVISION PROBABILITY REQ FPR DATA SCIENCE MAJOR ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cfs26v/upper_division_probability_req_fpr_data_science/,2024-04-28 23:18:14," I’m currently an upcoming sophomore! RANK upper div probability course you guys recommend taking for data science major? I have the options of stat 134 with Stoyanov, Data C140 with Adhikari, or INDENG 172 with Daniel Pirutinsky…. I would be 88/100 on the waitlist/ near the end of it because there are reserved seats 

 I heard people saying ind eng is better, but the professor this semester has lwk bad rating overall but there’s none specifically on this class so idk how its gonna go with him

other classes this fall
Math 56
R5B w/ Rachel Cook
UGBA 10

 ","Read up on the comparison between the different Probability options -  http://prob140.org/about/

If your goal is to get properly prepared into ML, I would say that 126 or 140 are the ways to go.  If you’re the type that takes the easy way out with classes like CS 88C, Math 16A and the like, IND 172 might be for you.
Nobody says Ind eng is better. EECS126 > DATA140 > nothing matters after that
EECS 126 >= DATA 140 >>>>> everything else. I don't know where people are getting the Ind Eng. classes are better, even for stuff like optimization theory because its in a completely different focus.
IND 172 isn’t very easy. I’d check Berkeleytime grade distributions. Ind Eng kids are smart and the professor is a menace.
Is pirutinsky hard?
Grade distributions are the most ridiculous criteria for determining whether a class is hard or not.  Know what the easiest math class is at Berkeley by far? Stat 2.  Guess what the average GPA is?  Borderline B-. 

The average GPA for EECS 126 is 3.42, and Stat 134 is 2.81.  Data 140 is probably somewhere around 2.9 So that must mean EECS 126 is much easier than the other 2, right?  I think not. 

Grade distributions mean nothing in the world of curved classes. The quality of the student in the classes is much more of a determinant. I can pretty much tell you that 172 will be much easier than the other 3 classes.
When people say “easy” or “hard” they generally mean what grade they get in relation to the amount of work. EECS 126 is the hardest but has EECS kids who work hard and the grading is better. I already thoroughly looked at every prob course’s reviews, grading, reserved seats, and profs. I’d say considering of all of these, it goes 140 > 126 >= 134 or 172 (depending on your career goals, 126 above all for ML, 134 for more chill). 

IND ENG kids are smart too, that’s why I brought it up. It’s not STAT 134 which is a mix of majors. The IND ENG major is a bunch of upper-div math with terrible professors and nonexistent support due to its size, and 172 has the worst grade distribution of all probability courses considering this. 

My point was just that IND ENG 172 isn’t the easiest. I don’t know why you would think it is when considering the variance in majors in 134 and 140."

how's the difficulty and workload in general? Any comments on the quality of teaching, reasonableness of grading, any issue or pros, welcome to share!! really need advice, thanks!

* compared to other econ upper divs like Econ 140, Econ 100A/B?
* compared to CS courses like CS61A, CS61B (it's killing me this semester!)
* compared to INDENG 142 (Machine Learning), INDENG 172 (Probability for Engineers)","It's essentially a corportate finance class, and has very little to do with ""engineering"". It's much more of an econ class that covers terms and ideas in corporate finance (you should skim the syllabus if you haven't already). It's very  arithmetic heavy, and you will be spending hours on your calculator every week solving the weekly homeworks. Homeworks are weekly, and usually take about 3-5 hours to complete. Not challenging, but very tedious and arithmetic heavy. The easiest part of this course are the exams. Both midterms and the final exam are all multiple choice (5 option) and you are also allowed to bring in your own cheat sheet with whatever formulas you want to put on it. Calculator use is essentially required to do the exam problems. Make sure you have a good calculator for the course. I didnt take any econ classes prior to this course and did fine.
Legit one of the easies classes I’ve taken. It’s mostly corporate finance terms and arithmetics. One hw a week, 2 midterms, and a final. It’s been pretty easy so far, imo. Would recommend.
3-5 hours? It takes like 2 hours wdym
Thanks, very detailed! (and reassuring for me if it's not complex conceptually. if it's just tedious) how does the difficulty and time commitment compare to math 54 linear algebra, math1b calculus/integration?
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)that's great news to me lol coz I plan to take other harder courses together - like machine learning as well as probability (both offered by indeng). DId you happen to have taken those courses as well?

lol its been a while since ive taken the course so i kinda forgot. im also a a slow worker."
INDENG 172,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10e5fl4/indeng_172/,2023-01-16 22:48:46,"If you've taken IEOR/INDENG 172 before with Daniel Pirutinsky, what was your experience like? How are the exams, the general workload like? Did you enjoy the course content and how was TA support?","havent taken it with pirutinsky but had another class with him. he made it relatively hard, lectures were not great and exams were pretty hard. take 172 w righter in the fall if you can
you talking about  IEOR/E 120?
Isn't Fall IEOR 172 strictly restricted to IEOR/ORMS major only?
hey i wanted to double check about this, where can this information be found?
[https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-fall-indeng-172-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-fall-indeng-172-001-lec-001)

The class note says that Fall 2022 IEOR 172 is restricted to IEOR/ORMS majors only. Not sure if it will change in the future."
Can I get into IND ENG 172?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ycovro/can_i_get_into_ind_eng_172/,2022-10-24 15:40:52,"I'm on the 15th waitlist and do not belong to any reserved seat. Can I get into this course finally?
