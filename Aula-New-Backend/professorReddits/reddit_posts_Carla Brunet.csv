What Classes to Take?? Can't Decide for Summer 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dj4utj/what_classes_to_take_cant_decide_for_summer_2024/,2024-06-18 16:33:07,"Hey guys, I'm taking three classes in the summer (not sure if that is a lot, but it is 11 units) and this is my first time doing classes in the summer. I just finished freshman year and in terms of workload, my first class is relatively alright (Stats 2) with Lucas so far and I'm planning on taking Music 26AC with Carla Brunet and Psych 1 with Christopher Gade. I heard Gade is good for Psych 1 (I think?) and I'm only taking Music 26AC since I heard it is a good GPA booster. In general, I need some advice- should I take Music 26AC or Psych 1? I'm on the pre-med track just for clarification but if not, take both? ","i can‚Äôt speak for stats or music, but psych 1 w gade is very easy!
Thank you! How would you say Psych 1 w gade is easy? Is he a good grader and is it doable in the summer? I wanted to finish it now then later, so I was wondering.
as it‚Äôs relatively low work load and very doable to do well! i only rmr the midterms as assignments and the final could replace a mt, or you can just not take it if you were doing well. they grade very easily, tbh i forgot i was even in taking the class most times
ahh ok thanks!"
Music 26AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cfrtka/music_26ac/,2024-04-28 23:02:58,"Has anyone taking Music26ac with Carla S Brunet? If yes, how was her class and what were you graded on? Thanks","yep, absolutely loved it! 8 homework assignments (short responses on the readings), 2 async quizzes (midterms basically) on bcourses that were MCQ, 1 5 page paper for the midterm on a documentary, and a 10 page final paper. you're gonna need to be on top of the readings to do the weekly responses and that + skimming through the slides is enough to do well on the midterms. knocked 2 requirements out of the way, definitely recommend the class if you're remotely interested in music history
Do you think I will be fine if I do not have much background in music history?
hi, is discussion attendance mandatory ?
I'm thinking of taking it and considering it is a lower-division course and has the option of fulfilling 3 breadth requirements, I think having little to no background of music history will be fine
yes, i think we were allowed maybe one drop. fwiw discussion was really interesting!
However, I would still like u/Ravenclaw9347 take on this just to be sure üôè
absolutely no background necessary!!"
Music 26AC Fall 23/Spring 24 syllabus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ctsnca/music_26ac_fall_23spring_24_syllabus/,2024-05-16 17:48:13,\^ Title says it all. I cannot seem to find any recent syllabus about this course. I need some information before enrolling since I am already loaded with 3 technical classes next semester :(,"I took it spring 23 with Carla Brunet and it was a really easy and fun class :) not sure if she‚Äôs still teaching it/if you‚Äôd still like the syllabus but lmk!
Would you mind sending it to me as well? Thank you!"
