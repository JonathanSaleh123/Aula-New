Thoughts on Ling 120,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1d8uk0k/thoughts_on_ling_120/,2024-06-05 09:44:44,"Hi everyone, I am enrolled in Ling 120 for the coming semester. I enjoyed the syntax phase of 100, so I‚Äôm eager to dive deeper into syntax. Peter Jenks is listed as the professor, so would appreciate any thoughts on him ‚Äî as a professor and as a person. Also on Berkeleytime, the average grade is a B which doesn‚Äôt phase me too much, but I‚Äôm aiming for nothing less than an A. Thoughts on this? Thanks yall üêª","Professor Jenks is a really awesome guy. He's friendly and really passionate about syntax. He wants his students to learn and be successful in the course. With that said, the syntax course is not easy. You will have opportunities for extra credit and to ""re-take"" quizzes through a final exam, but you will need to thoroughly understand the material. The course doesn't spoonfeed answers to you. You will need to really spend time thinking critically about theory, and it's very important not to skip over the early fundamentals just because they seem easy.¬†


Basically, I highly recommend Prof Jenks as an instructor and a person, I recommend syntax as an interesting course that will challenge you, but I do not think an A is a guarantee.
Finished my linguistics degree a couple years ago. Who was your professor for 100? 120 is much more intensive than 100. It is a bit professor dependent, but when I took 100, we didn't go too deep into syntax since the professor wasn't a syntactician. Personally, as someone who hated syntax, 120 with Professor Jenks was great. He's a pretty good professor and cares, but the material can be pretty difficult at times. When I was a linguistics student, Peter was generally considered one of the best professors in the department amongst ling undergrads. GSIs can make a difference too, but I'm guessing they haven't been listed yet?
Jenks is a great professor. He‚Äôs really easy to talk to and very enthusiastic about syntax. A very animated and passionate scholar. He‚Äôs very kind and caring, gave me accommodations when I had an injury. You should definitely go to his office hours, and he recommends papers for you to read, if you‚Äôre interested.

I took syntax with him last semester, and it was a tough class. He was trying many new things with us but maybe things will smoothen out next semester when you take it. 

We had weekly quizzes that you can retake as your final if you‚Äôre unhappy with your score, hw every other week, and a final paper that you work on throughout the semester by reading a corpus of a language and developing syntax theories for it, which was probably the most stressful part of the whole course. However, Jenks is generous with deadlines and he adjusts them accordingly.

Just as a heads up the syntax you learn in LING100 barely scratches the surface, and I was literally blown away at how complex and abstract upper division syntax was. It takes work to understand the concepts and it may seem impossible when you do it, but at the end everything clicked and came together. An A is definitely not guaranteed but just keep going at it!
Just took 120 this past semester with Prof Jenks, he was a great lecturer and it was a really great class, would definitely recommend! If you put in the time I would say getting an A is very doable, assuming the structure of the course is about the same as this semester.
This is all super helpful, thanks so much for your insights. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî I‚Äôm genuinely interested in syntax and some of the topics sound really cool. It won‚Äôt be the end of the world if I get less than an A bc it seems like the class is very worthwhile, but I‚Äôm a bit of a perfectionist haha. 

What would you recommend I do to maximize my grade? Office hours, reading the textbook, grinding past exams, etc
I'd definitely recommend making use of office hours and reading the textbook. Past exams likely won't be helpful. Syntax is entirely about theory. You need to be able to understand the underlying theoretical structures, what the structures will do, and why they do those things. So syntax can be challenging because you either ""get it"" or you don't.¬†"
