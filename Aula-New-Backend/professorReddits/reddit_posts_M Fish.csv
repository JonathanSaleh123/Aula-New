How do I condition myself to eat certain foods?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bsx8tf/how_do_i_condition_myself_to_eat_certain_foods/,2024-04-01 00:17:15,"So growing up, 99.9% of the meat I ate was poultry(chicken and turkey(the bird, not the country)) and I never had any issues with those. The remaining 0.1% consisted of fish, shrimp and mutton. Was raised in Hindu household so never had beef or pork.

I didn’t like and still don’t eat mutton though because I don’t like the taste and also I think goats are adorable so I feel bad. As for fish or shrimp, the thought of eating them just grosses me out. The only exception is fish scramble where the fish is cut into really tiny pieces and has no bones. I had no issue eating that when my mom made it.

Anyways, fast forward to today: I’ve been almost exclusively eating chicken for meat even since I started university. However, I’ve been trying to diversify my palate but, not gonna lie, it’s been a struggle for my picky sensory-selective ass:

And it’s not even the taste that’s a problem.

The issue with me is that I’m a very visual person: I get grossed out and feel a visceral reaction when eating fish or shrimp because I visualize that shit.

Like, for fish, they’re scaly, have no limbs and they have those big googly eyes so they’re like mini-water-snakes. Even the pet fish I used to have really creeped me out when they died bc of the way those lifeless eyes were staring at me. And for shrimp, they have all those legs and those antennae and the shell and the black eyes so they’re like creepy ahh fuckin water cockroaches. 

Whenever those thoughts creep up while I’m eating, I can’t get myself to eat anymore fish or shrimp and I feel like puking the fish and shrimp that I just ate. At least, for fish scramble, it’s really easy for me to dissociate and to “dehumanize” the fish I’m eating since it’s almost unrecognizable from its original form. But, for anything else, I can’t. Especially shrimp since they retain that creepy crescent shape even after they’re prepared and cooked.

Right now, I’m eating some tomato and shrimp curry and, I was halfway done when suddenly I caught a glimpse of one of the crescents and I, as folks say nowadays, “got the ick” and I can’t get myself to finish it bc I’m thinking of the sea cockroaches.

How do I fix my brain to eat normslly? And how do people all around the world eat all sorts of things like snails, tarantulas, snakes, rats, cockroaches, eels, etc. bc I can’t. 

Edit: I don’t really have the visualizing issue with chicken tbh. Maybe it’s cause they don’t gross me out and also bc I’ve been eating them for so long and so regularly that it’s second nature. The only time I’m really grossed out is when I encounter sinew or liver. ","just don't. eat what makes you happy and (relatively) healthy.
Not eating red meat is not necessarily a bad thing, health wise. There are a lot of people who struggle to give up eating too much red meat, and it's also a big producer of greenhouse gases (through methane from cows / cattle, and the fossil fuel energy that goes into producing fodder). So don't consider yourself deprived in that respect. 

For fish...I'd recommend a visit to the Academy of Sciences / Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco. Will give you a different perspective on the beauty / variety of all sorts of fish.  True they don't have limbs, but they have amazingly expressive and functional fins, and on many fish you don't see the scales.  Doesn't mean you need to eat them, though.
If protein intake is your concern, you could try incorporating tofu or other plant proteins into your meals for less of an ick. no need to force urself to eat foods you find gross
https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/02/04/465305656/in-babys-first-bite-a-chance-to-shape-a-childs-taste the book they're talking about includes some strategies for adults too
Thanks, I’ll try that! It’s just that I wish I knew the root cause of my sensitivity
Thank you, I’ll check it out! And yea fish are really diverse and some are really beautiful and it’s interesting to see the different features that they’ve gained or lost based on their environment. Like, I’ve heard of this one fish species that lives in caves that is blind since the caves are totally dark so there’s no need for sight.

But, as soon as I think of putting them into my stomach, I get the ick again…

Wish I knew why
Yea I already eat a lot of pulses such as black gram, red gram, bengal gram, green gram etc.

Also greens like spinach, totakura(idk what this is called in English lol) and menthikura(fenugreek leaves)

But I just wanna know why I can’t eat those things normally lol

Bc my little brother and my parents have no issue eating fish, shrimp, mutton and the like. So it’s def not a hereditary thing I think
No problem. You aren't familiar with those foods so you don't like them.

I've been a vegetarian since 2016, and I'd probably feel the same for all types of meats.
Fair enough. Sounds like just a personal preference lol. You are in no way obligated to enjoy certain foods just because your family eats them
yeah I feel the same way even for meat substitutes and stuff. Like meat eaters love ""Beyond Burgers"" but they taste weird for me"
RIP Chinese Express,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1aycpus/rip_chinese_express/,2024-02-23 13:45:56,Does anyone happen to know the contact information for the owners of Chinese Express? I really loved their salt and pepper fish and I’m so sad they are no longer around. I want to reach out to see if I could get their recipe for it.,"And now King Dong on Shattuck has shuttered. Another stalwart from the 80s. It’s getting hard to find straight ahead OG Chinese food in Berkeley anymore. It’s all Taiwanese street noodles, House of Dumplings, etc. Not that there’s anything wrong with that but sometimes a brother just wants some Mongolian beef over rice.
They fed me through college back in 2012-2014. It was my go to, cheap meal, comfort meal, celebration meal, regular meal, all the meals. I love that place, sad to hear it’s over.
Chinese express >>> panda in every possible way
Opening panda was a bad idea.
Are they closing?
Got food poisoning twice, good riddance
What!? No! My beloved King Dong. Getting a King Dong Chicken lunch special was a treat back in the day.
Cap Chinese express wasn’t fresh at all
Why? It’s obviously more popular than Chinese Express ever was
they closed in december, there's a Hawaiian bbq place where they used to be
Yeah I've been to both a lot and I do not *hate* Panda, but Chinese Express imo was objectively better. The food tastes homemade, rice had more vegetables, and they don't load all the entrees with a fuck ton of sugar. They also had way more entree choices, and switched things up from time to time (from what I remember). Also the super nice lady.
oh rip :( used to love going there
While your opinion is valid, the fact that Panda drove it out of business so quickly shows that it might not be the opinion of the majority
Love how you’re getting downvoted for the truth lmao. Chinese express sucked. Chicken was always dry and flavorless and rice was always uncooked, crunchy, and flavorless. No restaurant goes out business within 5 months of competition opening if it’s good. If it was good people wouldn’t have switched to panda because panda is more expensive."

young boy gets goop splatted on valentine’s day,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1aqwrpa/young_boy_gets_goop_splatted_on_valentines_day/,2024-02-14 12:22:07,"Today my bus didn’t come on time so I knew I’d be late to class. “That’s fine,” I thought. “I’ll just wait here a bit longer. What’s the worst that can happen?” How naive I was. So I’m standing at the bus stop for 20 minutes or so when an unhoused fellow comes trudging in behind me a few yards away. No big deal. I look down the street to see if my bus is coming. No bus, but the man gets closer. He starts digging through his stuff and pulls out a cup of yogurt (or what I believed to be yogurt at the time). “That’s chill,” I thought. “Man is just getting his Vitamin D.” I was wrong. In one motion, he begins furiously scooping the white goop out of the cup and proceeds to fling it at me, the high-velocity projectile splattering on the back of my leg and upper thigh. In awe, I let out a small yelp. To my horror, the goop is not only white, but chunky with little brown mushy specks, which I later determined to definitely not be granola. “Bro what the fuck,” I exclaimed. He looks me dead in the eye and goes “it’s America, dude.”I stumble away, the man continuing to fling goop onto the ground in front of him, an expression like that of a dead fish plastered to his face. Stunned, I turn to my leg and one whiff takes me the fuck out. It is the most rancid dairy product I have smelled in many years. As the man limps away, a kind soul offers me a single paper towel. I try to wipe away the goop, but it simply smears in a wider pattern. My bus still isn’t here. As I wait, the smell permeates the air around me. I get on the bus, arrive twenty minutes late, and rush to the bathroom. I lift my leg onto the sink and scrub furiously, trying with all my might to wash away not only the goop, but the stain it had left on my soul. I’m on the way home now, and I am sure I will see The Goopman in a nightmare tonight.","Fear

yeah this actually happened although i played it up a bit for dramatic effect. like the goop was rancid but not that horribly rancid and it was only the back of my calf up to my knee not the back of my thigh"
Need help identifying food I hate a long time ago.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17f6gp9/need_help_identifying_food_i_hate_a_long_time_ago/,2023-10-23 23:40:54,"So I just ate some chewy stuff which just evoked this memory: (it is a bit hazy so please bear with me)

Several months ago, I was eating with my ex on one of the benches in Asian ghetto. I was eating food from Punjabi Dhaba and she ordered from another restaurant, presumably also on Asian ghetto.

She let me try a bit of what she ordered. If I recall correctly, it was white and roughly cylindrical and it was immersed in some sauce or other condiment. What I liked and what made it stand out to me was its distinct chewiness. Like, it was so chewy and that just felt so satisfying to me. 

In terms of chewiness, the food that I’m familiar with that resembles it the most is palatalikalu(పాలతాలికలు). Palatalikalu are basically these noodles made of rice flour and water/milk coated in jaggery syrup, and the consistency was VERY similar to that of the food she gave me. However, unlike the Palathalikalu, the food item in question was not sweet and I remember it being kinda bland. But, because of the chewiness, maybe it also has rice flour?? If so, that would also explain the blandness.

If anyone knows what it was or thinks they know, I’d be super grateful! And even more so if you know which place/s serve it. Thanks in advance!



Edit: 

I am pretty confident(but still not certain) that [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/s/XAUoeINO5H) is it.

Will try it ASAP and edit this post again when I do!

Edit 2: Bruh I JUST realized that I butchered the title; I meant to say “food I ate” 🤦‍♂️

I do NOT hate it at all.


EDIT 3: I FOUND IT!!! ITS THE SPICY DUKBOKGI FROM KIMCHI GARDEN BUT WITHOUT THE EGGS AND FISH

Rolls? Was it a dim sum restaurant?
Oh shit I think [it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tteokbokki) is!!!

My memory’s hazy but I’m 70% sure this is it!

I’ll try it tomorrow and update on whether it is!
Thanks, I’ll update you if I find it or think I found it!
Edited the post!
Ok so I looked up [rice rolls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_roll) but I don’t think any of these are it

Mayyyybeee it’s the Cifantuan because it does look kinda similar but it’s not immersed in a liquid like the thing I had
awesome! let me know (:
yay happy to hear you found it!
They’re served in a variety of ways. Could it be from the Korean restaurant? Rice cakes ?
I will! And I’ll leave an edit on this post!
See edit!
Added another edit!
Hmm yeah maybe it’s Korean 

I’m not sure if it’s a rice cake bc I’ve never had any rice cakes besides idli and kudumulu and this had a very different consistency from both of those
Happy for you!
Korean fish cake ? Or a yam cake? Check out this photo I saw on Yelp! https://yelp.to/9PDebXoOM5
I don’t think it’s fish bc I don’t like fish and, if it has fish, I would’ve known.

But that first picture does look a lot like how I remember it!

Someone else in this thread mentioned Tteokbokki and I’m 70% sure that is it!

Won’t know for certain until I try it though but I’m confident
Good luck!

"A Vietnamese Student's Pointless thoughts on CalDining's ""Pho Bar"" and How it can Improve",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10qke5c/a_vietnamese_students_pointless_thoughts_on/,2023-01-31 20:23:02,"The execution of the phở bar at Foothill today was although very interesting, below CalDining expectations, which really says something for many Cal students.  If you disagree and think the phở was good, please tell me to help me prove I'm going insane and elaborate why.  I'd like to point out possible suggestions to improve the 'pho bar' experience if they would like to reintroduce it.  I'll be sending these suggestions in the CalDining feedback form but thought it would be nice to share these with others.

Before I give my suggestions.  Here are some things I did enjoy from the phở bar today.  

1. There were plenty of ingredients for us to add including bean sprouts, lime, cilantro, leaves (can't remember what kind), brisket (which actually might have been the tri-tip), and much more!  There was even a condiment section with chili, hoisin, and fish sauce!  I genuinely felt like I was at a phở restaurant for a brief moment.
2. The label for fish sauce was ""nuoc nam"" <-spelled exactly that way.  I was very impressed that CalDining used the Vietnamese name for fish sauce.  I'm more familiar with it being spelled as 'nước mắm', spelled with an 'm', but that label helped me remember that the alternative spelling for nước mắm exists, so kudos to them! 
3. The beef brisket was well-seasoned and overall not bad.
4. Side note, but the cà phê sữa đá (Vietnamese Iced Coffee) was really refreshing.  I honestly think that it should be served regularly.  It's almost on par with the Passion Orange Guava juice and is the best coffee I've ever had from CalDining.

Phở is a complicated dish, I'll give them that.  However, it was far from decent in my honest opinion.   
Phở K & K, a restaurant that many Vietnamese Cal students have strong opinions about, is much superior to this.  Here are my suggestions.

1. **Cook the noodles thoroughly before serving them:**  The noodles had the consistency and texture of bean sprouts.  In other words, they were raw and quite crunchy.  Perhaps the chefs decided to undercook the noodles before serving into let the noodles simmer in the broth when added to gain the noodles' optimal texture.  However, the given broth wasn't even warm enough to do that.
2. **Serve the broth at a higher temperature:**  As stated earlier, this can help cook the noodles as its being served.  I doubt that there would be a point where the noodles become overcooked and soggy,  Also, many people don't scoop as much on their plates so it cools down quickly, especially on a paper plate. It doesn't have to be boiling hot, but at least make it as hot as the other soups that are regularly served.
3. **Give us chopsticks:**  They're cheap and don't have to be reusable.  Last semester, Cafe 3 served an Asian meal that they provided chopsticks with students.  Although it was pretty funny seeing everyone in the dining hall eat phở with a fork.
4. **Have servers serve the phở to the students:**  Many students were spilling the broth while struggling to scoop it into their small paper bowls.  There was soup all over the counter, which is the result of students waiting thirty minutes in line and quickly grabbing ingredients.  This is a huge waste of soup which could have easily been prevented.  
5. **Add more seasoning to the broth:**  It tasted like it was diluted with water.  I honestly have no clue on how someone could make a broth taste like that.  
6. This is a little extra but maybe **provide a brief history and overview of phở and how it is commonly eaten:**  This would be a brilliant idea to establish with every dish at CalDining.  Something like this would help familiarize students with the dish and how it is commonly eaten to help them understand exactly what's being served.

Why does something like this matter and why am I suddenly being so picky?  I understand that CalDining's approach to introduce a diverse menu is extremely important in order to celebrate diversity and inclusion. I also understand that I shouldn't expect a five-star meal from CalDining. As a Vietnamese person, I get very excited when UC Berkeley's dining halls serve dishes of my ethnicity.  However, I left the dining hall today feeling offended, insulted, and even a little sick.  I didn't expect perfection, but even after so many negative experiences at dining halls, I didn't think that the phở at CalDining would be this abysmal.  When a dining hall botches up cultural food, it ironically gives a bad outlook to not only CalDining, but also the culture it tries to introduce to its students.  Imagine someone trying phở for the first time at CalDining and being given raw noodles and cold broth.  Would a dish like this really encourage that person to want to try phở again?

If the point of serving phở was to demonstrate inclusivity and diversity as the #1 public university during the ""lunar new year season"", then the execution of it shouldn't have been this disappointing for so many people.  If CalDining chooses to reintroduce the phở bar, then hopefully following these suggestions would help make phở become one of CalDining's most favored items!","you had me before ""**Have servers serve the phở to the students**""

As an indian, I remember one time foothill's chana masala (or daal or smth, idr which) was just the same three bean chili they served every other day of the week
Ok listen up chef maestro — you need to remember you’re eating at a dining hall not a typical restaurant. Humble your high standards 

Same way I’m Italian but don’t complain that their pizza isn’t “authentic” enough or some crap
not that deep dawg
Berkeley food sucks news at 11
As a Pho connoisseur, myself, I appreciate this post. I wasn’t fortunate enough to be able to participate in this dining experience, but I appreciate the time and thought that you put into this post. 

For some students, depending on how deep they are into their Berkeley journey and experience, sometimes it’s difficult to find that neccessary comfort that is lacking and greatly needed just to make it to fight through the chaos another day. Certainly, a familiar and decent dish such as pho can certainly provide the type of comfort for which I speak. 

That said, I think the suggestions that you offered here are not too much to ask. I think they are reasonable and even if they can’t provide ALL of these improvements, they certainly have enough wiggle room to do a better job next time and make it a better experience for those who genuinely enjoy the dish, need comfort, or for those who haven’t even had the chance to taste the magic that is Pho. 

All-in-all, I hope a big Berkeley dining hall executive or the Berkeley pho chef reads this post and I hope it provides the necessary feedback that is needed and required to hit the Pho bowl out of the park, next time around.
Wait they had a pho bar?

I feel bad for any who had to suffer caldining pho, I can only imagine based off of the other things I’ve eaten from there last year.

**wait the noodles were raw and the broth was lukewarm**

The viet within me can only scowl at the thought.

One time they serve viet food and they screw it up.
Cal dining has been shit for years, you’re talking to a brick wall. nt though.
So what's the best pho in East bay?
Instructions not clear, penis stuck in toaster

More food reviews and tips please
The fact is is that dining establishments around any public university campus is going to survive on doing shortcuts to save money and time. So authenticity goes out the window very often.  This is why you don’t see any restaurants around the Berkeley campus being recommended for fine dining or for authenticity, whether it’s Mexican or Chinese or almost any other ethnicity.  I cringe whenever anyone asks about questions on recommendations for food, because almost any establishment near campus is going to be shopping mall food court-like quality.
bravo, thank you for this!

chào bạn! bạn vơi tôi đi ăn phở, phải không?
ayo 805 represent?????????
Quite honestly, I understand OP's point.  If the dining halls rarely serve cultural dishes like this as a main dish, and the one and only time that they serve this dish could potentially be a health hazard if not properly prepared.

Additionally, for some people, it may be their first time even trying pho, and because the dining halls gave them that first impression, it could be a huge turnoff and lowkey might rise into xenophobia with people shaming it with their extreme opinions.
Yes, I admitted in the post that I wasn't expecting much at all, but at one of the only times it seems as if my ethnic culture is represented in a main dish, it is raw and cold.  My standards were extremely low but I wasn't expecting a bunch of raw noodles and murky oily water.  Pizza gets served almost every day at CKC.  Serving pho at CalDining was definitely not something they'd do everyday and the event went extremely wrong.  Rarely does this type of cuisine get representation from CalDining and the staff at CalDining have to admit that their goal to spread awareness about Asian cuisine didn't go perfect.  I felt highly offended waiting in line to get my food when I can hear people in the dining hall talking about how they thought pho was disgusting as for many it could have been their first time trying it.  It almost reminded me of when I used to get teased for packing my cultural cuisine for lunch.  My point is that this is beyond my already-low standards for CalDining, which is really upsetting since it's one of the only times Vietnamese cuisine gets representation.
Pho at CalDining is and will always be a unique experience.  I'm certain that they'll do it again.  I really do love pho and think that it can be used to augment the diets and lives of other students.  I don't think I'll ever see all of these improvements in the future but most of these suggestions can be easily done.  Hopefully my comments in the feedback form are effective enough to spark change.
How does UCLA manage to not suck? Real question.
Uh... Chez Panisse (Michelin Green Star) is like half a mile from Campus,  Great China is literally across the street from Edwards Stadium, and is a Michelin Bib Gourmand recommendation for Chinese, and Comal is a Bib Gourmand recommended place for Mexican food (Berkeley has a third Bib Gourmand restaurant, the excellent Ippuku).
Ok đi 🤣
Ventura county represent!!
I think you are absolutely correct. It can be used to augment the diets and lives of other students. It has changed my life. True story. It helped me get my body and GI tract stable again, but in a healthy way... Please allow me to “geek out” over phở for moment and share my testimonial, haha. 

First and foremost, it’s my absolute most favorite food. EVER. Because it’s absolutely delicious but also, as someone who lives with a lot of chronic illnesses like autoimmune disease, GI issues, kidney stones, and the like, I can always count on phở when I am really sick. For the most part, it really is the only thing I can eat sometimes. It’s filing, but not too filling to where I don’t feel sick after. The only adjustment I ever have to make is that sometimes, when I am super sick, I just have to ditch the meat and keep everything else. It’s truly the only food I can actually depend on. Even when I am sick with something as simple as a cold, it’s my cold medicine. It drains my nose, soothes my throat, and calms a cough, just from the broth alone. How I choose to make and prepare my bowl is primarily contingent upon whichever medical condition is bothering most at the moment, because I know it can and it will be helpful.

A few years ago, I met and made the most dearest friend I have ever had. I once knew her as “the nice Vietnamese lady who owned the Asian market” that I frequented all the time back home. Now, I know her as pretty much: family. She gave me the traditional phở recipe and taught me how to make it properly and authentically. She also taught me all the different ways I could make it with all the different ingredients. She taught me how to make the broth from scratch and how to use the phở broth pre-made packets, depending on my needs at any given time. I would shop at her market every week, because she was the only place I could find that sold microwaveable phở bowls that I would take with me to school or work for lunch. I would also mail them to my military friends when they were on deployment. Especially my former roommate who introduced me to phở in the first place. 

I had my first bowl of phở back in 2005 in Everette, Washington. It was recommended to me by my roommate at the time. He was a surgeon in the Navy and he was a huge fan of alcohol. He swore by it as a way to heal his arch nemesis: the hangover. I don’t drink. So, I can’t speak to that. But, he recommended it to me because I was really dehydrated from a really bad kidney infection. Of course, I was better in no time. There have been times where I have been able to avoid trips to the emergency room altogether thanks to phở. If it weren’t for phở, believe me when I tell you, I would be really unhealthy and likely go weeks without eating. It soothes my tummy and my soul. When I have a bad day, I don’t go for pizza, chips, cookies, and the like, I go for a big bowl of Pho. So, I agree with you, 3,000% If more students knew about phở and how to make it and/or eat it properly, it would be a game changer for most and despite inflation, it’s still affordable. 

All that said, simply just posting about the disservice brought onto the Vietnamese community and to phở lovers everywhere by CalDining, please know that you are undoubtedly bringing awareness to anyone who takes the time to read your post and your comments. Who knows, maybe we are encouraging someone right now to try phở for the first time? BUT, I think together, you and I CAN bring about change. It seems to me that we are both equally passionate about phở and again, while I was unknowing of the phở - bar event and didn’t participate (shocker, I am out sick at the moment), I am very upset to hear that CalDining, where fellow golden bears collectively go to gather, talk and share a meal, missed a golden opportunity to provide the justice and dining experience that the Vietnamese community can be proud of and that the bowl, itself, deserves. Thus, I would hereby like to propose to you a call to action… One that we can participate in, together. Hear me out… 

To ensure that your extremely valid concerns are immediately addressed BEFORE they attempt to host another “phở bar”, I have discovered that we have a couple of options available to us to make sure that your/our concerns are heard and addressed. In looking at the UC Berkeley CalDining website, under the ‘connect’ tab of the page, CalDining offers a “comment card”. (Forgive me if you are familiar with this. I am not. I don’t live directly on campus, nor have I ever dined at Cal). But, the ‘comment card’ allows us to rate the food and offer critiques, comments, and suggestions regarding the experience. Additionally, under the ‘contact us’ tab, they offer a general email address, where I would imagine, we can do the same. So, if you are willing, I would like to encourage you to copy and paste your post into a comment card that you can fill out through the website AND into an email. I am also going to take it upon myself to submit a comment card and an additional email of support addressing the same concerns. Of course, I will put my own “spin” on it. 

While it’s true, I wasn’t there and I am not Vietnamese, I can speak to the following: 

1) the value of the much needed and urgent improvements on any future “phở - bars”. 
2) how I eat astronomical amounts of phở for health and nutrition, alone. 
3) how it helps with the management of various medical conditions and how I think a phở - bar done right can offer the same to my fellow golden bears. 
4) as a phở - lover myself, how much I have enjoyed learning about phở through the years like the different ways that I can prepare it, how to properly eat it, how & why it became popular in the first place. Thus, I can find an authentic and incredible Vietnamese phở restaurant in almost every city I have ever visited, both nationally and internationally. (Which was precisely one of your suggestions).

So, if you are willing to fill out a comment card and send an email and I am also going to fill out a comment card and send an email, then I am almost certain they will make improvements. In fact, I am going to ask that they follow up with me on my end (I encourage you to do the same), to see what suggestions are feasible, what they like and don’t like, and to see if any of them are problematic that maybe we can help them create a solution for so that the next Berkeley phở - bar at least hits the very bare minimum of standards. It’s worth a shot, yes? Nothing brings people together like two people passionate about phở. Why not?
Also isn’t there a deadass neighborhood next to campus called gourmet ghetto?
Part of it is that they’re in a wealthy area.
Chez Panisse is not close to campus. 

Great China is too Americanized.  See how many Chinese people actually are in there the next time you dine there. Same with Comal, see how many Mexican people actually are in there.
great china sucks azz
WOAH
In re-reading as I am working on reaching out to the CalDining center via comment card and email, I see that you are sending it in, which is great! My apologies for not seeing that part sooner. But I am making good on my end to send an email and comment card as a letter or support to further advance your critique, if in the event that it can help in any way.

So I’ve sorta been fishing around for other stuff to pair it up with since I enjoy CS, and I’m thinking of maybe doing a BioE minor since becoming a  cyborg is on my bucket list lol idk, but I have 0 chem experience (no AP). Basically, is BioE a good choice and if not what other paths have y’all heard of that could be fun?","BioE is a very broad field, so I'm sure there's at least something you'll be interested in. I'm not sure that you *have*  to do a minor in order to get into bioE, but you could look into research positions and stuff to get involved.
EE! It’s said the the one EE/CSupper div that will actually guarantee you a job is EECS151, and there’s a ton of other pathways. Perfect for becoming a cyborg too because mechatronic design needs EE knowledge hehe
What classes would you recommend I take if I have 0 experience?
Honestly, not even something that I considered, but it seems like a good idea!
Do you have a basic understanding of chemistry or bio?
I've taken high school level chemistry and biology at a pretty tough high school, but nothing beyond that.
I think you should be fine. Take a look at some upper div classes for bioE. The curriculum for the synthetic and computational biology major has good suggestions for junior/senior year coursework: [https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/program/syncompbio](https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/program/syncompbio). Some of them have recommended prereqs, so you can figure out where your gaps are."
Top 10 free date ideas for Cal students,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u0y470/top_10_free_date_ideas_for_cal_students/,2022-04-10 20:14:29,"I’m bored and lonely, so I am writing this to escape my legitimate work to do free unpaid internet labor that no one cares about. This list is intended for everyone who is not in EECS, as we will never be able to even dream of the riches they may attain. Bonus points if you are in a major that people ask you to explain the purpose of when you tell them what you are majoring in. So anyway, here are the top 10 free (first) date ideas I can think of as someone who tries to spend less than a crumpled $10 on any given date (except that one time...).

1. Botanical gardens: duh
2. Go hiking: Berkeley (and the bay area at large) has some great hiking trails accessible via bus, bart or mere hopping over fences. To spice things up, go to golden gate park!
3. Go to amoeba or rasputins: show each other your music taste by going through the cds and vinyls. (show off your cultural capital (social science hoes get that reference)).
4. Go to Moe’s: show each other your taste in books. This is a great way to make sure that your date is literate (you never know with these UCB students).
5. Establish a sovereign nation within the bounds of Berkeley: this unfortunately stops short of political revolution, but is a great way of quality checking your date’s political affiliation and making sure they are not a nazi. Further, on the second date you can help other non-EECS students around you find class consciousness
6. Go to Mcdonalds: ask for a cup of water and then take a seat. They probably won't kick you out if you don’t buy anything. This is a great way to benefit from the ambiance of Mcdonalds without having to shell out the money.
7. Bampfa: get into the museum for free with your student ID and show off your art knowledge (or lack thereof). For non-artistic students, I would recommend memorizing a list of shades of colors names to use during the date to make it seem like you have both a base knowledge of art and more importantly an extensive vocabulary. For example: make it a game with yourself to use the word cerulean or chartreuse when describing the art (that way you can combat the possible badness of the date with a private game of bingo).
8. A pack of cards at a picnic table: this one has versatility. Play go fish, or speed, or an actually good card game like 52 card pick up. Alternatively, you can build a house of cards together and then knock it over. You may realize the symbolism of the latter only when it is too late. such a realization of the fragility of the first few dates with someone may cause you to brainstorm a list of date ideas and aggressively regret your past actions (and texts).
9. Go up the Campanile: this is free with your berkeley id! Once you are at the top floor, you and your date can take turns pointing out the best spots on campus to cry over what could have been with a person (who is not your current date) that you never really did know. sometimes you need to get the recommendations of where to listen/self insert into to I wish you would by taylor swift
10. Berkeley Marina at sunset (or sunrise if you are wild like that): how romantic! but don't stay with your date after dark, you may get kidnapped :)","the abandoned naval air base in alameda is dope too
this is so cute and I appreciate this. no one is asking me out anytime soon but i will save this for that day! ;)
>4. Go to Moe’s

half price books babyyy cause im only a half good date
Walk thru Berkeley Bowl and treat each other to a new apple...
Berkeley Rose Garden, Clark Kerr tennis courts, scavenger hunts around campus, random sporting events (you can get into most sports with a Cal ID), sunsets at Indian Rock, and cheapskate hill were some additional free dates my college partners and I liked.
i hope i can actually use one of these before graduating lol 😭
Underrated cheap date: take a bus to Piedmont Ave, walk around the Chapel of the Chimes, have a picnic in the Mountain View Cemetery, get some ice cream at Fenton's. You're welcome, goths.
Indian Rock has always been my go to and it’s always a hit ;)
Great ideas here. I’ll contribute one which is to walk around some of theological schools on Northside. They have nice buildings and lawns that are quite different from the style of our campus.
52 card pickup is a classic, used to play that with my dad all the time
I’ve done the McDonald’s one ✅
i prefer league of legends
> Go to Moe’s: show each other your taste in books.

I thought these were supposed to be ideas for dates that are going to cost you less than $10.  Bookstores are definitely going to be out if that's the case.  I can never get out of those without spending over whatever limit I set walking in.
Walking around the marina is kinda fun as well ngl
Another rec: Taking the ac transit to solano ave in albany. Got a lot of little shops there with neat things as well as a coffee and plant shop there.
Wow this is great! If only I could find a date
> free

rip dating someone who doesn't go to Berkeley for half of these
Is the Campanile really open for top floor visits again?
no mention of big c or indian rock?
ahhhhh THIS IS CUTTTEEE

I’m too old to date most of my fellow students (27), but these sound fun!
Firstly, you need a
that's where some of myth busters was filmed!
there's a ferry from that area to SF!
yay! Let me know if you do number five and I volunteer to be a citizen for your country! :)
> no one is asking me out anytime soon

If you want to go on dates and aren't being asked by others, don't just sit around waiting for lightning to strike you.  Start asking other people out yourself.
Happy Cake Day!!🎂🎉🎁🌹🥳
ok, you are actually pulling up with the good reccs and not the troll reccs like mine.
I (don't) recommend dating apps if you want to make a hope into a reality
Wait that is actually so cute. I feel like bonus points for that date idea would be try to convert to as many new religions as you can in one day.
set a negative limit.
I command you and u/fairyofsnow to go on a date together
I think some of them allow guests :) like bampfa does. Idk abt campanille
sounds like you should break up huh. save some cash...
i think so yeah, i went up like late last semester, so idk if things have changed since then. I googled it, and it looks like it is still open [https://visit.berkeley.edu/the-campanile/](https://visit.berkeley.edu/the-campanile/) but i mean i never said these dates were all logistically possible

have u checked it out? it's really nice when the sun is setting on the water
will do, pls be a citizen! also u mentioned a taylor swift song so I instantly like u <3
you make a very valid point! its my insecurity/fear of rejection that has kept me from it, but you are right!! can’t wait around. ❤️
hey, wanted to come back on here and say I took initiative and made a tinder heh! it took guts but started talking with people - genuinely talking - and am looking forward to going on a date :) thank you for the advice!
thank youuu
lolol
When you rig the system that hard is it even the same game anymore?  Plus, what does achieving a negative spending limit look like in practice?  Does it require shoplifting or maybe pickpocketing another patron?  Lol.  Funny idea though, I like your out-of-the-box thinking.
Big if true
The campanille costs four or five bucks for non-students, as far as tourist traps go it's an incredible deal. For comparison, Coit Tower tickets cost $10 for non-residents and you have to wait in line for up to half an hour.
To hell with the date. I just want to go up the Campanile.
Yep! It really is nice there. I once saw a drug trade there! Plus, there is the USS hornet that has pretty cool tours lol
thank you, I hope this citizenship comes with a good passport that will allow me to travel the world. also, sounds like we are officially friends as we have common interests!
Good for you!!!  I know how daunting it is put yourself out there and you're absolutely right that it takes guts.  So, way to go on moving forward toward what you want.  Hope you have a good time with it.  :)
Doesnt moes buy books from patrons (like half price books)? You can bring a box of books with you and peer pressure them into buying your second hand books.
what? Im putting all the hot singles in your area in touch.
anywhere outside berkeley you have good ideas for? i know of a bunch of nice viewpoints but not a lot of great date spots lol
:) <3
I’m down sure WHY NOT
it is expensive, but the oakland zoo is cool. they have lions, and tigers and bears oh my! There is also the museums in sf which are fun (and have free days). There is also first friday at lake merrit which is lit. also, the deyoung in golden gate park has a free view tower. also what are the viewpoints you know?
omg if you two actually go on a date, keep me updated. ( u/fairyofsnow are you, do you, can you make my matchmaker dreams come true?)
i can totally show u a few 👀 but i really like views from the albany bulb, the hall of science, and from costco (unironically)
well damn, came to reddit tonight to post stupid jokes and left with the future love of my life 👀

Thanks! ,"My best pal harry can give you lessons here at peoples park. Why do you think there ain't as many squirrels here as there are on the campus. harry once caught two squirrels at the same time with a laundry basket. We then kept them as pets for a while and called one of them chip and the other dale, because they were always humping. Harry started givin chip and dale our stash of cocaine and when they got high they would move so fast. Well they got addicted to coke and then harry forgot to give them some so they chewed their way outta that basket and found the stash. They stole it and ran up a tree with 100 dollars worth of the stuff. I never seen harry so sad. Those squirrels are crazy now, crazier than most of the hobos here. they'll attack anyone.
nice try /u/squirreleater1
Yes where does this club gather?
Can you join as a non student? That looks really fun."
"""Life isn't just about school"" - CalSO Leader [Rant]",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3ccvsq/life_isnt_just_about_school_calso_leader_rant/,2015-07-06 15:45:22,"When I went to CalSO they emphazied that “life isn’t just about school” and that it is very important to find a community or a support group/person, but to be honest all I did at my CC was wake up, read the paper, go to school, exercise, do homework, sleep then repeat, and I was totally content with that routine. I didn’t have any primary relationships, just a bunch of secondary relationships that faded once the semester was over. Life was just about school and I loved it. 


I like people, I’m not depressed, and generally have a positive attitude. I’m just pretty introverted and during my free time I enjoy engaging in individualistic activities such as running, biking, fishing, backpacking, and above all reading (mostly stuff related to my major). 


I can see how someone would argue that another person/group could be helpful during tough times, and I am sure that’s the case for some people and I see no problem with that, I just feel like my intrapersonal skills are pretty solid and I can rely on myself to work through “tough times.”


Reflecting on my rant, I guess I was just disappointed to hear “life isn’t just about school” because that’s exactly what it has been to me and I love it that way.


Reflecting even further on my rant, I guess this subreddit is in a sense a community that I belong to. Sure, it’s not the deep connection forged between two people in person, but it is something. Whoa, I didn’t even realize this until I finished writing this.


Thanks, r/Berkeley. :)
","What your Calso leader was clumsily trying to prevent was burn out and isolation. Most students at CAL were the top of their respective schools and will generally push themselves harder than they need to. They aren't used to not being the top fish, and that can have disastrous consequences outside of just burning out in class. This is a warning to people who believe they have to work towards some invisible standard to impress others.

If you are content with your school/life balance, then you are already ahead of the game. 
My time at Cal was filled entirely by the #Fieri2015 campaign...and I'm fine with that. 
I'm a cc transfer as well and it's going to be hard to get out of that routine. I was the same as you. Work, school, study, eat, sleep. Anything I do for fun is basically by myself now, with an occasional party or concert to see my friends. I was content too. Overall I'm so excited to not have this routine anymore, but it's going to be weird. 

But as the top comment states, at least we'll have some dank memes on the way to having a different life.
[deleted]
Hope you dont get too bothered about a comment like this. Just do your thing man disregard what others say. 
People with proper life/work balance and who aren't stressed 24/7 (if school never stressed you until exhaustion it will here) work better, more efficiently and don't burn out. Almost every successful person I know knows this and realizes it. That doesn't mean there isn't dead week go time with 24/7 studying and caffeine, but there's also time where you go out and party or go to sleep early or just decide that you've studied enough for the day. I think you'll understand them a lot more even if you still don't agree a year from now.

If the sub gives you that distraction from work then more power to you. I like to post here for the memes and free karma tho.
It sounds like you'll do just fine at Berkeley, then.
OP, you'll need to make friends and connections while at Cal, which won't fit into your introversion, but will pay dividends for years and years after graduating.

Jobhunting isn't a total meritocracy -- it's mostly networking. And keeping in touch with people during school is the best way to get where you want to go after school. Even if they're not your peers, networking with alumni and faculty is a great way to bolster your own personal network.

It's just something to keep in mind. The student with so-so academics and a great personal network is going to go a lot further than the introvert with great grades and not much else. Unless you want to go to grad school, then it's great grades plus a great faculty network.
It sounds like you have plenty going on outside of school: ""running, biking, fishing, backpacking, and above all reading""

Perhaps the calso person did a bad job, but he was trying to talk about people who come and do nothing except school, value themselves solely based on their performance, and are eventually crushed by an unsustainable lifestyle and unrealistic expectations. This is a very real problem for a lot of people.
Your life wasn't really about school if you had free time to do those extracurricular activities. There are students here who literally focus on school and nothing else at all. Every moment is just study, study, study. If all you want to do is study, apply to grad schools and then you'll really love the life. For undergrad, I'd recommend continuing to do those extracurricular activities while you still have time. 
...... You do you boo. If isolation, long hours and work is your thing, do it. Life of what you make of it. 

Dank memes and rare Pepe's. Nothing better. 
> if school never stressed you until exhaustion it will here

This is the key line. I would imagine it's very different here from your CC.

OP, at the least, I recommend you make some friends. You will probably end up lonely if you don't. Even introverts get lonely.

I like Fish and Bird, right off the corner of Haste and Shattuck. I’ll miss the days of eating outside, not. Definitely on the pricier side.  Geta in Oakland is a hole in the wall place, really good though, but since it’s small, hard to get a seat.

CalDining needs to change.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sckz3f/caldining_needs_to_change/,2022-01-25 10:55:03,"Picture this: you're a freshman or junior transfer who doesn't know anybody.  You got railed by successive midterms.  After a long day, you just want to eat, but Cafe 3 is the only option.  You walk in and your options are 4 hour old pizza, tilapia and veggie medley, or the salad bar.  You choose the salad bar and fish because you want to be healthy.  You sit in the corner and eat half the food because it is literally undercooked.  Later that night, you shit your guts out for 4 days because you got Norovirus.   Now you're behind in class and have to play catch-up the rest of the semester, constantly worried if you're gonna pass.

&#x200B;

It's frankly embarassing for a ""prestigious"" university like Berkeley to be serving such abysmal food on the daily.  CalDining horror stories are nothing new and extend years into the past.  Not only is the food quality subpar (classics like Veggie Medley, Polenta, Tilapia, bug salad), I'm sure you've all seen someone or yourself get sick with Norovirus salad, or seen raw fish and meat.  I myself have seen  cockroaches scuttling around on the floor of Crossroads.  The only thing that was edible was cereal and milk (and looking at a recent post, even this isn't safe anymore).   CalDining also has issues with their staff, I'm not sure what exactly goes on and why they strike so much, but if things were fine I don't think they would.  It's obvious to anyone that CalDining is failing in multiple aspects.

We as students should push for better dining halls with very high quality food.  People will say it's expensive, but lots of us are paying a huge amount of money for seriously inedible food.  Imagine having high quality, safe-to-eat, delicious food at the dining halls.  Food waste will be minimized because people will actually be able to eat.  I saw so many people throw out whole plates of food because it's unsafe or just disgusting. Additionally, Cal's reputation as a university can only increase.  Everyone I know raves about UCLA's dining hall and how it's so amazing, with crepe bars, steak nights, pro chefs, etc.  That is an extremely convincing selling point for a lot of prospective students for UCLA, and a convincingly nightmarish thought for prospective Cal students given the horror stories that come out of CalDining.  Lastly, student mental health (and physical) will immediately improve.  You all know the feeling of having to eat CalDining. Food is so important and Cal should not be neglecting it.","Oh my god vegetable medley 😭 just throw all the leftover rejected vegetables into a pot and it counts as a whole new meal I guess
As an alumnus, I’m seriously considering not donating until they get their shit together with CalDining. I don’t want my money padding an administrative budget while they feed students maggots and spoiled milk. Frankly, it’s embarrassing. 

That said idk if that makes any sense and I don’t really have money to donate anyways. Can I earmark my donation for the dining halls?
my community college had amazing food. I hate Cal for this.
Better to rid yourself of dining plans asap. I had a wonderful time eating my meals from the restaurants near campus.

i do agree tho, UCLA has great dining halls like b plate. even their ""worst"" dining hall is pretty good.
CalDining is really bad. I have friends who skip 2+ meals a day because the dining halls are so terrible. That's just not healthy. If you have a couple minutes, email a couple of these important people like Ms. Lee and Mr. Santos: [https://deanofstudents.berkeley.edu/about/meet-the-team-staff-directory/](https://deanofstudents.berkeley.edu/about/meet-the-team-staff-directory/)

(I sent an email already and actually got a response. I assume filling out the CalDining review cards does nothing.)

Would appreciate if ppl who saw this comment could upvote so more people could see the link. I feel like the quality of the food is something worth spending a couple minutes emailing about. I think this is something that a lot of people can put energy behind. Thanks.
What I don’t understand is how much we pay for dining hall food when you live in the dorms and we get this shit. There’s no fucking way they’re spending more than 50% of what we pay them 

It was a running “joke” 2 years ago (when I lived in dorms) that the food at croads was literally prison quality. Just slop on plates. The only thing that was in any way redeeming was croads weekend brunch
Cal Dining has been on a steep downward spiral since like 2019 and it hasn’t recovered. It was just unbearable to me at a certain point and it felt like a waste that I was paying for it, when I’d get something from somewhere else.
Protesting is what we’re known for right? Why aren’t we protesting about this?
Because no matter how bad it is, no one is not going or leaving because of the food so long as there is something they can say is ""food."" School rankings don't care about food either. 

Its the same reason why air travel is so awful. People complain, but in the end they don't care enough for anything to change.

Also, at schools with ""good"" food like smaller liberal colleges, they get in trouble for why they are spending SO MUCH MONEY on food instead of more important needs. There is no way to win this one.
Btw there’s not even pizza anymore except for Clark Kerr

Edit: most dining halls have one food option atm. No campus restaurants other than GBC open
This is so disappointing! A decade ago the food was actually quite good
I think it's a labor issue. The university treats dining hall workers like shit, pays them shit. High turnover, poor job prospects. They could attract more experienced workers if they had a better work environment.
Exactly my point in my earlier post.  I am absolutely disgusted with CalDining.  They really think that this crap is okay?  What everyone is describing lately goes against several health codes and violations.
I saw this on another page. Any company or institution's most timely response is always, always to bad press.   


""My name is Tanay Warerkar and I’m an editor on the food team at the SF Chronicle. We’ve seen some posts shared online of rotting food and long lines at the dining facilities at Berkeley.

You can reach me on my cell at 914-309-8979 or by email at tanay.warerkar@sfchronicle.com""
I lived in the dorms all last year (2020-21) and barely ate out because of covid restrictions. I'm pescatarian so my only experiences with CalDining have been with their fish and veggie options but even those made me SICK on numerous occasions. I understand how the university can play the funding card on how bland the food is, but training employees on proper food safety and maintaining quality control does not require that extra funding and for such a prestigious university it's concerning how much they don't care about food safety.
It's quite unfortunate. I was actually impressed with the menu for the first week of Crossroads and was considering upgrading my meal plan. However, after reading horror stories I decided to hold off a bit. Glad I did. The food this week has, in comparison, tasted bland to the point where I was considering tossing it out. No bug salads, but just really bland... The chicken tenders last week tasted restauraunt quality, as if they were freshly made. This week, it tasted like something I'd find from the frozen section in safeway. The quality of the ingredients in general also tastes a bit offputting. I don't expect pasture-raised organic chicken from whole foods but damn they should really find a better supplier.

In their defense, though, I still think CalDining gives you a good deal in terms of quantity for the money. You could go there and acquire enough food for the entire day and it'd only cost you 10 bucks. However, if you're one of those people who just gets one entree and bounces I don't see why you wouldn't just go to a restaurant.
I don’t feel good for days after eating the dining hall food. My stomach aches man. For paying so much in dining hall food it’s ridiculous.
Crossroads was fairly decent around 2016-2017. I wonder what happened.
I actually quite like the dining hall food
UCLA is dealing with the same issues
Before UCB implement dining upgrade: 63k tuition

After UCB implement dining upgrade: 100k tuition.

Watch your parents slap you silly.

Tbf, the cafeterias are still better quality than chow halls at camp lejeune.
[deleted]
i have this theory that cafe 3's kitchen is actually just one giant pot over a wooden fire. at the start of each day, they fill the pot with water and dump whatever they can find in the fridge and cabinet. after a few hours, they use the ladel to fish everything out and separate it again by type. then it's put out to be eaten.

on a side note 90% of what they serve could be made substantially more stomachable if they gave us basic condiments like salt.
They won’t change until people start getting hospitalized from food poisoning.
nooo not your 20 annual donation :((
Same here. In my day CalDining was cheap and edible. School officials should not be getting raises when such a huge problem exists.
The dining halls are run by housing and dining which are profit center for the university. If you donate to the dining halls it will just increase their profits.
RIGHT, my cc HITTT after class
YOOO FR my small cc in the middle of nowhere has some bomb ass food
exactly
I’m not gonna lie, I almost went to UCLA for the food. Just narrowly decided on cal cuz I thought it’d be a better fit for me/better CS program, but I was very close to going to UCLA cuz the dining is supposed to be top shelf. I’m confident that there were people on the other side of that. It’s not like dining was the only thing I considered, but given that cal and UCLA are both good universities, I bet we lose people to ucla over food

Also, I believe this post is mainly talking abt like health issues. Undercooked food and chunky milk is like genuinely unhealthy for people, and should be changed
Clark Kerr a decade ago was good. Crossroads sucked- I lost 10 pounds instead of gaining my freshman 15 cause the food was just unappetizing
[deleted]
Exactly it’s even worse
You don’t get salt?  Sorry that’s probably my fault. When I was there in the 90s we had salt and pepper but we’d collect them all and try to see how high we could stack them.
Hell, I worked at caldining. Other then the rats at Foothill, it wasn’t nearly as disgusting as it looks now.
The dining halls are run by Cal Dining, Res Life is a completely different department under the umbrella of RSSP   
Send all complaints to this guy:
Christopher Henning, Executive Director, Cal Dining
I went to FH or C3
I’m just ststing from what I have seen from the posts I have seen on the UCLA subreddit.

Like serving raw chicken
One off experience.
People repeatedly making the same complaints is an one off experience?
No but having the #1 ranked dining program in the country vs Berkeley’s shitstorm is not quite comparable
[deleted]
- I attended a summer program there in 2019 and got to stay in the dorms and the food was great.

My comment was only focusing on the complaints that I have seen since the fall semester began"
