Niren Murthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11qtzli/niren_murthy/,2023-03-13 19:26:18,"I do not like. I do not enjoy. In fact, I despise. Niren Murthy. You cannot teach. You get so much wrong. Your lecture ends and Iâ€™ve learned nothing. Itâ€™s not me, itâ€™s you. Worst of all, I think you think youâ€™re doing a good job. You have not deterred my passion for biology. Instead, you have only made me realize how easy it must be to have a decent h-indexâ€”you donâ€™t even need to understand the material, you just need to make friends in research and project confidence! 

Goodbye and good riddance. By the way, I recommend you review The principles of organic chemistry. Your colleague, Dr. Marsden does a great job explaining if you need additional resources.

Hello Dr. John DueberðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜©. We have been waiting for you.","awful professor but I don't despise him.  Hoping dueber is better.
Literally true. Murthy useless, BIOE 11 high key useless class. If the stupid department didnâ€™t mandate it, people would just take CHEM 3B
fax. Murthy just says a bunch of unrelated shit and acts all esteemed. Iâ€™ve heard him fuck up the most basic ochem shit itâ€™s just embarrassing. I donâ€™t know why we have to learn from someone who A) doesnâ€™t want to be there//doesnâ€™t work hard at teaching and B) fails so badly at his job that like 80% of kids donâ€™t go to his class. 

Iâ€™m ngl, I could have aced his midterms after studying for three days and never watching a lecture. Such a fucking waste of my time."
Should I drop 61c?,https://i.redd.it/qjyskkz9upbc1.jpeg,2024-01-10 17:43:34,"For reference, I got an B+ in 61a and A in 61b. Is it worth finishing the 61 series now, or delaying 61c for a semester?","That 11am -2pm break

Cs70 + 61c was high workload imo.  Idk ur exact situation but if ur trying to declare cs Iâ€™d drop it since u alr have 20 units.  Otherwise itâ€™s best to get it over with
It depends on your situation, what your major in, what class are you, and what you are shooting for for a grade. In general, when these types of posts are done, you have to give full disclosure.
20 units is a lot but besides that u should be good. Just stay on top of the course work.
(lol i would personally drop physics cuz Ronnie sucks ass and the course staff is wack too) 

Lisa Yan is the best professor i have ever had so it might be worth it to take 61c just for that (imo better than Dan). and if you donâ€™t need to declare then i would drop 70 (cuz of workload) and/or do what i first said (cuz of personal opinions lol)

BioE, but yeah college of engineering so no need to declare"
