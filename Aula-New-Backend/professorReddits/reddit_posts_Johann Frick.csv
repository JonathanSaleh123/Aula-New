Philos 2 with Johann Frick?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ccdq83/philos_2_with_johann_frick/,2024-04-24 17:02:38,"He has no reviews on RMP, has anyone here taken a class with him and what are your thoughts?","One of my favorite Professors of all time. He’s such a nice guy, super helpful in office hours, and his lectures are extremely engaging! Zero hesitation, take his class
That sounds super great because I’m taking a class in the same room right before so I’ll be sitting in the room during Berkeleytime and having extra time to talk to him would be so awesome"
Philosphy 2 with Johann Frick,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ubm84e/philosphy_2_with_johann_frick/,2022-04-25 07:18:16,Thinking of taking this class as a breadth for Fall 2022. Any reviews/advice? Haven't heard anything about the professor but find the class content interesting (at least from the brief syllabus). Would appreciate any reviews or syllabus that you can send over!,"He is the LS 22 prof this semester. He’s pretty good.
Was it worth it?

There was only one rating for him from Princeton. He's teaching it this sem so I thought I'd ask"
