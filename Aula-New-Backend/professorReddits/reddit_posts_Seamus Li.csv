ECON 140/Seamus Li,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cvizbl/econ_140seamus_li/,2024-05-19 00:44:15,"Has anyone taken Econ 140 with Seamus Li before? I'm taking this class with him this summer. Please share the experience if you took his class before.

","I took it this spring semester and in my experience, the lectures are not super well organized, but the exams are almost copy + paste from past exams. 
As long as you pay attention in discussions, do practice exams(!!), and show up for attendance, then it’s a pretty easy A. He assigns problem sets for practice, but they’re not mandatory. 
The main point is to make sure you understand the exam questions and reasonings for the answers. Then just memorize those and apply them.
Thanks! Could you share the syllabus with me?"
