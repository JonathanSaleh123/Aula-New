Michelle Baptiste (ColWrit R4B) - is she tough?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eygkw8/michelle_baptiste_colwrit_r4b_is_she_tough/,2020-02-03 15:51:23,I have heard she gives a lot of work and so long it has been true. But is the amount of work always this high?,"yes she could use some tenderizing
Pineapple works well.
What?
Huh?
How will pineapple work on Baptiste?
The enzymes in pineapple tenderize meat very well.  Add to the marinate & soak minimum of 4 hours before grilling"
Michelle Baptiste or Tyler Blakeney for RnC B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/exxlpg/michelle_baptiste_or_tyler_blakeney_for_rnc_b/,2020-02-02 15:39:50,"I am currently enrolled in both ColWrit R4B with Michelle Baptiste and French R1B with Tyler Blakeney and I can't decide which one to take and which to drop.

I know that Baptiste gives an A to 52% of her class (8-ish people in a class of 17) but I have no idea about Tyler. I have heard Baptiste gives A LOT of work (and so far, that has been the case for me). But i know her distributions are good. If someone could give me the distributions for Tyler, it would help me a lot.",
