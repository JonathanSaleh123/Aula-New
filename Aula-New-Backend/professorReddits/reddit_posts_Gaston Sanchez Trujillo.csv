Has anyone taken STAT 134 with Vadim Gorin or STAT 133 with Gaston Sanchez Trujillo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17fnv9e/has_anyone_taken_stat_134_with_vadim_gorin_or/,2023-10-24 14:27:26,Has anyone taken STAT 134 with Vadim Gorin or STAT 133 with Gaston Sanchez Trujillo? (or other classes with them and knows if they're good professors). I'm not a stats major (I'm applied math and CS) and haven't taken a stats class since high school so leaning towards stat 133 since it seems much easier content-wise. ,"i also need to know how vadim is  as a prof, taking 134 in spring 😭🙏
sanchez is a dry af lecturer, thank the gods you don't have lucas for 134..
So anybody has an experience with vadim gorin,,
Stat 133 will be easier for sure but it is also not a well-run class (at least as of 4 years ago, unsure how much has changed)
Ur not a stats major, so why even take Stat 133 unless u need units or something or tryna learn R from scratch, data100 is basically >= 133, it’s more so j a computing class. Stat 134 is where u learn all the important stats content.
When you took the class, did Sanchez teach? And also, when you say the class is not well-run, what parts of the class did you think could be improved?"
Gaston Sanchez Trujillo or Noureddine El Karoui,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/khq6bn/gaston_sanchez_trujillo_or_noureddine_el_karoui/,2020-12-21 13:03:23,"I’m debating between taking stat 133 or 135 next semester, and unfortunately ratemyprofessors has low reviews for both professors. Has anyone had experience with either and can offer me some insights? Thanks :-)","[deleted]
I took stat 133 last semester. Professor Sanchez isn't nearly as bad as the reviews say he is. I liked him a lot. He's a nice, relatable guy and explains everything clearly, although he does move a bit slow. His lectures were pretty entertaining. He responds quickly to emails and is always there to help you out.

Grading wise, labs are based on completion - homework and projects are graded a bit harshly, but fairly. The quizzes are a bit difficult, so prepare well for them and know the material. The final was a breeze compared to the rest of the work we did in the semester - Professor Sanchez and the GSIs really gave us a donation there.

Throughout the semester there were opportunities for extra credit and other grade boosts. I'd recommend you take this class if you're into data science.
Gaston's kinda meh but there's no other option, plus the class usually ranges from medium if you've never programmed before to really easy if you have a programming background.
Nice, upvoted
Dang alright, thanks for that info!
That’s definitely reassuring to know. Thanks a lot! (:
Thank u!"

I searched online and many students did not suggest to take any course with him but I took his stat 133 and I thought that was very good experience...

Can anyone share the feeling about his stat 154 course?",Don't
Stat 133 with Gaston Sanchez,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18jdjfl/stat_133_with_gaston_sanchez/,2023-12-15 15:33:41,"I'm a non-stats major and I just want to say that Gaston gets excessive amounts of hate on RMP for no reason and it's not deserved. Just finished taking Stat 133 with him and he's genuinely such a nice guy. His last lecture was so heartwarming and compared to other programming classes I've taken at Cal, and it made me genuinely enjoy working with R, despite it being my first R-based class. To anyone who wants to take this class as an R intro, I highly recommend it. Overall pretty fun, great teaching, you'll do great if you just go to lectures and do all of the assignments","Agreed. Gaston is an awesome professor and I found him to be very helpful and encouraging in making sure that you not only succeed in his class but get a good and applicable understanding of R at the entry level
I concur. His style of teaching is pretty dry, but he cares about the students and is understanding with grading, courseload, etc. Great class I really enjoyed it.
Absolutely agree, last lecture was very sentimental, I've been to his office hours for help on the shiny apps and he really is a great guy, great professor in my first semester here as a transfer student
He’s nice, but I think the issue comes with his lackluster teaching
I found it pretty engaging, I sat in the front row and asked questions on what sth different would output and he would always explain it and then run to confirm. He also was great at explaining concepts but ngl I never went to his OH"
Has anyone taken Stat 33A Introduction to Programming in R?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/seb690/has_anyone_taken_stat_33a_introduction_to/,2022-01-27 14:54:38,Professor is Gaston Sanchez Trujillo and it's a 1 unit course. How hard is it for someone with no programming/coding experience?,"Yea I took it and liked it. Good into and it will help if you take other R based classes like stat 20. But I will say it was kinda a lot of work for a one unit class.
If you have a knack for programming it will be easy. R is extremely easy to write and read.  


If you have a very hard time with programming, then you will do ok but it will be hard and a lot of work for you. Do a few programming tutorial with R on your own and see how it goes, the software is free."
STAT133 curve,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ri3v8q/stat133_curve/,2021-12-16 16:01:25,Just wondering if anyone who took the class previously knows if he curves this class or what the grade bins are. Taking it with Gaston Sanchez Trujillo,"How was the class tho and the prof
[deleted]
I thought it was pretty good, little heavy on the assignments but the teacher was nice and helpful
I was looking for point bins, ie how many points is an A vs an A-"
How's Gaston Sanchez?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7bzi7l/hows_gaston_sanchez/,2017-11-09 22:47:05,"Thinking about taking him for Stat 133 next semester, does anyone know or have experience of being in his class?","If you have basic knowledge in programming (61a), you'll be fine for that class.
133 is pretty straight forward no matter who is teaching, just from what I hear and my own experience
Easiest tech class I took here.
Literally the easiest professor for the easiest course at Berkeley. Gaston was great. Would strongly recommend taking the course with him. His actual final exam was a straight copy of the practice final with different numbers.

NOOOOOOOOOOO :(
Don’t listen to this lmao. The hardest part of this class is remembering when the homework’s are due. There’s no need to go to lectures, since you pick up whatever you’ll need in lab and on google. Super easy tests. Just make sure you turn stuff in because he’s not going to give you much wiggle room if you miss assignments."
Rate my schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15f2yar/rate_my_schedule/,2023-07-31 22:14:31,"Does this seem doable? For reference, I got a B+ in 61a and took an algebra-based physics class in high school. I've also self-studied the discrete math portion of 70.

Does anyone have experience with stat 33b? Also can someone send me a recent syllabus for BioE 114? The last syllabus on TBP is from a covid semester.

Rather tough but doable. Would recommend taking an easier schedule, probably swap out a technical with a breadth.
this is definitely going to be a grind if you go through with it
Is it doable, yes. 
Is it going to be tough, yes. 
Your going to be in straight grind mode the whole semester."
Stat 133 Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pikroo/stat_133_advice/,2021-09-05 13:33:50,"Currently enrolled in 133 with Gaston Sanchez and have heard his lectures, assignments, and exams are all quite different. Can anyone recommend the material my friends and I should be studying to prepare for exams?","I remember Gaston has written an online textbook, which is pretty brief and helpful, and generally covers a large portion of the exam materials. (make sense, since he wrote the book lol)"
Gaston for Stat 154?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dyc09l/gaston_for_stat_154/,2019-11-18 15:59:29,"For anyone who has taken Stat 154 with Gaston Sanchez, how is he? I have him now for 133 and he is awful, but have heard that he's better for 154 so would love to know people's thoughts.","No one's slick as Gaston

No one's quick as Gaston

No one's ~~neck’s~~ brain’s as incredibly thick as Gaston's

For there's no man in ~~town~~ Cal half as manly

Perfect, a pure paragon
Can't answer your question but I'm somewhat considering taking 133 with him and I'm curious why he's awful"
