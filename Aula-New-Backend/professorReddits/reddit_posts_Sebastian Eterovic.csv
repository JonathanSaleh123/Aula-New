Help: Which Professor should I take for Math 104?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/djhxai/help_which_professor_should_i_take_for_math_104/,2019-10-17 20:54:00,"Currently my options are; **Nicholas Miller, Mariusz Wodzicki, Ryan A Hass,**  **Yu-Wei Fan,**  **Sebastian Eterovic, Rui Wang,**  **Philip J Wood**

Thanks for the help!","Not wodzicki if you value your sanity.  I've heard very good about Hass.
I have Hass right now for 104 and he’s a wonderful teacher! Lectures are very example based, and he walks around the classroom chatting with students. Neat notes for if you miss a class, very fair midterm 1 (aside from one question but whatever), and generally available.
Echoing the comments about Hass - he's a very engaging lecturer which I find relatively uncommon among professors, and his assignments are reasonable
Can vouch for Yu-Wei Fan! amazing chalkboard work, his clarity in lecture is superb, and he answers every question thoughtfully and precisely. Every student who’s gone to his office hours lauds him for his helpfulness.

He is also great at managing admin stuff, keeping us students well informed about what material will be covered, and about upcoming deadlines. 

11/10 in my book. And I come from CC, where I feel like I had great professors, but was definitely coddled.
Not Wang. She means well but the language barrier and accent makes her hard to understand, at least for me.
Rui Wang, and I cannot stress this enough. Crystal clear lecturer (unless you have an issue with her accent - see another comment below) and is incredibly helpful during office hours and always open to questions. Of all the classes I've taken at cal so far, analysis with Professor Wang probably made me smarter more than any other class has. I found it difficult initially, but that is by virtue of the difficulty of the material and my inexperience coming into the class - not because of quality of instruction. She uses Rudin, and will give you a rigorous foundation in basic topological concepts that should prepare you well for 202 A/B. She structures the class logically, so that you get a complete treatment of the constructions of the reals, and almost everything is generalised to topological spaces and metric spaces, unlike other sections which may just state a completeness axiom for the reals, and then specify all work to the reals for the majority of the semester and do some basic work with metric spaces in the last two weeks (making for a very boring, and much easier class). You will also get some very basic introductory concepts in functional analysis which few of the other sections bother introducing at all (equicontinuity, uniform convergence, arzela ascoli).  I would take her again in a heartbeat. The only possible qualm you may have is her accent, and that the class is rather fast paced if you do not have any background in proof based math at the level of abstraction that 104 goes into (I did not. Many others found the pace just right or too slow even). I for one, did not find her accent particularly hard to follow."
Which math professor would you recommmend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6cbeq/which_math_professor_would_you_recommmend/,2020-04-22 16:53:00,"I haven't taken any uppers for math yet but I'm hearing so many bad things about a lot of profs :k. The classes I'm thinking of are 104(taught by Ian L Charlesworth,Sebastian Eterovic,Koji Shimizu), 110(taught by Zvezdelina Stankova), 113(taught by Semen Artamonov), and 128A(Olga Holtz) Thanks in advance :)","Art for 113 is really good imo, sometimes his lectures and instruction are unclear, but he is a massive chiller and cares that you do well. Fair and all that, I have no exp with the other sorry
I took math 113 with Koji Shimizu and it went pretty well. He is very happy to interact with students and answer questions. I will warn though he does have an accent (I did not find it hard to understand but hey you do you).

I took math 110 with Zvezda and I have been traumatized. I would say the class content is fair but she tends to be rather intimidating. Some people really like her, some people still have nightmares about saying ""dobro utro."" She also has an accent but it is pretty mild (again, you do you). Learning about Bulgaria was cool I guess.

As for the difficulty of classes (from easiest to hardest based on my sad grades): Math 128A, Math 110, Math 104, Math 113.
Holtz I’ve heard is very good for 128A.
Aight, thanks a lot!
Wow is 128A easier than 110? I had not expected that since I always thought 128 is terrible
Got it thanks :)
oof sorry for slow reply. I don't think 128A is easier than 110. However, I did get a higher grade in 128A than math 110. I don't know how that happened but such is life. I took 128A later so perhaps my more developed skills helped.
I see, thanks a lot :))))"
