ENVECON C118 VS CS 164 Chasins VS DATA 101 Lisa Yan in fall 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12e297g/envecon_c118_vs_cs_164_chasins_vs_data_101_lisa/,2023-04-06 16:40:31,Does anyone know which course is easiest in terms of difficulty and workload?,"101 only offered in the fall so it may be a bit of an exclusive option
I‚Äôd take 101 simply because Prof Lisa Yan. She‚Äôs fantastic and genuinely cares about students succeeding. Oh also she‚Äôs a great lecturer, puts in time to make examples relevant to what students care about/should care about. 10/10 do recommend.
Data 101 if not then C118
Lisa Yan is a gem
ENVECON C118 is amazzing if you get Prof. Villas-Boas
Data 101 doesn't allow the time conflicts."

Advice for what UD classes to complete before graduating for an EE/Hardware career,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8vpfq/advice_for_what_ud_classes_to_complete_before/,2022-04-21 12:39:06,"So I guess this would be a follow-up post to my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice\_for\_ee\_classes\_for\_fall\_and\_spring\_2022/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice_for_ee_classes_for_fall_and_spring_2022/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So here is my current plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

105 with Ali M Niknejad - 4 units

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123, 130 and 189

&#x200B;

Replies from original posts mentioned that the workload for Fall might be too crazy.

And so I have an alternative plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123 and 189

&#x200B;

So it all boils down to if I graduate finishing 5 UD classes (120, 123, 151, 188, and 189). Would this be a good set of classes to take for an EE/hardware job?

If not then I'm forced to go with the first plan and finish 7 UD classes (105, 120, 123, 130, 151, 188, and 189) and suffer for 2 semesters.

&#x200B;

 Thanks for the help!","Don‚Äôt take 188. Useless for your career goals and imo pointless to take in general. 

Taking 120/151 are a must. Simply putting 151 on my resume got me interviews from top hardware companies.

If you‚Äôre up for it you could squeeze one of 126/127 (I liked 127 better)
Since I‚Äôm not an analog hardware engineer maybe I shouldn‚Äôt comment, but if you‚Äôre interested in that kind of work I would almost suggest using summer to self study 105 and taking 140 next fall instead. I‚Äôve heard that 105 is a good class but won‚Äôt get you any job interviews by itself. 120/140/151 will be a heavy workload but if you truly have a passion for these things I think you‚Äôll learn a lot and have fun.
Thank you for your reply! Does it matter if I take 105 and 130 for hardware? Does having them benefit a lot? Does not having them hurt? I'm for sure taking 120, 123, and 151 just not sure about 105 and 130."
Should I drop 61c?,https://i.redd.it/qjyskkz9upbc1.jpeg,2024-01-10 17:43:34,"For reference, I got an B+ in 61a and A in 61b. Is it worth finishing the 61 series now, or delaying 61c for a semester?","That 11am -2pm break

![gif](giphy|PmABbbUe3IqUKSOIBV|downsized)
Cs70 + 61c was high workload imo.  Idk ur exact situation but if ur trying to declare cs I‚Äôd drop it since u alr have 20 units.  Otherwise it‚Äôs best to get it over with
It depends on your situation, what your major in, what class are you, and what you are shooting for for a grade. In general, when these types of posts are done, you have to give full disclosure.
20 units is a lot but besides that u should be good. Just stay on top of the course work.
(lol i would personally drop physics cuz Ronnie sucks ass and the course staff is wack too) 

Lisa Yan is the best professor i have ever had so it might be worth it to take 61c just for that (imo better than Dan). and if you don‚Äôt need to declare then i would drop 70 (cuz of workload) and/or do what i first said (cuz of personal opinions lol)

Is virginity common nowadays
idk, in my experience the ""horny nerds"" trope seemed to ring true (more than a decade ago! wow!). I was not by any means an attractive man, in fact I was pretty average and unremarkable but it seemed many Cal women were very nice and open to giving me a chance.

Have things changed since covid? I've also seen the statistic about genz not having as much sex. Or is this just toxic Andrew Tate BS?

I moved from Toronto to South Bay in 2015 and while I still got dates, it was way harder to start a relationship here.

I dated for 4 months in Toronto before finding a girlfriend (we split 4 months later because of my move).

It then took me 3 YEARS(!!) to do the same thing here and required a lucky encounter with someone who literally had filed for divorce days earlier, and therefore hadn't been getting passed around on the apps. Also she was nearly a decade older than me (but still very attractive). Sadly after about 2 years she went cold/evil on me when she realized just how spoiled for choice she was (basically got cocky like most of the rest).

So yes, what the dude wrote is 100% accurate. Women can be SHOCKINGLY callous when they know you're easily replaceable.
What is the context I have to know

I'm not a Berkeley alum, not even in college anymore and I got recommended it...maybe because I'm a woman SWE ü•≤ solidarity to any women who saw the posts and felt discouraged, I really do understand how this feels. For what its worth I work in the Bay and even as the sole woman on my team, my coworkers are much more respectful and compassionate than this professor so there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Not everyone is this shitty

Bay Area dating culture is incredibly difficult, but not for the reasons cited in these posts. Tech culture is prevalent, and many young people are extremely career driven. While this by itself is good for them, it leaves little time for getting to know others and/or spending with any one individual. If you're similarly occupied it may not be such an issue.
I'm gonna get downvoted but I got more matches my first week in Boston than i did 6-7 months in San Jose. It is absolutely significantly more difficult for young guys in the bay, regardless of what reddit insists.
Dating is hard everywhere, people in the bay just want to believe that it‚Äôs harder here, but plenty of people have success. I wouldn‚Äôt take it into account over things like quality of education or location. The west coast is lovely.
That's not the takeaway.
Only for these top dweebs who act like this and then wonder why they can‚Äôt meet women.
I live in Seattle and I don't like it here. It's kind of hard to make friends.
Yes

My dude.  It was a freakin‚Äô free for all in Berkeley and SF in the ‚Äò90s!

How terrible for you that women aren't making themselves up just to get your attention and don't respond to you creeping on them in public places.  Oh woe is you!
He‚Äôs just super lonely and he‚Äôs paying people to just to meet them.¬†
I mean still pretty misogynistic or at least socially ignorant to think there's a set experation date for forming relationships. And also to lament losing out on one of the  ""expiring"" relationships, but also being the one who never texted back lol.
I don't think it's any more difficult. Berkeley maybe more than other universities due to the academics being tough and a priority. And if you work in tech and don't have other hobbies then the dating pool as a guy is tougher. 


But I think the dating scene has gotten tough everywhere ever since dating apps became so big. Everyone wants to find someone by swiping but then it's hard to get people to commit to in person meetups for the first time.
[deleted]
I've seen women say similar things to Shewchuk here about men all the time. ""Don't date X kind of person"", however they usually explain what exactly they mean rather than keep it vague. Like I heard a lot of people say that they wouldn't date men from Korea (not Koreans raised abroad, just Koreans from Korea proper) because of their experiences with them being overly controlling which seems to stem from the way men are raised there, or in other cases just because of cultural differences. It is unfair to Korean men who don't do those things and I don't think of it as a hard rule, but they make clear that it's these attitudes that make a relationship hard, not necessarily something inherent. 

It's still not right because people are not their culture, and they can change, but I think if Shewchuk said something like ""Don't bother with women in the Bay Area, they're focused on their careers and don't have much leftover to deal with your needs, your relationship will be more about how it reflects on them personally rather than about being there for you"", it wouldn't be... as controversial? I think people have encountered people like that before, so even if it might not be true for the group overall, people could understand it being common and could relate to him being so cynical. Like I remember reading a guy talk about how his girlfriend dumped him because he had a mental breakdown and couldn't continue his research job, instead of you know, being there for him and helping him (it was anonymized, but I don't think it was Berkeley). I think because he kept it vague, people projected a lot onto his comments especially in an environment where incel-like views are very common. 

To be clear, his comments are very weird, inappropriate and pointless, why he is giving comments about getting women instead of CS concerns, and it's possible they do have misogynistic views behind them, but that on their own they're very vague.
[deleted]
Huh?? Bay Area dating is terrible compared to Chicago, LA, or NYC. Heck, I would even put Austin above it.
Sad news bears
its not misogynistic , but an insane thing to say.
Hold up‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a young (I assume on gender identity here) woman and there are men your age turned off because you have a career now and/or don‚Äôt want to give it up to be Susie Homemaker?!!  Is it still 1955 in Texas?  

Wait - I know the answer.  Yes. Yes, it is.  

I mean, you‚Äôll find troglodytes here in CA as well, but not too many in the Bay in my experience (Cal grad, lifelong Bay Area resident).
then you're set lol
no it's 100% misogynistic, especially given the context

California for sure has more liberal views on relationships. Also it's expensive so unless one of you are a surgeon or a trust fund baby I think most people expect their partner to also work lol."
Advice for EE classes for Fall and Spring 2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice_for_ee_classes_for_fall_and_spring_2022/,2022-04-21 11:34:11,"For context, I'll be a senior (EECS) next academic year.

Classes I have taken CS61ABC, EECS16AB, PHYS7ABC, MATH1AB, MATH54, and CS70

&#x200B;

Questions:

1. Is the workload manageable (for each semester) if I take the following classes?
2. Are these sufficient to jumpstart an EE career after graduating?

&#x200B;

Summer 2022:

188

Fall 2022:

105 with Ali M Niknejad - 4 units

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball  - 1 unit

Spring 2023:

123, 130 and 189

Note: Was thinking of taking 140 in Spring but turns out it is only offered in Fall. So chose 130 instead.

This schedule sounds like a nightmare, and I would break it up if you could.
Yeah agree fall 2022 sounds tough
[deleted]
I see, since I was planning to P/NP 1 class per sem so maybe P/NP 105 for Fall (only need 20 UD units to graduate). Do you think this is a good idea (since I only have a year left)?
Yeah, I tried to fit 105 & 130 in there. Another option would be 120 & 151 for Fall and 123 and 189 for Spring.

Either way, I'm enrolling in the above classes and maybe tweak (P/NP or drop a class) as the semester goes.
I decided to do the following for now:

188->189  
120->123  
151

I decided to not take 105 and 140 to allow myself to really understand 120 and 151 which seem like the two most important classes according to a lot of people!

If I want to go into DSP, do you think it hurts if I don't take 105 and 140, or does it not really matter in the long run? What about Hardware companies in general?"
New Schedule Draft is out for Fa22,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rvkrew/new_schedule_draft_is_out_for_fa22/,2022-01-03 19:47:26,"Link: [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html)

Interesting stuff I noted was

* CS 61A being taught by Professor P. Fox herself, which is great to see! I guess this means Denero is off in the data science dept, maybe there's news for data8/data100 there as well?
* Professor Hug back in 61b, i wonder if he will continue to teach gitlet so early in the semester if at all, I wonder who will be teaching data 100 then...
* New faculty hire in Lisa Yan (not completely new as they are teaching data100 with Prof Hug this spring [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001)),
* Professor Ranade teaching 16b and 127 (which a LOT of people were waiting for),
* Michael Ball teaching 375,
* Professor Popa in 261 (which is completely unrelated from CS 161 which is taught by Nick Weaver -- kinda a shame as I wanted to see him branch out and teach some other classes (61b with Nick sounds fun lol, may make it redesigned in golang though XD, same with 162) but I understand that 161 being offered every semester is important to it being persisted and I'm sure fa22 161 students are overjoyed at the news lol)
* and Professor Rao in CS 70 again also was great to see as they are very familiar at teaching those areas.
* On that note Professor Babak Ayazifar will be teaching both CS 70 and EE 120 per [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html) which is great news for anyone who couldn't get in this semester!
* Professor Chasins teaching CS 164 again, seems like a return for OCaml and a tearful goodbye to Hilfinger's ChocoPy (btw where is Hilfinger on here?? I hope he hasn't retired...).
* CS 168 finally being offered although CS 160 is not offered (not an issue since it's usually there in summers),
* Professor A. Sahai teaching  CS 182 (seems like we'll get another bio-focused 189 since he's not there but him teaching a PyTorch class (altho 182 is clearly more than that) falls in line with what I saw in eecs16b),
* 186 being completely online even with everything hopefully back in-person. I guess it will be CS W186 then?
* No CS 188, though if it happens, Russell and D. Song are my guesses for the professors if they get the funding for that to go through and Abbeel still isn't able to teach it.
* As well as a return of a few 194s (I heard a few more are planned yet to be listed though such as Dawn Song's DeFi CS 194/294-177).

&#x200B;

Keep in mind this is still a draft so changes can be made, but thoughts?","Lisa Yan was a lecturer at Stanford for a couple of years. She has a PhD in CS education (also from Stanford) and is an excellent instructor overall. Hug and Yan should be nothing short of the teaching dream team.
Holy shit they resurrected 168 from the grave
It is unlikely that I will do gitlet at all. As much as some students love it, it has relatively poor synergy with the course material, and I also personally find it a bit boring (sorry Joey! It is a **great** project, just not my style). But I'll review all the course evaluations over the summer to decide whether to keep it or not.
goated, thnx for the update
From what I've seen, CS 160 is planned for the spring next year.
182 is more of an applications class.  Wonder how Sahai will approach it.  Hopefully they offer it in the spring with another professor in case he makes it theory intensive.
Ranade and P. Fox, we love to see it
Oh I so want to teach other classes.  But 161 is one of the classes we‚Äôve scaled to meet demand (500+/semester).  The only way to maintain that is run the class every semester.  I‚Äôd really like to do 162/redo-162-project-as-194/162 as a sequence.
Good to see 176 back, though Prof Yosef isn‚Äôt teaching it.  But since Prof Ioannidis is so involved on the comp bio end, she a good replacement.
Gonna take 182 with my favorite prof
who's pamela fox?
and also what has dan garcia been doing i haven't heard of him since his 61c semester in the first semester of online
damn 176 seems like a really cool class. Doubt I'll get in though. Are prerequisites usually enforced for CS classes?
[deleted]
I miss Ranade
SO happy about babak teaching 120!!
182 is taught in pytorch, not tensorflow
hmm does this mean Shewchuck is not teaching 189 this semester?
Just to clarify, who is teaching 189 in Fa 22?
I'm really interested in 168, but since it's scarcely offered, does anyone know whether it's a difficult class to get into? I'll be a senior then, so i should have a decent slot all things considering
No 188 either.
Is 162 a preq for 168? I‚Äôm seeing conflicting info on different sites
I would recommend Demmel/Nelson cs170. I took Jelani Nelson's cs170 and enjoyed his teaching style very much. It's a hard class, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it was all worth it.
Yes, Prof. Hilfinger is retiring. His last lecture is tomorrow 4/29 at 1pm in 155 Dwinelle.
omg you just made me remember that Lisa Yan was the one i was referring to in [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)   


I'm glad she finally decided to leave Stanfurd for Cal, go bears!
Let's just hope there exist enough TAs out there for the class to be a normal upperdivision size now...
Any thoughts on the lack of a fall offering for its future? Dyt it doesn‚Äôt matter as much as other classes because of summer + is cs160 usually a ‚Äúfall xor spring‚Äù class?

I didn‚Äôt mention stuff like 270 not appearing for that reason (it‚Äôs biyearly spring only)!
I actually have the opposite viewpoint: Marvin Zhang's 182 appears to be less application-focused than past iterations (the usual final project is now a final exam being the main point, until the course site comes out not much more to say on the matter). I hope Sahai recognizes the power of PyTorch and brings back an application-based final project, as he did when introducing those notebooks into 16b. Marvin Zhang making DS 189 Listgarten/Malik-theory oriented instead of Shewchuk application-oriented is another example of how he prefers theory but we will have to wait and see what actually happens this spring (note that this makes sense for DS as many of those students are double majoring in a subject like biology so listgarten's version does make more sense to offer to DS students).

However, you very well could be correct. Maybe Sahai will make it even more theory intensive as that's always a possibility. The fact that NNs need big data makes me hope a deep NN class would be very application-based but if Sahai ruins it then we always have Levine's [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL\_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A) to lean back on and audit... definitely not the same though :(
Yeah I‚Äôm sure other universities would also love seeing a Rust OS project on the scale of pintos üëÄ

After all Berkeley did take inspiration from Stanford, this could be a chance for Berkeley to give back and help lead education in that sector!
hopefully me and you both survive through bestie üòµ‚Äçüí´
Pamela Fox is a new lecturer who has taught 61a alongside DeNero and Hilfinger in the past alongside some other classes (she was a CS 302 co-lecturer last spring, the class for summer instructors, maybe 169 as well iirc but i have a shaky memory there and the other Professor Fox teaches that so I very well could be confounding the two).

I talked to her once about the work she did at Khan Academy on their CS curricula (which I actually used as a kid growing up)  as well as some stuff she did on Coursera. She's done *a* *lot* for 61a these past few semesters and I'm interested in seeing how she changes the course as it's a course that has been evolving a lot recently with SQL ‚Üí Regex ‚Üí BNF etc, as well as an A+ project and new additions from when I took it! I can tell she cares about teaching a lot and have had heard good things about people who took 61a with her though she came just after my time... I took 61a in su20 haha.

And I think Dan was on sabbatical.
usually not
yeah and we could also use those profs to teach grad classes like 286, does 186 still use Hellerstein's lectures lol?
well now she's back from her leave and teaching 2 classes at that :)
yeah, usually he teaches 120 in the spring only, this is quite a surprise IMO but a pleasant one at that!
yeah... i think i misremembered because it was pytorch that Prof Sahai introduced into eecs16b this semester (which is what i referred to), i think i just typed the wrong thing, ill edit it, thanks!
He is for spring 22, the above is for fall 22 which is after sp22.
Also note that Shewchuk is only teaching CS 189, DS 189 will be taught by Marvin Zhang
NVM: Listgarten and Malik
prolly will be. but i think most seniors will get into it. i doubt any juniors will get in. Depends on how big the class is also, if its around 500, itll be fine but if its < 300, then big yikes
FWIW there were 500 seats last time it was offered [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001)
it's not, that's an old prereq
and she can also teach CS 168 in the future so this is incredibly based
BTW, Lisa Yan also did her undergrad at Cal, which is doubly awesome
Prof. Fox co-taught 169 this past semester. I didn‚Äôt love the class (more specifically, I absolutely hated it), but its failings weren‚Äôt her fault and she clearly has a passion and a great talent for teaching CS. It‚Äôll be cool to see her teach a class that isn‚Äôt buzzwordy garbage!
that's good. Still don't think i'll get in though since I'm not a cs major and I imagine seats are reserved T_T.  thank you for the answer!
[deleted]
Oop you're right my apologies.

Wait, 182 is being offered Fa22?! Let's goo!
ya but there were more TAs back then since 168 was offered once a year. Its been 2.5 years since, so there will be a lack TAs along with the fact that the budget is less
Thank you
yeh as i said above, havent taken a class with her so everything above was second-hand anecdotal. Though i bumped into her in Soda a couple of times and she was a nice person to talk to. Am also a huge fan of her work at Khan Academy. I think she'll do good things with 61a though i thought it was a great class as is when i took it (doesn't mean that it cant improve ofc).
if you phase 1, and wait it out then who knows
:o isn‚Äôt that the first live lec 186 in awhile? Is this confirmed or could this still change, might have to sign up for it if so
Yeah that‚Äôs also usually a spring-only class, I was surprised to see it there‚Ä¶ I also think this is  Prof A. Sahai‚Äôs first time teaching it, should be an interesting experience
yeah ive been worrying about that myself tbh"
