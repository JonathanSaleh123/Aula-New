California State Treasurer and 2018 gubernatorial candidate John Chiang came to Cal on Monday to speak on his vision for California's future on issues ranging from the state's housing crisis to its failing infrastructure. The event was hosted by Berkeley Forum and Goldman School of Public Policy.,http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/20/gubernatorial-candidate-john-chiang-speaks-uc-berkeley-housing-crisis-education/,2017-09-21 00:23:08,,"What housing crisis? I don't see no crisis going on, just a maybe a bathroom and a mental health problem. When you put them both together, you get a bad mix of problems. That's why I don't do drugs or respond to my imaginary friends. My best bud Harry sometimes mumbles and when I ask him what he said, he says he didn't say anything. I always make sure to talk loud and clear all the time. Harry has trouble hearing so I have to yell at him all the time. People always think we're arguing with each other. Most of the time we are, but sometimes I'm just trykng to get Harry to stop staring at me."
