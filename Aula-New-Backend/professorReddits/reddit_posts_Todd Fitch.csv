Econ major course recommendations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yfbw9d/econ_major_course_recommendations/,2022-10-27 19:58:06,"I'm currently taking econ100a and stat20 this semester and have to take a macro econ course for spring. But I heard that Hawkins 100b is pretty tough so I was looking into ugba 101b. I was wondering if its true that ugba101b is easier compared to econ 100b? econ 100b is taught by Raymond Hawkins and ugba 101b is taught by Todd Fitch. I'm not really confident on macro econ so I was hoping to take the easier one.. :,)

Also, can I get any thoughts on ugba 131? I'm thinking of taking it as an outside department econ elective. It's taught by Stephen Etter!

How about econ 136 with Hawkins? I heard the course is a lot of math but wanted to get more comments on the course too.

Also, for anyone who took ugba 131 or ugba 101b, are the discussions mandatory?

Any comments would be appreciated, thanks!","Hi I’m actually gonna take econ100a and stat20 together next semester! What’s your experience with that combination been like?
Keep in mind you can transfer only 2 upper divs from a diff department- so don’t spiral into taking multiple ugba classes, they won’t work. I recommend 100B because it may be harder but it’ll prepare you much better for Econ electives. 101B is very haasy- it’ll teach you the minimum, you’ll get a better grade for less work, but you’ll probably struggle in other upper divs which had 100B as a prereq
The average grade of MT 1 in econ 100b is D. Hawkins doesn't know how to teach
Class is hella curved tho"
