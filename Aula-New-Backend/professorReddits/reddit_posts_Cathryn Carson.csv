> One of the things to be discussed was the Data Science major, wondering if anybody that attended has information? 

## **Student's Answer**

> Here's my note: 
> 
> ###   
> Faculty Presentation
> 
> ### By Prof. Cathryn Carson and David Culler
> 
> #### DATA SCIENCE MAJOR & MINOR
> 
> - Underway now! 
> - ""Group major"": group of faculty, bigger than one department putting it together. Both in CoE and L&S (Same Content) 
> - ~30 to 36 upper divs unit 
> - Frame 
>     - Lower div with foundations w/ emphasis on Lower-div anchor (data 8) 
>     - Upper div 
>         - Upper-div anchor: data 100 
>         - Some integrative experience 
>         - Societal context and ethics 
> 
>     - Two part: Depth and Domain Emphasis. 
>     - Mix of 
>         - Inference 
>         - Computation 
>         - Theory and Practice win the context 
>         - Applicable to wide range domain 
>         - Variety of perspective with integrative experience 
> 
>     - Integrating existing courses? 
>         - Lower div -- data 8 + some stats and math 
>         - Math 1AB, 53, 54 
>             - Less requirement? Ongoing questions. 
> 
>     - Upper div 
>         - difinitely data 100 
>         - And some machine learning course 
>             - currently offered from: stats, CS, or IEOR 
> 
>         - then, clusters 
>             - like cluster system Econ or Stats or Applied Math 
>             - A bit of mix of required to build technical depth associated with Data Science 
>             - Some sort of concept of specialization or cluster / or Area 
>                 - like data driven policy 
>                 - Urban Planning emphasis 
>                 - Or theories ... 
> 
>             - Integrative experience with a lot of individual choice... 
> 
>     - minor: 
>         - Foundation w/ maths... 
>         - or another minor with fewer math requirement... 
>             - Application domain specific &lt;-- need more courses. 
> 
>         - 5 upper divs 
>             - need a set of refined courses 
> 
>     - Building a major that's feasible first... improve it semester by semester... 
>         - Major will come faster than minor. 
> 
>     - GPA Capped? 
>         - Hard to say... 
> 
>     - Grandfathering courses? 
>         - Taken 61A, Stat 20: Data 8 required? 
>             - This is issue need to deal with... hard to say from now. 
> 
>     - Ethics requirement 
>         - the engineering one too narrow... 
>         - There are some existing courses that address social context and ethics 
>         - But there's need for much more courses specific around data science. 
> 
> - What should I take, like now? 
>     - Calculus: Math 1AB/10AB 
>     - Linear Algebra: 54 OR EE16A(B) 
>     - Programming and Data structures: 61AB 
>     - machine learning course: Stats 154 or CS189 
>     - CS 70? It doesn't do the inference... 
>     - Stat 134... has a different mix... 
> 
> - Time? 
>     - Pieces are almost all there... 
>     - Still in the end stage of gathering faculty... 
>     - More departments need to talk to each other... 
>     - Expectation: 
>         - Requirements can be outlined by the end of the fall: hopefully, people could graduate with it in the spring. 
>         - Yes...There will be advisors! 
> 
> - There will be online FAQs...",
