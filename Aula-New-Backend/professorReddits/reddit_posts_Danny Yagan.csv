Has anyone here taken Econ 131 with Danny Yagan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ihas46/has_anyone_here_taken_econ_131_with_danny_yagan/,2020-08-26 17:16:45,I’m enrolled in econ 131 with prof. Yagan this semester. I was wondering what the class was like? What the difficulty of the class was? Any recommendations on how to do well?,"I took it with him. Loved it. It’s not that hard if you remember optimizations from 100A. The best way to do well is to make sure you not only get the math but also get the concepts, because his exams are equally weighted between mathematical problems and true/false with explanations.
Thank you so much! If I took the 101 series, should I be fine in the class? I was wondering how conceptual the class was. I’m usually fine with the mathematical side of it.
The true/false are kind of hard. He goes over a bunch of different studies in the slides as well as discusses a lot of hypothetical scenarios. In addition to marking true/false, you also need to justify your answers (guessing gets you 0 if I remember right). I would say that most people focus too much on the computations and not enough on the concepts which is why the exams seem difficult. I don’t think it’s too bad; after I scored a bit above average on the first midterm, I switched my studying from the computations focused to something more balanced and did way better.
This is awesome! Thank you so much for the advice. I’ll keep in mind to pay extra attention to the concepts as well. :) Thanks again!
would it be a class that would be too much on top of econ 140, cs 61a and an ethics class? I'm deciding between 131 and a new enviro econ class.

I'm more interested in the public sector than environmental policy but I don't want to deal with a ""tougher"" course I guess.
No problem. Enjoy the class; he really is a good lecturer.
Nah, you should be fine as long as you keep up with the PSETs."
"California is one of four U.S. states that has struggled the most to bounce back after the recession, says a study conducted by Danny Yagan, an assistant professor of economics. Yagan's study of over 2 million workers shows many have become discouraged to look for jobs and others decided to retire.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/23/the-most-unlucky-places-in-america/,2016-06-28 19:14:40,,The traffic I sit in every day says different. 
What are some easy econ electives?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cwv8u2/what_are_some_easy_econ_electives/,2019-08-28 20:13:04,I'm a transfer student and I wanted to take a light load my first semester. I'm currently enrolled in ECON 134 (Macroeconomic Policy with Emi Nakamura) but I'm debating whether or not I should switch to ECON 131 (Public Econ with Danny Yagan) or ECON 182 (Monetary Econ with Galina Hale). Any suggestions?,"Nakamura is excellent; I wouldn’t switch.
Do you have any advice for the class? Is the grading tough? Is she approachable?
I would look at BerkeleyTime for grading. And yes, she’s approachable."
"Cal economist Danny Yagan: Economic recovery has been unusually sluggish and uneven. At the current pace of improvement, employment rates across the U.S. won't return to normal levels until the 2020s, “amounting to more than a relative 'lost decade' of depressed employment for…half of the country.""",http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/03/17/half-of-u-s-may-endure-lost-decade-of-depressed-employment/,2016-03-17 22:03:44,,
