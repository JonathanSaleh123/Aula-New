What is the easiest AC requirement class?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zpjnlz/what_is_the_easiest_ac_requirement_class/,2022-12-18 22:02:41,"I’m a second semester senior and I need to complete my American Cultures requirement along side my last three upper div courses. What is the easiest course i can enroll in to fulfill the requirement, any recommendations would be much appreciated :)","Hist100ac has a great professor, your grade is based on an essay, and a midterm and final that are writing essays in a green book. There's readings but I mostly just paid attention in lecture and prob got an A
heard anthro 2ac was pretty easy
Probably ESPM 50AC
GEOG167AC: it's super easy to actually get a 100 percent in the class, easy A+ at the very least and the professor is wonderful as well
i took 60ac it was amazing no finals/exams only 2 essays and a project
PBHLTH 155E was a breeze this sem, no exams only group work but this sem we got lucky with a good group some people didn’t and hated the class bc there wasn’t an option to switch groups. Might change in the future tho
 any theater class with an AC lol
If you need upper div AC then Islamophobia in Spring. Easy A
You should ask the question in the context of what is [still available,](https://classes.berkeley.edu/search/class?f%5B0%5D=sm_general_requirement%3AAmerican%20Cultures&f%5B1%5D=im_field_term_name%3A2729&f%5B2%5D=ts_open_seats%3Aopen) which is not much.
Art23ac
I second that! History 100AC is a GREAT class! Not a ton of homework and interesting material.
I took it as well and it is great but she isn’t teaching this course in the spring
Second this, 10/10 great and easy class. I ended with like a 105% and didn't do any work outside of just going to lecture
What department is 60ac?
I want to take this class so bad but only art practice majors can enroll
True that! Her LGBTQ survey will probably be awesome as well, that's in the spring!
comparative literature ! taught by professor karina palau
I took it as a non art practice major a year ago, maybe they change the rule
Are you gay?

O  yes

O  no"
Schedule for incoming Data Science Major,https://i.redd.it/ufm0xpm14kbb1.jpg,2023-07-12 08:58:51,"Hi everyone! Here is my schedule for this incoming fall as a freshman. Please let me know if you have any advices on this or thoughts. I’m worrying this might be too much so what course should I drop and what should I take instead? I’m thinking about drop COMLIT R1A and take something lighter as this is 4 units. The reason I want to take CS61A is because I also want to do a double major or minor in CS or potentially declare CS later. Please lmk your thoughts! Thank you so much. 
Go Bears!","Hi, I'm an applied math and stat double major and I think your schedule is fine, although it may be a little work intensive! 

One thing to note is that 61A is often quite difficult for people who have no coding experience (my friend really struggled, like it was one of her worse semesters), so if you're worried, I would suggest getting the basics of coding in python down over the summer (you can google past cs61A websites, here's the one that gets updated/reset every semester https://cs61a.org/)! Also as a tutor in CSM, I will say that if you're finding 61A to be difficult, CSM can be a great resource. I personally found 61A to be relatively reasonable but that was because I took AP Computer Science A back in high school so I had most the fundamentals down.  
I did not take Math 1B at Berkeley so I have no idea how it's like, but if it's like most math classes at Berkeley, it will likely be very dependent on the professor (it also may be a weeder class? so be careful). However, unlike most math classes, there are a lot of resources online for Calculus so hopefully you'll be fine! (To be honest, if you need help in 1B you can DM me and I'll try my best to help or jsut check out something like Khan Academy or reading your textbook)  
Data 8 is generally pretty chill. KEEP UP WITH THE WORK. The professor you have is the professor I had for Data 100, and she's decent, but a little dry. I think that just doing the labs and homework will be most effective.

I have no idea how work intensive COMLIT R1A will be because it depends on the class and the prof, but if you're afraid grading, I would go on Berkeley time and look for a class that had a good average and fulfills a breadth or requirement (https://berkeleytime.com/landing).
Set up a tent in Wheeler.
I’m a transfer student so yet to take my first semester of classes (I will this fall). My question is, how are you going to get from your 10am to 11am? Won’t they be back to back?
pretty standard, should be a busy but very doable semester! stay on top of things and you'll be fine.
Solid. No offense but this might be the most average schedule I've ever seen.
Doable, probably on the slightly harder side for most. If you wish to lighten it slightly but still make progress toward your degree(s) I suggest taking a breadth in place of 61A and to take 61A in the spring.

Also, save your physical sciences breadth in case you minor or major in CS since 61C will cover it.
Thank you so much for your help!!!
Berkeley time - classes start 10 min after the listed time
They’re in the same hall too, they just needs to go upstairs
Wow wish I knew this before registration opened
Wish I knew this too! I didn’t see it in the orientation. Good to know! Thanks!
Oh man yeah I think it says it in the online orientation thing but if the classes you want still have spots you can probably still change it around
Ya a kinda rushed through it. Thanks for letting me know"
American Cultures Courses,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vz697k/american_cultures_courses/,2022-07-14 13:59:52,"Hi! If you have taken an AC course, which one did you like and did it also fulfill other requirements?

Any course suggestions for AC courses that also fulfill other breadth requirements?","121AC was pretty chill and easy
comlit 60ac
Soc 131ac (Race And Ethnic Relations: U.S. American Cultures) the workload wasn't bad and the professor was amazing! You have reading assignments but they're not bad cause the readings are really interesting and you just answer like 5 to 7 questions (not all reading assignments have questions assignments) you have to do 8 out the 10 question reading assignments I believe and three essay test throughout the semester. No final or midterm. Highly recommend!
I enrolled in this one. How’s the workload?
dude it was so chill , i loved writing tho but the assignments are chill just word responses and theres no midterm or final, just a final paper + project which is not bad it was a 2 pg paper and a group project i met some amazing people in that class and i loved the professor
Who was ur professor
professor karina palau i dont know if shes teaching it in the fall maybe in the spring?"
