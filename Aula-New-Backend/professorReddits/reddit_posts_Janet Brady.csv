Janet Brady vs Mohammad Nadeem for UGBA 106,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dkn0co/janet_brady_vs_mohammad_nadeem_for_ugba_106/,2024-06-20 14:27:49,"I noticed that they added a new UGBA 106 class with Prof Brady, who I've heard is better than Professor Nadeem. Is it worth the switch? Is her class easier, like everyone says?","Nadeem’s class is so overrated, you’ll have to do a lot of work and will get A-, never more never less
Janet Brady is awesome"

Most practical and useful Haas/Decal classes to take for Product Management?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cyoj5m/most_practical_and_useful_haasdecal_classes_to/,2024-05-23 02:16:17,"Hi there, I would really appreciate some insight and advice on which Haas/Decal classes at UC Berkeley you found to be the best in terms of usefulness and helpfulness for a career in product management and business overall?

It is my last semester and I have a good amount of experience in the field and would really like to develop practical skills to learn more AI (not a super technical person), business strategy and leadership, marketing and design skills. I want to stay away from classes with a crazy workload, though.

Below are the classes I am currently planning to take, are they worth it? How is the difficulty/workload, are the professors listed good? Please share your experience:

- UGBA 105 - Leading People (Edward Kass) - 3 units

- UGBA 106 - Marketing (Janet Brady) - 3 units

- Intro to Business in Content Creation Decal - 2 Units

- How to Build an E-Commerce Brand Decal - 2 Units

Please share your experience and let me know which classes were most helpful for you. Thank you so much in advance!","None of these cores will be helpful to PM (I’ve taken both), you’re better off taking a SCET ENGIN 183 class. Try Technology Entrepreneurship or Product Management (one is offered fall and the other spring iirc)
Thank you so much! Why do you say the cores are not helpful, should I just take a random online class and learn marketing/leadership on my own then? What exactly is the Technology Entrepreneurship classes? 

For SCET classes, I am interested in these. Which of the following do you recommend I take?

* Technology Entrepreneurship
* Growth Marketing for Aspiring Entrepreneurs 
* Connected Life: How Mobile/AI/Internet of Things Will Improve Our Lives
* Design Thinking for entrepreneurs 
* Future of Technology: How Innovators Critically Examine Game Changing and Time Wasting Technologies  
* **Which of the following do you recommend I take that will be most useful for PM?**"
