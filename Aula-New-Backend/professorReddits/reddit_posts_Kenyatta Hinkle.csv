Art + lit breadth and philosophy + values breadth,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pxdyti/art_lit_breadth_and_philosophy_values_breadth/,2021-09-28 12:34:13,"Does anyone have any course recommendations to fulfill these breadths? I've been thinking about taking art 12: drawing foundations or art 8: intro to visual thinking and philos 132: philosophy of mind or pbhlth 101: a sustainable world - challenges and opportunities, any thoughts? Kenyatta Hinkle is teaching art 13, Anne Walsh for art 8, Marlon Maus for pbhlth 101, and Geoffrey Lee for philos 132.","I heard Music 26ac is really easy, but it's only offered in the Fall so if you need to get your arts + lit requirement by the end of spring then rip :/
im in histart 10 and love it! fulfills art&lit
What time is your registration? 

PbHlth 101 is chill
It's also offered over the summer if that's an option, was very very chill (did that myself)
9 am on the first day of phase 1
The 11th? 

You can definitely get into PbHlth 101 and art 8 or 12. Don’t know much about 12, but 8 is chill, high key boring, but chill
is pbhlth interesting and do you actually get to make any art in art 8? what’s the workload like in both?"
