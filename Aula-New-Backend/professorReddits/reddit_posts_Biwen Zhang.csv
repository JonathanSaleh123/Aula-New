biwen zhang or erick bell for financial accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1djf0re/biwen_zhang_or_erick_bell_for_financial_accounting/,2024-06-19 02:32:01,as the title suggests! zhang's class doesn't fit as well into my schedule but I've heard really great things about her. I've also heard great things about bell and he fits better in my schedule.. thoughts?,"Both are good, but Biwen is amazing especially if you have no prior knowledge cause she deliberately goes slow and explains in a lot of detail
Thank you!!"
ugba 102a attendance,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/173leiz/ugba_102a_attendance/,2023-10-08 23:56:44,"hi,

i'm in ugba 102a right now with biwen zhang and was wondering what the policy is for attendance. on the first day of class, she said something rlly ambiguous like, ""i trust you if you don't want to come to class, but students who come will be rewarded). On the syllabus, constructive contribution is worth 5% of the grade. How does she track attendance/how is this measured?","Due to the large size of the class, that 5% of your grade is not explicitly tracked. Your semester grade is pretty much based entirely on your midterm and final. As I recall, I donâ€™t think we ever knew what our constructive contribution grade even was.
