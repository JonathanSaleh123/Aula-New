"For anyone with access to a car, I have a cool East Bay day trip recommendation: Cull Canyon Swim Lagoon!",https://i.redd.it/19gfrz8m514b1.jpg,2023-06-04 09:44:56,"It’s a man-made swim lagoon in Castro Valley that gets up to 11ft deep in the middle, and there’s a cool jumping dock you can do flips and stuff off of. There are bbq pits and party cabana rentals, showers, changing areas, bathrooms, vending machines, and a sandy shoreline to put your stuff. Admission is $4 for adults and less for seniors/children. It’s a great thing to do with friends and a fun way to beat the heat. Not sponsored or anything, I just went there and had a really good time. :)","One of the few good things in my hometown
Another Awesome spot is San Pablo Reservoir!! It might be closer than CV..
I thought that place closed down! I love it there! The swim test is awkward but aside from that, it’s fun as shit! I like jumping off that deck.
The sand is so sharp though!  Maybe I just have tender feet of a child but I had to wear water shoes. 

Also it’s lightly chlorinated which I did not expect. But I love this place.
Thanks for this gem. This kinda reminds me of Lake Anza in Berkeley. Does anyone know if Lake Anza is open again?
I’m a strong swimmer (swam every day for like 10 years), but I still get anxious every time I do a swim test 😂
Water shoes are good, yes! They got like aquarium gravel in there and not beach sand 🥲
I want to say I think it’s open, but I’d check their website to be sure. I know they have the algae problems every year, and I’m not sure if it’s that point in the summer yet
The first time I did one there they didn’t tell me I was on the kid’s side so I was splashing around like an idiot. i thought they weren’t going to give me a wristband! They did, though. lol
I did the exact same thing yesterday. Did the whole 20 yards or whatever before the guy was like “oh, in the deep water, please” 

🙃
HA! At least he told you. Dude totally let me humiliate myself."
