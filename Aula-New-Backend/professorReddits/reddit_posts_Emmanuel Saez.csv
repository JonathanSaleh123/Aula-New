God I’m dying I need to see how the percentile ranking ended up working for Econ 2 with Emmanuel Saez,"The FAQ says 2 to 3 months after the end of the semester.

Nope lol based on the median I got a B+ on the first midterm and an A- on the second one. Final I clutched up, but obviously we don’t know the stats. Using my raw scores and an online calculator, I got like a B+ raw which got curved to an A, which I’m happy about"

IEOR + Haas/DS incoming freshman fall class,https://i.redd.it/so7s7pvs983b1.jpg,2023-05-31 08:36:41,Is this courseload managable? if not which one should i cut? thankss,"IMO physics isn't a class you should prioritize, since it's not needed for most IEOR breadth classes and it may hit your GPA hard. To give you an idea i didnt do my physics till junior year lol.

I'd prioritize D8/61A instead (if you wanted another class), otherwise you may just wanna drop 7A and not add anything else since your first sem is gonna be a transition and your other classes aren't easy either IMO.
Don't do Physics yet
You’ll be busy the whole semester but it’s doable
I’d drop physics
No, take into account office hours and the time you need to study + internships and extracurriculars

Unless you’re a physics whiz, physics will actually take you a lot more time than is actually listed on your schedule to get you to score high enough around the averages"
