This upcoming fall, AoW offers 5 courses that you can take: EALANG 125, FILM 193, GEOG 129, HISTART 192G, and SOCIOL 190. Prof Naddaff will be happy to answer any of your questions about those courses or AoW in general.

My friend George is experiencing severe writers block. He‚Äôs been working on a writing a book that is the 6th in a series. He‚Äôs actually been pretty successful with the first 5 books and even got picked up a while ago to do a show for HBO. He‚Äôs been working on the 6th book for 12 years now, and still can‚Äôt seem to finish it. Any advice for him? Or you could tweet at him directly @GRrMSpeaking Any advice is truly appreciated!
Do you write by hand? I know writing by hand and typing generate very different thought process therefore final product.
The best way to improve your writing is  to write, write, and write some more.  It's like a muscle. It needs to be exercised.  If you want to be old-style, you can get a little  journal and  a pen and keep it  with you all the times so you can write at any time of day. To  improve your writing, you  have to commit  yourself  to rewriting.  Writing is rewriting.  (See what Hemingway has to say about revising.)  Write a  draft; wait a day or two; reread and edit the draft; show it to a friend and have them edit; rewrite. I know that is too many  steps when you have so many essays to write but do give yourself time to revise a draft! Reading  is also important as a means to improve your writing.  On Revision: See Joseph  Harris'  great book: *Rewriting: how to do things with texts* and William German *On Revision*.  Good luck with your writing!
At Berkeley, you  are required to take two writing courses your  Freshman year.    In those  classes, which  are usually taught by graduate students, you learn new  skills that  help you move beyond the  5-paragraph essay.  These  courses also help you to learn to read  texts closely and construct a strong argument.  

Art of Writing courses are upper division courses, taught by a  ladder faculty, on a specific topic that is of interest to the faculty  and their graduate student who team teaches the courses.   Classes are small; you get lots of feedback on your writing; you learn to revise; you read but you concentrate on thinking and writing.   You develop a supportivecommunity  of  writing with your fellow students. AND most of all you learn to develop your own voice and style and to see yourself as a writer.  These classes are a unique opportunity at a large university   like  Berkeley.
Like some other students who took Art of Writing courses, I wouldn't take just one! I would take 2 or 3 with different professors on different topics each semester.
First  of all, don't call  it writer's block.  It's a pause; a moment of silence when new ideas and words are coming-into-being. 

\--Be kind to  yourself and do  not judge  yourself.  Most writing blocks come from being over self-critical, comparing yourself to others; judging everything you write.  Be compassionate with yourself  and your words.  There are enough harsh  critics in the world.   Don't  be one  now. 

\--Try to schedule a time during the  day when you are relaxed. Read a  little, move a little, and then write.  Set a  limit on how long you write at first--say 5 minutes--and make  yourself stop  after that.  Write   a little longer each week.

\--Just write words. Don't reread; don't revise; just write.

\--For me, listening to music really helps me to write.  I imagine there is some activity that relaxes you,  or a place that makes you feel secure and expressive. 

&#x200B;

\-- Create a ritual  either before or during the time you write. One friend used  to  set very narrow margins  and make sure each line had the same number of words!  The words came--it was a *creative challenge.*
It changes  all the time.  It depends on my mood.

One summer all  I wanted to do was  read Dickens.  And so I did!
This  is an exciting moment in what is now called ""creative non-fiction."" Writers in this ""genre"" are not just interested in listing a series  of facts and maintaining an objective and neutral voice.  They want to tell a story, to find a narrative and style that  draws the reader in and catches their interest.  I don't know what you  like to read or think about but check out  some of the books by one of the Art of Writing  Guest lecturer: Michael Lewis.  A great writer; a great essayist and journalist; a superb thinker.  You can listen to his lecture on [artofwriting.berkeley.edu](https://artofwriting.berkeley.edu)  Check out Robert Reich also on his writing process and  practices on our website.
We asked our students to write about chaptGPT and tell us  what they  think!  See our website to read the essays at [artofwritting.berkeley.edu](https://artofwritting.berkeley.edu).  We hope to continue with more essays on the subject next year.
oh i got some thoughts about the mascot
I  have to think about that!  I'm always amused when I see  the mascot.
I absolutely  adore seeing my students become excited and absorbed by their  own writing and by the writing of others.  When I see students who are  curious about  words  and devoted to discovering the right words to say at the right time, whatever that time may  be-- I honor  that.  Students are the most creative people I am around!

For an aspiring educator--you have to love what you do and see it as a creative act.
I'll let you  answer that.
See my answer above on AoW courses. In fact, I just copied it for you. Let me also add that your writing will be given  the attention and care that will  help you develop as a writer in any  field.  Communicating  your ideas in writing  with  style and precisionis an important skill to acquire.

reading.
See above and below.

Also--no other  university has courses that resemble Art of Writing courses.  They are   unique and special to our campus where writing  and critical thinking is a  core value.  

I will say this --you  will meet  wonderful   students and have great and original learning experiences.

We have courses that are taught in the Engineering Department.  For example, Prof Mark Bauer just  taught Engin  185 Beyond Data: scientific writing for  non-scientific  writers.  Margaret Kolb will be teaching a course  in  Spring 2024 ""Writing Robots.""  Honestly, just  find  a topic that interests  you and  take the course.  The professor will help you  to develop your own voice and style.
That is a  long story.I had a great job in publishing but  I was deathly bored. I had to change careers.  So I did but I kept being  an editor. The  combination of being an editor and a professor and someone  who is writing on writing led me to become  Director.
Depends on the professor!

Spring 2024: WritingRobots.

Revise ChatGPT's essays and say it  in your own words.
I  mean this: Knowing how to write well  will serve you in  any profession.  A well-written email will get you an interview!

So just take a course that interests you, a topic that inspires you.
Pretend you are not  writing.

Read a writer who inspires you before writing an essay.
Lol, someone seems excited to come to Berkeley
You  decide after you take them all!
no thoughts
Please see our website under events:  [artofwriting.berkeley.edu](https://artofwriting.berkeley.edu)

We host lectures by  writers who speak about  their  writing  practices and processes.

We invite translators.

We invite   lawyers who  write books.

We invite former students who  have  become well-known authors.

And we have a series of wonderful writing workshops!   Check them  out.

Read  read and write write.

Look at ads commercials, texts, instagram, etc and think  about the words  and how they are put together and how you would put them  together.

Just keep writing and if you can (or care to) take a  writing course.

I  find reading books on writing  or writers' memoirs on their writing and moments of not  writing very  helpful.
I do!  And I have a small but  loved pen collection  so I change pens often.

When  I can, I buy my students pens so they can have the experience  of writing by hand.
Not all first-year classes are taught by grad students. There are a lot of lecturers who teach those classes, too.
Thanks!!
