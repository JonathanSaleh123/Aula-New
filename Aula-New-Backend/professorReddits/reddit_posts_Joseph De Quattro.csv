Help!„ÄêSummer Session„Äë Is this summer schedule doable for a freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n0wftd/helpsummer_session_is_this_summer_schedule_doable/,2021-04-28 21:06:17,"Hey, everyone, please give me some adviceüôèüôè

I am a 2025er and I just enrolled two courses in this summer session. I planned to take **COLWRIT R1A** (by prof **Joe De Quattro** \- heard that he was amazing and the average GPA was high) and **MATH W54** by Nadler.

Is this **workload** too heavy for a freshman? What are my chances if I wanna get an **A** for CW R1A and at least a B+ for MATH W54? Note that I am an international student (English not my native language), and even though Joe De Quattro's R1A is said to be easy A by most students, I still worry that my situation might different...","Is there a particular reason you‚Äôre doing math 54 in the summer ? You can certainly hold off on that, and take 16A/B or 1A/B which most freshman do. I feel it‚Äôs a waste because you‚Äôre attending class every day for 2 hours and paying ~$1600 for just a passing grade in 54
Thank you for your reply! Yeah, that's true... but I consider this because I will take my AP Calculus BC exam this June, and I can skip 1a and 1b if I gain score 5.

For choosing 54 this summer, that's because I am worried that I cannot get a good score if I follow the ordinary pace and learn that in fall, since I saw the 54 in fall is taught by Nadler and Katrin Wehrheim, both of their courses have low GPA in Berkeley time.
I consider choosing pnp because I don't know if I can deal with the workload successfully... Anyway, I'm still hesitating... I may still choose the grading option to make the 1600 worth that much."
