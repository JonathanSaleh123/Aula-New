CS 70 Alistair Sinclair and Yun S. Song lectures,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/c5julu/cs_70_alistair_sinclair_and_yun_s_song_lectures/,2019-06-25 19:39:08,Why were they taken down? and did anyone download them?,"My guess is that they took it down to encourage people to go to live lectures this semester.
but I heard that other professors wanted them to be taken down.. asking since next sem I have the same profs so idk if there'll be webcast lol
When I took 70 with Song/Sinclair, they originally did not want to webcast. They only ended up webcasting so that more people can be enrolled in the class.
Because restricting access to information/education always turns out [so great](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/why-uc-berkeley-is-restricting-access-to-thousands-of-online-lecture-videos/2017/03/15/074e382a-08c0-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.7d12bfa83ab8) . Sigh.. I hate humanity sometimes
ohh I see huh that's odd, thank you!
After reading the article it seems Berkeley didn't have much of a choice or am I wrong.
Yeah they were forced to by the court, I was more making a statement about how Berkeley already had a problem and had to restrict lecture access from nonstudents, and how it was disappointing that professors want to restrict it from students as well.
thank you for the information! that's really annoying :/"
Anyone have a recording of today’s Campanille songs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/158ujbh/anyone_have_a_recording_of_todays_campanille_songs/,2023-07-24 19:06:42,"I will take any and all recordings from today; Phantom, Sugar Plum Fairy, they absolutely popped off today.

Is this schedule suicide?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gpys8m/is_this_schedule_suicide/,2020-05-24 15:26:06,"I'm going to take STAT 135 (Yun Song), STAT 140 (Adhikari), CS 61B (Hug), UGBA 105, UGBA 137 this Fall, and I wonder if the schedule is doable.","That seems pretty chill. Why not add CS70 and CS 61C?
depends on the person, but if you're asking this question I'm assuming you're a consistent A/A+ student. if you're not, don't take this.

if you are that kind of student and have at least some familiarity with data structures, Hug's 61b is not time consuming at all, probably ~5 hours a week or so. the projects are pretty short except the last one. 135 with lucas was low workload and pretty easy but a stupid, useless class. 140's workload should be pretty typical cs/stats stuff. I have no idea what the business classes are like but I'd imagine they're easy. So I'd say this is probably doable, but not fun.
lol don't do it
How come youre taking 140 and 135 concurrently?
i did 140 and 61b concurrently (plus the same amount of units as you) and it was manageable but not fun tbh.
It's hard to judge your capabilities without understanding the courseloads you've taken before. Would you be willing to share your previous semesters' schedules?
I don't think doing 135 and 140 concurrently is recommended. 61B and 134 were a lot for me this semester. U gonna die bro, unless you are a god.
I’m sure you will have your hands busy with any 2 out of the 3 technicals. Yun Song’s 135 is no joke.
Is UGBA 137 with Etter? I took UGBA 131 with him and I thought it was a lot of work for a 3 unit class. It probably won’t be too bad but don’t underestimate it. I ended up spending more effort on UGBA 131 than another 4 unit CS class.
If you haven't took any probability at all DO NOT TAKE STAT 135. I don't know your major, but consider taking Data 100 / Stat 33B or Stat 133 as a replacement. I did fairly well with 4 techs this semester (CS 61b, Stat 135, Math 110, Data 100). Depending on your background, you might find Data 100's assignments trivial and easy to do; in addition it's a good complement to 140 (?).
I went ""uh-oh"" 3 times while reading this. Lol don't do it but if you do, good luck!
[deleted]
Last semester i took 61a math 54 and 4 ugba classes. I’ve been taking 18-19 units in my previous semesters.
Pretty late here lol, but is 61B + stat140 + breadth + decal-or-seminar-1-unit-thingy doable?
Who r u and why r u here
If you found that courseload challenging, then this might not be very doable. It's hard to say whether you will find this doable if you found your previous coursework easy. Stat 140 is no joke and neither is stat 135. Maybe drop one of the two stat classes and you have a good schedule.
I'd say so. I did that, but with Data 100 instead of a breadth and Stat 134. You'll be working super hard, unless you are naturally great at stats or cs. Stat 140 takes a lot of studying and 61B can be grinded out. I've never taken a Berkeley breadth before, so no comment there, but I assume it can't be that bad. I remember you're an incoming freshman right? Is that your Fall semester? If so, wow, you are very ahead of the curve.
I'm an incoming freshman, and that's my spring 2021 semester. I was gonna do 61B  + 2 breadths this Fall, but 61B filled up wayyy to fast :/. Doing Math 53 +16A + 2 breadths.
61B always expands. If you sign up, you will get in this Fall for sure. I recommend adding it during phase 2 if you can. Even if that's you're Spring sem, taking Stat 140 your freshman year makes you very ahead of the curve. Congrats!
Thank you! I'm pretty set on taking Math 53 (wanna declare Stats also). Given that I'm taking Math 54 this summer (it's hard lmao), would 61B + EECS 16A + Math 53 be very hard (considering online format 😶)?

I'll be done w/ 61A, Data 8 since I did them as a high schooler through the pre-college program; testing out of Math 1A/1B.
You'll be working hard the whole time, but it sounds doable. I never took it, but I know 16A is super annoying. I highly suggest taking an adjunct class for 53, unless you are super good at math/disciplined. Even then, it doesn't hurt to have extra practice/resources for such an important class in the declaration process.
Yes I'm definitely taking an adjunct for 53 regardless of 61B. I'm leaning away from doing Math 53 + 61B this semester because I need A's or close to A's on both of them, and both are not-so-easy classes haha.

If I do take 61B this Fall, I'll take Data 100 + STAT 140 Spring 2021 --> CS 70 + STAT 135 + (maybe course staff??) in Fall 2021. 

Otherwise, I'll just do 61B + stat140 --> CS 70 + Data 100; followed by 61C + Stat 135. Would I be taking important classes like 61C, 135, DS 100, etc. later than avg if I go with taking 61B next spring?
Nah, looks normal to me. I'm not entirely sure when most people take 61C, but I don't think Spring sophomore year is late. 

I'll just say that it's harder to get into ds100 as a freshman. Idk if online means they'll make way more spots.
>I'll just say that it's harder to get into ds100 as a freshman.

You were right lol. I'm on the waitlist - position 205 🤡. Got into STAT 133 so I have the min. units required but oops XD
Lol rip, it's okay, you can try again next sem! Good luck bro!"

Anyone? I'm serious!

\#Edit

A fellow Lana sister also suggests that we can put some ""intellectual spin"" to the club, in addition to the main events, like intellectual discussion of how Lana's song lyrics also incorporate feminist messages like body positivity, sexual autonomy, gender diversity, sisterhood, solidarity, sexual confidence, emotion self-expression...etc. Everyone can be a sister!

CS61B/Stat 133/135 +breadth doable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g29qyw/cs61bstat_133135_breadth_doable/,2020-04-15 23:39:44,"I'm planning on taking these next semester probably with some breadth class but i'm not very sure about the workload. Anyone have any thoughts? Professors are Yun Song for 135, Trujillo for 133 and Hug for 61b

Unfortunately the finals for these 3 classes are all on the same day, but I need them as prereqs for either stat upper divs/cs70. I could possibly push 133 a semester if that's any better?","133 essentially exists to teach stats majors how to code. there is literally zero reason for you to take it aside from the stat major's stupid requirements. I don't think the department enforces prereqs either.

otoh, 133 will probably be very easy for you. I think the workload of 133/135/61b is completely manageable, but 3 finals on the same day sounds rough.
Second this! The only challenge you'll face taking 133 is getting used to R's syntax (I'm taking the class atm and it's the only challenge I have, as well as many others, have faced). 

As an aside, I'm also taking 135 next sem so OP if you want to study together feel free to PM me"

Legally Blonde 

Bonus Round: Actors who went to Berkeley!

Chris Pine (Wonder Woman), Brenda Song (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody), John Cho (Harold and Kumar), Gregory Peck (To Kill a Mockingbird), Yahya Abdul-Mateen (Aquaman), Ki Hong Li (The Maze Runner), George Takei (Star Trek), Adam Lamberg (Lizzie Maguire), Paula Patton (Mission Impossible)","movie reference: catch me if you can
Rick and Morty also mentioned Berkeley in their most recent season
You should also include 22 Jump Street, as Eric reiterates that “he was supposed to go to Berkeley” in the [jail scene](https://youtu.be/P78J9C2OLT0).
GORDO WENT TO CAL 😮
You’re missing a huge one. The kissing booth 2.
Doc Brown from Back To The Future is also a Cal grad
In Searching (2018) a girl says that she's trying to get into Berkeley! Coincidentally John Cho is the main actor.
Book reference spoiler for Percy Jackson series: >!Annabeth goes to Berkeley!<
not a movie but the show “Weeds” mentions Berkeley quite a few times!
Grey's Anatomy, Christiana Yang (Sandra Oh) gets her PhD from Berkeley :')

in another Grey's episode a patient gets into Cal
If we’re going outside of movies, I was really surprised to see a brief reference to (a future) Berkeley in Cyberpunk 2077!
TV show: In House MD, Dr Kutner (Kal Penn) went to Berkeley for his undergrad. Irl Kal Penn went to UCLA but is good friends with John Cho who did go to Cal


Another TV show: in Monk, Adrian Monk is a Cal grad
Pixar's Soul
10 Things I Hate about You. The Stiles character is obsessed with getting into Berkeley.
If your list includes any reference to Berkeley at all then you can add United 93. Mark Bingham was a passenger on that flight and was a Cal alum. They portray him in the film wearing a Cal hat.

Good Will Hunting - they mention Ted Kaczynski teaching at Berkeley
Gregory Peck went to Berkeley!

He was one of the biggest actors of his time and was in To Kill a Mockingbird as Atticus.
The tailor's store in Soul is based on Advanced European Tailors in Berkeley
The Perks of being a wallflower book mentioned Berkeley. I’m not sure if the movie did tho
Sopranos too
Princess Diaries 2 mentions Lily Moscovitz attends Berkeley
Good will hunting. in one of the scenes they were sitting down having lunch and referenced berkeley

Rise of the planet of the apes. I think there was a Cal shirt in there and the main character either went to or works at berkeley.
George takei?! Ohhhhhh myyyyy didn’t know that
Also, forgot that Korean actress Choi Hee-Seo (최희서 ) was also a Berkeley student (Performing Arts).
Monsters University, what a reference to Berkeley lol
The Graduate?
If you wanted to include famous HK actors, you could include veteran actor Kenneth Tsang Kong(曾江)(School of Architecture), most noted for his role in A Better Tomorrow and his many numerous appearances in Jackie Chan movies.  Also Terence Yin Chi-Wai (尹子維) (Philosophy), also a HK veteran actor, most noted for having a famous actress mother.
Chunk from The Goonies (Jeff Cohen) went

Basic Instinct has a mention too
Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park is a visiting biology lecturer at Berkeley!
Boys and Girls, a late 90s rom com that is pretty pedestrian, but is notable that it actually is almost entirely shot on location on campus and in SF, and not at UCLA with b-roll and establishing shots. I think this is the most I've ever seen of campus in a studio movie. Use of geography is very wacky though, the main characters hang out in SF and the Marin headlands all the time.

Also, kind of cheating, but the legendary documentarian Frederick Wiseman has a 4 hour documentary called ""At Berkeley"", detailing student life and the administration over one academic year.
If you guys are trying to brag about Berkeley entirely and all the ""smartness"" in the movie ""Arrival"" with Amy Adams when the aliens arrive and the U.S secret services don’t know what else to do they go for Americas most smart linguist (Amy Adams) to decode the alien's speech sounds and what they want to communicate, Amy Adams declines, and secret services leave for their 2nd option... and she says when you go to Berkeley ask professor (can’t remember the name) what does (can’t remember) means in (can’t remember). Still, they go back to her for the answer which was cow shit, proving she was better than the linguist Berkeley professor for the job.

The movie is not trying to put in 2nd place Berkeley. Still, they go with her first because I believe she was working with the government before but lost her child or something and they wanted to know if she was ready, but she wasn’t, but then after some days she was and a helicopter lands on her patio to take her to the alien's site.

The director is Denis Villeneuve who did Blade Runner! the movie made over 200million in the box office, and it has high scores on rotten tomatoes, meta critic, imbd etc... it’s a must-watch IMO
Agent Lindsay in T-Men (Dir. Anthony Mann, 1947) graduated from Berkeley.

r
[""At Berkeley""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3091552/) is a documentary from 2013 about the University.  I realize it's pretty on the nose as a ""reference"", but would include it because if you haven't seen it, it's neat, and it's got a decent IMDB score (for a 4 hour long documentary) and [won a few awards](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3091552/awards?ref_=tt_awd)
Never seen this, but it was filmed during my tenure on campus:

[Boys and Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_and_Girls_(2000_film))
If we are doing TV shows, there was an episode of Quantum Leap set on campus.

Showing my age but a great show!
""Fear the Walking Dead"" - The girl was supposed to go to Berkeley before the zombie apocalypse hit lol
The Umbrella Academy season 2. The girl Ben liked (who was in Klaus’ cult) wanted to go to Berkeley
I feel like it's more interesting to know which movies are set at Berkeley. For example, both ""Antman and the Wasp"" and ""The Graduate"" have Berkeley as a setting. In ""The Graduate"", [you can see old Sproul Plaza, old Moe's Books, and old AC Transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY5_Gu_mLfM).
if we're going any reference to Berkeley, no matter how trivial- 

minor Bond-villain Henry Gupta (Tomorrow Never Dies*) is a ""techno terrorist"" who was a student at Berkeley in the 60s
Tim Kang, a character actor mostly in films, but played a big part as Kimball in the TV show The Mentalist, was a Political Science grad.
Where exactly in Antman and the Wasp, Hulk, Iron Man, and Legally blonde? do you’ve clips links? So I don’t have to watch the whole thing hahah I saw antman but can’t remember but makes sense since the history is developed in SF
Omg Atticus went to Berkeley
The Umbrella Academy. When Ben was in Klause's body and was obsessed with that girl that left Berkeley to join his cult
Mare of Eastwood has mention of Berkeley's media studies.
Can’t believe I forgot that one, it’s one of Spielberg’s best!
Movies including Silicon Valley, mention Berkeley at least once

Haha this might be the funniest Berkeley reference in a movie!
“You guys need to get me the fuck outta here”
And the princess diaries 2
Very cool!
It fits her so well!
The West Wing does too! CJ says she went to Berkeley
To add, Parenthood is set in the city of Berkeley, and I believe a few of the characters went to Cal. In The O.C., a few characters also go to/studied at Cal.
Awesome! I need to make another list just with all the TV show references!
Damn they really need to fix the game so I can play it
I might need to make another list with all the TV show references!
Another TV show: in Halt and Catch Fire its mentioned that Gordon and Donna went to Berkeley.
It’s there! Already one of my favorite Pixar films!
I thought she wanted to go to Sarah Lawrence?
Awesome! It’s such a fun rom com!
He’s in there! It’s so crazy he went here!
Oh shit! He went to my high school too, I didn't even realize he went to Cal.
So cool! It’s amazing how many Berkeley/Bay Area references are hidden in Pixar films
He ended up transferring to UCLA :( so people don’t talk about it too much, but yeah he was here for a while!
It’s there! It’s so fun to watch it and see buildings that look just like campus! They have almost exact replicas of Sather Gate and the Campanile in MU.
It’s in there, but yes, it’s the quintessential Berkeley movie!
Arrival is on the list! It’s an absolute masterpiece, probably my favorite Villeneuve film! I’m so excited for Dune!
YESSSSSSSSSSSS I was about to say this one, this is the classic one!!! literally, the whole history unfolds surrounding UC Berkeley the movie made Sharon Stone a movie star and the film made 352million usd on a 40mill usd budget which for the early 90s that would be the avenger's box office of today, i would say this movie put on the radar the school for millions of people to know across the world

I would also say this is the biggest movie reference for the school ever, but no one from junior year to senior at the moment would want to watch an old movie from the early 90s
Hey they don’t all have to be masterpieces!
Yes he mentions Klauss that she left a full bright scolarship to go to Berkeley just to join Klau's stupid cult 😂😂also, Klaus starts the whole cult movement in Berkeley and then starts traveling in the bus with all the other groupies followers of his
I tried to include those too, so both those movies are on the list! The graduate in particular is like the essential Berkeley movie, I love it! Antman and the wasp is awesome too, it’s crazy to see Berkeley play a key role in a modern blockbuster! I wonder if there’s any other notable movies set in Berkeley that I missed.
Kevin Costner's character in Field of Dreams was a Berkeley grad.
> Wing does too! CJ says she went to Berk

Can anyone comment on these classes? I am a double major in Stats/Econ, and have a pretty strong math background.","not familiar with econ classes at all, but relative to the CS classes I've taken stat 135 was a pretty straightforward tech. I didn't really like the class at all but it wasn't difficult imo.

otoh, Lucas's curve was pretty brutal lol. median grade was a B-, 10% failed, and the average gpa was 2.59. the final was also effectively 65% of your grade, because it was so much easier than the midterm that almost everyone clobbered.
That looks fine. Yun Song is a pretty good lecturer (had him for cs70). On the econ side of things, your schedule looks great.
For 136 you should be totally fine. If you already understand the concepts behind derivatives, fixed income, and equities then you’re way ahead of the curve. The only difficult part is understanding the math behind the many pricing and valuation derivations. Prof. Hawkins is a really good professor and is fairly clear about the material.

Idk who is teaching C181 but I had Roland-Holst and the class does take quite a bit of time. The material is extremely bland and getting the grade you want just depends on your understanding of all the math behind the models.
I took Stat 134 with Lucas and his final was wayyyyy harder than the midterm, but yeah....not a huge fan of Lucas

However, Lucas isn't teaching 135 next semester.....someone else is (professor Yun Song), and he has never taught 135 before and has questionable reviews on RMP!!!
I've heard similar things about C181, so I switched to taking Stat 155 instead, and am going to replace Econ 119 with an easy LD breadth class!

I'm low-key really excited for 136 because I've heard great things about it
I'm pretty sure yun song is a dude. He taught the probability half of cs70 the past two falls and I've heard great things about him.

(unless there are two yun songs lol.)
Took 135 with Song in Fall 2017. One of the best professors I've ever had in Berkeley, but extremely difficult. Song focuses on proofs/theory and his HW is similar to that. Lucas focuses much more on applications. Song is definitely the better professor and you'll get more out of the class, but be prepared to work.
Yeah 136 is by far my favorite class at Cal. Hawkins spent half his life on wall street so if you’re interested in all that stuff then he has a lot of interesting stories for you.
You're right! I must have been thinking of another prof 😅
that sounds so much better than Lucas's version. his class was essentially AP Stats 2.0."
Legalst 138 vs 107,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/158or5y/legalst_138_vs_107/,2023-07-24 15:07:43,"I’m considering adding either Legalst 138 (Supreme Court and Public Policy) or 107 (theories of Justice). The professor for 138 is Kyle Deland, who has no reviews ( I believe he’s a grad student, and this is his first solo instructor class). 107 is w/ Sarah Song.

138 looks very Interesting but I’m hesitant due to the workload I’ve heard it entails w/ memorizing cases, and since it might be a wild card because the professor is new. I know I’ll take 107 eventually since it’ll be for a core requirement, but I heard professor Song is really good and the seats are more competitive to get her courses.

I would appreciate any feedback, especially from students who’ve taken either/ both courses!

Thankssss","138 is pretty easy, no matter who the professor is. I lucked out and got a special guest professor for this course, none other than the Dean of Berkeley Law, Erwin Chemerinsky himself. It was magical. But, regardless of who teaches it, it's about the Supreme Court, so it is modern, relatable, and most importantly - your opinion counts as a correct answer. You will examine the history of the Supreme Court and the most famous/socially impactful decisions of (mostly) the 20th Century, and on exams you can argue for your opinion without worrying about a right or wrong answer. You just have to use the concepts/points of law correctly to argue for your point of view. If you're interested in pursuing law it's kind of an essential course. That being said, I have no idea who this other professor is. I haven't taken Theories of Justice so I can't speak to that.
is law school in your future? always take the class with a predictable professor. a wild card new professor might make your life hell or not, but it’s better to know what you’re getting into. a B/A- could actually be detrimental in the long run, sadly for prelaws

How famous is Lil B/BasedGod among the student body?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mr5qeq/how_famous_is_lil_bbasedgod_among_the_student_body/,2021-04-14 19:29:37,I’m an incoming freshman and ive been a big BasedGod for a while and knowing that he’s from Berkeley and has made a song abt it id assume he’s pretty well known. Is Berkeley by Lil B a known hit? Does he ever perform on campus? Lol just tryna spark discussion,"Here’s the thing, my friend. People like you and I, i.e. those with IQs of 160+ who are studying EECS, MechE, nuclear engineering, etc., get it. We just do. Lil B is by and large the greatest musician of our lifetime. You see that. I see that. Others on this campus, however, do not. When your roommate tries to tell you how good that new Brockhampton album is, just nod and smile. They can’t help it. They just don’t know any better.
I use a Lil B video as a reading for CS 195.

An older student’s thoughts on college during the pandemic,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jvrmfz/an_older_students_thoughts_on_college_during_the/,2020-11-17 03:44:35,"I started my degree at Cal in 1992 and was recently class of 2020. I didn’t make close friends until I studied abroad at Osaka University in 1994. I took a leave of absence in 1995 after the Great Hanshin Earthquake to help a friend whose family business was affected by the earthquake. Business was already hard for them before the earthquake since the bubble economy had just collapsed a few years earlier. I realize things are tough for the younger generation too now that I’ve had classes with a bunch of 22 year olds losing internships and worrying about the job market.

If there’s anything I learned from my early 20’s, it’s to look after your friends even when times are hard for everyone. You might not be able to travel halfway across the world during a pandemic to support them, but this generation has social media and video calling. I wouldn’t consider myself an anti-social media boomer, but I think young people should try using technology differently. My middle-aged friends and I rarely make social media posts or like/react to posts. DM’s and video calls are enough for us to feel connected.

Don’t worry about missing out on the so-called college experience if you’re a freshman or transfer. A memorable and fullfilling time in college doesn’t have to be a typical experience.

A song that I remember being popular when I was studying abroad was Makenaide by ZARD. It roughly translates to Don’t Give Up.","As an alumnus, I'm not going to tell you how to use technology or whether to worry or not.  That's because I am not equipped to do so. Actually no internet stranger is. Why? 1) nobody has ever gone through college sitting in their room in front of a screen during a global pandemic, 2) nobody knows exactly what you're feeling, 3) nobody knows your unique circumstances, 4) different people use technology in different ways - there's no right or wrong, better or worse, and 5) worrying isn't something you can just stop doing.

All the posts complaining about the challenges of going to college during the pandemic are valid and appropriate. I would be super stressed, anxious, depressed, angry, etc. from my inability to socialize and learn the way humans are meant to by nature and nurture, i.e. in person. This is only worse when it occurs during such formative years of life that you can't re-do every again. This is not catastrophizing - these are facts that we should accept and understand.

Use technology however you want. Worry however you want. Do college the way you want. When you have questions, feel free to turn to the subreddit for help. Or call a friend. Or text a family member. Or don't do any of that. We all cope in different ways. Do what works for you. Let's not dish out hackneyed advice.

Just know that we older Cal alumni feel for you. We'd all be struggling in your shoes.
People are angry and depressed because we feel like we CAN’T have access to a meaningful undergrad experience. For those of us who find socializing difficult, the “typical” undergrad experience made it MUCH easier to make friends. I joined clubs, I made study groups. I had a lot of fun. But now that school is online I don’t have that.

And no, I can’t just FaceTime people. That’s not how this works. My social life has essentially been reduced to my family members and my 2 best friends. My study group doesn’t want to talk anymore. My clubs barely meet anymore, and the virtual meetings are TERRIBLE.

Furthermore, I’m missing out on socializing with acquaintances and strangers. And isn’t that what college social life is all about? Parties, football games, huge lectures. I always loved the sense of camaraderie I felt with others. 

As a junior, I made the decision to continue pursuing my degree instead of withdrawing. Now I’m losing 1/2 of my college years. 

So yes. I’m angry and sad. And I’m worried. And I think that I have every right to be.
It’s good to get some perspective on this sub-reddit from time to time. I feel that as 20-something year olds we tend to lose sight of that the fact that college is at most just 4 years out of our relatively longer lives, and what happens here must not be the end-all for us.

Thanks for giving us that!!
I’m a 32yr old senior and I must say that it has been a real bummer to finally go back to school and make it this far only to have an online learning experience. However, because of my age I’m not worried about missing out on life experiences with friends. For me, the loss is in losing the engagement of the in-person learning experience. 
But for all the early 20s folks, I know this shit sucks but you still have all of your 20s left to fuck around, make mistakes, and have a blast. The plus side is that you’ll hopefully have careers and money to burn in your 20s rather than working 40-60hrs/week and having no money in your 20s like I did. Keep your heads up because your best years truly are ahead of you.
Also an older student and I think younger people should use social media exactly as it works for them. Just because you do it differently doesn't mean anyone is doing it right or wrong. They grew up with it. We didn't. It is part of how they socialize.
I don’t know man, undergrad years are pretty special. I would be pissed with online leaning as an undergrad, not to mention the lack of socializing. Losing a year or two of it is a pretty huge deal
U didn’t come back to CAL for like 20 years??
Bruh. Facetime your 2 best friends. 2 best friends are worth more than a trash study group
But on the other hand, it's because we only get 4 years of college (undergrad at least), and basically 1/3 of that is gone due to COVID, that many of us feel sad
Idk why you’re being downvoted. I agree with you and I’m pretty sure this is how most people feel.
Not that rare. I took 15 years off. One semester turns in to 30 super fast.
Same. Tbh in the beginning of this semester I spent quite a bit of time moping around about how sad my situation is, but at this point I’ve just given up and accepted it as it is.
I’m taking off as of now too. So I guess we in the same boat

"Join the official berkeley subreddit discord for meetups, school discussions, and other stuff",https://discordapp.com/invite/SYfBxKB,2018-08-20 20:39:28,,"'Watch Me Whip' is literally the worst song I have ever heard

The song ""Watch Me Whip"" is single-handedly the worst song I have ever heard. Before you get all bent out of shape, I do know that it's not to be some intellectual masterpiece of modern art; it is just factually a shitty song. Here's why:

Repetition:
This song takes repetition to a level rivaled only by songs written for 3 year-olds. The singer repeats his name a full 6 times before the third verse, just in case you were wondering who 'wrote'? No vocalised the script put in front of him. There were 980 'words' in this song. Is nae a word? Scratch that, I truly don’t care. Of those 980 words, three variations (Now watch, now watch me, watch me) represent 369 words. That’s more than ⅓ of the song for literally 3 words (and I didn’t include the single mentions of the word ‘me’). If we include ‘ooh’ (there are 84 instances) and ‘bop’ (there are 72 instances), which total 156, we have 525 out of 980 words made up of 5 words. I think we get the picture on this.

Simplicity:
The most complex word in this song is a tie between ‘Silento’, the vocalist’s (not an artist in my opinion) handle, the word ‘already’ (which appears literally once), and the word ‘superman’. Doing a quick tally, that means that 15 single word instances are 3 syllables. All the rest are 1 or 2 syllables. The vocabulary is not strong with this one. Look at that! My use of ‘vocabulary’ beat out this song by 2 whole syllables!

The culmination of the two previous points into the dumbing down of everyone who had the displeasure of hearing this song:
Pretty self-explanatory. Look, I get that the writer wasn’t going for a Pulitzer or a Grammy, but a quick hit that’ll be catchy and easy to remember. Fair enough. EXCEPT FUCK YOU YOU’RE LITERALLY RUINING MUSIC. Who am I to say what should and shouldn’t be written? An asshole, that’s who. One who is procrastinating other, important work.

Basically, by putting music out that has a grand total of about 30 unique words, you’re contributing to the lowered standard of quality of music. This is one step away from repeating one single word over and over for 5 minutes straight, which now that I think about it probably exists. Except that would have some comedic value at the very least. This shit, well it’s like a kindergartener took a crayon and drew a stickman (poorly, I might add), that was subsequently put up in an art gallery. Real, impressionable children will listen to this and think “ Wow, dad was wrong! I CAN skate in life only knowing less than the bare minimum needed to be able to read ‘See Spot Run’, which I never did because fuck books and education”. (Side note - That interaction wouldn’t have been possible outside the child’s head, since there are too many unique words used)

Now put on your tin-foil hats, because this is where I lose half of you with my bullshit. Songs like this promote the opposite of education. Like I said, it devalues a halfway competent vocabulary in the name of catchiness and a cheap ‘musical’ fix. When you see what can be presumably defined as success (ie having several hundred million views on Youtube and countless other radio plays), it sets a standard in young, impressionable minds. We’ve had many people trying to get past this dumbing down of society, like KRS-ONE, Stevie Wonder, John Lennon, and many others (No, of course not all of their songs). They were trying to create a more engaged people who reflect on the actual issues we face as a society, instead of making up a cute little dance to go along with your shitty track as your brain melts from lack of use.

Who is the target market for this song? For all the reasons I’ve brought forth, I believe the target market to be the typical vapid, vacuous consumer that doesn’t engage in critical thought related to anything more than whether the Kardashians look better in blue or teal. I realise that I’ve made a broad, fairly baseless claim, and yet I’m confident it’s pretty accurate. Songs like these placate the masses with their simplicity and safety. You don’t need to think, you don’t need to guess what it’s talking about, you just need to follow these three easy steps and you too can conform to the newest dance craze. Independent thought is the antithesis of this track. By listening to this, you are using time that could be spent thinking of ways to better the city/country/world you live in. Again, I realise that not everyone WANTS to engage with the world like this, but I will still stand by the claim that critical thought is better than being herded like a goddamn sheep by pop-music.

So what have we learned today? Well, mostly that I’m way too mad about a song. That’s a given. What I want to really stress is that this song is symptomatic of a larger issue at hand. Like the CIA funneling crack into ghettos, to me this type of music represents a concerted effort to quell independent thought. Ultimately it’s easier to listen to a catchy song with like 7 words than to actually sit back and think about why everything is kind of messed up.

I really, truly fucking despise this song.
Uh what "
Congrats fellow graduates!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nd4vxc/congrats_fellow_graduates/,2021-05-15 11:10:25,"We made it! 

To my fellow transfers especially, we moved heaven and earth to come to Berkeley only to get less than a year of the full experience. But we are resilient and more prepared for future challenges in life and work as a result. And so are the ones who came in as freshman.

My mom graduated in 1999 when this song came out. I think it's still great advice for today: https://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI

I also recommend watching *The Graduate* (1967) on HBO Max. It's about a recent college graduate who's worried about his future. Part of the film takes place at Berkeley, and some of it was actually filmed on campus. The first time I watched it was when I was in community college, but it resonates a lot more strongly as a graduate.

Good luck to everyone, and again, congratulations!",
Advice on Berkeley choirs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6c9ie4/advice_on_berkeley_choirs/,2017-05-20 02:22:35,"Hello, I will be moving from Sweden to Berkeley this fall for an exchange and I’m an avid choral singer. 

Does anyone here sing in a choir and give me some pointers to which choirs are good in the Berkeley area? 

I’ve mostly sung in men’s chorus but I’d be willing to sing in a mixed choir as well. I primarily like choral music and is not as big a fan of pop songs arranged for choir.

How’s the choir life in the US/Berkeley overall?","I've been in the Chamber Chorus for a semester now, and have really enjoyed it! We don't get as much publicity as some of the a capella groups, but if you're looking for a more traditional choral experience then Chamber Chorus or University Chorus is for you :) UChorus has more undergrads and non-music majors, while Chamber has more music majors and a fair number of grad students (in the sciences). I'm a chemistry undergrad for reference.  
Both chorus meet twice a week each for 1.5 hours at a time (total of 3 hours per week), in the evening, so it's a pretty low time commitment.
Hey man! Berkeley has a stellar Men's Octet you should look into auditioning for! I also know they have a couple of a capella groups on campus that are pretty solid. As far as classical choral music, though, Berkeley's really not the place to be. I mean, yes, Berkeley has a Chamber Chorus, but I dont know if they're anything special. However, I'm sure they're still a solid group and I don't doubt you'll be able to find a choir that you'll enjoy while you're here :)
Hello, I was a member of the uc chamber ensemble (UCCE) as part of an a cappella group. I had a choral background as well so you might enjoy the a Capella community. There are so many  groups on campus and the variety of the groups are crazy diverse. Most of them perform weekly on Sproul plaza next to the gate. It's quite the commitment but worth if you enjoy singing.


On an unrelated note, if you are a bass Noteworthy will gladly audition you. Go bears
https://ucchoral.berkeley.edu/ is the website for UCCE. It's the parent group of Noteworthy and UC Men's Octet as mentioned above. The full list of groups is available on the website.

I would also recommend the UC Men's Chorale, since it's fun and has a low time commitment.
The GSE choir is super low key, if you're looking for something a little more relaxed! My boss runs it and he's a very talented choral leader. They really need men too! Message me if you're interested in getting involved with them!
Hi /u/resainos! Chamber Chorus sounds interesting! How does it differ from University Chorus? How many people are in the choir and what kind of music have you sung during your semester?
Glad you're interested /u/Coedwig! Chamber Chorus is about 35 people, while UChorus has (more) people, can't remember exactly how many. Here's the website for the Chamber Chorus (the University Chorus link is on the left hand side) http://music.berkeley.edu/performance-opportunities/university-chamber-chorus/
The main difference between UChorus and Chamber that I've heard about is that Chamber moves at a much faster pace through the music, and that there are higher expectations on the musical ability of Chamber singers. Honestly if you're interested I would recommend trying out for both (since they're under different directors) and seeing which one you like better. 
I'm not sure about UChorus but this semester Chamber sung 18 pieces in 8 different languages with the theme of Love and Longing. We had Brahms, Schumann, Rautavaara, and Randall Thompson, just to name a few.
Thanks! I’m a bigger fan of smaller choirs so I might apply for Chamber Chorus when I move there, it sounds pretty similar to what I’ve sung in my home country. Thanks for your input!"
Meeting people/social life at berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tkwcj5/meeting_peoplesocial_life_at_berkeley/,2022-03-23 08:22:12,"This is pretty much just a vent. 

I’m currently a senior at Berkeley studying architecture. Majoring in architecture is nice because of the tight knit community, but it also kinda has a downside. Because all of my classes are only at wurster and I see the same 50-100 people everyday that are in my class, it makes it difficult to branch out and meet jew people.

I’m part of an athletic club on campus, but not many people are part of it (5-10 people). So while it’s nice to hang out with them, like architecture, it’s so few people (and the same ones everyday) that I feel like I’m not branching out. 

I am honestly really happy/content with my “circle.” I am really, really close to my housemates, I have other acquaintance friends, and I’m never necessarily lonely (which I’m grateful about). But I feel like I’m not taking advantage of being at such a big campus with the opportunity to meet lots of people.

I think a lot of this worry/stress was brought on by the fact that my boyfriend of 3ish years and I broke up recently. That happening made me think about how I feel like I was just so content/settled with my routine before that I didn’t force myself to branch out. 

With that said, I was wondering if anyone has advice on where to meet people (not just romantically, just in general?) on campus? I honestly don’t know. I feel like clubs are such a commitment and I have class with the same people in my major and would like to meet people from other departments

I saw a few other people on this sub post about themselves, so I’ll do the same and if anyone is interested in hanging out I’m down to meet new people! 

- I like to run, hike, and bike. If anyone wants to run together I’d be down! My pace is around 8 minutes on average 
- I enjoy reading and talking about psychology 
- indie music (can talk about different songs forever. I always like comparing and showing fellow indie lovers music I like and vise versa)
- I like art and design 
- cooking  
- walking around pretty neighborhoods in Berkeley 
- plants? Idk if this is an interest, more like I just have a lot 
- making videos 
- himym and Gilmore girls lol","Every week people make posts on Reddit asking to meet up and every week people make low effort responses like “PM me! I’m down!” and nothing every happens.

Nobody wants to meet strangers that they don’t know from online. 

Go out and meet real people on your own - it requires real effort
8 mile pace is pretty nuts; that's like top 5% for females of your age band.
up coming freshman here. have you been able to branch out and meet new people since the time of this post? If so how did you meet these people?
Agreed! I exchanged messages with a few people last year and nothing came of it.
Lol I made a post about asking for a girl to go on a date with me (I’ve never been on one as they usually ghost me last minute haha) and well yeah nothing came of it"
Any Non-competitive Acapella Clubs On Campus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bszmm6/any_noncompetitive_acapella_clubs_on_campus/,2019-05-25 14:07:17,See title; the only experience I have with singing is of the in-the-shower variety--so I know full well how little skill I have--but I enjoy it a lot and would like to get more involved.  Are there any acapella groups on campus that take all auditioners/which groups are less competitive than others?,"Unfortunately, I’d say that all acapella groups on campus are pretty competitive simply because a comparatively high volume of students are auditioning for a small amount of spots in each group. Your best bet is probably to put yourself out there and try your best! There are also two UCCE chorale groups- Men’s Chorale and Women’s Chorale- that aren’t necessarily always singing acapella, but accept all levels of vocal talent and are a great bunch of people. Even if this doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, it’s a good place to start if you want to get some training and audition for other groups later on. I’d advise attending the Welcome Back to Acapella event in the first week of fall semester and researching online to pick out groups you like/want to audition for! Good luck!!
[deleted]
Consider joining University Chorus, Music 144.
As someone who was part of an a cappella group, I support everything in this comment. The Chorales are terrific and great for beginners and experienced singers alike. I would also recommend just auditioning for a bunch of groups and seeing what the experience is like so that you can gauge if/how much/where you need to improve to make the cut next time around.
I’ve never done acapella before but I’m really really interested in joining a group, do you have any advice?
Thank you for the advice!  I think I'll look into the Men's Chorale and talk to the post below.
That's awesome!  Will you guys be operating over summer?  I'll be here anyways, so I figure the sooner I can get started, the better.
I’d never done acapella before coming to college either, so don’t let that discourage you! Everything I said above is good, but here’s some additional advice:
- The more groups you audition for, the higher chance you have of getting into one. The auditions are usually the second/third week of the semester for every group.
- Every group has a different style and personality. Make sure you audition for the ones you think are the best fit for you, because you’re going to spend a lot of time with the people in your group!
- You’ll need a good audition song, obviously, but make sure you also plan ahead for callbacks. That second and third song needs to be just as impressive as your initial audition song, but hopefully shows off another aspect of your range or style as a singer. 
- The audition process is going to be nerve wracking and probably very long, but make sure not to let that stop you from being friendly. If you come across as conceited, aggressive, etc. you have less of a chance of impressing the people you’re auditioning for. Acapella groups are performance based groups as well, so make sure to at least pretend like you have confidence in your singing abilities! 
- If you get cut from callbacks, most groups will tell you that you can email them for feedback on your audition. Make sure to follow up on that, because they can offer valuable advice that could help you in other auditions.
Summer acapella is a thing, but I don’t really know how it works, I’d have to ask people who stay in Berkeley during the summer (I haven’t so far). If you just want to get singing, you can absolutely do it in any form! I wouldn’t worry about doing organized stuff from a competitive standpoint though, that’s too much stress and IMO unnecessary
Heyo I’m in the summer group that Robo mentioned — it’s usually just something thrown together by a few friends from each a cappella group. The community is phenomenal and every group gets along with one another so it’s almost like you’re in one big group sometimes.

Unfortunately not enough people are in town for each individual group to function over the summer. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me and I’ll be here if any of your concerns needs a meetup!
Thank you so much for the advice!! Where can I see a list of acapella groups that Berkeley has?
I don’t believe there’s a full list anywhere because different groups are either affiliated with UCCE or independent.

The UCCE groups are UC Men’s Octet (all men), Noteworthy (all men), The California Golden Overtones (all women), Cal Jazz Choir, and Perfect Fifth. There are more groups within UCCE, such as the two chorales and BareStage, but they aren’t strictly acapella groups. 

The independent groups are Dil Se (mainly Indian cultural group), Artists in Resonance (AiR), Drawn to Scale (DtS), Nikkei Choral Ensemble (NICE; mainly Japanese cultural group), For Christ’s Sake (FCS; mainly religious group), and DeCadence. 

Each group has their own website and YouTube page to check out!"
"Hey Reddit, please help local band Mad Noise get voted into SXSW 2012!",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qar30/hey_reddit_please_help_local_band_mad_noise_get/,2012-02-28 19:27:17,"I don't normally do things like this [seriously, check my post history, I mostly lurk], but my friend is the bassist for Mad Noise, and they need your help to get voted to SXSW this year!

Reddit is the most powerful internet force I know, so I wanted to do my part to help make his dream come true. [Also, he goes to Berkeley, so you actually may have heard of him/their music. They played at Yoshi's very recently, and are scheduled for Saturn Cafe in a couple weeks.]

It's all very easy -

1) CLICK this link! http://www.topblip.com/w/9056

2) RATE the video by clicking the little music notes!

3) LIKE the video! (click ""like"" and sign into facebook blah blah blah)

4) TWEET it! (this is also worth something, apparently.)

If he makes it, maybe I can get him to write a song about Reddit, or something. If not, well, thanks for your votes/views/looking at this thread anyway. :)

Can I get free counseling/therapy on short notice (or also scheduled) without health insurance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/79nyna/can_i_get_free_counselingtherapy_on_short_notice/,2017-10-30 07:13:42,"I have no justification to my parents for why I’d be getting therapy, if they knew I was bi I’d be disowned. I’m already in a weird spot by them calling me out for a hospital bill when I was transported for slitting my wrist and my story didn’t add up monetarily, can’t risk using their insurance more. Plus, they don’t have money either and that bill already was $400 and broke the bank. 

If anyone knows some way I can get free counseling that won’t show up anywhere, please, tell me. It’s 7am right now and I type this on this throwaway account because I realize that it’s probably more likely that I kill myself in the next 24 hours than it is that I can flip flop my sleep schedule for me to wake up at 6am for an 8am 61c midterm when I sleep at 7am (hopefully) the night before, and that in this day of having to flip flop sleep, I somehow manage to catch up from being weeks behind in this class and succeed. I missed an essay due at midnight for cs195 bc I woke up at 2, stayed in bed til 5, railed adderall until my drug dependent brain was fed and distracted, ate breakfast at 6, sat in moffitt doing nothing til 11:15 and then tried to start the essay then. I then fucked around for the rest of the night and did nothing else, left moffitt at 4am, laid in bed for 3 hours thinking, and now am writing this post. 

I literally cannot work anymore, I can’t take this fucking school or the stress. I sell my adderall to afford food but then I can’t work because I don’t have my adderall. But hey I came out as bi last week, at least to the greek system here, so maybe I’ll have a shot at the “sucking dick for drug money” meme. 

I just need the stress to stop. I feel no motivation to do anything except to write, cause when I’m writing I just lose myself in the words and can get away from real feelings. All the time I did “nothing” at moffitt I was literally just writing, not writing for class, but just writing. I wrote a 20 page (6200 word) review for a show I saw earlier this month (hip hop group called brockhampton). The other day I had my friend find me two of the most meaningless lines from the most meaningless recent trap song he could find as a challenge to myself to write something absurd and then try to argue it, and I wrote a 3 chapter, 8700 word essay about the practice of analyzing music, the “truths” or accepted musical canon, and how to use literary philosophy and stuff from Kant and Freud to establish an explicit analytical framework for reviewing and analyzing music, and contrasted that with the implicit framework that is just accepted and used by all reviewers, and then finally after these chapters of preposition I finally analyzed two dumb lines to absurdity. 

The most frustrating thing about this is that I fucking missed the deadline for the essay due at midnight but then I still wrote it afterwards from 12-2 and finished it because it was about using moral philosophy and it’s components to analyze the morality of voting to do things like raising minimum wage which will make people lose their jobs and be replaced with automated solutions, and it was a really interesting paper, but late submissions weren’t accepted, so I submitted the paragraphs establishing this sort of ethical framework of analysis and then I just cut the paper before getting to any point and submitted it cause I ran out of time, then finished after, and it ended up really good, but went way over word limit. All of this is a good example of why I’m stressed and why I fucking hate this school right now — do I really learn more as a student here if I submit by 12 and not by 2? Is my paper really a failing paper if I double the word count? I understand there are limitations to how much they can grade but for people like me who can’t deal with the stress already, knowing that you have a lot to say and have to limit it to a tiny word count of 1000 at max is terrifying and kept me from even wanting to start. 

I don’t know where this love for writing is coming from because I’ve never had it before, but now that I have no will to live, all I want to do is write essays long-form. Word limits terrify me, I’m only interested in music and philosophy, CS sucks, this school sucks, and the only reason it’s not worth us all killing ourselves is because we’d hurt other people and deprive them from opportunity cost happiness, which is p ironic cause if everyone killed themselves then it’d work out anyways. 

I’m tired as shit so I rambled, sorry. The point is, I need help, desperately, and I don’t know what to do, but I’ll probably die if I don’t get it. 

Thanks for reading 💞","[deleted]

You've got a lot going on right now, but know that you don't have to take it on by yourself. You've got lots of options available to you and plenty of people who are willing to help.


First, I would ask that you make your way to the third floor of the Tang Center to visit [Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling). If you let the person at the desk there know that you're [currently having an emergency](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/emergency), they'll help you out.


[If, however, you feel as though you can't make it to the Tang Center, please call 911](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/prevention-education-outreach/suicide-prevention).

You can also give the [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) a call at 1-800-273-8255.

Your life matters. 


After that, know that the Tang Center offers [individual counseling](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/individual) to all students. The first five sessions are free, regardless of your insurance coverage, and students are allowed to make up to eight appointments a semester.


And when it comes to food, I might suggest checking out the [UC Berkeley Food Pantry](https://pantry.berkeley.edu/about/), located in the Student Union building. You can visit twice a month to receive food for up to 10 days.


In regards to your school work, I would consider getting in touch with your professors or GSIs and letting them know what's going on. They're people too, and if you explain what's going on, even just a bit, they'll understand. It might also be worth considering [taking a break](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/social-services/academic-adjustments-and-medical-withdrawals) from your studies. College, especially here at Berkeley, can be stressful for any number of reasons. I know that when I was going through a hard time, I found it easier to take a break from school so that I could figure out how best to take care of my own needs first.


I hope you get the help you need, and I hope you know that we're here for you if you need it.
I think Tang Center is best for emergency situations, but if that proves to be a problem for whatever reason, the engineering department has [their own personal counselor, Christine Zhou](http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising-counseling).

She's got walk-in hours, although I don't remember what they are now. If you walk through ESS into the hallway behind it, you'll see her office, and there are usually fliers with the times around it. I went to her a few times when I was at Berkeley; your mileage may vary, but it's another option open to you.

I'm at work right now, so can't comment too much - but feel free to message if you need someone to listen. Wish you the best, man. This place is stressful as hell, but I think you can get through it. :')
Every student has access to free counseling with our without SHIP.

https://uhs.berkeley.edu/counseling/fees

> Students do not need to have purchased the Student Health Insurance Plan to see a counselor. Initial phone and in-person consultations, urgent visits, and initial counseling visits (up to 5th session) are all free. Minimal fees apply to other services.
Thank you, I appreciate the support. I’m gonna go in tomorrow, this helps a lot to hear.💞
Thank you for the kind words 💞

Other commenters said this too so I’ll check out the ability to cover my payment and if not you’re totally right, a discord server or something anonymous to vent might be the right choice, I think I only came here because I figure people here can know what it’s like to be a student here more than anywhere else, obviously. 

I super appreciate the offer to meet up, i think I’d be a little uncomfortable with that because of the precedent I’ve set for myself and everything but it’s incredibly kind of you to offer. My social life here is objectively quite fine; I’m next in line for social chair of social fraternity, and things look very fine from the surface, so I have people to talk to. Unfortunately it also makes the fact that I feel so alone something that’s hard to talk about, depression is a bitch and hard for other people to empathize with when it seems like it’s coming from nowhere. 

I emailed the professor so we’ll see how that goes. Hoping for the best. 

Also, yes, I’m considering picking up a double major in philosophy or something, just already feel like I’m pressed for time and don’t know if I necessarily want to add more to my plate. I really do feel passionate about CS, but this semester I’m not taking classes that have enjoyable work for me as I finish off all my lower divs. Hopefully it gets better!"
"Course Review (F22): Bio 1A, Bio 1AL, Physics 8A, Music R1B",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zw1w3c/course_review_f22_bio_1a_bio_1al_physics_8a_music/,2022-12-26 16:42:29,"Hello hello :) I wanted to share my experiences in these classes like I've done in the past and I hope it helps! If you have any questions feel free to pm. As always, these are just my opinions and experiences, I am only one person and there are lots of other people with other experiences! Background on me: pre-med, declared MCB. 

Physics 8A (Bordel): 6/10

* I'm terrible at physics LOL.
* Professor Bordel is incredibly kind, an effective lecturer, and so helpful in office hours. Really, this course is all about putting in what you want, so please go in person, ask questions, engage. She was very transparent with us about grades the entire time and updated us often.
* \*Make sure to do all practice exams that you are assigned by Prof Bordel and GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS!\*
* Workload is moderate but on the higher end. Weekly homework (w/ two drops) using online software, you get multiple attempts to get the question right. Get as much of these points as possible as a small cushion to your grade.
* Short weekly quizzes testing basic theory (1-2 mcq questions), get them right, it will  help cushion your grade.
* Why I rated this course a 6 and not higher was because the exams were quite tough and the homework didn't necessarily match the nature of the problems on exams. I believe more practice material written by Prof Bordel would have been really helpful.
* I didn't really bother reading the textbook, just focused on lectures.
* Discussion sections (while we still had em) were somewhat helpful. I personally didn't feel super supported in discussion, so I didn't go. I'd elect to go to the professor/GSI's office hours instead. Also, go to head GSI reviews before midterms! They are intense but great practice/reality check.
* Course is curved generously - I believe roughly a 76% was an A- for this semester. Don’t get me wrong - it’s not easy.
* There are 2 midterms and a final. All exams are multiple-part, word problems with free response. Partial credit saved me a lot. The final became MCQ because of the strike.
* Final was very, very tough. I guessed on about half the questions and was so distraught. Part of this is my fault, as I had a rough end of the semester and my circumstances were less than ideal but it was hard.

Bio 1AL (Sha) - 7/10

* Moderate workload. The pre-lab quiz and flowcharts are not bad - preparation for labs is fine. Postlabs are also not bad for the most part, sometimes can have tough questions but you can go to office hours or ask GSI for help.
* Experiments are fun! The theory can be boring/lengthy/complicated sometimes, but for the most part I enjoyed them and had a good time learning/figuring out. My favorite stuff had to be the streaking agar plates and fetal pig dissection.
* Dr. Sha is a nice prof, willing to answer questions. \*However, lectures tend to get a little dull/boring and so I honestly didn't attend past the first two lectures.\*
* My GSI was the BEST. He spent the first hour of lab every time explaining concepts, which I thought was weird at first but honestly this is how I learned anything and why I was successful in the class. He distilled the most important parts of the lab.
* There are lab quizzes - make sure to study and review lab concepts for these, as they can be tough. Also, a lot of the material overlaps with 1A so kill two birds with one stone.
* Lab final was hard. Avg was 60%. It is imperative to review all labs for this, as they do get really specific with material. Personally felt that it was harder than the Bio 1A final.
* A- was about an 80%.

Bio 1A (Schekman, Niyogi, Welch) - 7/10

* Light to medium workload - no actual homework. However there are 2 quizzes for each section of the course (total of 6 with 1 drop) that can be quite frustrating LOL. That being said, I'm glad we had them because they kept me accountable for the material and if you do keep up with the material, it is possible to do quite well on these quizzes as they focus on a little bit of material at a time.
* 2 midterms (each 100 pts) on the first two units. About 55% (166 pts) of the final exam is unit 3, and the remaining 45% (134 points) is divided evenly between sections 1 and 2 of the course.
* Professor Schekman taught cell biology - his style of lecturing is hard to learn with, primarily because he tends to digress into a lot of details that sort of dilute the focus of the topic. That being said, the material that Prof Schekman taught was interesting. But he sort of complicated that material and didn't explain it in the best way. Heavy memorization. His section exam average was the lowest, at about 56%.
* Professor Niyogi taught genetics - he was very effective in teaching because he spoke so coherently and made a complicated topic a little bit easier to wrap our heads around. I don't really enjoy the little intricacies of genetics as much but I respect Prof Niyogi and his section a lot. Again, heavy memorization. Exam was hard, avg was 59%.
* Professor Welch taught physiology. This section was the best. A bit of memorization, but lectures did not feel that dense at all. Also, as a pre-med, this part of the class felt the most exciting/relevant. I enjoyed the content. Average on this section of the final was a 77%.
* Keeping up with lectures was the hardest part. There were times when I was behind on 8-10 lectures. It is so, so easy to fall behind, regardless of how great of a student you are. Do NOT let yourself fall in this trap. If you fall behind on one or two, it's fine but make an effort to catch up as soon as possible. It sucks to spend your Sunday watching 6 bio lectures.
* Not much practice given, but whatever you do get, make sure to do it.
* I took notes directly on the lecture slides (which I downloaded to my iPad).
* Go to discussions and do the worksheets. Go to end of the semester GSI review sessions. Correct the mistakes you made on tests/quizzes and make an effort to understand why. Personally, this class was not much work for me because I just sort of watched the lectures and did alright. I could've done better had I made flashcards, but I was lazy lol.
* Class was curved (A- was about a 75%).

Music R1B (Singer) - 9/10

* Fun class studying Disney music and how it engages with different cultures. We dissected songs in class, made observations, and collaborated a lot with one another.
* Most of the music-related teaching happens in the first month - it was my favorite part of the class, as we got to have really nice discussion.
* Participation based class! Attendance based class!
* Weekly homework is usually quite easy for the first few months. Assignments involve some brief analysis of music from films.
* Since this is R1B, you're going to get into quite a bit of essay-writing as you progress in the class. The essays can be tedious, as Prof Singer can be particular about certain ways she likes students to write but there are many opportunities in class to ask her for feedback. She also does conferences with students as an assignment to give proper feedback.
* The class sort of became an office hours/work period as the semester went on with little bits of lecture added, since we were primarily working on papers. I was a little sad to see the discussion go, but the class was overall quite easy if you just do your work on time and are receptive of feedback for writing.","Good stuff!

You can at least brag to your non-Berkeley friends that you got taught by a Nobel Prize winner.
what is the difficulty of physics 8a like? is it high school esque where you just calculate something and the question is almost the same as lecture examples? and what about bio 1a? what made the exams averages low? i thought bio tests were just memorization based, so is what made it hard to sheer amount of info to memorize? 
or are these tests more about applying concepts to problems you've never seen before
[deleted]
Thx for the detail you put into this, super cool
[deleted]
How are the requirements in terms of attendance for Bio 1A lectures? Really not looking forward to waking up for an 8 am for most the week

Also: Does Bio 1A and Chem 3A content overlap at all? I haven’t taken Chem 3A yet, and was wondering if I would struggle with Bio 1A/1AL without orgo chem knowledge.
Hello! Your feedbacks are super helpful! Thx for doing that!

Also, I am wondering about the workload of music r1b and how hard it is to get an A. thank u!
Haha very true!
hey! so physics 8A with bordel is a lot of variable manipulation (not really as much calculation), which can get very dense when you’re considering a lot of situation-specific variables. personally, I had a hard time in high school physics and in college physics. question types are similar to lecture examples, but they are definitely varied/complicated. do tons of practice. as for bio 1A, the low averages were due to the nature of the questions. Very few questions ask you “what is ___?” Rather, you’ll get a passage or experiment and then have to use a certain concept from the course to answer the question. it’s about test-taking skills and reading skills in addition to the biology (which can be a lot to memorize but definitely more than possible). so be solid on the concepts but also know how to dissect really dense, convoluted questions (at least for the first two sections of the course if you have these professors)
Correct! I honestly didn’t read the textbook or didn’t bother trying. I would focus first on the lectures, maybe use organic chem tutor to supplement the lecture material that Prof Bordel covers, and then if you still are not able to solve problems of that topic, refer to the textbook for added support.
Of course! Hope it can help, I know it would’ve helped me to get a preview before I took these classes with these profs haha
Ofc! Thank you so much for the support and have a wonderful break! Appreciate y'all so much.
Hey there! Haha I feel you - honestly, I think the entire semester I attended 3 lectures live and the rest I watched later. You should be totally fine to not attend, they record them and at least my professors never required attendance. It should be the same for yours. That being said, be veerrryyy careful about keeping up with lectures if you don't attend (so easy to fall behind, which can really screw you over). 

There was a fractional bit of gen chem and ochem at the beginning of Bio 1A - valence electrons, chemistry of water molecules (H-bonding that gives water its properties), pH, cis/trans isomers, enantiomers, functional groups (memorize and be able to recognize in molecules) and polarity. Of these concepts, the trickiest to grasp might be the idea of enantiomers, but they briefly cover it so you should be fine without any ochem background. I wouldn’t worry about pre-studying, just make sure you have brainstormed a couple good study strategies so you can hit the ground running!
Ofc! So music R1B is not too much work, you have easy weekly assignments and ample time to write about 4 papers throughout the semester. They get longer as you go but getting an A is very doable and easy :)
[deleted]
Thanks so much! This was so helpful
no ap physics, I should have though lol. B+ in 8A, 2% away from an A- rip. made lots of mistakes by not doing practice, not going to office hours as much as I should have, not spending more time on the homework

practice problems >>> reading the textbook. You can read about it for a background but practicing is really what cements those concepts in your head :)"

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There’s a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don’t do that. While I’ve visited many times, I’ve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It’s mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we’ll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you’ll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it’s remarkable how many people I know who haven’t ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley’s best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won’t be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you’ll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don’t think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you’ve ever taken the 51B down University though, you’ll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I’ll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>• Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>• Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>• Visit the Little Farm (it’s a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>• Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris’ favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There’s also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you’re here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you’re there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven’t ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha’s hand. Don’t get cherimoya fruit though—I accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can’t even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it’s the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area’s fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don’t think their parties are exclusive? I’ve never asked. It’s a tradition though, and they’d probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn’t substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you’ll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there’s no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it’s a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn’t stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they’d let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn’t interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they’re much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it’s surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day’s moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you’re further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you’re trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn’t need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer’s markets** *You’ve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There’s a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine’s Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you’re looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley’s indie bookstores:*

>• Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>• Moe’s  *If you’re looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there’s also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>• Pegasus  
>  
>• Mrs. Dalloway’s  
>  
>• Half-Price Books  
>  
>• Eastwind Books

* **Stop into a store you’ve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they’ve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you’re closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I’m going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn’t a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the “Hell Summer” that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, “the poetry reading is out of control,” uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here’s*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I’d begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It’s hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it’s now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it’s good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There’s a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber’s Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he’s inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can’t walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I’m unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you’re looking for something wholesome, this Cal student’s** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it’s so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don’t exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he’s accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country’s history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it’s spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it’s haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don’t need to listen closely.*
* Oakland—Mountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some… mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it’s worth the trip. It’s a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can’t believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they’re filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It’s gothic, but it’s also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany—Albany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I’ve ever taken--I’ve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you’re willing to do a little bit of exploration. There’s a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It’s a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany—TEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland—Lake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There’s a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children’s Playland.*
* Oakland—[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I’m mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland—Jack London Square *I’d sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you’re into that. There’s also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London’s Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There’s also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don’t be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You’ll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill
* [Mark’s Yard Art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mark-oliviers-yard-art)
* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you’re lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There’s a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren’t an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire’s before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it’s near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I’d call it romantic.)","I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:

Check out the archives and the Bancroft Library. There's a bunch of really cool old and rare books and a lot of Cal related historical documents. You can't check anything out of the building though, you can only look at it in the reading room.
To add onto the bit about fire trails:

This section in particular (starts from the stadium, goes up to Grizzly Peak) is my absolute favorite hike in the entire area. It's a pretty steep climb but if you're a good hiker or runner then it should be very doable. 6ish miles roundtrip. When you get up into the hills you can see a huge chunk of the East Bay and into SF - and then you realize how small Berkeley is compared to the rest of the world. It's also a great place to meditate.

Walking across the Golden Gate, and looking at Berkeley/Campanile tower is an amazing perspective! Then go up the tower, and look back at the Golden Gate.
1) stay up all night watching stars at Fire Trails contemplating just how big the universe is

2) storm the field after a Big Game victory


3) eat a Top Dog after a long day of classes. As you order, think about how you’re standing right where Steve Wozniak would have ordered his first Top Dog. Don’t think too long, or the cashier/chef might yell at you 

4) Build something cool. Even if it’s stupid and you’re the only one that will ever appreciate it. It’s worth it
The pier trespassing is dangerous... Could end up with someone dying. I don't recommend.
You know, I feel like I'd appreciate this a lot more if I wasn't stuck at home for my last semester :( 

great list, though, and maybe I'll just have to come back after I graduate...
Find someone who has a code to the Essex Baths.

See a concert at the redwood grove

Meditate at the Berkeley zen center (can combine with a trip to Berkeley bowl)

Attend the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary Easter celebration hosted by the Nuns of perpetual indulgence.

Find the concrete slide in the Castro. Take a walking tour while you're at it.

Swim at the hearst women's gym pool at least once - it's covered in marble and old statues, and has a great view of the campus.

Catch the art students' semesterly print sale days. Extremely cheap awesome art.

Speaking of art, you can check out a priceless piece from the University - and switch it out every once in a while for something new.

Not quite Berkeley specific, but gaze at the stars while taking a late-night cliffside swim at the Esalen center.

Go go Land's End. It's beautiful.

Take advantage of the SF museums. They're fantastic. They also do free days every so often, if you don't want to pay ridiculous admission fees. Just get there early.

Children's Fairyland is not creepy! It's cute, and it's over 70 years old, which is cool. Rumor has it that it inspired Walt Disney when he was planning Disneyland.
A must do for any EECS undergraduate

Spend an all nighter in the depths of Soda Hall working on cs project due the next day
Wow I grew up in Berkeley and gotta say you've hit practically every spot I can think of! I personally also enjoy Panoramic Way as a walk up to a nice view, and would add Point Isabel to the list of places to visit if you're into dogs.

Really enjoyed reading this and extra thanks for sharing the 1999 blog
It's a very minor point, but ""find a strange fruit"" might be better worded ""find rare fruit"" or ""find unusual fruit"".
this is very helpful for people who havent visited campus yet cuz of covid, thanks!
Watch a football game from T1GHTWAD HILL!
Thanks for these excellent suggestions! I just checked out *American Heiress* on your recommendation. As an undergrad, my friend John used to live in that apartment - I think he said they still had bullet holes in the wall.
Adding on:

\- Read a book in Morrison Library

\- Visit Cheeseboard Pizza at least once (but probably 100+ times).

\- Get sushi at Kirala

\- Take BART to SF on a free weekday and explore the city, visit the de Young or Legion of Honor, get lunch, go to Blue Bottle Coffee at the Mint

\- Visit the Old Rose Garden at the Botanical Garden in May -- all the roses are in bloom and it is stunning

\- Swim at Strawberry Canyon pool in spring/summer

\- Visit a coffee shop so many times that the staff know you

\- Take grad pictures around campus; cliche, but as an alum, I LOVE having these
As a 2020 transfer, this is very sad. Hopefully I can stay in the area after graduating and doing some of these next year.
22. Not get rejected

~ An applicant preemptively crying over my rejection this thursday
Should have included attend the Big Game!
Underground steam tunnels should be there too
Mostly food related—

Get some food from the Buddhist temple in South Berkeley, Vik’s Chaat, Ethiopian food (Addis; might be in Oakland).  

Tilden—play golf/whack a bucket of balls at the driving range.  It’s a pretty course and the three-tier driving range is pretty cool.

Bike the bike trail along 580 to Richmond and check out the Rosie the Riveter installation.  If you are lucky, a park ranger will be present to answer questions.

Ride your bike around town at night.  It’s fun!

Frolf.

Do the sake tour (if it’s open).

Berkeley Bowl—best grocery store EVER.  Get the Odoriko tomatoes if they have them.

Kirala—chawan mushi is like an ocean French kiss.
This is the coolest post ever, thank you

-freshman at berkeley
For now, I've got one that you probably know too well by now:

Your home. 


Stay home, please? 
We need this thing to go away.
Hey, I love you and this post
This is so beautiful. Tysm <3
god i miss trawling through urban ore on a sunny day 

the south berkeley farmer's market is also amazing too and if u have calfresh u can get $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce!!!
While you're at the Rose Garden, go through the tunnel by the tennis courts to Cordonices Park and ride down the concrete slide on a piece of cardboard. There are usually a few pieces lying at the bottom. (Do not attempt sans cardboard.)
“Does anybody here remember Barrington Hall? Does anybody here remember Barrington?”

—Primus
You should add in some stuff in San Francisco since it's easily accessible to us. Great list for Berkeley though- both the campus and the wider city.
Have ramen at Marufuku in Japantown :D
this is late but what’s wrong with cherimoya?
This is one of the best posts I've seen on things to do, ever. Thank you stranger! Making me reminisce on so many positive memories of Berkeley + the Bay area. Truly unlimited things to do. I feel so thankful. If I do even teeny fraction of these things, I will be happy<3
Isn't Bancroft closed to people without special access? I tried going in during 2019 but they didn't let me :(

&#x200B;

Will add to check out all the Berkeley libraries, Doe itself has at least 4 smaller libraries within it.
I adore that trail, but good god that one slope midway though is terrifying
hope you'll be able to visit someday; most of these things will probably be here once you do (: and I hope your last semester goes as well as it can!
the heart women's gym/pool is a fascinating and beautiful old building!! i had no idea it existed until i took a final in there lol
the man's had a glorious career, there is no doubt! didn't know about his involvement in UC directly though (beyond the work in Claremont), most of my knowledge only goes as far back as John Galen Howard. very cool!
children's fairyland was my childhood. no disney could ever attempt the beauty of that place tbh.
not just a rumor, that's a fact! and I should have corrected that by now haha my Oakland neighbor who reads my newsletters said the same. unfortunately I can only speak from my experience walking around it when it's closed due to covid, and that's a bit eerie. always wanted to go inside, maybe someday /:
That place is terrifying and it made me scared as shit of puppets. So I have to disagree with you
Previously WEB. Previously 260 Evans.
I hate that I did this, but also glad I did for the experience lmao. CS projects and all-nighters mix well together
updated; is ""strange fruit"" used as a euphemism on the regular? I haven't ever heard it outside of the context of the song
Because of the association with the protest / anti-lynching song?
oh whoa that's wild!! cool that they preserved the history, but also kind of disturbing, but also I'd totally pay to set foot inside and see (': and I hope that you like American Heiress! Toobin is fairly well-respected, but it's clear that he's got a certain angle and sometimes the way that he editorialized to that was annoying.  Kind of reminded me of listening to Serial honestly--good storytelling and the character of the people really comes through, but you also have to wonder what they're leaving out. I'd love to read Patricia Hearst's memoir if I ever come across it!
I also recently learned that Morrison Library loans out original artworks to students! If I were a student again I would definitely take advantage of this.
Wait how do you find these?
many of these are fine to visit in a mask, I think we all agree that we need this to go away but depriving your life of all pleasure until then is not the way to go about it
it was $11 for one fruit lol
Haha yeah - I remember the first time I went there and tried to run up it. Even to this day I still remember how difficult that was!
It's a commonly understood phrase, yes. The song was capturing a phrase used at the time, and it is used sometimes now.
Because of its association with lynching, of which that song is part. The phrase exists beyond the song.
https://youtu.be/Web007rzSOI

For anyone who has not heard this Billie Holiday classic.
I'll be relieved if Toobin doesn't hypnotize me into jerking off in public.
[deleted]
Look for the steam
oh lol I didn’t see the word “accidentally” until now
Indeed it does. Even beyond that historical meaning. The context OP provided rendered it harmless.
As an art historian I agree with your comment completely! Glad that you were not charged. Out of curiosity, what was the work?
I totally understand your position, I didn't think it was malicious by OP"
How do I not get dead?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/94hvjr/how_do_i_not_get_dead/,2018-08-04 02:11:38,"So I was walking home today from the RSF (around 10 pm maybe) and it was pretty dark outside. I was probably a block behind unit 3 when I saw these two guys opposite the street, blasting music (it wasn't even music it was just like some guy repeatedly saying the n-word to a beat). So I was like, ""nah, I can't be scared of them just cause of the way the look"", so I kept walking on the sidewalk opposite them. Also, there were some people walking around us too, and I'm a relatively big guy who's never had any problems on the street so I wasn't tooo worried.

We reach the next block, and one of the dudes walks across and asks me for a dollar. He's clearly not homeless and is playing his ""music"" from some pretty high quality speakers, so I got kinda confused. I actually didn't have any cash so that's what I told him, and he asked for a fist bump and went back. Okay... cool.

I got kinda suspicious, and slowed down, but they also slowed down. Then I sped up, and so did they (they're still on the opposite sidewalk). Okay..... Now I should've taken the hint and switched to a more crowded street or something, but I'm a dumbshit.

So now, one block later (I think this is now at Dwight and Telegraph idk I have the direction sense of a orangutan) both of them cross the street - one guy comes behind me and the other tries to hide in like a bush a few steps ahead of me. So I try to make small talk, and ask the dude behind me what song he's listening to. And the dude straight up says ""don't worry about the song and keep walking"". Oh also, did I mention he had a gun in his pants (idk, are they still pants if you're wearing them at your ankles).

So now I obv shit myself and cross the road and fuck right off while the try to follow me and I somehow lose them by getting onto Telegraph. So now my question is, WHAT IN THE FUCK AM I PAYING MORE THAN FUCKING $70,000 TO GO TO COLLEGE AT A PLACE WHERE I CAN'T WALK HOME AT FUCKING 10 pm!? Like what the fuck is this shit. How can I recommend this school to anyone knowing that there's a good chance that the could get jumped on their way to class. This makes no sense to me. Some kid got kidnapped in South Berkeley last Saturday - like when people ask him how's college he must be like "" so the 61A midterm didn't go too well and oh yeah I got kidnapped for a ransom of 30k""

Now actual questions, if you've made it this far:

1. how do i not get mugged/beaten/raped/whatever while walking home (home is close to campus btw)? Do I call BearWalk everyday as soon as it gets dark - so at like 3 pm during Spring semester?
2. what can I do as a student to get the city or college or whoever is responsible for student safety in the city to actually give half a shit?

I'm apologizing in advance for anything offensive here, I don't mean it. I'm just so fucking lost about to what to do and completely shook. Never thought I'd come to college and get into something like this near campus. I know nothing happened, but the guy had a gun and with so many shootings in this month itself, I am super paranoid.

TLDR; How to not die in Berkeley? (pls don’t just give UCPD tips and tricKs","I don't know if you do these already or anything, but general tips are to avoid appearing clueless (unfamiliar with the area), unaware (not paying attention to the surroundings), soft with weak posture/body language, or naive (engaging with strangers at 10PM, sorry). 

You want to walk briskly and purposefully with large powerful steps like you know exactly where you're going and how to get there and damn any random motherfucker who delays you, and eyes up scanning everything/everyone, head on a swivel. Anyone stops you for anything in the evenings that you get iffy vibes from you brush them off courteously but firmly (""Nope, sorry""), still doing your own thing and walking big and fast the entire time. (In hindsight the dollar and fistbump thing was probably test to see how skittish/sharp you were IMO. I don't give strangers time of day past sunset anymore sadly)

Edit: *I really wanna emphasize the scanning eyes and head on a swivel thing*. A lot of people walk fast but they don't look around and are just staring ahead or downish so they still look unaware. Ideally every time you reach a new block you want to have assessed every person on it, and don't be too subtle about it either. 

I'm not exactly a big dude, but I've done okay so far the past few years (knock on wood). I know a lot of tall or biggish people who just kinda.. meander along. Not ideal. 

Other tips, avoid the quiet residential areas like Dwight downhill of Telegraph etc if you can. They're too quiet and too empty. The Dwight and Telegraph area sketches me the fuck out especially. 

Going uphill from the RSF I prefer Bancroft between Dana and Telegraph, then either Durant or Channing between Telegraph and College. More cameras, more blue light phones, more people, more places you can cut through to change your path versus being boxed in walking up those long Dwight blocks. 

Also dunno where you live but the Southside Night Safety Shuttle might be useful for you. There's a stop in front of Beverly Cleary Hall near Unit 3. 
This doesn’t answer your question, but I just want to suggest to never do the fist bump or anything of that kind again. That gives the person an opportunity to pull you in / make contact.
I've lived in Berkeley for 5 years and I'm a 5' tall girl. I've walked around plenty at night and haven't ever had an issue. I second what other people are saying - don't engage, walk confidently to where you're going. If you're lost but feel sketched out, don't take out your phone. Navigate yourself to shattuck or bancroft/telegraph (or wherever else you think is populated) then figure it out from there.

One thing I'll add is that I think it's better to just say ""sorry"" when asked for money, rather than saying you don't have cash. I've heard several askers respond with ""oh, I take venmo."" 
I made it through 4 years at Berkeley with no incidents and I’m a small asian girl. But, you are not alone in this :( most of my friends have had some scary incidents.

If it’s late out and I’m alone I’ll call an uber to go home. I’ve walked home past midnight multiple times but always with at least one guy friend. I stick to better lit streets, busier streets. I walk in the middle of the street so I can see anyone coming at me and I am vigilant. I have my hand in my pocket ready to call 911 if anything happens. Once I had to walk alone after dark and some guys tried to talk to me, I just kept my head up and didn’t acknowledge them. Don’t acknowledge strangers, pick up your pace and stay alert.

I’m sorry this happened to you and it sucks that Berkeley students do not feel safe walking around at night. 
Carry pepper spray and react to situations in a smarter way! To say that you didn't want to take a different route because that would make you racist just sounds silly. **Remember, safety first.** And I don't think that pointing out their race makes you racist - it's kinda funny that you point out how you're not trying to stereotype anyone so many times haha. Don't worry about being so politically correct and chill out brother!
Sorry this happened to you. Reflecting on your post, I think there are some things you could change to avoid this situation in the future.

- Don't walk alone late at night (~9PM or after). There are plenty of alternatives: go out with a group of friends, call BearWALK, take an Uber/Lyft, take a bus, take the Night Shuttle.

- Don't engage with strangers. Especially, don't make physical contact. If someone you don't know starts walking toward you, walk away. Do not talk to strangers. If you can't walk away for some reason, make a phone call to someone you trust or Berkeley police non-emergency tel:(510)-981-5900. Have them stay on the line until you are in a safe place. 

- Carry pepper spray. Learn to use it properly and don't be afraid to act if someone makes a direct threat to you.

This is pretty standard advice given to protect yourself in a major city. Berkeley is an urban environment, with crime and homelessness like any other. Of course, in an ideal world, this wouldn't happen, but in reality following UCPD's tips and tricks probably could have improved your plight significantly.
Just graduated after four years with no incidents.  I’m a little spoiled in the sense that I lived on north side for three years, which tends to be a lot safer than south side (with a few exceptions).  I did live in Clark Kerr my freshman year, and the way I stayed safe was traveling with people or using something with wheels.  I had a bike back then, and nobody is gonna try and mug you while you are biking (unless they are really ballsy)

After my bike got stolen, I got one of those Razer scooters with the biggish wheels.  They may look lame but it may have been one of the single best purchases I made in college.  Not only is it convenient for getting to classes faster, it also is a great deterrent for not getting stopped at night.  They fold up quite nicely and you can take them into classes or store them in the big lockers at the RSF (I have done this before).  Plus in their folded down state, they make an excellent object for swinging at would-be-attackers.

Tl;dr get a scooter
I live downtown and it’s not safe. Obviously Telegraph is much worse. I would say Bear Walk is a good option for sure. Being noisy or bright is very helpful also. 

I don’t know if you just moved to Berkeley but generally downtown and Telegraph are some of the most unsafe in the city. There is not much more that you can do and I do agree it sucks. Always carry pepper spray with you also there are sound devices you can get that make a lot of noise and this could also be helpful.

Overall don’t walk alone at night in Berkeley, you might be better off bicycling. 

I don’t know what to say about what you can do. Lately the mayor and council members(and also the community) hate the cops and have made their life very hard and essentially said they are unwanted in Berkeley. They have done other things to increase the amount of homeless in Berkeley while not really addressing the street problems or drug problems and sanitary issues of the commercial zones.

When people get the idea that Berkeley is lawless as it’s become lately, it becomes a hot bed for crime and that is exactly what is happening thanks to our new “liberal” mayor and council members. 

Sorry that happened, pretty scary. Always walk in well light heavily occupied places. 
Don't walk in areas you don't know late at night.

If you have to walk, walk where there's lots of people.

This is basic urban survival 101, dude.

Also, you're in a college town. There are criminals who specifically haunt the areas around the college looking for easy targets, don't make yourself an easy target.

If you're somebody who likes to dress nice or who often wears UC Berkeley gear, they're going to pay extra attention to you. It doesn't matter if you actually have money or not, if you *look* like you have money, well - money's what they're after.

Be safe.
This is such an important post and I'm so sorry this event happened to you. By coming to Berkeley I've made changes in my lifestyle (i.e. not going out late, walking around shady areas even if longer distance, waiting an hour for bear walk to come) so that I will be less likely a target even if it means inconveniencing myself. However, this seems a very short-term solution and I'm curious to see what we as students can highlight to the university/community/state to create a more safe learning environment. I'm sure your story isn't the only one, and if we make it known that Berkeley isn't a desirable school because of safety concerns, admins/media might listen. 

That being said, I agree with what's been suggested so far:
- walk on busy roads if possible
- walk with group of friends/bear walk if possible
- don't walk late at night if possible

Just want to say I'm sorry that happened to you. I've lived in town for almost ten years. When I first moved here, I never felt unsafe and would walk around intoxicated late at night downtown and in more secluded areas. My feeling of safety has diminished every year. I'm more or less constantly thinking about my surroundings when I'm out in public and I don't enjoy it.
You will not be a racist if you are scared of them. There are much more to the story than their color. What type of music they are listening, how loud is the music, their clothes, the way they speak, the way they act, any women around or is it just men, what could they be doing in a college town, why are they far away from pubs and bars. You should think analytically(which is an important Berkeley skill) and be like I'll avoid this situation. 
People have already commented on your specific situation so I won’t get into that. But I did grow up in West Oakland so I have some experience in general with living in dangerous areas.

One of the main things that I notice in Berkeley is that most students don’t know how to carry themselves. When you have a chance, drive into Oakland and drive down International Boulevard. Go to Fruitvale taco trucks to get some good food or something so it’s worth it. When you do that, check out how people walk down the street, how they stand at crosswalks, how they wait in line at the taco trucks. You might think they’re hood rats or some shit, but they’re really just normal ass people like you and me who know how to carry themselves so they won’t be messed with. Notice what they do and how they do it. Try to emulate the attitude that they project (not their actions because you’ll look like a fool if you do that.)

I honestly don’t know how hard it is to learn how to do that kind of thing since I picked it up young. That also makes it hard for me to say exactly what it is that you should be doing. In general, you should try to look hard, not soft. Look guarded and wary without being scared or skittish. Basically, guys like the ones who tried to rob you are going to go after people they think won’t fight back or cause trouble for them. You don’t have to learn self defense or anything, but if you carry yourself in such a way where they think that you might be strapped, that you might have gotten in fights before and wouldn’t be afraid to fight them if they tried anything. If you do that, especially at Berkeley where there are so many naive students who would be easier to rob than you, you won’t be messed with.
I’ve lived in borderline war zones (Camden NJ, SW Philly) as well as Berkeley. For what it’s worth, Berkeley is pretty safe and it is highly unlikely anything will happen to you. That being said, most people don’t realize the bubble of security we all walk around in is an illusion. If you aren’t carrying a gun, your life wholly depends on the good will of every stranger around you. 

I would suggest getting a carry permit, but 0% chance Alameda county will issue you one. Since you can’t do that, some tips I can offer.

If it is dark out, walk in the middle of the street, against oncoming traffic. If you get mugged or attacked an approaching vehicle might stop the event. This is harder in Berkeley because there are so many silent cars, so stay aware of your surroundings.

Never walk outside with headphones in. Don’t stand around staring at your phone. Never make eye contact with crazy. Do not engage crazy.

Walk quickly. If you’re stuck waiting in a sketchy area, wait next to the ATM or next to a bank. If something happens the event will be caught on camera.

Keep $2 in singles in one of your pockets, keep your credit cards / big bills in your shoe. If you get robbed give up the $2 and claim it’s all you have (claim it’s your bus fare).

Walk in a group whenever possible. Sit in the front of the bus and wait for BART at the top of the stairs, where security is more likely to see you.
Genuinely think we need to do a walk out/protest (non-violent obvi) about the lack of safety on campus. 

Students are always fighting for the voice of other people but we suffer two main problems - mental health and safety, and I cannot believe how little the school does to help safety. The city of Berkeley even lost like 10 cop cars last year because of budget cars. 
Self-preservation is always common sense. 
I think a very simple solution is to get a bike. I have no problem leaving campus past midnight cause I’ll be home in 5 minutes with my bike and no one can stop you even if they want. You get to classes faster, get to wake up later, and plus get a small workout with all the hills lol. 
Bad things happen everywhere, but petty crime happens particularly in areas of high inequality. We've got that in spades here in the bay area, where rich people don't have as many suburbs as places to seclude themselves as they do in other parts of the country where many new students came from.

This doesn't directly address your safety I know, but I think a big perk of going to school here is we're reminded of how we should use the skills we get to help reduce that inequality. Any major can give these skills, you just have to realize you can work on fixing the problem.

Best way to avoid having criminals target you in the meantime? Be a tougher target than the next person. Make the thief or bad actor less likely to target you. Ways of doing this? Try to make friends and do things with them at night, or wake up earlier and go to sleep later, or get a bike/scooter so you're not trapped as much in that situation, or get pepper spray, or (if possible) date tall imposing people, like football or basketball players. Take self-defense classes, call bearwalk, consider the occasional Uber, have a buddy,  plan your walk strategically towards high-traffic areas, or talk on the phone when you're worried about being followed. Or all at once. It isn't your fault you were attacked, and It's police officers' jobs to keep these things from happening, but that doesn't mean you have no means of being proactive and taking things into your own control.

Also, report the crime to the police if you haven't already.

And it doesn't matter if you were being racist or not, but what's the relevance of their race? Did it change the nature of the crime that occurred? Was it worse than if a couple white guys followed and assaulted and attempted to rob you? It might be relevant to your identifying the perps, but you didn't give enough information to indicate that you intended for us to identify, so it's hard to see what other reason you thought it relevant than trying to play into stereotypes
Oh man, sorry this happened. As someone who graduated Berkeley a couple of years ago I can relate to that feeling of “I might get jumped on the way to class.” I’ve been sketched out more than once by people behaving strangely, whether or not it actually turned into a situation like you described.  

What everyone else has said is good, and definitely use bear walk. But even more than that, as soon as you notice suspicious behavior, respond! You couldn’t have picked those guys out as actually dangerous until the end when it was probably too risky a situation already. But before that, when you noticed them being odd, you could have turned onto another street or gone into a building (always choose a very crowded or well monitored area if you’re walking away, never go to a more isolated place!). It’s not good to judge people based on looks alone, but what you saw was behavior. Better to respond to that and be safe, than to ignore it and get mugged or worse.  Also my parents sent me to school with a keychain of pepper spray— I’m a petite woman and it made me feel safer to have it, though it wouldn’t have helped if someone held me at gunpoint. It may not hurt to have an easily-accessible canister just in case. 
I'm a woman and lived in Rockridge for 8 years. I would occasionally take long walks to Cal late at night and I never had any issues. I think what helped me was being on super high alert (not friendly with anyone), I knew exactly where I was going, I walked hella fast, and I tried to stay on populated streets. It does suck that there are creeps out in the world. Don't beat yourself up. Those guys were total jerks. Maybe next time, call a friend on your cell phone or call the emergency line. Also, it's okay to trust your intuition. You had a feeling from the beginning that those dudes were creeps. It's okay to listen to that from now on.
Look like you know where you're going when your walking, even if you don't. 

Gun violence in this city is a problem, but I don't think there's been a student shot yet, which doesn't sound super reassuring, I know, but if that dude had a gun, it probably wasn't going to end up pointed at you. 

Sorry to hear about what happened to you. The best advice I have is just don't make yourself look like an easy target for robbery and you'll be fine.
I’m a mid 20’s female. I’ve been lunged at by homeless men and cat called plenty in broad daylight. What I do is completely pretend they’re invisible. Even when the guy lunged at me and was within a foot of my face, just keep walking unfazed. It takes a little practice to not let your eyes wander at all when you’ve got people trying to get near you or ask you for money. If someone gets in my face for money I just say “no, sorry” and keep walking. Another great defense (which makes me feel more safe) is a flashlight- tazer I bought on amazon for $20. Looks like a flashlight, has good weight to it, and tazes with ease. Like most everyone else says though, the way you carry yourself is most important. Walk with purpose and don’t talk to strangers. 
Honestly, this sounds like a shitpost. 
When I walk home alone at night I carry my cellphone out with 911 dialed (but of course don't push call) so the moment I get approached or made uncomfortable I can call.  Better to call 911 and get home safely than get hurt and not be able to call in time.

1) Confidence is everything tbh. They will test you if they think they could get you to budge. BearWalk is something that you can use and a lot of people use it and nobody thinks anything of it tbh. So far my time has been fine but I do dress kinda bummy and also am a minority so maybe that helps? But I'd say confidence is everything and do not stop for anything, just keep walking and just ignore. Nobody is really every trying to catch a case. Just try and to not fuck up by putting yourself in a sketch situation. That's honestly the best thing you can do.

2) That's a question that troubles most inner-cities so I doubt you'll find an answer here.
I always recommend BearWalk or Bear Transit if it takes you where you need to go. You can report suspicious activity to UCPD or just BPD. This isn’t the safest city, but I think you’re going a little nuts with your “how do I not get raped/beaten/etc.” commentary— most of the shootings that happen here are between people who know each other. You *can* get mugged and people’s laptops get stolen all the time, but there are things you can do to prevent this. Crime happens in every city. 

Best thing you can do IMO is travel at night with other folks, or use BearWalk. Walk fast, don’t walk with headphones in. I always carry pepper spray with me— get some, make sure you know how to use it. It doesn’t get dark at 3pm in spring semester. Use the resources that are available to you. 

Also, side note— having to repeat numerous times that you aren’t racist because of X, Y, and Z doesn’t ever help your point. 
Are you saying you’re paying more than 70k a year or is that what you would figure 4 years to cost? Seems like a strange amount
Build a time machine and organize for better etter social services in the 80's.
I'm 64 and walk the streets all hours of the night. Use a zig zag evasive pattern when you walk anywhere at night. Imagine a straight line between your 2 points and then walk a zig zag pattern every block. Worked for me for decades. Stay off main streets. 
[removed]
Oh you-you’re almost definitely dead. I’d move immediately. We lose tens if guys just like you every fall. Sad really they can’t see the paint on the wall
Guy had a gun in his pants which were at his ankles? What?
I second this as someone who grew up in bad neighborhoods. When you see people on the street you wanna be sizing them up, not aggressively so they feel threatened, but enough so that they notice. You want to look guarded always. If someone stares at you look back at them, acknowledge them, but don’t engage and just keep moving. In general, you want to look hard, look like someone who’s been around the block and seen some shit; if you don’t know how to do this, then try to fake it.
Yeah when people (read semi-sketchy strangers) start talking to me, I generally speak super loudly and deeply, but in a friendly way, and establish my distance from them. Avoid physical contact and make sure you look like someone who isn't gonna be a pushover. You can still be friendly, but you want to do so in a way that sends the clear message that you're not to be fucked with. 
Don't even say you're sorry, if you can avoid it. That was always my line, too, and then several months ago in SF a pandhandler followed me for half a block and got in my face going, ""YOU'RE SORRY, BITCH?? YOU FUCKING BITCH! YOU'RE NOT SORRY! I'LL MAKE YOU SORRY, BITCH."" etc etc.

Shockingly a guy nearby came over to me afterwards and asked if I was okay, and he went, ""You know, you really just shouldn't say anything back."" YMMV, and I've said ""Sorry"" many times without incident, but after this happened I just shut my mouth and move on.
Yea I’m a guy 9 months away from graduation and of a relatively bigger build than average and can say this still holds true. I’ll walk home past midnight by myself but typically do what she speaks of above (i.e. better lit/busier streets, 1 hand in pocket). If you still don’t feel safe you should consider buying a concealable knife to take with you when it’s really late (legal to have if you’re above 18), I have plenty of friends that keep them in their backpacks for late night studying on campus and I have one but usually never take it out of the house.
Also, better racist than robbed or dead. I profile people on the street here all the damn time because I'd rather make the wrong assumption than be dead.
Actually, to anyone with an ounce of common sense and familiarity with Berkeley, the race of the perps was obvious even before you said anything. 
I know that it is just being realistic to expect this level of crime from an urban area, but I also want to point out that this kind of thinking feels like a resignation to a public problem which is solvable (albeit probably near impossible with current efforts).

Many American cities have had similar issues of crime whose root causes probably can be attributed, as others have stated, to inequality, poverty, and lack of social services. While we have failings on this front, I also hope that there is more we can be doing to also support better law enforcement to combat crime (within the limitations of addressing broader societal issues I expect). At this point it really does feel that, controlled for the rise in population and other urban issues, we are not investing properly in law enforcement that our citizens can also trust.

Cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Singapore show us that in terms of public safety at least, there is a better world that we can create than the situation we've resigned ourselves to. Taking a step back I don't think we can claim to know any easy solutions because differences between a place like Berkeley (or SF) and these cities are so vast, but holding an ideal standard is important to remind us of the ways we can still go. By no means is this an easy job of course.

For the time being we have to just be realistic and be mindful when we go out, but I genuinely hope that someday we can make this a city where everyone can feel at ease when they go out at night.
I would second this.  Scooters are compact, fast, and heavy enough to hurt someone.  I mean if you've ever had one of those scooters roundhouse you in the ankle you know what I mean.  Of course now people complain about scooters on the sidewalks but I mean better than being mugged.  
10 years in Berkeley too and I wanted to say yes, same! It used to be a little sketchy but not bad, now I'm on high alert 24/7.
Fixed the 'I'm not racist' bit, angry me was just overthinking/being a dick/idk - thanks for the reply!
‘Inequality’ caused an individual to to wear his pants around his knees and put a gun in his waist to intimidate hapless students? ‘Helping to reduce inequality’ will prevent you from being robbed at night right now? Come on. Some individuals are just jerks, inequality or not, and get off on messing with people they perceive as weaker than themselves. Identify those individuals (notices I didn’t say people), and avoid them at all costs. Working to reduce inequality is a noble cause and you should do it. But to suggest that will somehow prevent you from being targeted by an individual with malicious intent is simply naive and ludicrous.

Let's review:

* Sketchy dark 'urban' boogeymen

* Who corner this kid in an isolated area

* Revealing they have a gun (apparently)

* With pants literally around ankles

* and somehow OP just .. gets away?

*Very* plausible story. 
I thought I was reading a copypasta
Yeah, nothing happened. OP just sounds sheltered and paranoid.
Esp the part about the rap music thats just them saying the n word... this reeks of some edgy 14 year old r/the_dumbass browser trying to start bait here

edit: i'd also like to add that in my all 3 years of studying here i've never seen potential muggers just casually blasting music on the streets of Berkeley. Nor does it make sense for potential muggers to draw attention to themselves in that manner.
>Crime happens in every city.

Man, stop pretending that this is normal. Yes, crime always happens, but Berkeley has it in an abnormal amount, especially for around a *college campus* of all places. I don't regret choosing UCB, but I can't wait to get out of this shithole city.
Out of state tuition is not so kind :( and like housing and what not
Nah you should be disarmed. That way only the government and criminals have guns, and nothing will ever go wrong. 
Yeah I've been considering doing that too. Currently I just do a quick ""Sorry man/bud"" and keep walking but I've had some people get testy over it. (Not to the level of following me around thankfully) 

On the other hand, I've definitely had a few people be like ""Hey thanks for at least acknowledging me"" so, it's hard. 
I don't profile people.  I assume everyone is capable of violence and am pretty alert especially at dusk or lower lit areas.
Lovely.
I assume you mean they were black but if you haven't been followed by a twitchy white dude (or dude-ette?) in Berkeley I have to question whether or not you've actually spent any time here. I've had far more problems with crazy whites than with any other demographic (not counting scary, drunk frat boys, who aren't a problem now that I'm older/dumpier. When I was young they were hands down the scariest.)
See, now that’s racist as fuck. It’s about being proactive not racist. If someone looks sketch because of what they’re doing, walk away. This can be a person of any race, and yes in berkeley. 
There's probably a number of types of individuals who commit crimes like this.

-Desperate people who dont have any other option. These crimes are likely caused by inequality  and can be addressed by minimizing it.

-""Assholes"" with sociopathic tendencies. These guys may exist, but my guess is a pretty small number of these people are legitimate sociopaths. I bet they have two subgroups. 

-subgroup 1: people who are hardened because of pain and the violence and abuse they've experienced in the past. Addressed by inequality and a better education system for sure, maybe not for people too far gone, but certainly for future kids in bad situations.

-subgroup 2. The kind of people you have just as much probability of being assaulted by in a suburb as you do at Berkeley, because they just commit crimes because they're sociopaths. That is, if you assume different demographic groups (other than men) aren't more likely to be sociopaths than others, which i happen to believe

I definitely wasn't claiming fixing inequality is a quick fix that will help OP today, that's what the rest of my post was focused on
He literally gave safety tips in the short term. But these problems aren’t gonna just disappear if we choose to move to ‘safer’ and more secluded areas now, are they? In the long term, let’s try and reduce inequality to actually eradicate the problem. Less inequality means less people desperate enough to want to commit crimes. These people don’t do this for sole amusement. 
Lets not forget ""DAE le rap music is just dumb blacks saying NI🅱️🅱️A lel epictrollstyle""
With a bit of racism sprinkled in.
Yes, everyone is capabale of violence but if you don't think people who portray themselves in a certain manner aren't more likely to commit random acts of violence you're naive. 
Of course, but still the odds that the individual are BMJs, in police talk, are pretty overwhelming. 
This is an area where we have a plethora of homeless vagabond teenagers who do this willingly. Yes, they do.
Even then, their clothes will probably tell you more than their race. You have more to fear from a person of any race who's dressed like a hoodrat than a random black kids dressed in Cal gear, nice clothes, etc
But when you say “anyone with an ounce of common sense” you’re saying it’s common sense to assume BMJ. Sure, it’s statistically more likely judging by the police reports. Common sense? No. 
I don’t really think so. We don’t have the credentials to argue this, but I’ve made friends with some homeless vegabond teenagers, and they are very peaceful individuals. Most of the time they chill at parks, go through trash, hang out and get high. A lot of violence comes from residents of close by areas who know no alternatives because of their situations "
