Did anyone do earthquakes in your backyard with professor Richard Allen? We have our midterm next week and I was curious about how it went. Thanks!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jh4syg/did_anyone_do_earthquakes_in_your_backyard_with/,2020-10-24 00:23:37,,"I took it with him before it was online so things may have changed. But when I took it, it was pretty easy with all the questions being things discussed repeatedly in lecture.

bdsm?
Do you think it requires a lot of studying?

In my opinion, not really. I studied for roughly 30 minutes total before the midterm. If you watched the lectures and thought things generally made sense you don‚Äôt need to study much. I just studied to memorize the different types of faults and fault motions. The midterm was not tricky, with a lot of the questions being simple/common sense if you had watched the lectures.

Thanks so much for the advice!"
Earthquakes in Backyard EPS C 20 - have you taken it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ihmfrv/earthquakes_in_backyard_eps_c_20_have_you_taken_it/,2020-08-27 07:52:49,"and does anyone know why this class is just 60% full?

How was the remote experience in the spring or summer?

Richard Allen is the instructor - awesome reviews on ratemyprofessor but recent Berkeleytime grading data lists other professors.  Berkeleytime shows a shift of students taking this P/F over the past few years (particularly Fall 2019), and summer grades stronger than year long grades

Has the course curriculum changed?

I am worried that the class has become too intense for a curious English major.","Took this class in person last fall with Prof Allen. A friend of mine said he is reusing the Fall 19 lecture videos this fall. I remember he said that he taught this class a while back and took a break, and only started again last fall so that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt appear on Berkeleytime. Can‚Äôt really say much about the online experience but you shouldn‚Äôt have too much trouble with this class. The only thing you would be missing out on are the two field trips that happen on campus but other than that the experience should be pretty much the same.

Thank you! That's very helpful!
Thank you!!!!"
Physical Science Recommendations,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12wntk5/physical_science_recommendations/,2023-04-23 12:51:51,"Looking to get my physical science breadth requirement done this fall, what are some good classes that are as easy as possible with the least amount of time involved?","eps 20 with richard allen! easy, it's about earthquakes and it was very enjoyable
Not sure about easy, but a can‚Äôt miss class is obviously Astro C10 with Fillipenko.  

If you‚Äôre a CS major you already have it covered since you have to take CS 61C.
eps 7, intro to climate change. completely online and a lot of the answers to assignments are on Quizlet. nice professor too who explains climate science in the easiest way possible!
omg take sense sensibility science its an easy A
Can you tell me more about the work load, quizzes and assignments ?
It's pretty easy, quizzes were based off lecture and were open note. I think there was 3 assignments about what we've learned in the class? The workland is manageable and everything was open note!"
My class schedule opinions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15rh1m5/my_class_schedule_opinions/,2023-08-14 20:36:19,"Hi,

I'm a new transfer student for the upcoming fall term. I'm considering majoring in data science. Is my current schedule suitable for the semester? Also, I've enrolled in EPS C20 and EPS 7 just to meet my minimum credits.

Instead of wasting credits on the EPS classes, you should figure out what your domain emphasis will be and take a class or two from there instead.
However EPS C20 is a fantastic option for physical sciences breadth if OP doesn‚Äôt have that covered already
If the person is a transfer student, it‚Äôs almost certain all of his or her breadths are covered.
Oh that‚Äôs true I completely blanked on that oops"
Realizing I‚Äôm a simp for cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xh6j0g/realizing_im_a_simp_for_cal/,2022-09-17 21:03:27,"Today I was flying back to the bay but our flight ended up taking off 45 mins late and we had to wait on the plane in our seats. For some reason being stuck on a plane that‚Äôs stalled on the ground makes me really claustrophobic and I started getting anxious. There were two boomers to either side of me that were literally so kind to me, talked to me and distracted me and I ended up talking to them the whole flight. Bless them. 

Anyway, at one point we started talking about earthquakes and I started telling them all about the Berkeley seismology department, the Hayward fault, and other shit you learn in that ‚Äúearthquakes in your backyard‚Äù class. It got to the point where I started doing free promotion for the MyShake app, telling them that I have it on my phone and how they should download it onto their phones because it can tell you there‚Äôs an earthquake on the way if you‚Äôre not too close at the epicenter and that could allow you to take preventative measures. 

Anyway, the point is, I love cal, I‚Äôm a simp for cal, and I will do free promo for cal because I think it‚Äôs the best school and I‚Äôm so lucky to go here. Go bears üíôüíõ

TLDR: DOWNLOAD MYSHAKE","I‚Äôm a simp for Cal and I‚Äôm at Stanford. I want to end up there as a prof maybe
Richard Allen would be proud
ur cool
We‚Äôre cool"
