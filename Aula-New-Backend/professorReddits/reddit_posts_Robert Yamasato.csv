Music 25 with Yamasato,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dlerke/music_25_with_yamasato/,2024-06-21 14:10:33,"Hi! Iâ€™m thinking about taking Music 25 with Robert Yamasato during Session E to knock off the Arts and Literature breadth requirement. Has anyone else taken the class? How difficult would it be if I only have basic music theory background and considering that this only three weeks? I was in band in high school, so I know pitches, notes and rests, key signatures, time signatures, intervals, basic chords and their sevenths, etc. Thanks in advance!","hey i took this class late last year, so i was even more crunched for time than the original 3 weeks. you'll be chillin, i had the same experience as you and got an A. also the class is designed for complete beginners so you actually already know all of the content for at least the first week. tips:  
- show up for each class and practice with every practice exam he gives ahead of time + other resources online he'll give to you  
- he often goes over exactly what will be on the exams during lecture which is why it's important to go  
- he is super nice and approachable, if you're stuck on how to do do/identify something then just ask him to go over it and he will during class or after class, he's really good at explaining the process  
- the material is easy. as long as you pay attention, follow along, and do plenty of practice you'll have an easy A. there was no assignments during my session, only the exams. hardest part for me was identifying key signatures for songs where it changes a lot, example: ""In the Hall of the Mountain King""
Wow thanks so much for this!
No prob! reply to this thread if u ever have any other questions or need more advice"
