"anthro2AC, history 178, or psych 136",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/t6ilog/anthro2ac_history_178_or_psych_136/,2022-03-04 05:07:36,"Hi, I'm an IB major and I'm planning to knock out some breadth courses for summer 2022. Has anyone taken these courses and knows which has a lighter course load/ is easier for a good grade. Thank you!

\-anthro2AC archaeology w/ Christopher B Lowman (heard anthro2AC was boring but this specific prof has good reviews)

\-history 178 holocaust w/ alexis herr (UPPERDIV)

\-psych 136 human sexuality","Highly recc anthro 2ac as someone taking it now. The course material can be interesting for some but Prof Lowman really does his best to ensure that students are doing well (aka open note quizzes, multiple attempts on said quizzes) and even if you're not interested in Archaeology he has a lot of fun anecdotes for you to engage with! Its also super light and easy on grading :D
Anthro with lowman is literally a free A.  Also pretty interesting imo
Anthro 2AC. Literally the easiest class I've taken here at Cal. Prof. Lowman is also a 10/10 professor.
Anthro 2AC
Psych 136 is fun. It can be quite easy if you've learned biology, or have had some scientific knowledge about biological sex/gender/sexuality in general. you have to finish reading a whole ass book, which can be a lot if everything is new. but since you are a bio major, and the exam is open note, just going through the book once is fine. plus attending all the discussions could get you an A.
oh i actually meant that im an intended bio major, plus I'm really bad at reading. is it like a whole textbook or just book? would u still recommend for people who cant read really well?
It is a whole textbook. But its language is very simple. Personally i am bad at reading too. English is my second language. But I do find it very easy to read. The hard part for you might be some of the biology things, such as how the hormone cycle works for women's period. Personally I feel that that is the most difficult thing."
Psych W1 with Christopher Gade,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pvq57s/psych_w1_with_christopher_gade/,2021-09-26 01:55:11,Has anyone taken psych w1 with Christopher Gade? What do you think about the class? How’s the class graded? How’s the workload?,"took it last semester was pretty good. the big things for him were the essays and tests. three tests and  three essays optional final but if u do better on the final he drops the lowest of the three previous tests.
The W1 is a fully web-based course and his lectures were incredibly boring for me. I felt like it was a waste of effort as there were better options available. I really think it depends on whether you can sit through obsolete 2hr lecture videos where the guy just reads off a script and clicks through slides. The material was very dense too, since Psych 1 is intended as a weeder class. I dropped it after 2 weeks so I think it depends on people's preferences and how much they can handle before they lose their sanity.
I took it last semester. there weren't any essays but we had 3 multiple choice midterms and a final exam. (PSYCH 1 has essays, not W1) we also had weekly assignments which were these multiple choice quizzes through this online textbook module/website (pretty much unlimited attempts)

I didn't end up watching any of the lectures since I didn't feel like I got anything out of them. I just used the lecture slides to study for the exams and did fine (got an A)

I think its a pretty low workload class overall, but don't expect to learn much from it
For w1, can we drop one of the lowest midterm exam grade as same as the PSYCH 1?"
