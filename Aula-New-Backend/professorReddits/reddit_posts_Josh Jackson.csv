Some questions about Media Studies at Berkeley (Transfer),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gyhfji/some_questions_about_media_studies_at_berkeley/,2020-06-07 11:22:16," Hi everyone! I’m currently a California Community College student looking to transfer into Media Studies at Berkeley. I have a couple questions for those who have the time :)

For some background about my academic profile so far - I currently have a 3.75 GPA, 1 Internship at UCLA (Ongoing), and plan to apply this coming Fall 2020. 

Here goes:

&#x200B;

* I’m taking Media Studies W10 with Josh Jackson this summer, any tips/recommendations to ace the class?

&#x200B;

* From what I’ve heard from other applicants to Berkeley, it seems like my extracurriculars are pretty weak. Should I prioritize getting more done before this fall?

&#x200B;

* Any other tips on making my application as awesome as possible/things I should know?

Thanks for taking the time to read this!","Hi :) I'm an MS major and a transfer (rising senior).

- It's pretty straightforward IMO, the tests were basically copying & pasting (from your memory) what he said in lecture. I have 2 Quizlets I made for the midterm & final if you're interested! https://quizlet.com/ninetiesbabe - Also, there are 2 essays; for me, getting to know my GSI really helped so I can understand their grading style.

- Up to you; my ECs were really weak when I applied (I only had 1 tutoring gig & 1 small volunteer position) & I've heard admissions values GPA above all. Also I'm not sure how much of an impact it would make to add a bunch of random ECs right before you apply (so basically, don't force yourself or worry about it too much).

- Essays that highlight why you want to transfer & how you are ready to succeed as a transfer, what you've learned prior to transferring, etc.

The average GPA admit range last year was from 3.52 - 3.93 (https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major) so it sounds like you're good! Good luck, lmk if you have any other questions. x
I’m a grad student now but was an MS double major and I just have to say, Josh was one of my favorite profs in the department. Hope ya enjoy the class :)
I’m also taking the same class as you! Just transferred in as MS in from CC (Rising junior), and like you, I’d love nothing more than to ace this class. So far, lots of reading, but I’m hoping this isn’t tooo bad. Maybe we can help each other out during summer session!
This helps a ton. Thank you so much for the detailed reply & have a great day!
I’m looking forward to this summer even more now! :D
