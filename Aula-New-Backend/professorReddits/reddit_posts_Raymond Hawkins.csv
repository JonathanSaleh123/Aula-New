Economics 100B with Raymond Hawkins,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1fhp02/economics_100b_with_raymond_hawkins/,2013-06-01 16:51:21,"Hi, did anyone take this class with Hawkins or any class by Hawkins? If so, what was the dood like on his tests? It'd be of great help if you can also send me your syllabus (any professor's), because I want to start reading the textbook already. I need a good fucking grade on this. Thank you Redditers, I'm relying on you.",
Stephen Bianchi for Econ 136,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zxnovo/stephen_bianchi_for_econ_136/,2022-12-28 14:50:32,I'm taking Econ 136 next semester and thought the instructor would be Raymond Hawkins but Cal Central is showing it's Stephen Bianchi. Has anyone had him for 136 or other classes? How is he?,"Bianchi for 140 was a toughie, he’s not anyone’s *first choice* of a professor to put it bluntly
Contrary to popular opinion, i think he's a decent professor. the only problem is that he's a little dry so he might sound boring. BUT i will take him over Hawkins ANY FUCKING DAY because Hawkins digresses every fucking ten mins. I took both profs once and the only prof i'm gonna take classes from again is bianchi.
Had him for 139 this semester. He's okay. Thought his exams were fairly easy and he grades the homework generously. Agreed that he is a meh lecturer though.
From someone who got A's in 140 (Bianchi), 136 (Hawkins), and 139 (Bianchi). Hawkins is legitimately bad; Bianchi is eh.
Wait what happened to Hawkins ?
I second this statement, thank your lucky stars hawkins isn't teaching. I'm taking Bianchi this upcoming semester too
Second this
Hawkins lectures: random digressions and nothing useful or related to the exams

Bianchi's lectures: math, math, math. Sometimes relevant but usually much more in depth than necessary
Is 136 and 139 curved?
He’s not teaching anything next spring — most of the Econ professors have other side jobs/businesses so it’s quite common for them to drop off the map occasionally
That makes sense , I forgot that he usually teaches the fall semester"
Econ major course recommendations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yfbw9d/econ_major_course_recommendations/,2022-10-27 19:58:06,"I'm currently taking econ100a and stat20 this semester and have to take a macro econ course for spring. But I heard that Hawkins 100b is pretty tough so I was looking into ugba 101b. I was wondering if its true that ugba101b is easier compared to econ 100b? econ 100b is taught by Raymond Hawkins and ugba 101b is taught by Todd Fitch. I'm not really confident on macro econ so I was hoping to take the easier one.. :,)

Also, can I get any thoughts on ugba 131? I'm thinking of taking it as an outside department econ elective. It's taught by Stephen Etter!

How about econ 136 with Hawkins? I heard the course is a lot of math but wanted to get more comments on the course too.

Also, for anyone who took ugba 131 or ugba 101b, are the discussions mandatory?

Any comments would be appreciated, thanks!","Hi I’m actually gonna take econ100a and stat20 together next semester! What’s your experience with that combination been like?
Keep in mind you can transfer only 2 upper divs from a diff department- so don’t spiral into taking multiple ugba classes, they won’t work. I recommend 100B because it may be harder but it’ll prepare you much better for Econ electives. 101B is very haasy- it’ll teach you the minimum, you’ll get a better grade for less work, but you’ll probably struggle in other upper divs which had 100B as a prereq
The average grade of MT 1 in econ 100b is D. Hawkins doesn't know how to teach
Class is hella curved tho"
Syllabus for Econ 100A or 100B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mna75r/syllabus_for_econ_100a_or_100b/,2021-04-08 22:13:33,"Looking for the syllabus for Econ 100A with James Campbell and Econ 100B with Raymond Hawkins. If you have either and wanna help a fellow bear, pls link or dm me!!!

Particularly trying to see if the lectures can be taken asynchronously next semester (they have online options but not sure about async if we’re in the same time zone), also interested in workload.","hi! did you find the 100a syllabus?
Nope
Hi OP, assuming u took the class, could u pls PM me the syllabus?"
Can anyone sponsor my Credit Card DeCal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qd7s08/can_anyone_sponsor_my_credit_card_decal/,2021-10-21 19:55:42,"I’m looking to create a DeCal course about Credit Cards and how to travel for free using points. I have been working on the content for this course and it’s creation for the past few months and I am in need of a faculty sponsor.

I previously had a sponsor in the CS department but I was informed by the CS chair that their DeCal courses must be directly related to CS. 

I have been trying to reach out to professors in Haas but I haven’t had much luck. 

The deadline is approaching quickly and I am getting worried I won’t be able to find a sponsor in time. The deadline is sometime next week for most departments I believe.

Can anyone recommend faculty members who might be willing to be a sponsor for this course? If there are any professors on here who see this and would be willing to be the sponsor please let me know lol.","[deleted]
The [personal finance decal](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/5349) from last year apparently was sponsored by plant bio... No clue but I guess could be worth a shot seeing as how credit cards n personal finance go hand in hand.
Could try econ, math, stats professors
Sounds interesting as fuck, woulda taken it for sure if I were still in Berkeley.
I’d totally attend this decal—need to learn how to churn credit cards haha
Education might work too try the GSE
I would totally take this decal!!!
Try Raymond Hawkins, I believe he'd be down.
I’m interested in taking this if you find a sponsor.
I keep getting rejected/ghosted from them :(

I am still reaching out to more Haas professors though
I taught the personal finance decal until I graduated. It was sponsored under plant bio because that was my major and the professors I knew best were there. It’s currently under EE because that’s where one of the new facilitators already knew a professor. 

My top recommendation is to focus not on what the professor teaches or what field they are in, but who knows you and can vouch for you as a person and as a teacher. Who would you ask for a reference letter? Start there. If you mostly know CS teachers that could be an obstacle, but then I would recommend branching out into professors from your breadth courses before trying to find brand-new people you’ve never met. Recall that the instructor of record’s two main jobs are to enter grades at the end of the semester and to convince the department chair that you’ll do a good job.
I’m planning to have a public zoom and recordings if you’re interested :)"
