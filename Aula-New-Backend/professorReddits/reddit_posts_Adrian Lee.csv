Physics 7A (Professor Adrian Lee),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18x43mj/physics_7a_professor_adrian_lee/,2024-01-02 15:38:18,"Hi, I‚Äôm a freshman taking Physics 7A as an engineering major. I struggled with Physics a lot in highschool. Any tips/words of advice to get a good grade? 

Yes, I read the Berkeley time and rate my Proffesor reviews.

Thanks in advance.","I‚Äôve never worked harder in my life for a C in physics 7A (Spring 2013)
CC
CC
Damn. Any tips??
What is cc?
I mean this was nearly 11 years ago now. I went to lots of tutoring both from the dorms and the ESS and I formed study groups with people I knew from my orientation & lab sections. It feels so distant from now if that‚Äôs any solace hah. I improved from the first midterm to the second midterm. I guess just make sure you understand every homework problem you are given. I kinda fudged the homework sometimes to my detriment. 
It was my first ever physics class. Never took it in high school.
Community college, better to take those courses in CC. I assume you weren‚Äôt a bum in high school so your physics performance is unlikely to change.
Is it transferable from community college?
*for engineering
Yeah but you have to get approval from your ESS advisor"
physics 7a with adrian lee or chem 3a with marsden?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1805qbg/physics_7a_with_adrian_lee_or_chem_3a_with_marsden/,2023-11-20 18:02:07,title. 3al is katie blackford.,"Take the the Chem 3 series with Marsden if you can. I can‚Äôt speak to Physics 7, but Marsden is an awesome professor.
Katie is also great!!
Adrian Lee is rough"

physics 7a with adrian lee vs chem 3a/L with volhardt?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qcgyuj/physics_7a_with_adrian_lee_vs_chem_3al_with/,2021-10-20 19:07:47,"hey homies i'm trying to keep my technicals at a level of Not Insane, and i'm already planning on taking math 54 next sem, so i only want to take one more. any thoughts on which of physics or chem 3a/L would be better along with it? probably gonna take EPS50 and R&C B too. 

would sincerely appreciate any insight! thanks :D","I had Vollhardt last semester and had a terrible experience in his class. instead of recording new lectures, he just gave us links to his 2019 already-recorded lectures. and the average for our final was like 35%
vollhardt made me seriously consider getting therapy
Avoid Volhardt.  I didn‚Äôt even do that bad, but now that I‚Äôm taking CHEM 3B with Marsden, I understand the difference between someone who actually teaches and someone who just uses lectures recorded from a previous year (which weren‚Äôt that good either).  Everyone told me to avoid Volhardt and I didn‚Äôt listen.  Now I can tell you from personal experience to avoid Volhardt if you can.
Absolutely loved 3A with Vollhardt! Highly recommend
Vollhardt teaches straight from a book that he wrote so if you‚Äôre having difficulty understanding something it up to you to find another source to help you understand. He talks a lot about the technicals instead of how to actually do mechanisms. Plus when I had him we had to buy a sapling that contained all of our assignments so it didn‚Äôt even feel like he was providing us with any problems that he made. I do not recommend
i have no idea but good luck man. love you.
thank you!
yikes. hope you're doing better man!!

thanks for the reply!
thank you so much!
Wait seriously? I‚Äôve heard so many negative things about that professor/class :( do you think Chem 1A prepped you enough for 3A? How is it different from 1A?
 üò≠ for every negative review i get about him, i get a positive one lmao. thanks for sharing!
ack. thank you so much!!
mwah love u too"

A former Berkeley physics major‚Äòs reaction to ‚ÄûOppenheimer‚Äú,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15j2wih/a_former_berkeley_physics_majors_reaction_to/,2023-08-05 11:28:05,"I watched ‚ÄûOppenheimer‚Äú last night. And one scene in particular brought me to tears.

It‚Äôs the one where Oppenheimer holds his first quantum mechanics lecture. He poses a question: ‚ÄûLight: is it a particle or a wave?‚Äú

The first time I ever heard that question was in that building. I think Leconte 2 or 3. Adrian Lee.

Watching that scene felt like I was in my first lecture of H7C. I was mesmerized. And when Oppenheimer writes the Schr√∂dinger equation (or maybe just a generalized wave equation) on the board, I lose it.

My intention is not to paint Oppenheimer as a political or even scientific hero. There is a lot to unpack with regard to war, imperialism, mental health, sexism, and many other themes. I simply want to share that, in the span of 5 seconds, this scene transported me from 2023/my current field/my new home in Central Europe to 2013/physics/Berkeley. It‚Äôs one of the most powerful movie theater experiences I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm still thinking about it today.

Being a Berkeley physics major was rough, but today, I look back on it with gratitude and satisfaction. So I guess I‚Äôm really just thanking Christopher Nolan and the actors and filming/editing staff and movie theater staff for bringing me on this trip down memory lane.

Go Bears! œà(x, t)

P.S. To any current physics majors reading: is the creepy ass portrait of Crommie still in the SPS office?","Thanks for the comment. There are few things more important about film dramatizations than someone who has direct experience with the subject saying *""yes, they got that right.""* 

And your experience, more than a half century after Oppenheimer was there, is testament to the solidity of the Physics program that Le Conte, Birge, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, and others built at Cal over over a century and a half.  People often mis-use or over-use terms like ""world class"", but Cal Physics truly is. 

When you refer to ""Crommie"", what portrait is that?
Current physics major here, ofc the Crommie portrait is still in sps, its a great painting and piece of lore. We cant just throw it out
I'm a chemistry major, but I felt the exact same way! I watched it with my friend who's also a chem major and when he was talking about particle in a box, about nuclear fission/fusion, Schrodinger's equation, etc, we both would silently lose it. It was a genuinely fun experience being able to understand all/most of the science that is behind the atomic bomb, and it was a good movie to revisit the ethics of science. 

This movie low key reminds me of when I was in a seminar last year and this guy said something along the lines of, ""I believe the most patriotic thing I can as a scientist do is work for the military."" And he was talking about weapons development. Honestly, twas a moment I realized that we are learning knowledge that is capable of killing tons of people, but I prefer to just make cosmetics.
The scene where he's walking in Berkeley made me feel so proud.
Loved the movie!!! Great post, thank you for sharing!!!

Whilst not a physics/chemistry major I read some of his writings and about him long before I came to Cal (transfer-reentry student). So amazing to see the history we have some connection too.

Besides just the Physics Building, what are some places on campus, around town that are connected?
I‚Äôm a physics major from the 80s and 90s and I had a similarly profound experience with the movie that has lasted for days after. I suppose I sort of knew those people of great historical significance were there in LeConte, of course, but while *I* was there in those halls and rooms, every day for years, I swear it was never discussed. It was a blank tableau for us to create our own experiences. I was beaming with pride at the environs in the film. I wish I had known or been taught more about it while I was there. 

Mostly I found the film exceptionally unnerving. I would encourage everyone to see it. At minimum it‚Äôs a moment in our country where physicists can be seen as so powerful‚Äîsuperheroes to some. 

Thanks for sharing.
Oh I‚Äôm surprised this wasn‚Äôt another meme post
I'm a former physics / math major from Berkeley also currently in Europe. What country are you residing in?
As a statistics major, I felt the same way when discussing probabilities. ‚ÄúWhat more can you get from theory alone?‚Äù
Were the interior scenes actually filmed in the Physics building? I read something about them taking the Berkeley chairs to their set.

SPS officer here: Yes, we still have the Crommie painting. We have also added a painting of  Matthias Reinsch to the collection.
Great this post makes me want to watch this, hearing LeConte and Adrian Lee bring me back, although I experienced them separately.

That being said I have very complicated feelings about watching this, seeing as I come from the country where the bombs were dropped. wonder if there are time stamps you can share that show the Berkeley stuff
he got mad that his weapon wasnt going to be used against the german people
Thanks, I appreciate your response!

To your question: legend has it that someone painted a portrait of [Michael Crommie](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/michael-crommie), a faculty member, and just left it outside his office, no signature or note or anything. As u/toc10responses mentioned, it's definitely a piece of lore among Berkeley physics students.
This pleases me haha. Wishing you the best with the rest of your studies! I hope the 111A/B series is still as fire as it was when I took it. Such good memories (forged in lab report tears) from both those classes.

When did the Reinsch portrait appear?!
Lol. Reminds me of this quote regarding the biggest mass murderers of the 20th century (by a long shot):

""You must understand, the leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians. They hated Russians. They hated Christians. Driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse. It cannot be overstated. Bolshevism committed the greatest human slaughter of all time. The fact that most of the world is ignorant and uncaring about this enormous crime is proof that the global media is in the hands of the perpetrators.""

I'm not sure, it was already there when I joined in 2021. It looks very abstract, which is a nice contrast."
Physics 7A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s0d03z/physics_7a/,2022-01-09 22:14:03,has anyone heard from physics 7A with adrian lee about anything? i‚Äôve had total radio silence on my end.,"It‚Äôs still the semester break for profs as well, they get back to work more or less starting Monday 1/10
none :/ expecting in the next day or two
okay so i‚Äôm not alone whew"
How bad is this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/u59pqr8rreaa1.jpg,2023-01-05 22:28:04,,"better pack a lunch for tues/thurs
That‚Äôs a huge L.

At least I only have classes back to back for 7 hours straight on one day of the week.

Probably better than having 2 long days of classes
Fellow BioE here, we have it horrible this semester :')
You gotta do some calorie loading before that huge block on Tuesday and Thursday. I guess that's what Monday's for.
A ziplock bag of trial mix from Trader Joe‚Äôs for Tues/Thurs. Convenient, tasty, nutritious, calorie dense, and quick snack. Best of luck ü§û
This is bad advice; however if you think you can still survive without going to discussions, I would skip some of them if they are not mandatory
‚Ä¶ there goes your social life. Extra curriculars‚Ä¶ And sleep‚Ä¶ who needs it? Good luck though
We‚Äôre in Chem 3A & 3AL together, do you wanna start an early study group!?
![gif](giphy|gd09Y2Ptu7gsiPVUrv|downsized)
You caaan dooo ittt!!!
I do all of my classes back-to-back-to-back on Tues/Thurs because I have a full time job and that's the least disruptive to my schedule. Honestly I dig it. I'd way rather have to hustle and focus and only be on campus two days a week.
I took first semester organic w/ lab, first semester calc based physics, first semester multi, and an easy elective a semester. It was hard, but I got all A's, I had a girlfriend, and I was in ok shape. The one thing is it was at community college, so maybe without the girlfriend and/or dropping exercise you could do it?
You are going to be so sore after every Tuesday and Thursday.
agree with everyone that tues/thu looks really hard‚Äî just want to add that educ 182ac was an amazing class and even though it‚Äôs an 8am, you should absolutely show up! i learned so much in that class and lisa is a super engaging professor :)
You might wanna drop out after a couple of months of this torture. Best of luck, and remember to eat some protein bars and fruit during those long days
Ngl, id simply kms
I actually had a pretty similar schedule last semester. Youre going to be exhasuted on tuesday and thursday! I found myself not doing studying/hw on those long days but doing a lot on the shorter days, so if thats something youre fine doing then its managebale. Ive had a pretty heavy load every semseter and it definitely takes a toll on me and usually cased some burn out in the middle of the semester.  math 53 isnt rough but physics might take a bit of time. i just finished the physics 5 series and it definitely took the most time in my schedule each semester.
Take 170 with it
Drop 3al for me. Pretty please?
[deleted]
it fine
Seems like a pretty hefty load
that 3A lecture is gonna go hard trust
Kevin is a good gsi, that class will be fine. Everything else, you‚Äôre royally fucked
Well it‚Äôs not good
horrific
i think we might have the same math class and section lol. kudos to you if you can manage this schedule and i wish you the best of luck!
Yeah üòÖ
So true üòÇ. Do you have a similar schedule?
Yeah, I was already thinking about skipping math discussions (besides when there is quizzes). I think I do better self-teaching myself math anyways
I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôll PM you my instagram!
Thanks :)
And I do pack a lunch lol!
That‚Äôs kind of what I had in mind too! But I originally was on chem lab waitlist for Wednesday, and planned to go home on Friday evening and come back mondays
Also, Ochem is by faaar the most work. For me it was over 50% of time spent studying, and the stuff you learn first semester is so important for second.
This is nice to know. I‚Äôve been studying Ochem and multivariable on khan academy and other Berkeley professor‚Äôs notes. I also took algebra-based physics in high school, so hopefully it will help with 7A. Thanks for sharing!
Educ 182 seems like such an interesting class! Do you remember what the workload was like?
That‚Äôs what I plan on doing. Grind hw on Monday and Wednesday , and just really pay attention to lectures/ lab on the other days. Do you think math 53 discussion section was helpful?
I‚Äôm still staying open to premed, but leaning towards comp bio / biotech industry. I guess I‚Äôll have a better idea after seeing how I do in Ochem haha
Fellow bioE junior here who had this schedule, you will die
yeah agree with the other commenter ‚Äî workload really wasn‚Äôt too bad, most of the work is reading and a few papers, which are generally pretty straightforward if you keep up. and my discussions tended to be more interactive/activity-based but that depends on the gsi you get
It depends on how your prof outlines discussions. My prof had discussion twice a week with a quiz on the second day each week. If you have a good gsi then the discussions should compliment the course material nicely. I took 54 concurrently and found 54 discussion a waste of time but skipping 53 seemed to lower my understanding so it's dependent on the gsi tbh. Good luck! Discussions are what you make of it
That schedule's rough with ochem in it. Good luck, though! You got this!
Any advice? üòÑ
Pray pray and then pray again. In all seriousness, I would mostly study for Chem 3A by doing every problem set once throughout the week and once before an exam as it‚Äôs the only class where actually studying will nearly guarantee you an A (though I had Professor Robak). Math 53 and physics 7A are all up to what type of question you get on the test/if you‚Äôre confident with the concept.
Did you find math 53 discussions helpful?
They were useless for me. Book helped a lot
second half of math 53 was A LOT harder so if you‚Äôre the same as me then you might be able to settle a lil bit into your schedule for the first few weeks without yet having to worry about math 53 yet"
