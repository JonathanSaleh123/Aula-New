ENGIN 78/178 with Gabriel Gomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w9x53r/engin_78178_with_gabriel_gomes/,2022-07-27 19:13:08,Has anyone taken engin 78 or 178 with Gabriel Gomes? I couldn't seem to find the course on Berkeley time. I would love to hear feedback from former students. Thanks!,"Pretty decent class and Gomes is a chill guy.  The tests are fair and not that difficult.  You get out of it what you put in.  Assignments are done on jupyter notebook and with python.  There's basic statistics for the first part and then it transitions into regression and classification methods and model building.
Do you have any feedback for him if you took the class lol
is gomes strict on the pre reqs, specifically engin 7? ive completed math 53 and 54 but imma be taking engin 7 concurrently. do u think he will drop me?
thanks. that sounds fair. do you know what would the lecturer be for the spring term?
i end up dropping the class in 2 weeks for me104, from my 2 week experience, he’s decent, homework is not too much and i believe there’s no final exam? and it seems like he’s the only professor that teaches 178
don’t think you will do well in the class without e7, but i don’t think he cares, i took it without 53
>class 

I know this is an older thread, but I can't find an answer online. Is Engin 7 a strict pre-req for Engin 178?
Probably Gomes, but idk who else might teach it.  I had Gomes this spring.
Yes thank uu
i disagree. e7 didnt teach me shit and im fine in 178. also didnt take 53 before and again, im fine."
