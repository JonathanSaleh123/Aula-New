do i have to take R1B in succession,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ajmrg3/do_i_have_to_take_r1b_in_succession/,2024-02-05 09:54:03,i’m a second semester junior transfer and I hate my R1B. it’s the worst class i’ve ever taken. must i take the r1b in succession? do i even need to take both the r1a and r1b? the l&s requirements are vague about it and i’m yet to meet with a counselor this semester,"I think you can take any R_B doesn’t have to be 1. R5B’s are known to be pretty easy. But I’m not sure if L&S requirements restrict you. I know engineering students can change.
Transfer students should have satisfied the R&C requirements before transferring. Also, the assumption that students do the “A” course before the “B” course. Whether you need to do the A *and* the B course depends on if and how you satisfied the first half of the requirement.
You don’t have to take R1B right after R1A.
R4B with Carmen Acevedo Butcher is awesome and would highly recommend."
