History w/ Novoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e1pnw9/history_w_novoa/,2019-11-25 16:26:10,"has anyone taken history with Natalie Novoa? If so, how was it?","Taking 124A with her right now. Readings every week. No books. All info is from lecture (Powerpoints are just visual aid so prepare to analyze everything she says so you wrote useful notes). 

Evidence reports, basically one-paged summaries of readings she assigned with some of your thoughts, due every two weeks. Her midterms are easy because she gives you the list of potential questions she will pick from on the actual test so you can study for them. Note that they are all essay responses.

She is very friendly and willing to talk over office hours/appointments about questions you have about the topics talked about in class. I would recommend.
in case anyone is wondering or looking back, i have her for 124b rn and it’s an amazing experience! she’s a very entertaining lecturer and understanding prof in general. :)
thanks for the reply! was looking to take 124b next semester with her. appreciated!"
