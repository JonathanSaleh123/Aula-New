I was one of Tim's roommates for a semester our Freshman year of undergrad at UW.

I have a hard time putting into words my feelings about Tim because I am sad to say we had lost touch soon after our time as roommates. Tim was a wonderful person, someone you could sense was destined for bigger and better things. He was the rare individual whose talent and tenacity was equally matched by his honesty and benevolence. 

I came into college a cynical introvert who kept to myself and saw the worst in most people. Nobody is geniune in this world everyone wears a facade, or so I had thought. Tim was geniune. He was kind, intelligent, passionate, diligent, and honest. 
He approached every day with an energy and joy that made everyone around him better for having been with him.

I don't have to wonder why his loss hurts so much. It's because he was the one person who was too good and capable to lose. The world lost a great soul but he will live on in the memories of the people he touched.

Rest in peace Tim.

RIP...."
Rejected from CS160 as #10 on the waitlist with 59 open seats and 205 on the waitlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/2fb1nt/rejected_from_cs160_as_10_on_the_waitlist_with_59/,2014-09-02 16:28:34,"[CS160](http://teaching.paulos.net/cs160_FL2014/) Professor [Eric Paulos](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/paulos.html) sent out this email at 3:27pm today before the CS160 lecture at 3:30pm:

> Dear students,

> I am writing to let you know that we were unable to accept you into CS160 this semester. Unfortunately the course was strongly oversubscribed, with approximately 300 students on the wait list for less than 50 spots. As a project-centered design course, CS160 cannot scale as well as some other CS courses. Given the large wait list, there is no way to select a subset of students without causing a lot of disappointment. We had to say no to many outstanding students who showed strong interest in the subject of user interface design. If you have additional semesters at Cal, we encourage you to apply again in the future - CS160 is taught every Fall and Spring. If you are graduating, we are sorry that we could not accommodate you, but we wish you the best for your future.

> We hope you will all have a successful semester.

> Eric Paulos

Today, https://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu/explore/courses/FL/2014/1460 says that there are 49 students enrolled with 108 total seats available. 205 people are on the waitlist.

I am a 4th year declared CS major and signed up for CS160 during Phase 1 of Telebears. I was around #10 on the waitlist this morning according to Bearfacts.

I thought I could get in but I guess CS160 with its application process is different from other classes that are first-come, first-served. :(","So, waitlist position plays no role in getting into the class.  Either you're enrolled, or you have to roll the 1 in 5-6 dice.  

And I am pretty pissed.  This is my Third time applying to get into the course.  I am graduating this semester as eecs and I am desperately looking for another CS course to take so i can graduate.  You have no idea how upset i am for being bumped out for the third time in a row. 

CS160 is always like that.

Back when I took the class, you could kinda see the patterns.  Each group had exactly one girl, there were majors and non-majors in each group, I think they had something going with mixing juniors/seniors as well.  But they've definitely got specific rules behind what they're looking for.

I know a couple seniors who got in after the petition process, basically begging the professor and saying they need the class to graduate/it's super interesting/it's my last semester, so if you're really desperate you could try that.  Or wait and try again for the Spring offering.
Quite a few seniors were rejected last semester as well. Being a graduating senior and being at a high position on the waitlist does not guarantee you a spot in the class. Your application must be what they're looking for.
The [CS160 Admission Petition](https://docs.google.com/a/paulos.net/forms/d/1RaEmAOTkD5_wlEPwjejbWsbQaVw3K1j2PHs3WCEIYuI/viewform):

> Everyone in the class, whether you are enrolled or on the waitlist, must submit the following course petition.

> We will use the petition information to determine which waitlisted students are admitted to the class. We also use this information for group formation later in the semester so EVERYONE MUST complete this form even if you are already enrolled. Enrolled students who do not submit a petition will be dropped.

Unlike other courses, dropping the course before the end of the semester has negative consequences for your other group members. So please make sure to answer the question about your commitment to staying in the course.

Honestly, I know its of little comfort, but the class isn't great. I signed up with a group of 4 friends and 1 of us didnt get in. We all ended up envying him by the end.  "
