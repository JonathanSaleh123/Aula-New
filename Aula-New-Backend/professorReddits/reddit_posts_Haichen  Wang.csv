I'm an incoming freshman, and plan to possibly double major in MCB/Stats. I come from a very rigorous high school environment, so I know I can handle enough. However, I still want the time and energy to adjust and get acclimated to college life.

\- Math 53

\- Physics 8A

\- Data C8

\- Philos 3

\- Physics 24 (Seminar)

Any input is appreciated (esp because registration is starting very soon)!

The art will be finding consistent time to do socials/club work/hanging out. 

Eg : for the first 5-6 weeks you’ll be able to balance your social life and work. Then towards the middle all the way to finals week you’ll probably end up sacrificing your social life if you’re aiming for all As"
Any suggestions on which course schedule to choose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14bqu3k/any_suggestions_on_which_course_schedule_to_choose/,2023-06-17 06:13:04,"Hi guys, I'm an incoming freshman, and I'm interested in majoring physics (and trying to do some research at cal). I've made these two different shedules, which one should I choose?

Why would you do physics 5a and 5b together? Isn’t 5a a prereq to 5b?
Second schedule looks very reasonable"
