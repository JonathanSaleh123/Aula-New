How is Physics 105 w/ Matthias Reinsch,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jwcp01/how_is_physics_105_w_matthias_reinsch/,2020-11-18 01:19:30,"Wondering about things like difficulty, workload, and how does it compare to physics lower div classes? Also, what is the professor like? There aren't too much info about him in Rate My Prof","Reinsch is good, 105 in general is hard, 5A is the hardest course in the physics department.

A typical physics upper div (110A, 137A, 112, 105) would require ~15-18 hours/week of work to get a competitive grade in an ordinary semester.

In material it's about as hard as any other course.

It's just the first one. 

You're a lot more sore after the first track meet than your 5th."
Advice for Physics 7A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4of7u4/advice_for_physics_7a/,2016-06-16 12:39:04,"Hi everyone, 

I'm taking Physics 7A in the fall as a rising sophomore, and I'm super nervous about the course. I know the course is pretty difficult especially the exams..
I really need to get an A in this course (for grad school). 
Taking it with Matthias Reinsch.

I have taken AP Physics 1 in high school, which was a useless course and the teacher was incompetent, so I didn't learn much. I was also pretty irresponsible (ended up with a 2 on the exam, unsurprisingly). I have also taken EE 16A.

Anyway, I'm planning on attending SLC study groups / office hours. Is there any other resources I can use to practice from that you recommend? Maybe some books? Should I just do all the midterms available on tbp starting 2 weeks before the exam?

On another note, I am taking Chem 1A during the summer session, so would you advise against taking physics 7a during this summer session as well? 

If not, I'll just audit 7a over the summer...

Please advise this terrible student who sucks at physics on how to get an A in 7A...

Thanks","My buddy took 7A last semester. He said the first exam was cancer and he got a 55%. There was a fat curve and his exam grade was boosted to an A. He said the final was pretty tricky, but fairly easy with little calculus, and aced it. Needless to say, he got an A. 

First of all, *practice* *practice* *practice*. The only way to do physics problems is to attack the relevant ones head on. But before you do that, motivate your strategy with concepts. Reviewing the text on a regular basis and keeping organized will also help you through the course. 

Also, grad schools are more interested in your ability to do research over anything else. Publishing papers, lab experience, solid letters of rec from your PIs, and a decent GRE score will trump a GPA any day for most grad programs (except medical school lol). 

To reinforce this, my friend's colleague went to CSU Long Beach and graduated with a 2.8 overall GPA. However, he was active in a materials physics research group and participated in extracurriculars, eventually getting his work published. He is now in the Materials Science & Engineering PhD program at UC Irvine.
Except for a chosen few people, physics as a subject is nearly impossible to ""cram"" for. All the ""formulas"" or concepts you will use in Physics 7A can be summarized on one face of a sheet of paper. Whenever I have taught it I liken it to learning a new language, which is really what you are doing. And the only way to learn a language is regular practice.

Of course do the homework, but there has notoriously been a disconnect between homework assignments and exams. That mostly has to do with the fact that in a typical homework assignment, the context of the problem (such as in a section for ""conservation of momentum"") typically gets you most of the way to starting the problem which is the hardest step. On an exam, topics integrate and are tested all at once.

You will already be attending the SLC and office hours, and when I took physics ages ago I did every midterm I could find. The physics department has a group called the Society for Physics Students that also has some exams you won't find elsewhere. I typically felt ready for an exam when I started identifying common big concepts, and then formulated in my head how I would write my OWN exam to test students if I was a professor.

The first physics class is always hard. For everybody. It gets easier if you put in that initial work.
I got an A for physics 7A (took it fall of freshmen year).

I'd recommend:

1. Attend lectures and clarify any questions
2. Make use of your TA and ask him/her as many questions as you can
3. Work through problems on your own before asking others for help
4. Ask others how they approached their problems
5. Prepare for midterms a week or two in advance
6. Do past papers and time yourself

It's entirely possible!
Like everyone is saying, practice a lot and with variety. Beyond that, make sure to really understand the physics; you can't get by just memorizing formulas. Reading the book carefully before lecture helps with this a lot."
