Theatre and Dance R1B: Srijani Ghosh or Sima Belmar?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17aw30z/theatre_and_dance_r1b_srijani_ghosh_or_sima_belmar/,2023-10-18 10:19:27,"Hi, can’t find much info on this class so any help is welcome. I’m looking for an easy R1B class with no exams. Also, which of the instructors should I go with?","I took my r1b with sima and thought she was great!! Workload was super light with a final paper at the end which was basically graded on completion
Thanks, this sounds like just what I need then !
was attendance mandatory?
I think it was technically optional but it would help towards ur participation grade if u went to class"
theater r1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xwwuct/theater_r1b/,2022-10-05 22:09:18,"Has anyone here taken theater r1b? Thoughts on it? Is it easy? 

The R1A I'm taking this semester is a lot of work so I want to take an easier R1B next semester. Any recs?","music r1b with Mendelssohn, super easy compared to other r1bs
do you need to have any knowledge about music? (I have absolutely no knowledge about music...)
as long as you are into music you’ll be fine! just reading/writing/watching about music is all you need to do so no, you dont need any technical skills :-)
thank you! I'll check that music r1b out too!"
Rate my freshman mechanical engineering schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v6g8uq/rate_my_freshman_mechanical_engineering_schedule/,2022-06-06 16:03:30,"Tentative Schedule:

1. Math 1B
2. Economics 1 or UGBA 10 if my AP scores that come out in July let me skip Econ 1
3. Engineering 7
4. Theater 52AC

I test out of Math 1A, Chemistry 1A, Reading and Composition A, and all the UC Berkeley general requirements except for American Cultures.

* I'd love recommendations for easy A/A+ American Cultures and/or Reading and Composition B courses
* I'm trying not to take classes that start before 10 AM or go past 4 PM
* Ratings out of 10 or comments/advice is really helpful!","Is there a reason you're not doing physics 7a or engineering 26?

A typical freshman mechE schedule might look like: math 1b, physics 7a, e26, humanities. But of course that doesn't mean you have to follow that exactly.
No idea what you’re planning to do in college, but I recommend nocking out as many engineering lower divs as you can, as early as you can

The skills from lower divs (CAD (E26/29) basics thermo (ME40) and materials knowledge (MEC85) are very useful for engineering teams/personal project

Upper divs are where you learn the really fun and cool tools that help you build the kinda projects that MechEs dream of (e.g it gives you electronics knowledge (ME100, ME132) ). You can’t do the upper divs without the lower divs, and I wish Id done more engineering classes earlier so that I felt more able to participate in clubs and research

If you want to talk more happy to hop on a zoom call if you PM me - I’m a rising senior in MechE
Hmmm, E7 might be a too much to start off ur first semester, but that’s my opinion :p
Any course with Sima Belmar for R1B should be an easy A
I couldn't find E26 on the Academic Guide or Schedule Planner so I assumed it wasn't being offered this fall, and I was worried Physics 7A might be too difficult to take during my first semester. Would you suggest taking Physics 7A over Engineering 7?
Def take physics 7a as soon as you can! You’ll be able to start on the ME core sooner that way. Lots of MEs will be in the class in fall as well!
Just wanted to let you know e26 has been added to the schedule in case you missed it"
