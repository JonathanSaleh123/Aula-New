Help Setting Up CS61A (Brian Harvey 2011) Scheme STK,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/narrvj/help_setting_up_cs61a_brian_harvey_2011_scheme_stk/,2021-05-12 08:43:35,"Hope everyone's healthy and well. I'm in the process of self studying CS61A Spring 2011 guided by Professor Harvey (Course page: http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/) and had trouble from the outset with downloading STK for Scheme.

Being computer illiterate, I have no idea what is being said on the UCB scheme website (http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/Scheme/) and was hoping that anybody with experience going through CS61A Scheme themed would help me with downloading STK. Bit of an obscure question, but I would greatly appreciate any help in my self studying progress.

e: So I've tried to go through the steps under ""For UCB Scheme"" and am running into some trouble. I downloaded the source code (http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/Scheme/source/) which I presume is stk-1.3.6.tgz. It's just sitting in my downloads folder for now. I went through the instructions on [here](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/Scheme/source/windows.html). On step 3, I wrote the prompt for simply but get the error ""cp: cannot stat `/cygdrive/c/Users/All Users/Start Menu/Programs/Cygwin-X/XWin Server.lnk': No such file or directory
simply is now the default"" but I guess since simply is the default, it's fine for now? Problem is, on step 4 when I write ""startxwin.exe"" I get the error ""startxwin:  Resource temporarily unavailable (errno 11):  Another X server instance is running on DISPLAY :0"". Is this just not doable since I'm not on the Berkeley campus?","I know this doesn't exactly answer your question but may I ask why you're going through 2011 61a compared to 2021 61a? just curious
Modern iterations of 61A use a custom python implementation of scheme iirc, so no one is really going to be familiar with whatever the 2011 class is having you do
Yeah do the 2021 61A lmao. It’ll also be closer to the class you’re actually going to take
Professor Harvey's 61a follows the SICP book and he uses Scheme and I've read some mixed but generally positive reviews on it (i.e. it's completely changed the way they approach programming, SICP is the best book on programming out there). Learning that seemed promising. Plus, it was recommended here: https://teachyourselfcs.com/."
Professor Anant Sahai Fighting Cheating in CS70 Spring 2013,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1jmspf/professor_anant_sahai_fighting_cheating_in_cs70/,2013-08-03 09:52:41,"I was a student in [CS70](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs70/sp13/) last semester (Spring 2013 with [Professor Anant Sahai](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Esahai/)).

There was cheating on the final, and Professor Sahai posted the following vehement note on the classroom forum:

>We have received disturbing reports of observed cheating on the final --- people copying answers and continuing past when time was called.

>**If you yourself cheated, I strongly urge you to confess. We will be significantly more lenient with those that confess. If you don't, we will throw the book at you and work as hard as possible to have you expelled from Berkeley and possibly, to have your name and reputation ruined for all time. (Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)**

>For those of you who saw something, please comment (anonymously (or not) as a follow-up in Piazza, or by sending us an email) telling us a. if you saw this, b. where roughly you were in the room, c. where the cheaters were.

>If you know or suspect who the cheaters were (or can provide a description), please report that too if you can. Your accusation will not result in anyone being falsely accused as we have all the exams scanned in and will only proceed on the basis of hard evidence. It will just allow us to more swiftly verify it and most importantly, to isolate those scores from our thinking as we adjust grade thresholds.

>It is really important in this case because we are trying to be fair to everyone in adjusting the grading to compensate for the unfortunate and unforeseen loss of 15 minutes. The cheaters are going to be hurting the grades of all the honest students in the class. They deserve no mercy or loyalty after doing such a despicable act to their fellow students. Please think of the good of all of the other students in the class and help us quickly find and isolate them from the sample.

>We have tried our best to make a fair exam with a chance for students at all levels of ability to demonstrate their understanding, we let you drop questions on the final, we made a special practice exam whose difficulty was calibrated above the actual exam, we released a specially made exam skeleton to reduce any uncertainty about the format, we allowed students to bring 3 handwritten sheets of paper, and we offered ample extra credit opportunities in the class. **We created and staffed homework parties and study parties to help students both interact with each other and get attention in what would otherwise be a large and impersonal class. To have students cheat in this context is extremely upsetting to me. To do so brazenly, in view of their peers, is a shameless act that is simply shocking. I have never seen such a thing in one of my own classes in my years at Berkeley.**

>For those who saw something, do not enable this kind of behavior in others. This is not normal. It should not be tolerated. They are contaminating your environment by their presence.

And later:

>UPDATE: Our estimates show that the extent of the truly egregious cheating seems to have been quite limited --- less than 2% of the class. We have had confessions and detailed reporting that has helped us in the process of identifying perpetrators. Those guilty really should confess if they know what is good for them. **As Brian Harvey has eloquently put it, cheating is fundamentally a violation against yourself.** Character is built out of habits, and cheating is a very bad and addictive habit. **Cultivating good habits and shunning bad ones is absolutely critical in your life, especially your youth when your character is most malleable. The violence cheating does to your intuitions of right and wrong is a terrible thing.** It is not too late. If you come forward without prompting, it'll be like stealing something that was in a sealed package and returning it without it being either opened or missed. We will be lenient and your character (and grades) will benefit greatly.

>For those of you who know something, please do step forward and report what you know to us. We've got lots of info, but your corroboration is very important. This is a matter of solidarity with your fellow classmates --- unrepentant cheaters have violated all of you. They must be rejected.

>If you yourself cheated, I strongly urge you to confess. We will be significantly more lenient with those that confess. If you don't, we will throw the book at you and work as hard as possible to have you expelled from Berkeley. **(edited to remove a stronger outburst of anger at the foolishness of provoking the wrath of Berkeley faculty.)**

**Professor Anant Sahai as a Berkeley undergraduate**

I took CS 70 in Fall 2011 with Satish Rao.  During the second midterm the fire alarm was pulled.  We were told to leave our exams in the room, but there was a group of 20 or so people who took their exams with them, and started looking on their smartphones for answers and talking to other students about the questions.
This was my first semester at Berkeley, and I was appalled at the behavior of these students.  I never even saw close to the amount of cheating at my community college as I do here. 
Good, people do the same in the larger Economics courses and it's pretty embarrassing.
> cheating is fundamentally a violation against yourself.

this couldn't be any truer

when you cheat, you cheat yourself out of an education
I was in this class.  I reported people who were writing almost 10 minutes past the call deadline and collaborating answers, esp the easy to re-write true false questions on that exam.  

Kinda pissed me off that people were cheating.  It was a fair exam and all.  

>(Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)

When I read this, I then realized that Sahai was pretty pissed.  I am kinda glad that he redacted his statement in a later edit because i'm pretty sure he was somewhat emotionally compromised in the beginning of this entire debacle. 

Well, it's good that they finally call people out on this shit. This happens all the time and normally for simplicity, profs and gsi's look the other way. 
Well, guys I suppose the moral here is to not get caught cheating.


What if someone doesn't happen to check their inbox for a few days; only to find out now they're being accused of not turning themselves in leading to their expulsion.

(Devil's Advocacy Group, LLC)

I realize that's unlikely, but the professor's reaction seems a bit over the top. ""I will ruin your entire future! Because you cheated on one test in college!"" 

Not that I condone cheating, but this just seems like too much. Also why is this only just now being announced? If this was a Spring course, why is he just now doing anything about this? 
It seems pretty unfair that they did not get the full time on the exam. 
Oh please, cheating on the exam? Happens every time, at Cal and everywhere. The system is outdated, students are incentivized to get good grades so they can get into Grad program. If that's your only incentive,  ofcourse you are going to cheat. And who cares, it's not like Cal or any other university is preparing you for real jobs. This is a money grabbing, degree manufacturing machine. Why is there 400 people in one class. GSI's have no way of educating or in this case controlling that many students at one time.
I had similar feelings; I felt bad for Satish (or any other instructor, really) that he had to deal with this. He seems great teacher (stays behind to answer questions etc) and researcher and it's just a shame, I dont think he was really prepared to deal with situations like that (and shouldn't have to). Wish people had more integrity.
I really wish we could crack down on that crap. 
Happened a lot in Math 110 it seemed like, too.
lol so was anyone dumb enough to confess to cheating? What was the punishment for the cheaters?
lmao. just a random outburst of threats. people are always writing past call time. seen it happen too many times and there's usually no way to stop it, especially when it's stadium seating and everyone else is in a mad rush to go down and turn it in. 
> Not that I condone cheating, but this just seems like too much.

Academic dishonesty is.. kind of a big deal. 

People who cheat now, will hey falsify their results later too?


If nobody got full time, does it really matter?
> students are incentivized to get good grades so they can get into Grad program.

Well gee, maybe you should fucking study and learn the material. I have no sympathy with people who cheat and distort grades for everyone else. 
snowflake_princess, you are so right. You have what it takes to become an accomplished grad student in today's society. I can see you now, among all the GSIs and TAs at Cal CS or even MIT's PhD program. You are cultured and intelligent and will lead a meaningful life worth infinitely more than those of most other people. I believe you are the next Alan Turing of research.You are a genius; honestly, and in a world where the only sin is to be dumb, you have risen to truly godlike status. Think of it: an international student thrust into the din that is the English-speaking world, snagging a spot at the pinnacle of academia, assuming a position coveted by all her peers! This is all because you knew how to navigate the world. But why am I telling you all this, when you know it all already. You must excuse me for not being a genius like you. 


...Fuck you, cheater. It's people like you who give me homicidal ideations. But I have no need for ideations. By cheating you lie to yourself, and your true ego decays underneath the facade you create. Your true life is meaningless, and though nothing's stopping you from worming your way into Cal or MIT grad school, you will probably never be a very interesting or cultured person if all you care about are appearances. It's no wonder none of your close friends are very interesting people to be around. Fuck, you are most definitely NOT an interesting or cultured person now, it's evident by the beliefs you hold. You will do many things in life, but you will never say anything new that's worth caring about. You are only as beautiful and creative as your character, and yours is a pus-filled decaying corpse of a thing at the moment. Enjoy the futility, you lowlife worthless scum.
>it's not like Cal or any other university is preparing you for real jobs

Lol, tell that to all the EECS/CS grads making six figures right out of undergrad.
\> cheat for good grades

\> get into grad program

yeah, good luck passing quals you'll probably wash out super early
Redditor for 2 hours with a suspicious username and these are your only comments? I smell a guilty conscience.
If you get called in for cheating, and don't confess, the penalties are far worse. Trust me.
alot of people did, because the penalty for confessing was only losing points on problems you cheated, and the penalty for being caught without confessing was zeroing out the final, effectively failing the class. 
Yeah, but 10 minutes?  thats just wrong.  It just took forever to collect the tests.  
There was a lot said and done in the moments and days after cheating that was a bit over the top, but I completely respect Sahai for trying to do what's right.
>Academic dishonesty is.. kind of a big deal.
People who cheat now, will hey falsify their results later too?

[Which is why why everyone knows that anyone who has ever committed a crime ever will continue to repeat that crime for the rest of their life.](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1psjcyZgK1qgcra2o1_500.gif) 
 
Yes, they might falsify their results later, but they might learn from their mistakes and grow as a human being after having had to repeat the course due to a zero on a final. Attempting to ruin someone's entire future for cheating on a final is an extreme response.

And from reading the above comments, it seems like this professor really needs to work on how he administers tests. Having everyone wait for 10+ minutes for their test to get collected is just idiotic. ESPECIALLY given that the students should have had an extra ~15 minutes allotted for taking the test. 

Get outta here.... Talkin that nonsense...

well if you are going to enforce the time limit this hard then yeah. 
that was...beautiful.
but how would they be able to tell who cheated once everyone left the room? Don't they presume everyone is innocent until proven guilty?

If someone said you cheated and you said you didn't then it would be your word and against the other person's. And it's impossible to know everyone's names in a 300+ person class.
Other than losing points on the final, did they also get reported to the Dean or receive anything permanent on their records?
how'd they even get to 10 minutes? normally gsis are scrambling around, grabbing tests....you've got to be desperate if you're still writing 10 minutes after. 
There's little difference between giving a 45-minute test and giving a 1-hour minute test that's cut off by 15 minutes when you know beforehand, the material's hard enough that many people won't finish the test, and there's a grading curve. The only unfair thing is that some people cheated for extra time and still received the grading curve (and also collaborated on answers but that's something different). 
There are ways to tell. It's not that hard. And no I won't elaborate because fuck cheaters.
I think it can be pretty hard to find a cheater. It would really have to depend on what the test looks like. I don't know what cs tests are like so I can't comment on them. 


the one's that confessed did not, the ones that did not confess may have been, I have to check.

There was this requirement sahai had where a gsi had to sign off the coversheet of your exam with you and your ID present, so GSI's had to sign each exam before you could turn it in, leading to a long amount of time required to turn in the actual exam. Also, Our exam was cut short by 15 minutes because we were in haas pavilion so another class was taking a final at the exact same time and the prof for that class was proctoring the exam and we ended up starting almost 15 minutes late and we didn't get that 15 minutes back at the end. 


Yeah it wasn't handled very well, they did this thing where they told everyone to stay put in their seats while GSIs went around and individually checked each person's ID before collecting their test... I was near the front and it still took them like 3 minutes to get to me.
The collaboration is obviously wrong and they should be punished for cheating, However, can at least feel some empathy for the people who wanted the extra 15 minutes. As we all know, college is serious business and if you are allotted a certain amount of time, it should be given to you. This is a huge fuck up by the department and they should at least realize that they have some culpability. I see that our opinions differ, but that is just my perspective.  
Agreed with that_pj, it's not terribly hard. Honestly, it's better to confess than get caught. And, having been in that class, people did turn others in. There;s plenty of ways to tell.
how do you check? Did sahai post what happened on Piazza? Can you copy over what he said?
Ah I see. If the prof's gonna do that, should have had everyone hold their tests in the air. lol thanks for the explanation
I'm not one of those who downvoted you, but why do you think everyone deserves the full amount of time? The professor changed the amount of time allotted at the beginning of the test. It's just a revision to the test. I do agree that they should've had better enforcements though. Giving people at the back 15% more time than people at the front definitely makes an impact.
>Anyway, we've got multiple leads and those guilty who have not confessed already are facing a ticking clock. They should confess very soon if they know what is good for them. At this point, it is still like someone who has stolen something in a sealed package but hasn't opened the package. Give it back and significant leniency can be achieved. The instant grades start to come out, they are in deep trouble.

and

>For those who fully confess, our vision of leniency isn't failing you in the class or even on the final. It is a much more measured response in keeping with the ""stealing something and returning it unopened and unmissed"" analogy that I used. It is a much better deal. By our calculations, at this point of our ever tightening noose, a person who has cheated has a larger than 60% probability of being caught. At this point, even from an Expected Value point of view, it is in their self-interest to confess. 

He didn't really say what happened to those that were caught and didn't confess. 

> If the prof's gonna do that, should have had everyone hold their tests in the air.

And wave it like they just don't care!"
