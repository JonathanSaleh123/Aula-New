What creative writing classes should I take this fall?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dj8dsy/what_creative_writing_classes_should_i_take_this/,2024-06-18 19:28:29,"I will be a junior this fall and have decided to do a creative writing minor. I am mostly a novice and so far I've only taken Eng 141 with Prof Abrams, as well as the required R1A and R4B. I really enjoyed the story writing component of Eng 141.

Currently, I'm deciding between Colwrit 130 (Kimberly Freeman, John Levine, and Kaya Oakes) and Eng 180Z with Prof Snyder. 180Z seems super fun and I have heard great things about Snyder but idk if it would end up being too advanced for my level, and on the other hand 130 might be better for learning the basics, but I'm worried it could be too simplistic and boring. What would you recommend? (Recommendations for any other creative writing or literature class being offered this Fall also welcome!)","The 143 Series are really good! 

The class sizes tend to be small so they're hard to get into but it does mean you get to know your fellow writers really well and they get a lot more time to review and workshop your pieces.
Were you able to get in? What kind of piece did you submit for it?"
