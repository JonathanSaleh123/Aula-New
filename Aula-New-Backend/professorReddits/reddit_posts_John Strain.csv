Easiest Upper Div Math?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7hw17p/easiest_upper_div_math/,2017-12-05 21:41:49,"I'm an engineering upperclassman looking for an easy upper division math class as a technical elective.

I'm enrolled in Math 110 with Edward Frenkel and on the waitlist for 128A with John Strain, which class would have the lighter workload or easier grading?","110
For whatever reason, this question popped up frequently two years ago. Consider taking a look at those threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/37nc8z/upper_div_math_class/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/32v69t/best_upperdiv_math_classes_to_take/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/34wxsk/hows_math_116_as_a_first_math_upper_div/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/33shcr/recently_admitted_looking_for_adviceexperience/).

In the future, also consider posting questions like this to the [Q&A thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7gzx44/15_are_you_prepared_for_finals_or_prepared_to/) currently pinned to the top of the subreddit.

Good luck!
Strain grades generously (and is hilarious and engaging as a lecturer), but the homework assignments he gives are pretty intense. Math 110 is a more reasonable workload but with a lower average grade. 
128a and 110 are both not very hard, the programming assignments for 128a especially are a joke
Ive heard Strain homeworks are very long. I’d wait to take 128A with Ming Gu where the workload isn’t as intense. Frenkel may be the easiest 110 teacher out there so don’t leave that. 
Can you elaborate on why? I'm leaning a little towards 128A because Strain curves to around a B+, whereas Frenkel usually to a B-/B. Are both classes about equal workload and suited well to someone who hasn't taken upper division math?
I'll have to take one of these two next semester, and I'll honestly settle for whichever one I can get the highest grade in as long as the workload isn't ridiculous.

Which one do you think would be better suited for an engineering major with little experience in proof-based math? I thought 128A might be okay since I have MATLAB experience, but if the workload is that intense I'm having second thoughts...
I think it's because it's Linear Algebra but with proof writing . Most people already understand the concepts, it's just now they need to apply proof writing to it. 

128A is alot less proof writing, in fact it's mostly just calculations. Unless it's the final, where they pull out every proof you didn't bother reading. 
I took 128a this semester and the psets were so long, eventually I just stopped doing them-- they aren't very helpful in learning the material-- it's just plug and chug. The exams are completely off from what is taught in lecture or given in homework. (Edit: I took it with Ming Gu, which commenter above said is the ""lighter"" workload...)

MATLAB experience helps you only very slightly. I don't know about Strain, but for our second (final) project, we literally just had to change some variable values and add a couple more from a code file the professor gave us on his website and turn it in. The first one was not too much more difficult either. So overall, it was a complete mental drain and not intellectually stimulating at all. I haven't taken 110 yet, but I do not recommend 128a at all unless you reallllyyyy care about learning about how computers approximate roots/derivatives/integrals/ODEs/Systems"
