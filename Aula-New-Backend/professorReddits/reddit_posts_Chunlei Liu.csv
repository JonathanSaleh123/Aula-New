exam of EE 120 taught by chunlei liu,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1an93l2/exam_of_ee_120_taught_by_chunlei_liu/,2024-02-09 21:37:19,"May I ask, will the exam questions of EE 120 taught by Chunlei involve many difficult mathematical techniques?","not the best time my friendüíÄ
i took it last semester (diff prof), first mt was pretty reasonable but i didn‚Äôt study but i feel like if i did i would have been fine. idk 120 is just knowing all of the ‚Äútools‚Äù and trying to apply them until something works. so just do practice mts, know properties of LTI, convolution, etc and you should be fine. not really any crazy hard problems you just gotta know the content.
thanks! you mean the mathematical techniques are very difficult and unpredictable?
it means that you should ask your TA instead of Reddit"

Thoughts on EE 127 with Laurent el Ghaoui or EE 120 with Chunlei Liu?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/k0npk1/thoughts_on_ee_127_with_laurent_el_ghaoui_or_ee/,2020-11-24 23:38:45,I can't find much about Ghaoui and Liu has really low ratings on ratemyprofessor. What are yall's thoughts?,"If if its anything like the textbook 127 uses (which  el Ghaoui wrote), I don't expect it to be good but it won't be terrible. It cant possibly be worse than Venkat that I'm going through right now so, you'll be fine.

Chunlei is top 5 worst professors I've had in Cal. I had him when I took 16A and he made 0 sense teaching linear algebra. At least I had some Math 54 knowledge so I didn't need to listen to lectures but a lot of my friends got fucked. Also, 120's content usually doesn't vary year to year but you can take the class, skip lecture, and just watch and learn it when Babak taught it (when I took it). Absolutely amazing professor, best professor I've ever had at Cal and 120 was the best class I've taken at Cal as well.
