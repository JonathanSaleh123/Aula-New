Humanities Class: Psych 110 or Sociol 166?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/6wm9xi/humanities_class_psych_110_or_sociol_166/,2017-08-28 13:45:45,"I need to take an upper division humanities class and am choosing between Psych 110 (Intro to Biological Psychology, taught by David Foster) and Sociology 166 (Society and Technology, taught by Linus Huang).

Both classes seem quite interesting, I'd be willing to take either or whichever might have a lighter workload. Sociol 166 is 4 units, while Psych 110 is 3. Does anybody have experience with either of these classes?","Society and Technology is a very easy class to get an ""A"" in. Linus is a very entertaining lecturer and the subject material itself is pretty interesting. I would definitely recommend attending lectures though. 
Second on soc 166. When I took it it was no discussion, no ""real"" homework assignments, and basically like 2-3 take home midterms and finals. Super easy and kind of fun class. Interesting to think about how your robotic overlords may come to take your kids and wives one day. Highly recommend. 

And Linus is a damn funny lecturer. The material itself is fun but he made it even funnier. Also he had a habit of giving nicknames to students.. like idk why but I remember some student was called Lord Alex for like the entirety of the class. All in all 9/10 would recommend. "
