could anyone help with some psych upper div questions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12mnhj2/could_anyone_help_with_some_psych_upper_div/,2023-04-14 19:55:34,"hey! i'm a junior planning to take a bunch of my upper divs next semester and i'm wondering about how some of the classes operate. if you have recently taken any of the classes below could you tell me if they upload lecture material online (like ppts, study guides, etc)? i have some pretty big sleep issues and don't know if i'll be able to make all lectures since these classes are relatively early. it would be so so helpful if anyone here could shed some light on any of these classes for me, thanks so much!!

Basic Issues in Cognition (PSYCH C120, Davina Chan)

Psychology of Personality (PSYCH 150, Oliver P John)

Developmental Psychology (PSYCH 140,  Jan Engelmann)

Developmental Psychopathology (PSYCH 131, Qing Zhou)

Social Psychology (SOCIOL 150, John W Kaiser)

Leading People (UGBA 105, Brandi Pearce)","I took Personality with Oliver, it’s still my favorite class I’ve taken. I had an 8am, but he records lectures and posts the slides so I’d skip and watch the recordings in the afternoon
i took 131 w zhou! she recorded all lectures, posted all readings and slides ahead of time, and tests were based purely on lecture, so it was fairly easy!
I agree with the two comments about 150 & 131! I also took 140 with Jan and he does upload slides but they are very plain. He does not record lectures but even though I did not attend lecture I passed the class with an A by downloading the textbook and going to sections.
thats super great to hear! thanks for the info!!
love! tysm!
r the tests online?"
