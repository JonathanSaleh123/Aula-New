ENGIN 125 - Opinions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/107fhww/engin_125_opinions/,2023-01-09 06:17:58,"Opinions on ENGIN 125 with Raluca Scarlat?

I thought it was an interesting and easy class. Looking at berkeleytime, the grade distribution looks great. However, looking at RateMyProfessors, people comment that she is a tough grader and to avoid her.","It may be dependent on the GSI/reader but in my experience it was easy to get an A with like 1-2 hrs of work a week, maybe 3 hours if you had to present that week for your discussion group. I missed one of the assignments where you respond to the presenter and ended up with an A+ anyway. IMO the readings were a mixed bag.

Lecture attendance was a part of the grade but you kinda just had to show up most of the time and you would be fine.
Took it before. Not a hard class and some topics are interesting. If you complete all the assignments with any modicum of effort and attend class, easy A
Thank you! Is it interesting?? I need to take a non-technical course (literally any non-technical course at Berkeley works), and I thought this one was a good option
They went for a variety of readings, so some of the content may be more interesting to you than others (ex. space shuttle failure study vs ethics from a non engineering textbook). It's also dependent on what your group chooses for their discussion topics. You also have to interview an engineer about ethics in their workplace, which i found most interesting.
What discussion topics would you recommend that were easier than others?"
