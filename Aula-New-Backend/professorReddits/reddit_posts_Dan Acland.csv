Anyone that's taken Econ 105 or Econ C102/EnvEcon C102,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cnunls/anyone_thats_taken_econ_105_or_econ_c102envecon/,2019-08-08 17:32:44,"I'm still trying to figure out my schedule for Fall 2019 and I'm taking CS 61B and Data 100 and I'm trying to figure out a third class to take. I was currently going to take Econ 100A but the professor, Dan Acland has horrible reviews so I changed it. I just added Econ 105 (History of Economic Thought) taught by Professor Ravi Bhangari. I believe he used to be a professor at a Saint Mary's College of California and has really good reviews. I also added Econ C102 ( Natural Resource Economics) being taught by Larry Karp. Professor Karp has decent reviews (way better than Acland for sure). I was just wondering if there's anyone that's taken either of these classes and can speak on them and/or the professors. I'm not the biggest fan of straight up history class since it tends to be a lot of memorizing, though I enjoy learning certain history topics on my own. Is Econ 105 a lot of memorizing ? I want to figure out the best Econ class to pair up with 61B and Data 100 since 61B will be really time consuming.","Well, Larry is condescending, and he's not that great with undergrads. I didn't like his class. Weekly iClicker quizzes, but if you get 1 wrong every week, don't worry about it. It's curved. I got an A by getting almost 100% on Psets, a little higher than 75% avg on quizzes, did the extra credit news presentation, and a B+ on the final But, there were quite a few people that dropped his class. 

It was a very stressful class. It took up a lot of time. His book isn't that good and he wrote it. It's needed for Psets.  You get what you need from section notes.
So you for sure need to read the book solely to finish the hw ? Do you think it would be a good class to take considering the workload I have already with CS 61B and Data 100 since I'm going to be spending most of my time on 61B and wanted a class with not as much work and that can probably get an A in.
No, don't take Larry's class. That thing took a whole ton of my time. It's a major req for Enviro Econ. The book contains the HW questions. Otherwise, the book isn't that great to read. It does implicitly contain the answers to the questions, but I wouldn't have noticed unless someone pointed it out. 

The only plus is that it's a webcasted class, but you need to show up for the quizzes every week. 

I don't recommend it. It wasn't easy to get an A, and a lot of people hated the class. You'd be better off taking a Haas class.
I actually recommend Climate Change Econ with David Anthoff. The only likely scenario that you'll get in that class now is if you try for an 8 am section time. 

It's a ton easier than Larry's class. You don't even need any prior Econ knowledge. 

You just do Excel hw every week and the GSIs are good at telling you what you're supposed to do. 

You have to go to lecture though only because it's not webcasted and I found it kinda hard to understand the slides without my notes. 

There's one group presentation, weekly reading exercises that are for EC and points but aren't tested on the final, final only (take home and in class) and the Excel hw. 

I got to the final 30 minutes late because it was at 8 am. Still did fine and some people actually finished it in 30-45 minutes.

Final Excel was ok. It was similar to a previous HW, so you should be able to do alright on it. Don't overthink it too much.
do you happen to have a past final file?
I tried adding that class but was placed on the waitlist #51 so based on enrollment I wouldn't get in as only a couple of people end up dropping the class :/"
