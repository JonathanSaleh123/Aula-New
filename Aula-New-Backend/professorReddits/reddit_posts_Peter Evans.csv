did this combo and wanted to cry every single day don’t get behind and try to stay on top of lectures
how was thtr 141??
I have taken all of those classes (at different semesters). TH 60 is an easy A as long as you have good attendance. If you have no other classes, you should be able find with both Chem and Bio. If you are not attending your 8 AMs live, make sure you schedule time to actually watch your lectures. Do not fall behind, especially in Bio 1A.
Oh no :/ are As possible in both?
it’s definitely doable but you just have to manage your time efficiently for both classes, i had a hard time bc I was juggling other commitments and couldn’t dedicate a lot of time"
