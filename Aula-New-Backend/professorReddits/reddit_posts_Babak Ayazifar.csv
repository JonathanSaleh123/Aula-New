Man I'm not even in EECS and Babak Ayazifar's EE 120 Piazza post made me sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qm8gt8/man_im_not_even_in_eecs_and_babak_ayazifars_ee/,2021-11-03 17:28:54,"The way he ended the email with ""forgive me"" :((","[deleted]

An absolute red line for me—one that I will not cross—is overworking my TAs beyond their appointment limits. Aside from the far, far, far greater moral/ethical abomination of overworking members of my staff, it can also trigger legal conflict with the Union.

The classroom assigned to me houses 149 students.  The bottleneck is my anemic TA budget.  I can’t hire the staff I need to deliver, to that large a class size, the quality I’m used to providing.

If you took EE 120 and did well (A or A+), your overall GPA is up there, and you’re willing to take an 8-hour TA appointment, do let me know right away, and go online and apply for a position, so I can see you in the database. If you got A-, B+, or B in EE 120, but subsequently took EE 123 or EE 126 and received an A or better, I’m more than happy to talk with you.

What's the rationale behind the school making these decisions? With all the donations and such, why does the eecs department get the shit end of the stick when it comes to enrollment for students?

I honestly believe that even if the school receives more money, this problem will still persist.
Can someone copy or link it?
Can someone share it here? I have graduated already but I wanna know lol
I am a TA in the math department. It is mindbending how little of the pro-rata tuition that students pay for participation in these gigantic courses goes towards paying course staff.

A hypothetical 400 person class with 8 TAs and one professor would cost about… 100k(prof)+100k(TA’s) in salaries for the semester; add in another 200k for “extra” costs like health insurance and payroll taxes. Generously, that’s 400k in payroll costs.

400 students pay, on average about $1k per unit. Let’s lowball that at $750. A 4 unit class would be 3k.

So, the absolute maximum possible payroll costs for a big class are $400k; the absolute minimum money the course should be entitled to, on a pro-rats basis would be $1.2 million.

Sure, big math classes subsidize small math classes, but even the 40 person math upperdivs with 1 GSI and 1 Prof would break even on payroll costs (and a lot of these classes are taught by just 1 postdoc, or a professor with a couple of readers).
because admin is a bunch of fucking leeches
I suspect a major factor is just that there is an absurd amount of students trying to take CS classes. In the Piazza thread, Nick Weaver said about 15% of graduating students are CS/EECS, and interest is only growing. That is going to put a lot of strain on resources. You would of course expect the TA budget to grow proportionally, but I don't know to what extent that happens. Presumably that money has to come from somewhere else, which could complicate things.

It also seems to me that these courses are very hungry for staff. What I mean is that in the few classes outside of the department I've taken, there have been only a few GSIs even for classes of 300+ students, meanwhile CS classes, have so many people on course staff that I don't even know all of their names, and while they tend to be bigger classes, they aren't THAT much larger. And to be clear, I'm not saying this is unreasonable, these CS classes need that much support (or more).

check it out in this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qm8hfv/eecs_budget_discussion_on_eecs101/
That’s,one option.

The other option is that non-stem disciplines don’t have economies of scale so they can have one prof teach 1200 people at the same time. So big courses and departments end up subsidizing the small departments with small classes.
It's like the school wants its cake and eat it too. They wanna enroll all these CS/EECS students but at the same time not provide the necessary resources...huh?"
Alistair Sinclair vs Babak Ayazifar for CS 70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/br75t7/alistair_sinclair_vs_babak_ayazifar_for_cs_70/,2019-05-20 23:56:06,"Who’s the best professor for CS 70? I initially planned to take 70 in Spring 2020 with Babak because I want to take IMT DeCal next semester. However, because IMT DeCal isn’t offered next sem, I might consider taking CS 70 next semester. What should I do to prep for 70? For reference, I’ve only taken two math classes: MATH 1A and B with Paulin (I got A+ in both)","They’re both great professors but Sinclair has an enchanting British accent if you’re into that kinda thing
Can’t speak to Babak, but I had Sinclair when I was a student and he was pretty good. Not the best I had at Berkeley, but one of the better ones. He’s also a super smart guy who does really cool research—which is a nice bonus for a class like this—but he is a good teacher, on top of that.
I thought Babak was fantastic, but I also only watched two of his lectures (lol). I've heard nothing but good things about song and sinclair.

W.r.t. preparing for 70, it's a strange class to prep for. TBH I feel it's very much a class where you either get it or you don't. Your A+es in 1a and 1b are good signs but not guarantees by any means; the competition in 70 will likely be significantly stronger.

If you really want to overkill-prep for the class, try reading through the course notes from this semester. They're fantastic, and I did well in the class pretty much exclusively learning from them. You really have to go through them slowly though, you won't get anything at all out of skimming them. (I.e. convince yourself of all the proofs, do some of the optional exercises, maybe mark them up, etc.)
I’d do ayazifar for the no homework option personally. It saves a lot of stress. And if you really need to declare then you will probably already have a strong enough incentive to do the homework on a regular basis."

DATA C8 w/ Prof. Sahai & Ayazifar,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jfojuz/data_c8_w_prof_sahai_ayazifar/,2020-10-21 16:46:41,Planning on taking Data C8 Foundations of data science for Spring 2021. I saw that prof Swupnil Kumar Sahai is teaching C8 right now and will in spring. How is Sahai’s class and teaching? Do you guys like how Sahai teaches/does Sahai make the class more difficult or more “easy”? Is Sahai nice and available for OH/Understanding during the pandemic? If anyone has had Ayazifar please lmk as well. Babak Ayazifar has 4.3/5 total rating and 3.5 level difficult on rate my prof. Sahai has 4/5 total and 2.5 level difficulty. Do you agree with these?,"Babak is pretty good and Sahai (this is not the infamous one) is quite good.
I’m confident Babak will be good for Data 8
I think Sahai is purely a lecturer; he’s never made a piazza post or comment for Data 8 (Atleast from what I’ve seen) and it’s Wagner who comments/engages with the class/holds office hours. As a lecturer, Sahai is nice and good at explaining concepts clearly. Wagner is the one who wrote the super hard midterm so he explained that Sahai will write our final instead - who knows what that will be like.
Babak is an amazing professor. Take any class with him. Godsent teacher from heaven. Makes every Cal professor look mediocre or so bad.
Babak is a great guy and really good at teaching probability (I took 70 with him). Idk about the other prof tho.
[deleted]
Currently with Wagner and Sahai rn and they're both great - sans the hard midterm by Wagner but thats life yknow
Would you say they’re good professors for people who have no coding knowledge?
??? Wdym
Lol should I not take it
I would say S. Sahai is excellent for beginners.  Babak has been around for a while, usually teaches CS 70 and higher level classes, so not sure how he is with a beginning class but he generally is considered to be liked by students.
There is a very well known CS professor who well, to put it nicely, has super-high expectations from his students, named Anant Sahai.  The previous poster got mixed up with Swupnil Sahai.
Alright cool thanks:)
So does Data C8 not have a discussion section? And it has a lab instead? And does it require another day besides the lecture days? How are those?
Oh oh I see haha good to know
There’s a lab, no discussion section.  It’s a 2-hour once a week time slot.  This is where you do your assignments and project work.  There will be a separate sign up for the lab times, usually done a week or two before classes begin.
Oh I never had a class like that. So it’s basically just alotted time for you to do your own homework and not like a regular physics or Chem lab? Those r only types ive taken so far. Do you happen to know what happens if you end up having a time conflict w all of the available lab time slots?
Well there’s a bit more to the lab I’m pretty sure.  Can’t remember if this is a lab where someone needs to check off your work, probably not.  There’s going to be at least 30 lab times, so I guarantee you that you’ll find a free slot somewhere.
I took it last Fall, so idk if anything changed. Basically there was a discussion section with a worksheet at the beginning and then lab for the rest of the time. You could work on the lab and get it checked off, then you were free to go home. If you did the lab before a certain day, you didn't have to go to the actual section and get it checked off. You could also do hw, projects, and other stuff during the lab and get help on them.

If you are new to coding, I think it is a great experience to go to them. Honestly the coding in Data 8 is not overly complicated. The stats stuff is a bit harder. I think you'll do great (especially since you care enough to reach out and ask these questions)! :)

Feel free to ask if you have more questions.
(Current data 8 student) 
Lab is basically a second weekly homework that you can either complete (passing all tests) by Wed morning or work on during your scheduled lab section (1.5 hours long) sometime Wed-Fri. Attendance isn’t mandatory if you’ve already completed before 9am Wed. If you don’t show up or complete it by then you don’t get credit for that week’s lab assignment. 

There is discussion at some point during the week (which you sign up for, your section depends on whether you have previous stats/coding knowledge) that is only 30 minutes in which you complete that week’s discussion worksheet. Attendance is taken every week. 

This class imo isn’t “skipping friendly” cause it’s hard to get credit for these things if you don’t show up.
Okay cool. Thanks so much for answering my bajillion questions I appreciate it :) have a good week
Oh cool. Do you have lab partners in it?
Do you find yourself getting overwhelmed a lot by the class pace
Btw is attendance mandatory to the lectures? Cuz I have a time conflict with spring’s Data C8 class. I was hoping data 8 was recorded so that I could attend the other class live
Oh wow ok that’s actually a lot more than what I was expecting... so the 30 min discussion is separate from the lab day  ? Damn . So lecture days+ lab days+ discussion days+OHs... hm
This class sound like a lot of work lmao like more than I was expecting
Sorry to ask this tedious Q but are the discussions and lab days mostly on Tues&Thursdays or r they just all over the weekdays? I wanna know so I can plan how I organize my schedule for next sem. And do they upload lectures within a day?
I think you are allowed to do it with a lab partner (might be misremembering). I always did it solo since I mostly did them at home, but if you are a collaborative learner that is an option.
Definitely, but as someone who is new to coding, the fact I have it 4 times a week is helpful for retention & learning. If I was already familiar with python and statistics it would feel much more tedious.
Attendance for lectures isn’t mandatory. But discussions are, and lab is graded by either completion by 9am Wed or getting checked off on your lab section (sometime wed-fri)
Okay thank you!!!
Fckkk that makes me feel better but worse all at the same time haha. I also have 0 coding experience and 0 stats knowledge. Idk if I should take it..:/
I guess I’m just scared to take it cuz ik I fall behind in lectures and crap like every single semester
Do you personally recommend being able to go to lectures live? Or do you feel like it’s rlly the same if u just watch the recorded lectures
I like live lectures because I can ask them questions/clarifications in real time about what they’re teaching. The GSIs who attend respond to everyone, it’s really helpful imo. But other than that you won’t be missing out if you watch them later on. It might be hard to stay engaged though especially if you aren’t familiar with coding or stats."
Advice for what UD classes to complete before graduating for an EE/Hardware career,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8vpfq/advice_for_what_ud_classes_to_complete_before/,2022-04-21 12:39:06,"So I guess this would be a follow-up post to my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice\_for\_ee\_classes\_for\_fall\_and\_spring\_2022/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice_for_ee_classes_for_fall_and_spring_2022/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So here is my current plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

105 with Ali M Niknejad - 4 units

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123, 130 and 189

&#x200B;

Replies from original posts mentioned that the workload for Fall might be too crazy.

And so I have an alternative plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123 and 189

&#x200B;

So it all boils down to if I graduate finishing 5 UD classes (120, 123, 151, 188, and 189). Would this be a good set of classes to take for an EE/hardware job?

If not then I'm forced to go with the first plan and finish 7 UD classes (105, 120, 123, 130, 151, 188, and 189) and suffer for 2 semesters.

&#x200B;

 Thanks for the help!","Don’t take 188. Useless for your career goals and imo pointless to take in general. 

Taking 120/151 are a must. Simply putting 151 on my resume got me interviews from top hardware companies.

If you’re up for it you could squeeze one of 126/127 (I liked 127 better)
Since I’m not an analog hardware engineer maybe I shouldn’t comment, but if you’re interested in that kind of work I would almost suggest using summer to self study 105 and taking 140 next fall instead. I’ve heard that 105 is a good class but won’t get you any job interviews by itself. 120/140/151 will be a heavy workload but if you truly have a passion for these things I think you’ll learn a lot and have fun.
Thank you for your reply! Does it matter if I take 105 and 130 for hardware? Does having them benefit a lot? Does not having them hurt? I'm for sure taking 120, 123, and 151 just not sure about 105 and 130."
Which is easier: CS70 or Math 55?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ep684e/which_is_easier_cs70_or_math_55/,2020-01-15 10:33:39,"I'm a Cogsci major and am not really a fan of math. I heard Math 55 is easier but I also read the teacher this semester is not the best.

Math 55 is with Olga V. Holtz and CS70 is with [Babak Ayazifar](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/ayazifar.html), [Doug Tygar](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/tygar.html).","Math 55 is known to be easier because they exclude various non discrete math topics covered in 70 like RSA, computability, etc
Don't know much about the instructors, but regardless of that, Math 55 will almost certainly be much easier. The class covers a smaller range of topics, in less detail. For comparison, people usually many hours (like 10+) on each week's homework for CS 70, where 55 is probably a few hours at most. Also, in CS 70 you'll be with a lot of intended CS majors who are very worried about meeting their GPA cap and so forth.

All that said, I should say that I found Math 55 to be pretty unfulfilling (and frankly a little boring) and probably would have rather taken 70. If you care about learning the material in significantly more depth, I would recommend that. But if you don't care much about math-y stuff and just want to fulfill your Cogsci pre-reqs, Math 55 will be the way to go.
Definitely 55. 70 covers a lot more material and goes much more in depth in a shorter amount of time (so we can spend the rest of the time for probability theory). Also the class has a lot of CS intended students who care about their GPA so the curve might be a bit tougher. I recall looking through math 55 homework and exams from my friend and seeing the difference in the level of difficulty from questions in 70.
Holtz is a great professor but is not going to be easy if you're not a fan of math.  I would say 55 will likely be more difficult than 70 this semester in terms of mathematical difficulty, based on my experience with Holtz's 55.  I'd probably recommend taking Math 55 in the Fall if you can wait a semester, because both classes probably will be relatively painful.  

I would take most of the advice you hear with a grain of salt because even if 55 is ""easier"" on average it also varies much more.  CS 70 is consistent in that it isn't usually taught very well from a mathematical pedagogy perspective.
I took 110 with Holtz and would guess Math 55 with Holtz will be similar in difficulty to CS70
No idea who you took 55 with but I did very well in Holtz's last time teaching 55 and easily spent more than 10 hours on the homeworks each week, they were very difficult usually.  But they were very fun and I learned a lot from them!
Classes are what you make of them. its quite possible you would have had to spend 1.5x the amount of time you did in math 55 than cs 70 to do well in the latter.
Maybe it's possible but I'm fairly certain it's not since Math 55 was also much more work than many of my math upper divs (for my level of mathematical maturity at the time of course) and Holtz's problem sets consistently had problems which were just objectively more difficult than those you'd find on a CS70 pset.  There were IMO level problems occasionally.  Maybe the grading was less harsh?  I don't know."

Yeah agree fall 2022 sounds tough
[deleted]
I see, since I was planning to P/NP 1 class per sem so maybe P/NP 105 for Fall (only need 20 UD units to graduate). Do you think this is a good idea (since I only have a year left)?
Yeah, I tried to fit 105 & 130 in there. Another option would be 120 & 151 for Fall and 123 and 189 for Spring.

Either way, I'm enrolling in the above classes and maybe tweak (P/NP or drop a class) as the semester goes.
I decided to do the following for now:

188->189  
120->123  
151

I decided to not take 105 and 140 to allow myself to really understand 120 and 151 which seem like the two most important classes according to a lot of people!

If I want to go into DSP, do you think it hurts if I don't take 105 and 140, or does it not really matter in the long run? What about Hardware companies in general?"
New Schedule Draft is out for Fa22,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rvkrew/new_schedule_draft_is_out_for_fa22/,2022-01-03 19:47:26,"Link: [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html)

Interesting stuff I noted was

* CS 61A being taught by Professor P. Fox herself, which is great to see! I guess this means Denero is off in the data science dept, maybe there's news for data8/data100 there as well?
* Professor Hug back in 61b, i wonder if he will continue to teach gitlet so early in the semester if at all, I wonder who will be teaching data 100 then...
* New faculty hire in Lisa Yan (not completely new as they are teaching data100 with Prof Hug this spring [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001)),
* Professor Ranade teaching 16b and 127 (which a LOT of people were waiting for),
* Michael Ball teaching 375,
* Professor Popa in 261 (which is completely unrelated from CS 161 which is taught by Nick Weaver -- kinda a shame as I wanted to see him branch out and teach some other classes (61b with Nick sounds fun lol, may make it redesigned in golang though XD, same with 162) but I understand that 161 being offered every semester is important to it being persisted and I'm sure fa22 161 students are overjoyed at the news lol)
* and Professor Rao in CS 70 again also was great to see as they are very familiar at teaching those areas.
* On that note Professor Babak Ayazifar will be teaching both CS 70 and EE 120 per [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html) which is great news for anyone who couldn't get in this semester!
* Professor Chasins teaching CS 164 again, seems like a return for OCaml and a tearful goodbye to Hilfinger's ChocoPy (btw where is Hilfinger on here?? I hope he hasn't retired...).
* CS 168 finally being offered although CS 160 is not offered (not an issue since it's usually there in summers),
* Professor A. Sahai teaching  CS 182 (seems like we'll get another bio-focused 189 since he's not there but him teaching a PyTorch class (altho 182 is clearly more than that) falls in line with what I saw in eecs16b),
* 186 being completely online even with everything hopefully back in-person. I guess it will be CS W186 then?
* No CS 188, though if it happens, Russell and D. Song are my guesses for the professors if they get the funding for that to go through and Abbeel still isn't able to teach it.
* As well as a return of a few 194s (I heard a few more are planned yet to be listed though such as Dawn Song's DeFi CS 194/294-177).

Keep in mind this is still a draft so changes can be made, but thoughts?","Lisa Yan was a lecturer at Stanford for a couple of years. She has a PhD in CS education (also from Stanford) and is an excellent instructor overall. Hug and Yan should be nothing short of the teaching dream team.
Holy shit they resurrected 168 from the grave
It is unlikely that I will do gitlet at all. As much as some students love it, it has relatively poor synergy with the course material, and I also personally find it a bit boring (sorry Joey! It is a **great** project, just not my style). But I'll review all the course evaluations over the summer to decide whether to keep it or not.
goated, thnx for the update
From what I've seen, CS 160 is planned for the spring next year.
182 is more of an applications class.  Wonder how Sahai will approach it.  Hopefully they offer it in the spring with another professor in case he makes it theory intensive.
Ranade and P. Fox, we love to see it
Oh I so want to teach other classes.  But 161 is one of the classes we’ve scaled to meet demand (500+/semester).  The only way to maintain that is run the class every semester.  I’d really like to do 162/redo-162-project-as-194/162 as a sequence.
Good to see 176 back, though Prof Yosef isn’t teaching it.  But since Prof Ioannidis is so involved on the comp bio end, she a good replacement.
Gonna take 182 with my favorite prof
who's pamela fox?
and also what has dan garcia been doing i haven't heard of him since his 61c semester in the first semester of online
damn 176 seems like a really cool class. Doubt I'll get in though. Are prerequisites usually enforced for CS classes?
[deleted]
I miss Ranade
SO happy about babak teaching 120!!
182 is taught in pytorch, not tensorflow
hmm does this mean Shewchuck is not teaching 189 this semester?
Just to clarify, who is teaching 189 in Fa 22?
I'm really interested in 168, but since it's scarcely offered, does anyone know whether it's a difficult class to get into? I'll be a senior then, so i should have a decent slot all things considering
No 188 either.
Is 162 a preq for 168? I’m seeing conflicting info on different sites
I would recommend Demmel/Nelson cs170. I took Jelani Nelson's cs170 and enjoyed his teaching style very much. It's a hard class, don’t get me wrong, but it was all worth it.
Yes, Prof. Hilfinger is retiring. His last lecture is tomorrow 4/29 at 1pm in 155 Dwinelle.
omg you just made me remember that Lisa Yan was the one i was referring to in [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)   


I'm glad she finally decided to leave Stanfurd for Cal, go bears!
Let's just hope there exist enough TAs out there for the class to be a normal upperdivision size now...
Any thoughts on the lack of a fall offering for its future? Dyt it doesn’t matter as much as other classes because of summer + is cs160 usually a “fall xor spring” class?

I didn’t mention stuff like 270 not appearing for that reason (it’s biyearly spring only)!
I actually have the opposite viewpoint: Marvin Zhang's 182 appears to be less application-focused than past iterations (the usual final project is now a final exam being the main point, until the course site comes out not much more to say on the matter). I hope Sahai recognizes the power of PyTorch and brings back an application-based final project, as he did when introducing those notebooks into 16b. Marvin Zhang making DS 189 Listgarten/Malik-theory oriented instead of Shewchuk application-oriented is another example of how he prefers theory but we will have to wait and see what actually happens this spring (note that this makes sense for DS as many of those students are double majoring in a subject like biology so listgarten's version does make more sense to offer to DS students).

However, you very well could be correct. Maybe Sahai will make it even more theory intensive as that's always a possibility. The fact that NNs need big data makes me hope a deep NN class would be very application-based but if Sahai ruins it then we always have Levine's [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL\_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A) to lean back on and audit... definitely not the same though :(
Yeah I’m sure other universities would also love seeing a Rust OS project on the scale of pintos 👀

After all Berkeley did take inspiration from Stanford, this could be a chance for Berkeley to give back and help lead education in that sector!
hopefully me and you both survive through bestie 😵‍💫
Pamela Fox is a new lecturer who has taught 61a alongside DeNero and Hilfinger in the past alongside some other classes (she was a CS 302 co-lecturer last spring, the class for summer instructors, maybe 169 as well iirc but i have a shaky memory there and the other Professor Fox teaches that so I very well could be confounding the two).

I talked to her once about the work she did at Khan Academy on their CS curricula (which I actually used as a kid growing up)  as well as some stuff she did on Coursera. She's done *a* *lot* for 61a these past few semesters and I'm interested in seeing how she changes the course as it's a course that has been evolving a lot recently with SQL → Regex → BNF etc, as well as an A+ project and new additions from when I took it! I can tell she cares about teaching a lot and have had heard good things about people who took 61a with her though she came just after my time... I took 61a in su20 haha.

And I think Dan was on sabbatical.
usually not
yeah and we could also use those profs to teach grad classes like 286, does 186 still use Hellerstein's lectures lol?
well now she's back from her leave and teaching 2 classes at that :)
yeah, usually he teaches 120 in the spring only, this is quite a surprise IMO but a pleasant one at that!
yeah... i think i misremembered because it was pytorch that Prof Sahai introduced into eecs16b this semester (which is what i referred to), i think i just typed the wrong thing, ill edit it, thanks!
He is for spring 22, the above is for fall 22 which is after sp22.
Also note that Shewchuk is only teaching CS 189, DS 189 will be taught by Marvin Zhang
NVM: Listgarten and Malik
prolly will be. but i think most seniors will get into it. i doubt any juniors will get in. Depends on how big the class is also, if its around 500, itll be fine but if its < 300, then big yikes
FWIW there were 500 seats last time it was offered [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001)
it's not, that's an old prereq
and she can also teach CS 168 in the future so this is incredibly based
BTW, Lisa Yan also did her undergrad at Cal, which is doubly awesome
Prof. Fox co-taught 169 this past semester. I didn’t love the class (more specifically, I absolutely hated it), but its failings weren’t her fault and she clearly has a passion and a great talent for teaching CS. It’ll be cool to see her teach a class that isn’t buzzwordy garbage!
that's good. Still don't think i'll get in though since I'm not a cs major and I imagine seats are reserved T_T.  thank you for the answer!
[deleted]
Oop you're right my apologies.

Wait, 182 is being offered Fa22?! Let's goo!
ya but there were more TAs back then since 168 was offered once a year. Its been 2.5 years since, so there will be a lack TAs along with the fact that the budget is less
Thank you
yeh as i said above, havent taken a class with her so everything above was second-hand anecdotal. Though i bumped into her in Soda a couple of times and she was a nice person to talk to. Am also a huge fan of her work at Khan Academy. I think she'll do good things with 61a though i thought it was a great class as is when i took it (doesn't mean that it cant improve ofc).
if you phase 1, and wait it out then who knows
:o isn’t that the first live lec 186 in awhile? Is this confirmed or could this still change, might have to sign up for it if so
Yeah that’s also usually a spring-only class, I was surprised to see it there… I also think this is  Prof A. Sahai’s first time teaching it, should be an interesting experience
yeah ive been worrying about that myself tbh"
"Course Reviews Fall 2021 (CS 70, DATA 100, PHYSICS 7B, ETHSTD 175)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ronadp/course_reviews_fall_2021_cs_70_data_100_physics/,2021-12-25 18:34:25,"Hopefully this is helpful for anyone planning to take these classes in the future.

CS 70 (Satish Rao, Babak Ayazifar) [Rating: 6/10]
- Not my favorite course, but honestly nothing terrible about it either
- The content you learn is relatively useful
- Notes are very dense and hard to digest, but if you understand them you will do well
- Rao was okay at lecturing, active on Piazza, down to earth
- Ayazifar was a good lecturer, seemed passionate about teaching and made it interesting
- Homeworks were very long, ruined almost all of my Fridays/Saturdays
- You will do well if you put enough time into the class, but the amount of time it takes might not be worth it to some people
- How to do well: do past exams, be up-to-date on lectures, go to discussions to put concepts into practice
- Workload: 10-20 hours/week

DATA 100 (Fernando Perez, Alvin Wan) [Rating: 2/10]
- I really wanted to like this course: it went from being my favorite class this semester to being the worst class I have ever taken
- The content you learn is very practical and useful
- The lack of effort put into refreshing the recycled lectures was disheartening, but the lectures were otherwise good and not hard to follow
- Labs were well-written and generally useful
- Homeworks were still useful but not as well-written
- Discussions felt like a waste of time to me, basically a rehash of lecture but worse and the worksheets did not teach me much
- The midterm was @#$% and not at all representative of how well you learned the material
- The final project experience really depends on your group, I personally had to work way harder because of some group members who contributed nearly nothing
- How to do well: the reason the class sucked this semester is because you could understand the material perfectly well, work hard, and still get a bad grade. I personally ended up with a good grade, but sunk so much time into the final project that I didn't have time to study for my other classes. My recommendation is to take this course with a professor that probably cares more (e.g. Hug in Spring 2022)
- Workload: 8 hours/week normally, 25 hours/week during final project

PHYSICS 7B (Robert Birgeneau) [Rating: 2/10]
- Another one of my least favorite courses
- You don't learn much relevant material in this course (at least for computer science)
- Birgeneau seemed like a nice, well-intentioned professor, but unfortunately the lectures were almost useless in preparing you for exams
- Out of the 180-200 people enrolled in the class, only about 10 showed up to lecture near the end of the semester
- They sent out a survey for feedback on lectures since attendance was low, but there were only about 2 weeks of classes left, so this was quite insulting
- Discussions were also relatively useless if you didn't already understand the material—most people I knew only showed up to get the bonus points for attending >50% of discussions
- Labs were the most engaging part of the class for me and taught useful concepts, but there were only 4 and they did not help me prepare for exams
- Homeworks could have been useful for preparing for exams, but I was more concerned about getting a good grade since getting anything wrong lost points
- Exams tested nothing conceptual—the best way I can put it is that they were a test of how well you could memorize formulas and perform calculus calculations
- How to do well: the class was as close to a textbook as you could get. Read the textbook thoroughly, especially when it shows derivations. Do the example problems in each section because these will often show up on the exams
- Workload: 8-12 hours/week (depends on how long you spend on the textbook, whether there is an upcoming lab or exam)

ETHSTD 175 (Greg Choy) [Rating: 9/10]
- I liked this class a lot, it was refreshing compared to the rest of my classes this semester
- You learn about a lot of history and literature that you probably know/have heard/wouldn't be surprised about, but that you probably haven't discussed before
- Choy was a great lecturer, and super reasonable in his approach to teaching
- There are no assignments besides reading (which is quite heavy, but you could honestly get away with some light skimming)
- The ""midterms"" were super chill, could usually work in groups and were basically short essays that you had a week to work on
- The great thing about this class is that it's more concerned with you learning something than with scoring you—I learned even while writing and discussing the exam questions with my group and you can't really say that for many other classes
- There was an end-of-semester poetry presentation where you/your group gets to be the lecturer for ~30 min
- How to do well: just attend and pay attention in all lectures, take notes, do the readings and you will definitely do well. That being said, you get out of the class as much as you put in, so you may also want to participate by asking questions, discussing during class, etc.
- Workload: 6-12 hours/week (depends on what readings are assigned and how thoroughly you read them)","Yo its Christmas. Take a load off from thinking about school work and spend time with friends and family if you can. You deserve it!
how was the data 100 midterm different from expectations? was it drastically different from past midterms? what was the avg
Should I push CS 70 back to my junior fall? I’m planning on taking it this summer so I can declare before junior fall
The midterm was half on ML when the class spent maybe 1-2 lectures and 1/3 of a lab on it.
Average was 38/85. High was also 71/85. Also consider most of these kids have cs experience. Most bs midterm I've ever taken."
How manageable is this freshman BioE schedule?,https://i.redd.it/52r7ciwgvhkb1.jpg,2023-08-26 11:04:23,"17 units, but 2 classes are both 1 unit seminar classes, so 15 units","seminars are always chill, and 15 units is fairly manageable. that being said i’m not in stem so idk how well my advice transfers here lol. good luck!
Pretty good and balanced 👍!"
