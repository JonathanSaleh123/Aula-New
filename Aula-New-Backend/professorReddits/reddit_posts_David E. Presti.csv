Classes / professors that you enjoyed just sitting and listening to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17b3ntp/classes_professors_that_you_enjoyed_just_sitting/,2023-10-18 15:44:51,"For example, a few:

**Drugs and the Brain - David Presti**

**GEOG10AC (Worldings: Regions, Peoples and States) - Jon Kosek**

These were classes where most lectures I could just sit and enjoy the fascinating lecture delivered by a great and engaging speaker. Anyone have any other recommendations?","Davina Chan - Neuropsychology of Happiness  
She is an amazing professor and you can tell she loves teaching. Her slides are very detailed so there isn't any need to take notes, you can just sit in class and enjoy. That class transformed my life for real because of who the professor was, and it is the best class I've taken at Cal. I may not have believed in the power of mindfulness and meditation if it wasn't for the knowledge this class empowered me with.

&#x200B;

John Campbell - Philosophy of Mind.

I kind of think of his lectures like listening to a very interesting podcast and each week is a different episode of the general topic of philosophy of mind. He is Scottish so the way he speaks is very engaging, funny, and extremely knowledgable. You don't even need to take notes for the class, slides have minimal information because he mostly just wants to invite the class to have a discussion during lecture. It does help to do the readings of the week during the week as you go.  
The class explores free will and determinism through the compatibilist and incompatibilist views (Benjamin Libet), what we can say about moral responsibility and free will through first-order and second-order desires (Harry Frankfurt), the way we imagine transformative experiences (Laurie Paul), Locke's claim that what makes a person the same person over time is the psychological continuity of memory and consciousness, Descartes on the soul, functionalism, qualia, etc. He really brings you up to speed on the state-of-the-art literature on where the mind body problem is.
Anything by Laleh Behbehanian
John Campbell for PHILOS 3A he’s such an awesome guy you just can’t help but love him
Any class with Zook! I was a poli sci major with 0 interest in international relations, but I took every class I could with Zook and loved all of them!
Asad Ahmed - melc 180 or melc 146. Theres no hw, just two essays and the midterm and final. Great courses if you are interested in studying religion. His voice is calming as well.
Ryan Edwards
global 173 - darren zook
also i loved charles Marshall’s section of bio 1b but it is very content heavy
UGAB 192-T, Edible Education with Professor Will Rosenzweig. Great class!
Paulin Math 54
SOCIOL113AC with Professor Hurtubise. A really well spoken and inspirational man! After every lecture, the majority of the class applauded him (at least when I took it this summer). Highly recommend!
Are you a psych major? Neuropsychology of happiness looks great, but looks like it is only open to psych majors"
NEED ADVICE MCB MAJOR! MCELLBI C62 or MCB 132,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wd1exc/need_advice_mcb_major_mcellbi_c62_or_mcb_132/,2022-07-31 15:55:13,"Hi I am currently a rising sophomore (MCB + data minor), and I am trying to decide on a class to take in my Fall semester. I'm deciding between MCELLBI C62 - drugs and the brain with David Presti or MCB 132 - biology of human cancer with Iswar Krishna Hariharan- both from what I have heard, are amazing professors. I will be taking CHEM3B, CHEM3BL, and physics 8A at the same time. Since I didn't get into an R1B, I want to do a bio class instead.

**MCELLBI C62** \- I am really interested in this class and have always wanted to explore neuroscience and psychedelics a bit more. It is also an easy A so a GPA booster class is always a plus. However, this class does not add to my major in any way. I simply wanted to talk to prof Presti and I think I can explore this side of bio by myself.

**MCB 132** \- After taking Bio1A over the summer, I am really interested in pathogenesis and cancer research, so in terms of content, I would prefer this class. It is an MCB elective class so one less class to take in the future. I really want to learn from this professor as well but will it be too much work considering the other classes I am taking? Is it a bad idea to take an elective as a rising sophomore because at the end of the day I still want to do well in this class and hopefully get an A.

They're both offered at the same time and only in the Fall semester. I am siding towards MCB 132 right now but, again, will it be too much work?

&#x200B;

**Edit: Ended up taking MCELLBI C62 to not stress myself out too much since I will also be joining clubs and decals.**","MCB senior here, I would advise starting with the lower div elective while you still are taking your chem and physics, just a lot of work for those classes. Set yourself up for success, you can always take 132 next Fall when you don’t have such high workload classes.
[deleted]
nothing wrong with taking an upper div elective as a sophomore, but also not sure what the 132 workload is like. I think if you take it, you will have a full schedule and a lot of work but it should be okay if you’ve done well in stem classes thus far
Yea, the concern is that MCELLBI C62 isn't a lower div elective (as far as I know I don't think any of the MCB electives are lower div). It's just a class I was interested in, so it doesn't actually add anything to my major- so I'm worried it's just a waste of a class which is why I started considering MCB132 which actually is an elective and will help me out in terms of fitting all my major requirements into the 4 years.
I am a rising junior and decided to take MCB 102 next semester cause I am taking physics 8B and MCB 104 so I want to spread out my classes... fingers crossed we do not get dropped
Hey so I ended up taking MCELLBI C62 instead because I didn't want to add more hard classes on top of physics 8a and chem3b/l.
if you plan well, you should have plenty of space in 4 years to take things you’re interested in. no rush for 132, do it because you really want to. In my opinion the MCB major (with no double major/minor) can be finished in 3-3.5 years without significant overloading, so you should have a semester or two of space to work in extra classes.
oh sorry, I forgot to add that I was planning on doing a data minor"
"Fall Schedule, Incoming Sophomore",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ukpkto/fall_schedule_incoming_sophomore/,2022-05-07 16:53:02,"Deciding between CS + BioE minor or CS + Data Sci double major (comp bio emphasis). Any advice on which schedule to take? I need a B- in 70 to declare cs.

I really want to take a few MCB upper divs, so I do need to take Bio 1A (also for the Data Sci domain emphasis). I'd need Chem 3A only for the BioE minor (not very sure about this yet).

I don't have any prior discrete math experience. 

1. CS 70 + (EECS 16B/Math 54???) + Ling 100 + MCB C62
2. CS 70 + Ling 100 + Bio 1A/L
3. CS 70 + Ling 100 + Bio 1A + Music 139
4. CS 70 + Chem 3A w Robak(no lab) + Ling 100 + (Music 139/MCB C62 ??))

Enroled in 70 (Rao & Ayazifar), 100 (Jenks) and C62 (Presti) during Phase 1. Ty!!","If you’re going to take Chem 3A at some point, take it in the fall because Robak is a much better professor than Vollhardt
CS/DS with comp bio DE guy here.  I happened to have taken MV Calc in HS at a CC, so that counted for my lower division emphasis class (articulation to Math 53).  I had a 5 in AP Bio, so theoretically I had subject credit for Bio 1A/B, but DS would not take that.  I don’t think you really need much Bio background tbh, you can study up on DNA and cell theory on your own IMO.  It’s much more CS, math and stats leaning.  As for my uppers, I took CS 176 which was a pretty difficult class but I worked really hard in that class (I’m usually very lazy) and got a great grade.  I also took BioE 145 which was somewhat a waste of time as it’s a subset of CS 189 with some bio twists to it, very easy class, but don’t recommend it.  Do grab the classes as soon as you can, most if not all of the classes for the upper division DE are only offered once a year, if that.

I would do CS/DS mainly for the purposes of taking extra CS classes. For me, I only took about 2 classes that I personally wouldn’t have taken has I been only a CS single major - Data 8, the ethics class, and perhaps this BioE 145 class. And even the ethics class was sort of worth it since it doubled as a history breadth. So it was worth the double for me.
Ooh thank you so much!! I took IB Bio HL but didn't get credit for that, so i do have to take bio 1a unfortunately :(( 

For the domain emphasis, are there any other upper-division classes you were considering taking? I was interested in BioE 145 but if it's a repeat of 189 it's probably not worth it, yeah.
BioE 131 is a intro course into CompBio.  I couldn’t fit it into my sched, but I heard it was a very intro class and It didn’t sound like I missed much.  The CMPBio 156 class  on Human Genomes sounded very interesting, but similarly I could not fit it in my schedule as I had a time conflict as well.

FWIW, all the profs for these classes I mentioned (Holmes BioE 131, Lareau BioE 145, Yosef CS 176, and Barcellos CmpBio 156 are all very prominent computation biology and/or epidemiology researchers, and getting in good with one of them could be a great way of connecting in with research.  I mention this kinda as a missed opportunity for myself, as whatever research I did (with Hug) was fairly limited and subject to so much competition for limited research opportunities on the CS/DS side.  All the classes are small, around 50 students, so you’ll get to know the profs for sure."

So are there politics behind the power shutoff in the East Bay?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dfrddj/so_are_there_politics_behind_the_power_shutoff_in/,2019-10-09 19:13:58,"Trying to find out what is going on behind the scenes, without having to listen to 2000 tin foil hat conspiracies, can be difficult around here. (Berkeley)  
I do know that the man heading PG&E, William D  Johnson (Acting CEO) once headed the Tennessee Valley Association. and was voted off the board of two separate energy companies.

* David S. Thomason (Vice President & Controller)
* Forrest E. Miller (Chairman of the Board)
* Nickolas Stavropoulos (President & COO)
* David S. Thomaso (Vice President & CFO)  


Other then the claim that there are ""high winds"" (there are not currently high winds in the east bay) could there be other political or financial reasons for the power shutoff?  
Just wondering.   
THanks.  
MB","Its priming the bay area and softening the masses so that when the Chinese & North Korean amphibious assault craft hit the beaches we'll all be concerned with Traders Joe's being open or not
More like additional lawsuit prevention.
Uh its way more than the bay, it's a huge part of central and northern California due to the heavy fire risk of shitty infrastructure + unkept brush. The East Bay has been barely affected by the power shutoffs as well.
Your guys' explanations all fall short, and I am certain you are part of the coverup, since I have it on good authority that this is an Illuminati plot to sell us as tasty snacks to  shape-shifting lizards  from the fourth dimension. Rosewell! Rosewell!  
Lol. But seriously. thanks guys. After last year it makes sense, especially with the lawsuits. That's a first, and a lot of us felt something new was in play, and that is it.  
THanks.

Just because they aren’t high winds right now doesn’t mean there won’t be. Current forecasts predict heavy winds tonight.
Why are you complaining? This is good for climate justice. California is leading the way with this.
Nah, the area 51 raids already proved that one wrong  The reptillians and 4th D'ers  just wanna do butt stuff
That's why I found it odd. It stands out.   
There's been periodic heavy winds in the late summer for my entire life around here, and the last wildfire we had was the Oakland Hills fire, (1991. I was there) and they've never shut off the power like this before.
Why? Obviously the threat of my air fryer not finishing my whole foods Foie gras nacho fries, in time to watch netflix with my new bluetooth headphones, and order a cafe latte in the morning from door dash, was far more than my weary soul could bear. Wait....wait... you're triggering me!   
Lol.
So THAT'S what all this ""storm area 51"" stuff is about! 

Everyone just wants to get all freeky deeky with with E.T. Typical californians. Always looking for a reason to party.  
What's that address again?
2018 was the worst wild fire year in recorded history, there were several large wildfires, paradise wasn’t even the largest one. The one in Butte county was the deadliest. The one in Sonoma county that burnt entire neighborhoods down is thought to have been caused in some way by PG&E, they’re facing like $18 billion in damages for it. I also believe the government of California threatened them in some way that is making them even more paranoid and cautious about any fire happening that can in any way be blamed on them.
It's basically just precautionary after what happened in Paradise last year.
PG&E hasn't been properly maintaining their lines for years. The 2017 fires was the first time it really came back to haunt them. Now they're bankrupt and facing billions of dollars in lawsuits while still failing to maintain their lines. They know their infrastructure is shit and they recently found out that they can get in trouble for it. PG&E shut off the power because they know how poorly maintained their infrastructure is and don't want anymore lawsuits. 
They need to be broken up.
Dunno, I was in Mexico recruiting midgets at the time, didn't get the info
Straight up information you guys. Thanks!"

Advice on Spring 2021 Course Schedule + Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jg65ml/advice_on_spring_2021_course_schedule_professors/,2020-10-22 12:05:17,"I’m a freshman and am trying to transfer to COE for either MechE or CivE. I looked on rate my prof and there were some professors that had ratings and some that didn’t show up. Some of the ratings were for other classes the professor taught so I’m not sure if it all applies. If you have any advice on this schedule or the professors teaching these courses or the courses in general please let me know.

  - French R1B (Trevor Sanders)
 
  - Italian R5B (Mia Fuller) 
 
  - Asian American Studies R2B (David Pham)
 
  - Environmental Design R3B 

TLDR: pls give experience with any of these profs/classes","I'm taking math 53 and chem 1a/1al right now. As far as I can say, chem 1a/1al is a bunch of busy work, that might not all be fun or engaging or interesting or even intellectually stimulating at times, but it really requires you to be on your feet at all times. To be successful in that class, you gotta just either know the material beforehand or just watch a bunch of youtube videos on the topics, either from khan and organic chem tutor. Nothing from lectures has helped me anyway. As for math, it's been ok. As long as you read the book and do the hw, you should be ok.
I took E26 with Youseffi and it's a somewhat low workload class, especially if you already have experience with CAD. If you don't have experience, then the labs may take you a bit longer to complete. I didn't have CAD experience and I found the labs somewhat ok after asking for help from my GSI and friends. There aren't any midterms/tests but the final was tough. People who do have CAD experience find the class fairly easy so it depends on your background. I recommend going to lab sections if you need help.
Ok, thank you!

I'm one of the officers for the ASUC-sponsored student group **eSports @ Berkeley**! Basically, we're a group of students that enjoys gaming and following eSports. We regularly organize Barcrafts, viewing parties, LANs, and various other events. Now that the school year is starting up again, we're looking for more gamers to get to know!

As of right now, we have a Starcraft 2 division (led by the oh-so-famous Conan ""EGSuppyRC"" Liu) and a League of Legends division. We're also considering adding more games if there's interest, with some talk already of DotA 2, CS:GO, and TF2.

What we can provide members is support in outside leagues as well as a large player base to play with. But most importantly, we're just a group of gamers that enjoy playing with other Golden Bears! You don't need to be a hardcore gamer to join either! We welcome anyone that has any remote interest in gaming or eSports to come hang out with us.

We're having our **first official event this Sunday, August 26th at Pappy's Bar and Grill.** It's a Barcraft, which is basically a gathering of people to watch competitive Starcraft 2. Two of our group's players are competiting in the event (Conan ""EGSuppyRC"" Liu and David ""MnMDayaL"" Lu), so come out and support them! There will also be a free giveaways at the event.

professors to take classes for fun with?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/831e4q/professors_to_take_classes_for_fun_with/,2018-03-08 13:57:56,"for fall 2018 does anyone have any recommendations for amazing professors to take classes with just to learn something cool
So far Ive heard of Data 8 with Adikari and Global 10A with Zook","[deleted]
Not even memeing, but 61B. Professor Hug is such an amazing guy
EA 109 with John Wallace - it's about the history of Tea in Eastern Asia. Interesting class, great professor.
Are you outdoorsy? Then I recommend PMB 113L with Prof. Tom Bruns. It's Mushrooms of California. You learn about mycology and go to the woods to pick mushrooms.
[deleted]
Drugs and the Brain with David Presti! He’s honestly the best and so insightful and I loved his class! I’m MCB so the actual bio material was kinda repetitive and basic but he’s worth it!!! Took a seminar with him and took this class last semester just to listen to him talk again :)
CS164 with Hilfinger
take 140 with adhikari
Chem 3A with Vollhardt, best prof ever 
I'm having a pretty great time with Fish in Polisci 2 right now. Dude delivers amazing lectures without a mic (booming voice), and he's done field studies everywhere from Russia to Nigeria - tons of interesting stuff to say. He's got a real genuine dedication to empiricism and evidence-based thinking that you don't see everywhere in the social sciences. I usually attend my lectures as little as possible, but I hate it when I have to miss his.
Rhetoric classes with Nasser. He's so sweet and intelligent, and really good at involving the class 
[deleted]
Anything with Sahai is amazing 
he's teaching data 100 next semester
So much this.
I was an MCB major, but I took this class for fun. Dr. Presti is great!
+1
This man has been terrorizing Cal students and ruining lives since the early 90's.

Chem 3A 1999, *Never forget*
The essays in ps2 are really hard though, the average scores would be like 12/20. But I agree the lectures were interesting.
How do you know? Are course lists already out?
He’s such a wholesome dude lol
Did they curve midterms when you took it? We’re getting results back this week and I’m a bit nervous.
I was MCB-CDB, so I didn't take his upper div course on neurochemistry, but I heard great things about it, too
Yea it was curved
Same! I’m immuno but I might take it just for the heck of it! "

## **First Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

> Also wondering about this since you'd think that the best CS program teaches CS much better than at other schools, or that maybe the best CS program has the best professors, or the most resources for its students. But do we really learn CS at Cal better than at some other UC? Are the professors here better at teaching than at other schools?
> 
> Sure, we have notable people on the faculty team, but does that really translate to having a CS program that's better than at other schools? Is the access to some of the best minds in the world really the thing that makes students' learning experience better here than at other UCs? Do other UCs not also have great faculty? 
> 
> Perhaps our high ranking is caused by the fact that this is a selective university (because a ton of students apply yet there's limited space) so naturally only the top performers get admitted, thereby making this university appear it has a good CS program even though it's merely the students who are top-notch as a whole, and can accomplish more, on average.
I'd like to draw a connection to elementary/middle/high schools in my neighborhood: some of them are known to be ""good schools"" because of high test scores or whatnot. So does that mean they are better at teaching? Are the teachers better there? Or is it just that these ""good schools"" are in better parts of town and so the students who attend these schools are more privileged and have the resources to focus on their education?
> 
> I think the same thing is happening at Cal and at any other university that receives a lot of applicants: There's limited space so only the top people (however you want to define it) are admitted. When you have a bunch of top people in a school, naturally it's better. Naturally, great achievements happen at that school. Naturally, more people want to apply because they hear about the school's achievements. Naturally, more professors want to apply. Naturally, the school only lets the top professors in. Naturally, those top students graduate and as a whole make more money. Naturally, those top-notch alumni can donate more money back to the school. Naturally, the school has more money to fund its amazing students and professors. Naturally, it's a ""great school"".
> 
> Now of course, this cycle has to start somewhere. I believe that it started because this university, and so many other ""top"" universities, are old and have had time to grow. And then when other universities pop up, naturally, prospective students are skeptical of them until they're established, and so prospective students naturally apply to established universities before they consider the newly created institutions. Naturally, this more established university has a lower admittance rate than newer universities. Naturally, a lower admittance rate gives off the vibe it's a better place, and naturally the university can only admit the top applicants who achieve more, on average, than students at less selective universities. And there, we're in that cycle.
> 
> Key realization: When ""top"" universities go around the county encouraging students to apply, it's not because they need to get their name out and convince students that they are good universities. They are already well known. Everyone already knows they're Ivy league or whatever. I believe it's mainly to get more people to apply so they can boast lower admittance rates. Because, come on now, you can't tell me you haven't looked at the admittance rate of a school to see ""how good"" it is.
> 
> I'm sure my opinion is not shared by all. I'm looking for further discussion and to possibly change my views on the matter :)

A student replied:

> OP here - thank you for your thoughts. I have to disagree that our CS program is prestigious due to our low admit rate. Berkeley admits 17% of applicants each year, which is far higher than any Ivy League school or Caltech/Stanford/MIT.
> 
> Yet Berkeley is said to be better at CS than all but two of those schools. In fact, the only reason people think these other schools are more prestigious than Berkeley is because they have lower acceptance rates. If Berkeley cut its admit rate one year, Berkeley wouldn't be a safety school to top achievers - it would be the goal. 
> 
> I think Berkeley is so highly ranked due to our accomplishments. You can't deny what this school has accomplished. We've made major advances in every field. And that overrides our high acceptance rate to make us a top school.
> 
> By the way, I'm not saying Berkeley should cut its acceptance rate to boost its prestige. It would work, but it's contrary to our goals as a public school. I'm saying that admit rate does affect prestige - people will always be impressed more by what they can't have.

A student wrote:

> Berkeley still has low admission rates compared to all or almost all the other UCs. Not to mention that it has low admission rates compared to other schools around the country. So Cal and many of the Ivy Leagues and UCLA, Stanford, and CalTech are also said to have good CS programs -- and they all have low admission rates. It seems that almost every school that has a ""good CS program"" has a low admission rate. No? So for the most part, I'd say that schools with a ""good CS program"" admit only the top students.
> 
> Still, I'm wondering: What do Berkeley's achievements in CS have to do with the quality of the CS program? Achievements don't give any information about how well students learn CS, right? What does it mean for a program to ""good""? I know magazines and news outlets like to come out with their rankings every year--but are they really legit? Do they really know which school is better? 

A student replied:

A student wrote:

Not all rankings are meaningless, and even the most questionable ranking system probably has some truth in it. Its not logical to just dismiss these rankings because its unclear exactly how they measure a school's quality. I'm also curious why you think these notions are ""baseless"" and ""evidence-less.""

Trying to then give an ordering to the schools where there is a best school and a second best school, and so on is such an empty? futile? subjective? venture. If you look at US news's rankings today you see that princeton is in first place and harvard is in second place. Are you convinced princeton is a better school than harvard? If you go to harvard will you think that you're not getting the best <any of the qualities that make a good school, good> as you would have received at princeton?
How about if you go to the 3rd place school?...honestly, would you feel that had you gotten into a school higher on the list, then you'd have gone to a ""better"" university? Can you honestly say that your education would have been better if you had gone to a ""better"" school?
> 
> I don't buy it. I don't see any truth in princeton being better than harvard or being better than Cal. It's just another school. And after all, we're each in only one or two or three majors. These rankings are for the school as a whole. I wouldn't trust them to tell me anything about the quality of my education.

> Or fine, let's look at the CS program rankings: https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/computer-science
> 
> So if I got into the #1 university I'll get a better CS education than if I had gone to #5 or #7 on the list? Really? I don't buy it. That's why I believe their rankings can be dismissed. Now of course, you wouldn't go to some random college that opened up a year ago and expect them to have their CS program be as well run as in schools that have been in the business for like 40+ years. But randomly pick any school that you hear people talk about and it will be a fine school, if you personally like it.
> 
> Basically, go to any university that you personally like and it will be fine. As long as you like the school, you can't go wrong by going to get a CS degree at, for example, UCSD instead of Stanford or CalTech or Berkeley. At the end of the day it comes down to what you do with the educational opportunities that are given to you.

Furthermore, there are even even schools that you know of that suck in some of the metrics and they are still considered a  top school. Like Cal has bad CS class sizes and yet, we're fine here because we make it work. And guess what, it's still a top school in their rankings. 
> 
> Here's another way to see it. I think it's a bit like picking a country to live in (assuming you know the language and culture of any country you choose). Is living in the US better or worse than living in Canada or the UK? Is living in France better or worse than living in Switzerland? I mean, clearly living in the US is better than living in some poor country in the middle of a war, but if someone came out with rankings about which countries are the best to live in, would you believe their rankings? I wouldn't. If they tell me italy is two places ahead of germany or that Japan is 5 places worse than Australia I wouldn't believe them because they don't know enough. They can quantify rankings based on their own preferences but they can't tell me where is the best place for me to live . They're all good enough countries! The best country for me to live in depends on my own preferences. And on top of that, it really depends where I live in said country, and how I live, and so many other factors.

> OP, I think you are trying to extract too much from these rankings. I completely agree with you that comparing schools based on single-digit ranking difference is a subjective matter, and people should perform their own research to figure out what they want from a school. However, the fact that no ranking system can these subjective opinions is not be a reason to disregard the rankings completely. They do their best to capture the differences between schools.

A student replied:

> There is some good discussion going on here, especially with regards to how much we should regard rankings. I think a high ranking (in a particular subject) is more indicative of the faculty quality. Indirectly, this attracts top students, and hence, after years of this process, sometimes some people want to go to a particular school because of who they might be surrounded by (this includes other students, not just instructors). Along the lines, this gets blurred as an outright reason to attend the school, when it probably shouldn't; because, as stated above, going to a higher ranking school does not therefore mean you are learning CS ""better"". Being in a better ""environment"" however, thats kind of subjective, and entirely is based on what someone deems ""better"".
> 
> I picked Cal EECS over schools some people may not have (a couple ivies included; not bragging just making a point). Whereas someone else might have gone to the highest possible ranked undergraduate university they were accepted to. Are my reasons better? I don't know, I don't think so. So to the OP's point about what makes a school better, I think these things are indeed subjective and it may not be possible to extract a host of useful information. Not because they are doing an inadequate job at making the rankings, rather, some people just care about different things when it comes to picking a school. The rankings may ""try"" to capture that, but as most people may agree, its still incomplete.

I suppose I take issue with the fact that yes, the rankings are opinions that could be plain wrong and yet, I think, ever since they've started coming out annually, it's been an obsessive race to get into the top universities. People take them to heart too seriously. So in a sense, the fact that people take them so seriously, makes me want to hold them up to a high standard. But, at the end of the day, they are indeed just opinions of some people working at a news outlet. They never promised to be accurate. I should chill.

Nitpicking who has a few percent higher here or there doesn't matter. They're all great. Seriously, if your school makes it to the us news rankings, how worse can it possibly be compared to the top 30 in the rankings? Also, UT austin is 56 in the rankings and you see it as highly ranked--so yeah, whatever. the 56th position is also great. And so is 57th and 58th and so on. I really think if a school is known enough to be in the top 100 it's good. As long as enough people (students, faculty, and administrators) apply to be part of learning, teaching, and managing the school, it will be a good place b/c the school will be able to pick the best people out of those who apply. And the cycle of greatness kicks off from there.

> 6. teacher-student ratio is actually one of the metrics they use to rate schools. What I'm saying is that we have a bad ratio in 61A and other classes and yet we're totally fine academically. And, we're still getting good rankings despite that. Personally, I don't care too much about teacher-student ratio because that's the average of the school and vary greatly between different classes.

jk, that sounds like such a circlejerk
>But why? How do you know Carnegie is good?
Even more broadly, how do we know even MIT, Stanford, and Cal have good CS programs? What is it about them that make them good?


Well that got philosophical hella fast.
Research and innovation of the professors.

Has very little to do with the undergraduates or the education they receive.
