biwen zhang or erick bell for financial accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1djf0re/biwen_zhang_or_erick_bell_for_financial_accounting/,2024-06-19 02:32:01,as the title suggests! zhang's class doesn't fit as well into my schedule but I've heard really great things about her. I've also heard great things about bell and he fits better in my schedule.. thoughts?,"Both are good, but Biwen is amazing especially if you have no prior knowledge cause she deliberately goes slow and explains in a lot of detail
Thank you!!"
