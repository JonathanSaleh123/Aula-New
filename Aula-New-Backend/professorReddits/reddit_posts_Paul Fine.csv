Who is the Most Fun Professor You've Had Here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17w0z4l/who_is_the_most_fun_professor_youve_had_here/,2023-11-15 11:04:15,I'm trying to find a professor who seems like they understand fun. Someone you may have run into at a bar or who generally seems to support student engagement and entertainment. This is for an interview hopefully so please let me know if anyone comes to mind.,"Professor Darren Zook!!!
Filippenko in the astronomy department (seriously an intellectual and comedic powerhouse) and Landreth in the English department (he’s so funny and his interpretations of literature are so beautiful and entertaining to hear)
Professor Lowhorn
[deleted]
I really loved Professor Beatty (he was my professor for MCB 50 and 55). He was really energetic and sassy. I also loved Professor Gibbs (she taught the second third of Bio 1A - she does it in the spring). She was teaching challenging material, but she was practically jumping around Pimentel Hall at 8 am.
For me it’s Professor Lowman he’s just so sassy in class and laughs at the chat’s chaos lmao
unpopular opinion but Shobhana Stoyanov in stats was hilarious lol, she also cared way more about her students than most professors I had during my time at Cal.
James Campbell!! Literally ran into him at a bar during dead week!!
Pete Marsden for sure
\[Disclaimer: 20 years ago, but I think he might still be around\]

Prof. Wenk in Geology.

Back in my day he organized week-long field trips out to the desert. The trip was a whole upper div course. Hiking and sightseeing all day. Every night camping with steaks and things on the campfire.

I can't recall if there was beer, but it was 20 years ago so probably.

Best class I ever took. Awesome dude.

I think we all got an A too.
Josh Hug. He has a really cool taste in music (Aphex Twin, Melt Banana).
Prof. Adhikari fs 8)
djordje popovic!!!!
Daniel Neumark 

He’s like…cranky AF and salty to the core.  He has the sense of humor you might expect from the captain of a crab fishing ship during a snow storm in the Arctic circle.  He’s constantly on the edge of being really pissed off but he’s just polite enough to make wry jokes at nobody’s expense.  

Also Udi Isacoff is a real treat if you’re ever taking any neuro courses.
John Arnold for gen chem!
Professor Hilfinger 🌚
Lynn Huntsinger. Rangeland Ecology professor. She came to UC Forestry camp and at the end of her guest lecture week took out all the of-age students to the local dive bar. She is seriously a hoot.
Norman Sheu
Dan Garcia for sure
[deleted]
I love Bill White’s classes in Anthro but I’m not sure if he is teaching next semester
Norman Sheu, his lectures are great and he is a very fun person once you get to know him.
darren zook!
professor lawerence cohen, he teaches medical anthropology
Charles briggs anthro
prof firestone & prof ball!
Davina Chan she’s the best prof I’ve ever had in my life she really changed my outlook on life, besides all the academic stuff she taught me how to live life outside of school, she taught me things that I apply in my life daily. Will forever have such respect and appreciation for her.
Jim Campbell, Jean Ahn, Peter Bartou
Alex Craghead
Dan Garcia so far
61C with Garcia
my goat anant sahai
Shawn Chi
Mark Hellerstein
anant sahai
Professor Landreth in the English dept. That guy's a hoot!
Jerome Baggett, Sociology dept
Paul Fine
Mickey
jrs, man of duality
Jean Ahn
Ryan Edwards
might be a niche class but Professor Ben Hammed for COMLIT 100A
Either Dr. Mardsen, Dr. Lowhorn, or Professor Ball
Prof. John Kaiser, Sociology is awesome! Definitely seems like he knows how to have fun and how to chill
I'm a such a stan for Zook!!!
was gonna say this but i knew someone would have already commented lmao
He’s the best!
I'm with you there! He's so energetic and goofy!
Fr
lowhorn makes physics tolerable <3
Big ups to the 61c legend
yes yes yes
Also, I can't forget Dr. Shusterman from Chem 1A! She was absolutely legendary!
Loved Beatty omg
Agree ^^
I was going to say him as well. I’d love to get a beer with him. He was always fun in lecture, and seemed to really care about his students. I’m sure he would be amazing to hang out with outside of the school setting. Also, Jeremy Sanchez who is in the Stats department. He always seemed down to earth and like he’d be cool to hang out with. I hated Stat 20, but loved him as a teacher!
is that the philosophy one?
I second this. I had 2 classes with him and he was so fun!
duuuude he’s so chill
The goat himself
Spot on description! I like Neumark a lot- some of us can appreciate the curmudgeonly among us for their honesty and refusal to put on airs, if nothing else.
This has to be a joke
I love how he teaches he’s such an amazing prof
I took his folklore class to fulfill a req and it was one of my favorite classes I took at Cal!
which Lyapunov function u used to show convergence?
Best guy to get a beer with. 

(But wait until you’ve graduated! ;))
Econ 100A
Sameeee
ohh nvm lol i was thinking of john joseph campbell who is also a very fun professor :)"
Guide to Weeb/Anime Clubs at Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/19b6v4g/guide_to_weebanime_clubs_at_berkeley/,2024-01-20 00:06:30,"hi! i'm someone who has pretty much been on staff/participated in pretty much every anime-related club at Berkeley and I waned to give a rundown on what to expect! The interesting fact is that they are all actually quite different from each other, and I'm here to explain so that you can find a fit that feels the best for you.

Also lol I know my post is gonna be meme'd to shit in the comments and copypasta'ed with various squirrel clubs and I'm fine with that haha :')  And forgive me for my poor writing, this was done in like an hour and I'm so sleepy ahaha.

The thing I want to first clear up is that with all the clubs, the stereotype of weebs being annoying/obnoxious isn't true at Berkeley! Might be the case in other schools but I think being here has humbled us all in a good way :)

**Cal Animage Alpha (ANime-MAnga-Games Club)**

* The general anime club, balanced in all ways. I think anyone can join CAA and find something that they enjoy :). Most members and particularly staff don't even watch that much anime, so no pressure to feel the need to keep up with anime just for a club.
* The thing with CAA is that the club becomes a LOT more interesting once you join an officer/staff position, and I'd say that's what people should do if they weren't impressed at CAA meetings. It really is a whole different experience haha. Becoming a head officer is even better and not competitive at all!
* Medium commitment is ideal for the best experience!

Misconceptions

* The club is too big/too many people. - Only the first meeting is huge and is not at all representative of CAA. I think the heart of CAA is going to socials, retreats, maid cafe, anime destiny, not necessarily the meetings only.
* Weird people/introvert loner cs bros/smelly eecs/logan paul type beat weaboos - I'd argue that most of the people on staff/officer are really genuine and wholesome group, and a lot more normal than you think! The primary major here isn't even CS or EE lol, its very diverse.

**Gekkou (Female-focused Anime Club)**

* Gekkou is an alternative to CAA, primarily targetted towards women :)
* Leaders of Gekkou used to be CAA officers/heads, but split due to some drama years back. But since then, leadership of CAA has changed significantly since, and bad blood has mostly subsided as some current CAA heads are friends with gekkou heads!
* I've never been to the club before, so I can't say much but it sounds like a very open and friendly community!

**The Intermission Orchestra (anime/game music)**

* A tight-nit friend group of very passionate and friendly people :)
* The club is unique in the way that it has a semester-long team system, where all members of the club are divided into social teams and those who meet up/go for dinner/do other activities together are rewarded in a game-like way! Additionally, there's always a group studying at Moffitt or something that you can join casually to study with.
* This club is honestly one of the few gem clubs where you can essentially make this club your entire friend group and still feel like you've experienced a college life to the fullest!
* High commitment club if you want the best experience!

**Digital Illustration & Concept Art + Outlet (art)**

* A super chill club based around drawing!
* Very active online community with people on voice chat multiple times a week
* Probably best if you have some confidence in art, otherwise you'd just shy away from wanting to participate... I feel that U\_U
* That being said, JOIN THE DIGITAL ART DECAL!! Its secretly the most social decal ever with post-class dinners and hangouts pretty much every week!
* Low commitment club, the heart of it is just coming weekly to meetings and having fun!

**Genshin @ Berkeley (Mihoyo/gacha club)**

* Haven't been before but there's decent overlap between all the other clubs I listed!
* I know a lot of people in there so I'm guessing its pretty nice as well, I'd like to assume that its kind of like CAA, but more member focused! That being said take this with a grain of salt because I haven't been there myself \^\^'

**Rhythm @ Berkeley (osu, and general rhythm games)**

* Haven't been before :'D

&#x200B;

Anyways, I hope I was able to tell you something new! If you're a weeb that's gone into hiding and trying to be a normie, then I encourage you to embrace that part of yourself because you'd be missing out on a lot!",">maid cafe

ETA: not judging, went to some CAA meetings back when it *was* all ""Weird people/introvert loner cs bros/smelly eecs"" - myself included :-)
The current clubs aren’t degen enough for me

Special effects inventor and engineer Petro Vlahos, whose industry contributions made possible such iconic film moments as Julie Andrews dancing with penguins in the 1964 classic MARY POPPINS, died Sunday. He was 96.

Petro Vlahos was born on August 20, 1916 at Raton, New Mexico. After graduating in Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1941, he became a designer at Douglas Aircraft during the Second World War.

After working as a radar engineer at Bell Laboratories, he joined the Motion Picture Research Council, spending six months devising a complex laboratory process that separated blues, greens and reds before recombining them. The result — his patented “colour-difference system travelling matte scheme” — created the breathtaking visual effects in Ben-Hur . Having minimised the unwanted “halo” side-effect that had dogged earlier attempts, he modified the technique to work on green screens as well as blue.

While others had grappled before with so-called “composite photography”, overlaying shots of separately-filmed actors on background sets, the results were never totally convincing, with actors often appearing to glow in a halo of light that spoiled the effect.

Vlahos moved the process forward, first for the spectacular chariot race in William Wyler’s 1959 remake of the epic Ben Hur, and later for the charming penguin dance in the Disney musical Mary Poppins (1964).

The techniques that Vlahos perfected in such pictures were applied in many subsequent science-fiction and fantasy films, including the first Star Wars trilogy between 1977 and 1983. Unfortunately, shooting for some of the special effects in Star Wars took place during the hottest British summer for many years. The blue-screen process required giant arc lights, making the sets stiflingly hot: electricians fainted, and the actor playing Chewbacca, clad in a body suit of angora wool and yak hair, collapsed from heat exhaustion and dehydration.

Vlahos and his collaborators won an Academy Award for their composite processes in 1965, and with his son, Paul, he shared another Oscar in 1995 for the blue-screen advances made by Ultimatte, the company he founded in 1976.

His original concepts and innovations have been enhanced and expanded over the years, making possible entirely seamless composites which preserve fine details such as hair, smoke, mist, motion blur and shadows while automatically suppressing “blue spill” (whereby light from the blue screen behind washes across the foreground subject).

Refinements of Vlahos’s pioneering technique were used to make many of the blockbuster films of the 1990s, notably Titanic (1997), in which scenes that had hitherto been too dangerous, expensive or difficult to film were finally possible.

Special effects triumphs in contemporary films like Avatar (2009), in which blue-skinned Na’vi dwell among floating mountains, and Life of Pi (2012), in which the tiger, the ocean, and sometimes even the boy Pi himself are digital creations, also derive from Vlahos’s work.

Vlahos had more than 35 patents for camera crane motor controls, screen brightness meters, safe squib systems, cabling designs and junction boxes, projection screens, optical sound tracks and even sonar. He created analog and digital hardware and software versions of Ultimatte. As a result, every green- or blue-screen shot today employs variants of the Vlahos technique.

Visual effects supervisor Bill Taylor paid tribute to Vlahos during the Academy's Feb. 9 Scientific and Technical Awards presentation, where Taylor received the John Bonner Medal of Commendation, the same honor that his mentor had received.

“It's hard to emphasize the importance of his inventions,” Taylor said. “His inventions made a whole genre of film possible - a genre that seems to make more money than any other. He created the whole of composite photography as we know it - blue screen, green screen, an important contribution to the sodium vapor system.

“He leaves no unfinished business. He lived a life full of achievement and honor and the love of his family.”",I’m watching captain marvel and it’s pretty amazing to know his work probably helped bring this movie to life.  (Given this movie is probably a lot of green screen)
