Oh shit, I'm actually laughing at how y'all are trying to imitate Trumps rhetoric, it's rather ""Sad!""

How unsympathetic are you? This situation is truly sad. There is an entire city next door to Berkeley that really needs the help and deserves that help. Streets, lined with people that need help; people and infrastructure alike. Berkeley itself is a commerce waste land outside of a quarter mile of the University. Instead of reinvesting into the city and community that gave this person a real chance, they decide to create a fund for people that haven't earned this privilege. International student fund, love it!. Illegal immigrant fund is a slap in the face to all Americans. I can think of many Americans that could really use this help. The Bay Area is full of the people that deserve that help more than people that are illegally here in this country and may or may not be abusing the system.

Your bland moralism is pretty funny seeing as the Trump government wants to lower taxes on the rich and repeal Obamacare and replace it with a health insurance program that'll raise costs and decrease coverage according to almost all studies. He wants deregulate wall-street and increase the risk of another financial meltdown and has denied infrastructure funding to both BART and CAHSR in successive budgets. 

You're taking the moral high-ground even though Trumps policies will actively hurt the working class. He wasn't elected on an economic mandate but a social mandate that calls for mass deportations and discrimination against minorities. Really what you're saying lacks any substance, because right wing politics have historically led to increasing levels of poverty and homelessness. Now lets talk about immigration.

**ETHICS:**

In a broad sense, you assume that the life of an American citizen carries greater value than the life of an undocumented immigrant, which isn't true. There's no ethical reason why an American deserves a scholarship as opposed to an immigrant besides the existence of a border, an arbitrary line in the sand. ""America first"" doesn't take this reality into account.

More concretely, undocumented immigrants are fleeing conditions of poverty and persecution in Latin America, where entire regions are war torn and controlled by drug cartels. Gaining legal entry to the US takes months or even years and most of these folks don't have the luxury of waiting, for them its a matter of life and death. Would you seriously deny people fleeing war access to safety to serve your petty, racist, interests? 

Finally, there are over 11 million undocumented folks currently residing in the States. Its unrealistic and inhumane to deport all these people; families would be torn apart, it would require massive funding and these people would be forced to undergo 'processing' in terrible conditions.

**ECONOMICS:**

Undocumented immigrants benefit the US American economy. Immigrants take jobs that American citizens aren't willing to take in areas such as farming. They have a lower crime rate than domestic Americans. Undocumented immigrants contribute significantly to state and local taxes, collectively paying an estimated $11.64 billion a year. This is obvious seeing as taxes are automatically deducted from paychecks using fake SSNs and everyone in America has to pay sales and property tax. While they sometimes benefit from education and healthcare, these costs are taken into account by the tax revenue they produce. In most cases illegal aliens pay into social security programs but do not benefit from them. Even in studies where there is a net deficit, by the second generation illegal immigration produces net benefits to the US economy. Undocumented immigrants produce and consume up to [$800 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-07-17/online-extra-a-massive-economic-development-boom) worth of goods and services and its probably a lot more today. To summarize, on average, [all immigrants (including illegal aliens) will pay $80,000 more in taxes per capita than they use in government benefits over their lifetime](http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42d75369-d582-4380-8395-d25925b85eaf%7D/TEN_IMMIGRATION_MYTHS_FACTS_032012.PDF).

Quoting [This article](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/203984-illegal-immigrants-benefit-the-us-economy).

>Harvard economist Jorge Borjas has stated that illegal immigrants from 1980-2000 have reduced the wages of high school dropouts in the U.S, he also states that the average American’s wealth has increased by 1 percent because of illegal immigration.

The fact the undocumented immigrants drive down wages for workers with less than a high-school diploma by marginal amounts is a minor con especially to jingoist xenophobes, however, this is a problem with capital. The immigration surplus does not accrue equally to everyone. It goes primarily to the owners of capital, which includes business and land-owners and investors. Furthermore, any student of the free market could tell you that prices and living standards would also fall in response to illegal immigration therefore, it shouldn't really hurt the working class in the long run. More importantly, this downside also applies to *legal immigration*, which gives employers access to huge pools of cheap labor in places like India and China. The wage theory also ignores the fact that undocumented labor increases domestic demand, which in turn sprouts new business activity. In general countries, don't get poorer as they get larger.

You've been brainwashed by Trump politics of fear and racism. That's what is sad. The cons of illegal immigration are a symptom of the larger problem of poor public services, no social safety nets and in general, capitalism. [This study](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED399323.pdf) takes an in depth look at immigration in America, including illegal immigration, I suggest you take a peak.

Lol dude you're an Iranian American with posts on /r/DumpsterDiving, you shouldn't have to ask why immigrants have such a ""tough time"". 
If it takes you this many words to convince people of your point... it's probably Bullshit. For instance your whole post is how we should spend American tax payer money on non American citizens. You can't just say that simply because everyone will notice it as bullshit. That's why you need so many words. Thank you for your contribution to the Trump 2020 campaign.

The fact that American tax payer money benefits non-Americans doesn't really carry any ethical weight if you consider all human lives to be equal. Furthermore, its up to American citizens as to who benefits from their tax dollars. I'm assuming these notions are just going to go over your head though because you seem a little slow. 

I'm honestly cringing a little that you were unable to follow my arguments, I guess thats why they call them 'simpletons.' Did you drop out of elementary school or are you just mentally challenged? Or maybe you were dropped as a child? I guess every movement needs canon fodder, if there was a war they'd probably put you on the front lines like they did with Forrest Gump.

Now I'm scared that you might respond and maybe even attempt a rebuttal. Regrets... 


[deleted]
*Snort* You got shut the f down, and *that's* your response? 
Who is speaking about ethics? Keep up child! I'll indulge your version of ethics for a second...Ethically, American citizens in need should be helped first and then whoever else, simple order of operations. Conversely, in your own words you are saying illegal aliens are more important than a large percentage of American citizens and deserve to go to American state colleges. This douche from UC is advocating for illegal aliens to leach off the system and steal a better education than most Americans can only wish for... Once again foreign student fund would be fine! Furthermore, do you really think people with developmental issues should be the vanguard in a war? I thought all lives were equal? It's obvious I called you out on your inability to separate feelings from reality and you are throwing a tantrum. 

Let's see if you can follow some simple logic, as that is all I am capable of according to your extreme bigotry of my condition. 
I for one will not give up on my fellow citizen, no matter their color or credence. Helping our fellow citizens and then the world is a side effect of our national culture of freedom and hardwork. If we don't/can't help americans first, how can we as americans help others? We would just be creating issues for ourselves. Happy Independence day my fellow American! Love the heated back and forth. Stop trying to oppress discussion ... Best!

Still no response about my argument and only an attack on my post history. Anything to add to the discussion?

Damn right white people should be scared and so should Trump supporters, you're not welcome on this campus. It's cool that Mefrusta is engaging you in a dialogue. I think right wing trash should have their skulls caved in.

From your argument it sounds like you're missing a few IQ points.


No, not really bothered to respond to hypocritical nonsense.

Let's add racist to your growing list of character flaws. Racist and a bigot lol, great job bud. I'm not white btw... 
Also I never said American lives were more important. You insinuated illegals were more important because you would have tax money be spent on them than an American... Move to another country (as a non american) and see how they treat you as an illegal... Your ignorance astounds me

You specifically stated that you didn't want it to be discussed further and that I should PM you, which I felt was a waste of time. Either way the argument you chose was nonsense because you, like every other dishonest ""fact"" reporter, specifically refers to illegals as ""immigrants"", rather than illegals, placing them in a basket that they don't belong to. I'm all for LEGAL IMMIGRATION but I guess there's just no point in saying that these days as I might as well state that I'm a member of the a Nazi party and that will probably get a more positive review.

I mean, you write really badly and your argument doesn't make any logical sense, you're cherry picking experiences, ignoring statistics and basic tenants of ethics. Its also quite pathetic that you felt the need to post your academic credentials on here. Of course I don't have any reason to believe you, since this is the internet. THUS, my point stands, all the evidence you've provided so far tells me that you're a little slow. 

The fact that you compare your experience as an Asian immigrant to black and brown immigrants is laughably reductionist. You're against illegal immigration based on a limited set of personal experiences, which suggest that undocumented folks *as a whole* aren't hardworking in an academic setting. Perhaps it didn't occur to you that they come from universally low-income backgrounds, their domestic lives are unstable because they're constantly worried about being deported, these people are struggling to make ends meet and avoid having their families torn apart, yet you lack the empathy to take this into account when gaging their *academic* achievement, which according to you provides grounds for *deportation* and a ban on illegal immigration. You claim that they aren't ""hard workers,"" yet these folks take jobs that most Americans aren't willing to do; for example, many undocumented immigrants work in farming for long hours and low wages. If you take a person who can't form rational arguments and a person with no basic humanity and empathy, then we've got you, a fucking degenerate. I may have extreme views but I can defend them from an ethical and rational standpoint. 

Anyone with remotely right wing views should be scared at Cal, that includes the liberals. It doesn't matter if you're Asian or white, I'm not talking about you specifically.





Wow, I love how you still can't form a coherent response. You Trump scum are a bunch of reactionary morons. 
A racist, bigoted person like yourself could never understand the struggles of hard work and improving oneself. I truly feel sorry for you. Your best arguments are debunked, talk points, ""facts"", and insults... Im done wasting my time on a violence promoting, genocidal, racist, bigot lefty like yourself. The CA government would rather the state drown or burn before they stop virtue signaling, all the while begging the federal government and the president to help them clean up their mess. You seem to have the same view, just so you can virtue signal and feel good about being ignorant to the realities of life. Thanks again for your contribution to the Trump 2020 campaign.

Thats not what cops really do. The police exist to protect private property and the state at the expense of people. More broadly the police serve to promote order and defend the status quo, regardless of whether the status quo constitutes, slavery, wage slavery or any other form of injustice. The Wikipedia definition also works:

>A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder.

For example, at standing rock, an entire police department police blew a girls arm off, sprayed protestors with freezing water in subzero temperatures, used tear gas and flash bangs in order to keep to protect an oil pipeline and unused, privately owned land. This isn't a one off instance. In 2014, the police attacked peaceful protestors in Berkeley, some people suffered brain damage and have since filed a class action lawsuit against Berkeley PD. In order to produce substantive social change outside of the political system, its **necessary** that the working class comes into conflict with the police since socialists seek to abolish private property and in the long run, the state– the two things the police exist to protect. In class war the police are the other side and as such we have no choice but to kill them just as soldiers on opposite sides of the battlefield must kill each other in order to bring about change. I'm sure there are good cops, but we don't have the luxury of making that distinction when we're dealing with a rotten institution. There there were plenty of ""good"" Nazis soldiers, who were brave and altruistic, yet believed in Nazism; but collective struggle warrants collective sacrifice. The cops pledge allegiance to a system that necessarily oppresses the proletariat through wage labor and misallocated resources.

I'm all for criminal justice, but that work is carried out be specialist detectives. The average cop exists to provide order. You're spewing the same reductionist shit that most Americans do when they defend the police. Police don't save lives, there's no evidence for that at all. Addressing crime is about poverty alleviation, not law enforcement. The war on drugs has shown this time and time again.

An [FBI study](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/the-fbi-has-quietly-investigated-white-supremacist-infiltration-of-law-enforcement/) showed that there was significant white supremacist infiltration and sentiment in the American police, they disproportionately target black and brown people, are heavily militarized, carry out extrajudicial killings and use unnecessary force when making arrests. The police are rotten to the core, in theory and in practice. The only good cop, is a dead cop.
[deleted]
Thats not relevant. You haven't addressed my points or the points I previously made about immigration.

Under a different social framework and the absence of private property, we'd have community defense units or local militia which wouldn't serve to protect property and state, but respond to the needs of the public. I'm not against all the functions of the police, just their necessary functions. For example, in a slave society, the cops are the folks you'd call when your slave runs away. In todays society the cops are the ones you'd call to beat the crap out of workers who declare a Wildcat Strike. In the 1960s the cops were the ones you'd call when black people moved in next door. I'm not against detective work or house-calls, but police don't necessarily serve that function. 

Personally, I would call the cops to report the break-in but not the defend myself. I also carry pepper spray when I'm outside. Lets not forget that in many cases cops end up shooting dead the people who actually call them, like Charleena Lyles. 
[deleted]
They're really not, I just think you just don't like being insulted. I personally think you're an ignorant, unethical, somewhat racist piece of shit, so the insults are totally warranted. Have a nice day!

Btw if you haven't read my points, you can't know that they're illogical. Logic dude.
[deleted]
They're definitely not irrational, they follow from my premises. Its okay if you disagree. 

Your views came from anecdotal evidence, where you assume that being an illegal immigrant leads to laziness. Some of your premises were also just false and incomplete."
How bad is this schedule?,https://i.redd.it/u59pqr8rreaa1.jpg,2023-01-05 22:28:04,,"better pack a lunch for tues/thurs
That’s a huge L.

At least I only have classes back to back for 7 hours straight on one day of the week.

Probably better than having 2 long days of classes
Fellow BioE here, we have it horrible this semester :')
You gotta do some calorie loading before that huge block on Tuesday and Thursday. I guess that's what Monday's for.
A ziplock bag of trial mix from Trader Joe’s for Tues/Thurs. Convenient, tasty, nutritious, calorie dense, and quick snack. Best of luck 🤞
This is bad advice; however if you think you can still survive without going to discussions, I would skip some of them if they are not mandatory
… there goes your social life. Extra curriculars… And sleep… who needs it? Good luck though
We’re in Chem 3A & 3AL together, do you wanna start an early study group!?
![gif](giphy|gd09Y2Ptu7gsiPVUrv|downsized)
You caaan dooo ittt!!!
I do all of my classes back-to-back-to-back on Tues/Thurs because I have a full time job and that's the least disruptive to my schedule. Honestly I dig it. I'd way rather have to hustle and focus and only be on campus two days a week.
I took first semester organic w/ lab, first semester calc based physics, first semester multi, and an easy elective a semester. It was hard, but I got all A's, I had a girlfriend, and I was in ok shape. The one thing is it was at community college, so maybe without the girlfriend and/or dropping exercise you could do it?
You are going to be so sore after every Tuesday and Thursday.
agree with everyone that tues/thu looks really hard— just want to add that educ 182ac was an amazing class and even though it’s an 8am, you should absolutely show up! i learned so much in that class and lisa is a super engaging professor :)
You might wanna drop out after a couple of months of this torture. Best of luck, and remember to eat some protein bars and fruit during those long days
Ngl, id simply kms
I actually had a pretty similar schedule last semester. Youre going to be exhasuted on tuesday and thursday! I found myself not doing studying/hw on those long days but doing a lot on the shorter days, so if thats something youre fine doing then its managebale. Ive had a pretty heavy load every semseter and it definitely takes a toll on me and usually cased some burn out in the middle of the semester.  math 53 isnt rough but physics might take a bit of time. i just finished the physics 5 series and it definitely took the most time in my schedule each semester.
Take 170 with it
Drop 3al for me. Pretty please?
[deleted]
it fine
Seems like a pretty hefty load
that 3A lecture is gonna go hard trust
Kevin is a good gsi, that class will be fine. Everything else, you’re royally fucked
Well it’s not good
horrific
i think we might have the same math class and section lol. kudos to you if you can manage this schedule and i wish you the best of luck!
Yeah 😅
So true 😂. Do you have a similar schedule?
Yeah, I was already thinking about skipping math discussions (besides when there is quizzes). I think I do better self-teaching myself math anyways
I’m down. I’ll PM you my instagram!
Thanks :)
And I do pack a lunch lol!
That’s kind of what I had in mind too! But I originally was on chem lab waitlist for Wednesday, and planned to go home on Friday evening and come back mondays
Also, Ochem is by faaar the most work. For me it was over 50% of time spent studying, and the stuff you learn first semester is so important for second.
This is nice to know. I’ve been studying Ochem and multivariable on khan academy and other Berkeley professor’s notes. I also took algebra-based physics in high school, so hopefully it will help with 7A. Thanks for sharing!
Educ 182 seems like such an interesting class! Do you remember what the workload was like?
That’s what I plan on doing. Grind hw on Monday and Wednesday , and just really pay attention to lectures/ lab on the other days. Do you think math 53 discussion section was helpful?
I’m still staying open to premed, but leaning towards comp bio / biotech industry. I guess I’ll have a better idea after seeing how I do in Ochem haha
Fellow bioE junior here who had this schedule, you will die
yeah agree with the other commenter — workload really wasn’t too bad, most of the work is reading and a few papers, which are generally pretty straightforward if you keep up. and my discussions tended to be more interactive/activity-based but that depends on the gsi you get
It depends on how your prof outlines discussions. My prof had discussion twice a week with a quiz on the second day each week. If you have a good gsi then the discussions should compliment the course material nicely. I took 54 concurrently and found 54 discussion a waste of time but skipping 53 seemed to lower my understanding so it's dependent on the gsi tbh. Good luck! Discussions are what you make of it
That schedule's rough with ochem in it. Good luck, though! You got this!
Any advice? 😄
Pray pray and then pray again. In all seriousness, I would mostly study for Chem 3A by doing every problem set once throughout the week and once before an exam as it’s the only class where actually studying will nearly guarantee you an A (though I had Professor Robak). Math 53 and physics 7A are all up to what type of question you get on the test/if you’re confident with the concept.
Did you find math 53 discussions helpful?
They were useless for me. Book helped a lot
second half of math 53 was A LOT harder so if you’re the same as me then you might be able to settle a lil bit into your schedule for the first few weeks without yet having to worry about math 53 yet"

Update on planning for the fall semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gettt4/update_on_planning_for_the_fall_semester/,2020-05-06 15:12:53,"Just sent to students, faculty, and staff:

\##

Dear faculty, staff and students,

We are writing today to provide an update on our ongoing planning for fall semester operations. The planning process is wide-ranging and is deepening every day as we bring more faculty and staff onto the committees (described below) that are helping us envision what the fall term could look like. We aim to make key decisions in regard to fall operations by mid-June.

**Guiding Principle**

A single principle guides all of this work: **to protect the** **health of our community**. There are additional sets of principles that guide our plans for instruction and research. We are committed to upholding Berkeley’s excellence across all of our mission areas.

**Scenario Planning**

Because we don’t know what the spread of COVID-19 will look like over the course of the next few months, each committee below has been asked to develop plans for each of the following three scenarios for the fall semester:

* **Scenario #1:** For public health reasons, the campus must continue with **full remote** instruction, and predominantly remote work being done in the operations and research realms.
* **Scenario #2**: **In-person** operations resume, **with limits** and restrictions imposed by public health authorities.
* **Scenario #3**: Campus operations largely **return** **to normal** (i.e., mostly in-person), but wherever possible, will accommodate students, staff, researchers and instructors who need or prefer to operate remotely due to continuing pandemic conditions.

**Committees**

Each of the following committees has been charged with studying and making suggestions for a key area of campus operations. Each committee will be led by members of the [Chancellor’s Cabinet](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/about-office/chancellors-cabinet) and special advisors who will share their committees’ progress and recommendations during weekly Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet will use the recommendations to guide decision-making as we develop plans to resume operations in a way that maximizes community safety.  In addition, we will look for opportunities to incorporate the broad range of student perspectives. 

The current committees are:

1. **COVID-19 Public Health and Testing Advisory** **Committee.** Led by Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics in the School of Public Health.
2. **Research**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Research Randy Katz.
3. **Instruction**. Led by Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Paul Alivisatos.
4. **Student Engagement and Services**. Co-led by Vice Provost for Graduate Studies Lisa Garcia Bedolla, Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion Oscar Dubón, Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education Cathy Koshland, and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
5. **Housing and Dining**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Stephen Sutton.
6. **Operations**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Administration Marc Fisher. There are three subcommittees within the Operations working group: Workforce, led by Vice Provost for the Faculty Benjamin Hermalin and Chief People and Culture Officer Eugene Whitlock; Events and External Relations; and Information Technology, led by Jenn Stringer.
7. **Athletics**. Led by Director of Athletics James Knowlton.
8. **Financial Planning**. Led by Vice Chancellor for Finance Rosemarie Rae.
9. **Communications**. Led by Associate Vice Chancellor for Communications and Public Affairs Diana Harvey.

Again, all of this planning is being done with public health guidelines as our backdrop. We will proceed only with the guidance and express approval of local public health authorities.

We will continue to provide regular status reports about this critical planning process on the campus [COVID-19 website](https://news.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/), under the Return to Campus tab. In addition, our next [Campus Conversations](https://campusconversations.berkeley.edu/) event on Monday, April 12 will feature Chancellor Christ, and we [invite you to submit questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaeOwW_QfTa7aTkwtcgeHcH181ohlmZy9lbgW-7n0BDEGrew/viewform) about the plans and structures we have established here. We’ll make every effort to address your inquiries on Monday’s webcast.

Thank you for everything you are doing to support the university’s mission and serve our students. It is indeed a challenging and uncertain time, and we have been so grateful for your commitment, as well as your patience and flexibility. What makes Berkeley *Berkeley* is not just our physical campus, or our history, or our traditions… above all else, it is our community. No matter what our fall semester looks like, we will remain strong because of the dedicated service of so many of you.","At some point, a definitive decision has to be made, regardless of the ambiguity of trusted pandemic projections. Although these committees are certainly doing well by preparing for these various scenarios, let’s not forget that this is the institution preparing ITSELF for the Fall. 

Students are still in the same situation, and completely unaware of what Fall will bring, and many are considering withdrawing, staying home, etc., and are facing a wide array of difficulties from both the unresponsiveness of the administration and the community function. 

Other academic institutions in CA have declared their Fall policy. Berkeley should too, considering it’s an international hub in the Bay Area, there can’t be any more people left in the dark about this.
“In addition, our next Campus Conversations event on Monday, April 12 will feature Chancellor Christ, and we invite you to submit questions about the plans and structures we have established here. We’ll make every effort to address your inquiries on Monday’s webcast.”

Um did y’all forget to proof read? It’s already May lol

Are these people seriously considering a *normal* fall semester after March 10?
The goal is to have final decisions on the major elements by mid-June. Let me know which areas you're referring to re unresponsiveness? I can try to help. We're moving as quickly as we can given the magnitude of the decisions and the changing public health landscape and guidance.
Eep, evidently. It's this coming Monday (...the 11th) at noon. I honestly don't know how we got the month *and* day wrong. We're sending another short message out on Friday so at least it'll clarify things.
Not saying that it is more likely, but from what I have heard about ""hybrid,"" I think it is #2, where let's say big CS lectures are online but small studio classes and really necessary labs offer the in person option.
I think people are worried mostly about housing. It would be hard to find housing now, let alone mid June
can we please get a specific date? Some of us have potential leases in the air and would like to decide whether or not to sign them asap. Having a specific date allows us to negotiate with our landlords as there'll be a clear deadline for us to make our decision by.
Can you please clarify if an online option will be offered regardless of what happens? As a non traditional student at a much higher health risk this is gravely important to me. In one e-mail it was announced it would be guaranteed, whereas this e-mail doesn't seem to hold this promise (i.e, I can't imagine with scenario 3 professors would abide to an online format if it wasn't required and some people were going to class in person)
To emphasize housing concerns on a financial level: 

We are guaranteed an online option, and a question mark for in person. Given that many leases end in May and people need to renew *right now*, the financially secure option is to cancel your lease, because 

a) the semester is fully online, and you save on the rent + 
b) the semester is also in person, in which you would miss out on in-person classes (if you can't find last minute housing), but would still get to work towards your degree

But if you plan for in-person courses, you take on **significant** risks. You take on financial risk of an entire year of rent, and if you are unable to find roommates (of which many are too scared to commit to a full year of rent for the same reasons), or end up with roommates who would rather take the smaller financial hit of cancelling their part of the lease come Fall, then you're really in deep for it now. Coupled with the fact that college students are really, really bad at communicating negative risks until the last minute, and it's a sizable fear for a lot of people.

---

Edit: I don't know how the UC would be able to help with this by releasing any plans earlier. Many leases have 90 day move out clauses, meaning a lot of people have already made the decision to stay or go. I am curious to see if on-campus population for Fall 2020 has already met its fate and been locked in by this point in time.
Wouldn’t it be easier right now? I would have thought the lack of students would have made things alit cheaper.
This from the provost's office: All indications at this point are that there will be an online option for all or nearly all classes to accommodate those who cannot obtain visas as well as students and instructors who may be at elevated risk.
True
I think its mostly because of contracts and subleasing hassles? Pretty confusing times rn
Which scenario are you all leaning towards right now?
Thank you!!
Interesting. I would have thought demand was super low."
Letter from Grad Dean on grad school admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kf8nnt/letter_from_grad_dean_on_grad_school_admissions/,2020-12-17 15:10:02,"(Just got this, thought it might help students to hear it - Bob)

Dear Deans, Department Chairs, Graduate Advisors, and Admissions Teams,

We have heard from UC Berkeley undergraduate students who are concerned about how electing the Passed/Not Passed grading option for courses during the pandemic may negatively affect how graduate admissions committees consider their applications to graduate and professional schools at Berkeley.

In Spring 2020, the Council of Deans endorsed [a statement](https://calmessages.berkeley.edu/archives/message/73564) indicating that departments would  not penalize students who adopt P/NP grades during the spring 2020 semester.

Below is an updated statement from the Graduate Division which reaffirms this holistic review: 

*UC Berkeley evaluates applicants for admission to its graduate and professional schools holistically, meaning that we consider an applicant’s combination of personal accomplishments, letters of recommendation, personal statements, academic record, and test scores in making our admissions decisions. Such a review will take into account the significant disruptions of COVID-19 when reviewing students’ transcripts and other admissions materials during the pandemic. Thus, we will not penalize students for the adoption of P/NP grades and reduced research experiences during this unprecedented period, whether the choices were made by institutions or by individual students. What is most important is that applicants demonstrate that they pursued a challenging curriculum that was relevant to their plan for graduate or professional school.*

*As we have continued to observe in admissions cycles, Berkeley graduates have a remarkable track record of success in graduate school admissions to the most competitive programs in the country. Our graduates are admired for their academic abilities and resilience, and are assessed, as always, on their overall performance. We are confident that graduate admissions committees will make generous allowances for the academic challenges produced by the COVID-19 pandemic.*

...  **We ask for your assistance in circulating this email to your admissions teams, and any other staff or faculty who assist with admissions.** We will notify undergraduate advisors of this message.

Sincerely,

Lisa García Bedolla 

Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Dean of the Graduate Division

Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Studies  
  and the Dean of the Graduate Division University of California, Berkeley","Thank you for posting this letter.
It is always nice to see Vice Provosts making soothing statements while not actually putting $$$ on the line backing up the empty promises that they are making on behalf of others who were never consulted.

Students should know that it is largely \*faculty\* who have to put their $$$ and time and effort on the line when it comes to admitting graduate students, and in the absence of any real resource commitments, faculty are going to be striving to minimize risks while maximizing the potential rewards. Faculty aren't stupid. They teach classes. They've seen the data about grade distributions in the Spring (mostly As and Ps). They know exactly why and when most students voluntarily elect P/NP in a class --- when they don't understand the material. Students don't understand the material for lots of reasons --- all of which are bad from the perspective of admitting a graduate student and committing to their success in a long and challenging program. 

So ""holistic admission"" is going to take into account the entirety of what faculty know about students and the adoption of P/NP grading is a part of that information. And it will likely not bode well for many students who adopt P/NP.  

If the university wanted to actually support the admission of students with voluntary P/NP, they would offer fellowship $$$ that were targeted to people impacted by Covid-19 who then selected P/NP. That would offset the risks. This is what the university does for the stuff that they actually care about. Look at the Chancellor's Scholarship program for example. Here, there is no such offer of fellowship money or extra TA positions or anything else. Which makes the message absolutely worthless or worse. (In the sense that taking down guard rails and removing a ""warning: steep cliffs ahead"" sign and replacing it with a ""We are confident gravity acknowledges the difficulty that people have in navigating during fog and will take into account the significant disruptions that it causes"" sign is worse than worthless.)

Of course, Prof. Jacobsen also knows this. So does Prof. Bedolla.  

Students with an ounce of common sense know the reality. It isn't just important that students take a challenging curriculum of study. It is important that they actually do well in it and can show that they will likely do well when things get even more challenging. The burden of proof is **always** on the student. (That's how life works, at least for those not born with a silver spoon in their mouth.) Taking a class P/NP is like running out the clock when you are behind in a game, and will likely have similar ramifications.  But who wins and who loses doesn't matter --- at least not to the person who gets paid either way. Plenty of people worldwide are going to take all their classes for a grade. They'll fill the top grad school slots, internship slots, and job slots.
The world isn't perfect, and neither is higher education.  But there's more here than throwawayfaculty51  thinks.

First, Dean Bedolla  \_is\_ putting funding and fellowships on the line.  As Graduate Dean, she's the one who distributes them, and she's telling departments how she wants it done.  Will that work always? Of course not.  Will it be as irrelevant as throwawayfaculty51 suggests? Given the reporting and accountability processes here at Berkeley, I doubt it'll be irrelevant. People are going to work to make this happen.

Second, at least in every department I know of (more than half of them), \_no\_ individual faculty member ""put(s) their $$$ and time and effort on the line when it comes to admitting graduate students"". We're not dragooning individual students for our own purposes.  Rather, departments (usually via faculty committees) admit students to the department, and guarantee them a certain level of funding.  Again, that's not a perfect process, but it's usually a pretty good one.  It's true that they're looking for people who will do well in their programs and afterwards.  Isn't that what you'd do?  But most of them look well beyond just the GPA number to try to understand a larger picture.  GPAs and GREs are predictors, but they're not great ones (you can prove that to yourself by looking at admission rates as a function of them; they're not sharp cutoffs, which means other things are being considered). Faculty committees are already looking at letters, experience outside the classroom, etc.

So what's different with COVID and P/NP?  As I've commented elsewhere on Reddit, students who have been impacted by COVID have to explain how they were impacted and what they did to deal with it.  If there are good reasons to get a P or drop a class, in my experience people really can include that in their reasoning.  That's also true if COVID and side-effects results in bad grades( (I once supervised a graduate student who had three semesters of really terrible grades as an undergrad, but she also described on her physics grad school application what it was like to be told you have stage 3 cancer and of her desire to work on radiotherapy; she'd now an MD-PhD researcher)  At least in the fields I'm familiar with, we're looking for committed, curious, smart people to be researchers; grades are secondary.  (Not sure if your throwawayfaculty51 user name means you're a faculty member or not, but if you are, when was the last time somebody asked you about your graduate or undergraduate GPA as part of evaluating you?  That's a serious question to which you should post an answer.)

Bottom line:  No student should use P grades lightly.  It's particularly futile to use them in an  attempt to push your GPA up; that's unlikely to help and may well hurt. But if you really needed some relief this semester from pandemic-related issues, or that happens next semester, then a P grade, a drop, an incomplete and similar strategies really are valid things. Explain why you needed them, and why they helped you continue to achieve as best you could.

Now a comment on why I'm writing such a long reply to this:  Berkeley students put a lot of stress on GPA.  They compete with each other on GPA.  They \_taunt\_ each other about GPAs.  And it's mostly all crap.  It's juvenile one-upsmanship that is actually resulting harm to their fellow students.  I think that reducing both the over-stress and the resulting harm should be a priority.

Yes, I know you need a certain GPA to get into the capped majors.  That causes some of this, but not the worst cases. Monday I talked to a sophomore student who was frantic and in tears because he understood that he was going to be over the cap number \_by\_ \_far\_ after this semester, but that getting a B in one of the courses ""would ruin his chance of getting a good job"".  His fellow students were telling him this. He really seemed to believe it.  And it's just crap.  (He probably hates me right now, as I didn't let him set it to P/NP post deadline; I'll check back in a few months and see how he's doing and how he's feeling about it)

Posts like the one I'm replying to are part of the problem.  Here's a Dean and Vice Provost directing how this campus is supposed to do admissions. She's saying what she and her colleagues across the UC system are doing. In response we get an anonymous post that argues, without any support except conclusory statements, that it's not true and ""absolutely worthless or worse"". There's really nothing there, but students are so wrapped up on GPA that they'll probably believe it instead of the Dean.  And that's harmful.

So, throwawayfaculty51, if you really have the experience to back this up, tell us who you are, and explain how you know.  Absent that, I really hope your comment doesn't cause further harm.

&#x200B;

(edit for minor typos)
Prof. Shewchuck had this to say about PNP in 189 last spring:

https://imgur.com/o1aCoNB

I agree with him (and you). Taking on a PhD student is a huge commitment, and there's no way the people admitting you will just ignore your grades / research experience because they were earned during COVID.
I just want to say I appreciate you taking the time to respond to these kind of comments. Honestly its just explaining it that one step further than the anonymous user suggests that helps give the complete picture. I hope you don't have to continue doing this with every post, but at least for me this little exchange was a learning opportunity."
Fall 2020 Update - Remote instruction will be an option; no tuition / campus fee refunds (lol),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6rwvu/fall_2020_update_remote_instruction_will_be_an/,2020-04-23 11:24:14,"Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students,

We understand that many students have questions about campus plans for the fall 2020 semester. We wish to share information with you as proactively as possible while we carefully observe the progress of the current pandemic. 

Like universities around the world, we are working towards making critical decisions for the coming academic year in this evolving situation. We have an FAQ website that we will update as more details are announced. 

In-person vs. remote instruction decisions
We will not cancel the fall semester. We are working closely with our local public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. At this time we don’t have an estimated date. Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 2020-2021 may be delivered via remote instructio n. We do not know exactly when these decisions will be made because the public health picture remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall semester as soon as there is enough information to do so. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff will always be our top priority.

Given the uncertainty the world faces, some students may not be able to safely travel to campus. **We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as an option for Fall 2020, even if classes are held in-person.**

We’re making every effort to minimize disruptions to our educational mission and recognize that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as possible. When we do resume in-person instruction, it will likely be a phased approach with certain types of classes considered more appropriate to resume in-person than others. We will also likely make changes within classrooms and laboratories to observe publ ic health directives and guidance such as increased hand washing, avoiding sharing equipment when possible, and recommendations on facial coverings and/or physical distancing. Decisions about broadly offering Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for fall semester will be made by the Academic Senate and will take into account the situation at the time. We appreciate your patience as we weigh these factors and gather more information about what the situation may be like in the fall. 

Tuition and student fees for fall 2020
**Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising.**

Some campus-based fees were established to support certain efforts like the Wellness Fee which is paying for many essential health services. Others were established to maintain the safety of buildings or other facilities when necessary for the health and safety of students—e.g., to address seismic deficiencies. Even as UC campuses such as ours have curtailed limited aspects of their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover will continue.

Student housing for fall 2020 
Under normal operations, all new students receive priority for housing. It is not possible to know at this time whether the COVID-19 pandemic will allow for normal operations in student housing and residential life in Academic Year 2020-2021. Consequently, we cannot guarantee housing priority at this time but we are committed to supporting students if they want to liv e on or near campus.   

For returning students, if fall classes are offered via remote instruction, we want to empower you to make the best decision for you and your family. We will keep the residential halls and apartments open as they are the primary residence for many students, unless we are required by public health authorities to close them. To date, we have not received any such closure order. If you do choose to live in University owned or affiliated housing, we will allow students the opportunity to be relieved of the financial obligations of their housing and applicable dining contracts and receive a prorated refund if the campus doesn’t resume in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 academic year or ends in-person instruction for an extended period of time (for example, in-person instruction is cancelled for more than 30 consecutive instructional days). 

For off-campus housing, students should pay close attention to the terms o f their lease. Most off-campus leases will not provide prorated refunds if students leave mid-lease. Consider trying to negotiate with the landlord for a month-to-month lease. This will give you more flexibility. Given the circumstances, some landlords may be more willing to negotiate. Learn more about leases at sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/leases.


We thank you for your understanding and resilience during these challenging and uncertain times. We are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible and we will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the coming fall. 

Sincerely,

Lisa García Bedolla, Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Dean of the Graduate Division

This message was sent to all undergraduate and graduate students.","Since they guaranteed remote instruction, how would exams possibly work if in-person instruction continues? 

I think this GUARANTEES that take-home/jank online gradescope exams will continue fall semester. Not only can you not social distance with 700 people taking an exam in Wheeler, but logistically it's a huge hassle if half of the course is taking an online exam with completely different format.

How the hell you curve that?
As a senior graduating in a couple weeks, although I was initially really sad about not getting to finish my college career in Berkeley, it’s becoming more and more apparent that graduating now is actually a lot more good than bad... I feel for you guys who are gonna have to put up with multiple semesters of this
[deleted]
I said this in another tread but allow me to repeat myself here: I’m most scared of the situation where we come back to school in person in the fall thinking the virus is all over and then it makes a come back in October mixed in with the regular seasonal flu and we all panic and have to scramble home again like we did this semester.... idk how likely this would be cuz I have no background in public health, but I did read on the news that someone at CDC said a second wave is possible and even likely. Please correct me if I understand the situation wrong, but with that (potentially big) possibility in mind I really don’t know if we should resume in person school at all for the fall:(
I mean someone has to pay for all the infrastructure right? As long as they don't charge for housing, it makes sense to me.
Getting spring admission is looking like more of a blessing every day
[deleted]
Seems like it's probably time to start making plans for deferral. For people planning to do so, what will you try to do for your gap semester? Remote internship?
I'm paying out-of-state tuition while living in-state. What the actual fucking fuckity fuck.
I find it interesting that they seem inflexible with regard to tuition and fees when they have to understand that such inflexibility will inevitably lead to a large proportion of students withdrawing for the semester.  I wonder what measures they will take regarding this.  It's a huge loss either way.
Why can’t they give some campus fee refunds e.g. RSF, AC Transit, and other services that we cannot use? I find it really unreasonable. Yea sure we’ll have access to staff through online classes which is ok to pay for but the issue is that we’re paying for services that we can’t even use!! Tell me where the money for our RSF membership that we’re paying for is going to when the gym is closed?? This is just really unreasonable. Considering the added fact that I already signed a lease for off-campus housing in January and now they can’t even give us a concrete answer so that I know whether I should argue to terminate the lease or not 🤦🏻‍♀️
RIP a digital year abroad isn’t quite the same thing
If fall semester is remote too I’m taking a gap semester
Mannn... I just hope whatever decision they make will be a solid decision. I don’t want to stress over whether I should choose online school for fall or if I should go in person to have that freshman experience. Just pick one!! I’m a horrible decision maker 😖😖
Oh man, I guess I'll miss out on those AC transit bus rides where tens of people get crammed into a bus for a few minutes at a time. Honestly, those should be refunded since people probably won't be willing to get on a bus during fall semester if there are still some social distancing restrictions due to the lack of a vaccine.
I do not understand why people are confused by this concept.  Just because you are not physically on campus does not mean you are not going to be receiving a UC education (exception being to the equipment and archives that are available).

As a graduate students at Davis I still had to pay tuition even though I had a remote program.  I was not confused by this concept when it happened 5 years ago.  Why would it be different now?
RIP to the people living off campus. So essentially, would labs for all classes be cancelled then, since if students are given the option to go remote, I doubt classes like Chemistry, Bio, and Physics can hold their in person labs.
Can we physically still go tho?
Exam format are likely up to instructor but I think everyone will take the same exam and in-person attendees would be treated the same as online attendees, since there's no way to do the reverse.
Maybe, just maybe, and hear me out on this one, _curving isn't a fair or reasonable way of grading a class_, so this is the perfect time to get rid of it.
Same here. I still take walks on campus but it's depressing how few students there are. Can't imagine a whole sem of this :(
I'll be the first student in the history of UCB to attend frow Hawaii.
At least this time they’ll have had some preparation time as opposed to having to scramble to hobble together an online class in the middle of the semester.
Yeah, the possibility of a second wave is very real, especially if we have a ton of students fly in from other cities + increase daily public transport. This is a reason behind their uncertain tone ""we're still waiting for public health etc, but for now we guarantee an online option"".
you are right, and I don't think schools like UC Berkeley would risk this even if majority of schools are. So the chance of canceling in-person classes is much higher than what many people are thinking(I would say 90+%). It's good to be optimistic but you cannot risk even a single student.
Yeah if my daughter was college-aged I’d most likely pull her out for the fall and find something productive for her to do around the house or at least be an unofficial intern for my wife and I. Can’t imagine being a college student through all of this.
I think many people getting angry about those fees aren't thinking about the numerous employees (not faculty) who would have no means of getting paid if not for those fees remaining to fund daily (minimum) operations, maintenance, security, etc. It's easy to assume those fees are just the university taking our money for kicks, but it doesn't feel like that's what they're doing.
God damn, I'm actually jealous.

Just got in after 3 years of community college, and now I'm losing 1/2 of my years at Berkeley for sure ☹️
Fall 2020 will at least have optional online classes. I don't know what the breadth of that will be, at least any course that's a major requirement or degree requirement.

The email leaves the possibility of either partial online (online for a bit, then in-person), or in person with social distancing measures, or completely online.

Though personally, I think it's pretty likely to be online at this point.
IDK it's really hard to plan because of the uncertainty. Personally, I will still enroll if it is hybrid instruction, but if it's fully remote, I'll most likely withdraw. But this really depends on the state of rest of the world. If we're back in ""lockdown mode,"" then I doubt companies will be hiring interns, much less min-wage jobs other than essential workers. In that case, I might just take a couple of classes because I would rather attempt to further my education rather that spend a semester doing a min wage job since my parents will most likely still be employed. 

However, if the rest of the world returns to ""normal"" and the only (main) thing that's online are colleges, then I would likely take the semester off and either find an internship or another job. But idk who will be hiring so it's really hard to decide so early, because if you can't find a job, the semester is completely wasted.
I will likely simply audit the classes I would have been taking (I doubt they will be gating anything).
tbf part of that is ostensibly at least in-state residents have supported the university through state taxes (and yes, some people just moved, there are exceptions)
One large reason that ""the situation remains fluid"" is because, as essentially a running business, they need to balance trade-offs. How much money will they lose by cutting tuition, vs. how much money do they lose by retaining tuition but losing students? (profit margins vs. revenue volume)

One reason I can think of with retaining tuition is that they get to keep the money-making whale in the room - international students. 

Out of state is ~$43,000, and in-state is ~$14,000, effectively making international students **x3 times more financially valuable**. They also have been making up larger and larger portions of campus population over the past few years. Most importantly, international students will likely be much more accepting of remote education because of travel restrictions, family obligations, as well as personal identification of where their home is (for example, the common theme of ""I'm going to America to get a degree, then coming back to my home country to work"")

But your logic still stands. This email, as well as watching the enrollment numbers, is a way for them to begin to test the waters and see how many people get spooked, and if they lose too much money, they will try something else. Because if they close campus or lose too many students, they stand to lose [hundreds](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-16/uc-reeling-under-staggering-coronavirus-costs-the-worst-impacts-all-at-once) of [millions](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fwrwjo/uc_berkeley_expects_100_million_loss_by_end_of_may/) of dollars.
I find it interesting that you think Cal is able to change tuition and fees as an individual university. Also, that you believe that any outcome is ""inevitable"" because it is one you might choose.
It makes me even more reluctant to attend the in-person or at all. This is comming off as: in-person option = half effort to keep up appearance and retain tuition.
People aren't confused, they take offense at the disconnect of paying money for a Berkeley education (which is normally in person) and instead receiving remote instruction, which is an objectively poorer learning experience. Sure, the piece of paper you will get handed at the end of four years stays the same, but what you gained along the way is measurably less.
Well, yeah, so everyone will take the online exam, which also can't be proctored.

Otherwise it would be incredibly unfair for the online kids to take an unproctored version of the same exam lol.
100% agree.
[deleted]
they will *most certainly* be cobbling together an online class again. it's just that this time they will have hopefully learned a bit.

edit: meaning, nobody is going to use the format *well*, like a class designed from the ground up would, but will instead still deliver the content exactly as they did before, but will have some tweaks because they now know how to use zoom.
and you can't force some students not to come. you either cancel it for everyone or give the option to everybody to attend. second option would need to ensure 40 thousand students from 100+ countries to be not sick. What are the odds....
If your daughter were college-aged, she'd be an adult, perfectly capable of making that decision for herself. But I understand that's what you'd do for _yourself_ in this situation.
Haha I’m 19 and my parents are advising me to withdraw for fall semester as well. My mom almost teared up last night saying she just wants to protect her little girl:( on another note tho, Im afraid that fall enrollment might look pretty ugly.
As a staff person, thank you for thinking of us.

Even with fees staying where they are, we are looking at massive cuts to departmental budgets. This comes as we were just *barely* done with the last round of belt-tightening to balance the campus budget. It's not going to be pretty.
Yea man I feel the pain. I was considering I’m going to UCLA if I got accepted but the spring admission is actually an opportunity I can pass lol
[deleted]
Let me rage.  
Jokes aside, you're right. It just feels bad.
As an international student I actually feel like... most of my friends and I are considering withdrawing if it’s fully online or due to some travel restriction we can’t physically get to america. Hugely due to the fact that it’s so expensive and being in a different time zone makes online school horrible. But that’s a very small sample size of just less than 10 of the people I talked to, might be wrong.
Wait so if I'm OOS, but they decide to do remote instruction for my classes, I still have to pay that huge tuition cost???
In person also requires rent btw:(
 very much agreed. Though maybe a relatively empty campus wouldn't be that bad if all facilities are open. It will be tough to tell how to make the decision.  Weighting the value of potentially lowered services with a much lower population using them.
Yes, and it is an entitled, bratty viewpoint because there are programs that are remote for grad school at Berkeley and other institutions and they need to be paid for.  I did not feel that was the case for my program at Davis (the first component of was in person).  In fact the remote learning was far better because there was a lot of down time that was cut out of things.

One loses the social aspect of college, but that is not what you're paying for when you pay tuition.
Hopefully there are other ways of evaluation that doesn't favor cheaters. For instance more weight on assignments/projects, etc. where we already have ways to detect copying. Some summer classes are also experimenting with this I think. Also, humanities could always give open-ended essays questions and check for plagarism like they alsways do.
well it's basically confirmed that there will be an online option so it means a majority of things will be online
But it might be, so there’s no reassign they shouldn’t be at least a little more prepared than getting blindsided in the middle of a semester.
That is very true... with that 90% chance of inperson instruction being canceled, what do you think fall enrollment would look like? I just don’t think my OOS tuition would be worth it if it’s online:(
Lol. She’s only one so it’s hard for me to think that far ahead. But good point.
There is already a hiring freeze that has extended to lecturers (so not just staff), as far as I know that is unprecedented.
 
It's almost guaranteed furloughs at the very least for staff if not significant layoffs. And we never did get back up fully after the disaster that was Campus Shared Services (shudder).

It's going to be very bad before it gets better.
What will get better, though? That's the thing, no matter what the virus is still here in August. We may have lowered the infection rate, new cases, and deaths with shelter in place orders, but the question becomes, how can we soften those while not just immediately causing another wave?

Treatment wise, COVID cases treated hydroxychloroquine apparently have a *higher* fatality rate than those of similar severity not given it. 

Colleges are prime position for viral spread. It involves mass domestic migration, a bunch of people squeezed into close quarters every day, and people living together in the same rooms with strangers.

How do you social distance in a triple? You can't.
I highly doubt it. Even though are age group is “fine” some of us have health complications or people might be living with elderly people. The whole situation sucks
""Just let me bang bro.""

""I do let you bang. I do.""
I'll agree that remote lecture cuts out a lot of downtime between classes where it's too short to walk home and do something else productive. However, this is but a trifle. 

My main point was sure, you can listen to a lecture online and that doesn't drastically alter the learning format of just being talked at, but for other classes, remote instruction just doesn't do them justice. For myself, this includes physics 7B (missed lab component) and environmental design 1 (where in-person site studies in Oakland are/were crucial to the semester-long project). I don't see how this is bratty - experiential learning is key for some people and in other cases, critical to the study of a subject. 

Furthermore, on the notion that ""there are programs that are remote for grad school at Berkeley and other institutions and they need to be paid for"" - the whole principle in these is that they are *planned* remote programs. When choosing a grad school, this is something that is known upfront and can be weighed among the factors of quality of education vs. price when choosing where to go to grad school. In this case, when choosing Berkeley as a the undergraduate program they would go to, students, and especially OOS students, factored that the quality of education justified the cost of attending here. If they had known in May of their high school senior year that one, and possibly two or three semesters would be taught remotely, some might have decided that this is not worth the cost and would have attended a different university. The cost/benefit equation has changed away from what the student expected. Therefore, it's completely justified for the student to wish for a reduction in tuition, or at they very least, bitch about it on reddit. Likewise, the desire of withdrawing for one semester to avoid this expectation/reality mismatch of services rendered is also justifiable.
I don’t mean to get into this but one thing I wanna point out is that, most of the undergrads here at Berkeley didn’t sign up to go to Berkeley thinking that it would be online. It’s great that for you an online education is just as good and I wish I could say the same. But for my major and classes I rely so much on talking to my professors in office hours and collaborating with classmate on projects in person etc. Speaking for myself the quality of online education is reduced. I think people are mad because of this sudden change to what we had agreed to pay for in the first place. (Like if you paid for a year of Spotify and in the middle they suddenly decide to not stream but send you the records you request. Sure the Music you get at the end is the same and you shouldn’t complaint about that, and some people might actually prefer that service, but if that’s not what you organically agreed to sign up for, it might be a little frustrating) that’s just my 2 cents and have a nice day!
> One loses the social aspect of college, but that is not what you're paying for when you pay tuition.

If you’re satisfied with the idea of online classes, go get your degree from the University of Phoenix and save yourself $100,000. It’s the same thing, right?
I believe a lot of students will defer their enrollment or take a gap semester. I really think that all majors(expect five-year ones) can be completed in 3.5 years and you can also always take a summer class for only 2k.  I really don't think Berkeley's (actually nobody's) online education would be worth 20k . 

There is a reason why Berkeley's masters in data science program is considered shitty by many students. It's the same classes taught by the same skilled profs, but it's fully online so it's certainly much easier to get in(since they can enroll more students) and definitely less reputable than masters in engineering. You shouldn't pay that much money for any online program, even something like a masters in data science at Berkeley.
I'm just wondering what will be different in spring 2021. Seems like without a vaccine, we're basically in the exact same situation :(
There are ways you can control that second wave though. For instance, you can phase out move-in times (have Bay Area people come first, then California residents, and so on) so that you can deal with new infections more spread apart. The issue is, you can't *not* have a second wave, unless you do the ""lockdown until there is a vaccine"" thing (which I haven't seen seriously discussed, and there's no guarantee of a vaccine). But, there are ways you can flatten the curve so it isn't as bad as it could be. 

There are also other treatments being tested for COVID besides hydroxychloroquine, so there's a chance there will be one by the fall.

And about social distancing in a triple: none of the guidelines ever apply to people in your dwelling. The issue would be within the bathrooms, dining halls, etc., not with the number of people in one bedroom.
If I read the text improperly, they are not charging lab fees, which means that you are not being charged for services that you would normally recieve.

It is true that remote learning does impact labs (and library and archive access for those of us in the world of Letters, rather than the Sciences), but you have to agree that it is a huge offer to let students not even attend courses but still get access to the education that they want to have.  The University is doing what it can to allow students to be safe while continuing their studies, and it should be commended for that, rather than be criticized for it.

There are many things that the University deserves criticism for, but this is not one of them.
You are being purposefully obtuse.  You have not given one reason why the University would lower tuition because of the circumstances.
Same. I feel like I can easily graduate in 3.5 years in my major so taking a semester off isn't that bad for me personally. I am also slightly concerned about what to do with myself in that time, idk if companies are going to be offering internships at this point and I am a little afraid that I would waste 6 months of my life doing basically nothing productive.
The problem with ""phasing"" move in times is just logistics, and the fact that almost all students other than Freshman don't live in University housing, so they really don't have a good way to control.

If all the OoS sophomores+ just come back, because well they already have to pay for August rent anyway, there's nothing you can do. And they will, because as we all know online learning is kinda ass.

>But, there are ways you can flatten the curve so it isn't as bad as it could be.

Well, yeah, like having services that can be done remotely, done remotely. Like most office work and... university. It sucks, but it's possible, and it helps the rest of the country get back to work. That's the logic.

>There are also other treatments being tested for COVID besides hydroxychloroquine, so there's a chance there will be one by the fall.

There's a chance of everything, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a useful therapeutic

>  none of the guidelines ever apply to people in your dwelling. 

That's for people in *normal* housing, which involves 1-4 people in a house or apartment. This is 3 people, *strangers*, put in the same room. Not a family unit, strangers. 

They're also use the same bathroom, have the same dining hall, touch the same elevator buttons, etc.
Please quote when I said the very fact of the University holding remote lectures is bad. While it's a ""huge offer"" - I'll agree, if there were no classes at all, that would be ridiculous - the University is refusing to reduce tuition for a comparatively *poorer* offer. At the end of the day I don't understand why complaining about that fact is ""entitled and bratty."" 

Is it realistic for the University to reduce tuition? Of course not, it's snatching for pennies when there's no global pandemic - it's going to be hemorrhaging money now as it had been before Christ's improvements. Is it justified to be pissed, nevertheless? I think so. Is it justified to want to not take remote classes next semester to avoid this convenient, but still inferior offer? Yes, and not bratty.
Because they’re providing an objectively inferior product?

Also, props for calling me “obtuse” when you just called students who don’t want to pay full tuition “bratty and entitled”
there are few online internships but don't be sad if none of them works out. if you really wanna do something important, here are some suggestions:

&#x200B;

contact really small startups(from skydeck or anywhere else) and ask them how you can help them remote. most will not be willing to pay you but that would be a great experience. 

take free courses from websites like udemy, you can even get a certificate for it for something like 100$

&#x200B;

start studying some of your spring classes during fall, you would get higher grades or take more courses since you basically know a lot about one of those courses.
Good point about the logistics. I’d imagine that there would be ways of coordinating between the city and the university, but it would be difficult. But there would be some incentive on the city’s part, given how much of city business depends on the student population. 

I’m just more of an optimist about therapeutics than you I guess. Keep in mind like every virologist in the world is working on this. 

About the dorms, the issue isn’t that there are strangers in your room (And they’re not strangers for very long). The issue is the other things you listed (bathrooms, dining halls,etc. ) It’s just not ever possible to social distance from the people you live with, and it’s irrelevant how many people are in the dorm, and whether you know them.
Explain how the education you would receive would be lessened.
>I’d imagine that there would be ways of coordinating between the city and the university, but it would be difficult.

To do what? Bar people from entering the city of berkeley unless they're california residents? I don't even know if the city has legal authority to do that. It probably doesn't lol. 

You can't reasonably stop people in the US from moving domestically, even the federal government can't, it doesn't have the constitutional power to. 

>I’m just more of an optimist about therapeutics than you I guess. Keep in mind like every virologist in the world is working on this.

Yeah, but just having more people work on it doesn't necessarily make anything possible. We never found a therapeutic for SARS or MERS. Hell, we never even made a vaccine for it. They tried, but it took too long (>5 years). 

>It’s just not ever possible to social distance from the people you live with

Yeah exactly, so its optimal to minimize the amount of people you live with. Effectively now, most students will lived with both their families and their roommates, doubling the ""can't possibly social distance"" number.
Some people have different learning styles and some majors benefit more from an in person approach.
I guess you can’t bar non-residents from entering the city, but you can do other things (testing, self quarantine, etc., stuff countries like Taiwan are doing). You can also make compliance voluntary, and I’d guess most people would listen. 

I’m under the impression that research on SARS and MERS slowed down after they went away, but you are right that having lots of people work on it doesn’t make anything impossible possible, only more likely that we find something. 

I still don’t understand your point about social distancing. If you move from a family house of four to a triple room, you are actually decreasing the number of people you’re living with. It’s not like you are now living with both your roommates and your family. I agree with the fact that the conditions in dorms are conducive to the spread of disease, but that would be the situation regardless of the number of the people in the room.
You might be surprised, but as someone with a Masters in Education, I am aware of learning styles, the research around them, and the public discourse that typically mangles what the research actually says.

The major benefit from in person education in an educational context is primarily felt in primary and secondary education where a teacher chooses to read the room and change the way they manage and deliver their content.  This is not something that is done in higher education in general because the expectation is that the student regulates and controls their own focus and effort in the class.  The sole exception to this tends to be in educational classes, and the effect on students who are used to the more mature and independent style of higher education tends to make them feel as if they are being treated in an infantile manner.

If you are entering Berkeley and have not learned to self motivate yourself in your education, then you are in trouble, because you are developmentally behind where you should be.
Personally, I struggle with maintaining focus and an in person class setting really helps me to focus on the physical presence of the speaker and helps my concentration. I also value the interaction I have with peers and going to office hours and clubs and stuff. I would, however, be interested in reading more about the subject and research that you mention so if you could direct me to some primary/secondary texts I’ll be sure to check them out!
For context, when I finished my masters degree, we were the one remote seminar in our program.  In our Zoom sessions we not only had regular chances to interact with our professor but each other, and spent time checking in and talking about our experiences.  We also had regular opportunities to have one on one conversations and office hours with our professor.  There was nothing lost in our experience except not having to spend hours to drive between where we currently resided and going back to campus.

As for the research, I will go digging in my files.  Sadly the days of having access to Google Scholar through UC just disappeared last spring, so I do not have everything I would like to show you.  In short, most education research is very locally specific.  Local conditions, supports, and culture have far more impact on academic outcomes than delivery techniques.  In addition, the most efficient means of transferring information is still proven to be direct instruction (lecture).  Still, we are told not to do it because general educational pedagogy is focused not on being efficient in transferring information but in improving educational outcomes for students with the least academic skills rather than trying to improve the academic outcomes for the majority of students.  Almost all discussions and research about learning styles is about increasing the outcomes of those limited few students who are otherwise not on level for reading, writing, critical thinking, or calculating.  Once again, if you are one of these people, that is support the tutoring center (and consequently the ASUC and student fees) covers, not University tuition."

Dear Colleagues,

As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, show that infections continue to increase.

The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.

Although we have repeatedly noted that all fall plans are subject to public health conditions, we understand that this news will be disappointing. Many of you have worked diligently to develop plans to provide in-person instructional activities for almost one thousand classes across the campus. Many faculty and students continue to look forward to resumption of some element of in-person instruction. We will continue to work hard on our plans, and to learn from the setbacks as well as the advances. 

Learning to switch between remote and in-person

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow.

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to providing guidance and support. 

If previously approved in-person instruction returns later in the semester, students will not be required to attend classes in-person—they can continue to attend classes remotely through the semester. 

To the degree that operational logistics and public health conditions permit, we will prioritize offering in-person instructional activities for Tier 1 and some Tier 2 courses, depending on instructor, classroom, space, and facility availability. Tier 1 is defined as instructional activities that, by their pedagogical nature (e.g., labs, studios, fieldwork), are significantly preferable to offer in-person or partially in-person. Tier 2 is defined as instructional activities that, if offered in-person, would substantially contribute to cohort-building for entering students, to academic engagement for students who are underrepresented on campus, and/or part of a capstone experience (e.g., freshman/sophomore seminars, first-year cohort-building courses for graduate students, capstone courses for seniors, etc.). 

The Office of the Registrar will continue to assign general assignment classrooms as needed for courses provisionally approved as Tier 1 and Tier 2 in the event that we can return to some hybrid or flexible instruction later in the semester. At this point, it is less likely that we will be able to offer Tier 3 in-person instructional activities, those in which the instructor strongly prefers to offer instruction in person—even later in the semester—so we are holding off on Tier 3 room assignments for the time being. 

Current fall planning

For now, as we plan for the start of the fall semester, faculty should implement their contingency plans for fully-remote instruction. Waiting for conditions to improve would not provide us with sufficient time to prepare for the start of instruction. If it is not possible to offer a particular course remotely and the course needs to be canceled for the fall semester, please work with your department scheduler to update the schedule of classes at your earliest opportunity. It is important that students have the most up-to-date information. For questions, please contact the Office of the Registrar scheduling@berkeley.edu.

Whether or not public health conditions allow us to return to some in-person instruction as planned, we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for our students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. Please also take a look at the following FAQs: 

For instructors (COCI)

For students (Registrar)

Participation/Attendance (CTL Resource) 

Looking forward 

We acknowledge the challenging times for our community with regard to childcare, dependent care, personal health, and other responsibilities through the fall. Our instruction planning and operations recovery management teams are working to develop plans to support instructors, GSIs, and staff who require classrooms or office space to prepare for and/or deliver instruction. We will send more detailed information about these plans in the near future.

We will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester.

As the public health situation continues to evolve, we will keep you updated as additional information regarding fall plans develop. We will provide regular updates leading up to and throughout the fall semester.

For your information, a message about fall plans that students will receive later today is appended below. 

We are immensely grateful for your incredible dedication to our campus community in the face of this pandemic and for your remaining flexible to our ever-changing environment.

Letter to be sent to students today

 

Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students -


As you are all aware, the trend lines regarding COVID-19 positive cases in Alameda county, the region, and the state, continue to increase.


The increase in cases in the local community is of particular concern. Given this development, as well as it being unlikely that there will be a dramatic reversal in the public health situation before the fall semester instruction begins on August 26, we have made the difficult decision to begin the fall semester with fully remote instruction. However, we continue our preparations to implement hybrid and/or flexible modes of instruction as soon as public health conditions allow.  

 

COVID-19 is showing us that we have to be not only agile, moving quickly between degrees of openness and sometimes pulling back, but also prepared to move forward as soon as conditions allow. 

 

This means we will keep a fully remote option open for all students, but also be prepared to implement our plans for select in-person instruction activities for those students who can take advantage of them, as conditions allow, even if it is part way through a term. 

 

We understand that this is more complex and difficult for students, staff, and instructors, and we commit to continuing to communicate regularly with you regarding these matters.  

 

Regarding Thanksgiving, we will continue with plans to go fully remote after Thanksgiving, even if we are able to pivot to some in-person instruction during the semester. 

 

Whether we are all remote, or mostly remote, you should know that we anticipate an improved remote learning experience for students. We have made significant progress in our technology since the spring. And, the Research, Teaching, and Learning (RTL) team has provided many resources to assist instructors with teaching remotely in the Keep Teaching website. 

 

We realize that these changes may be frustrating and make it difficult for you to choose what you want to do for fall. This may also be confusing for incoming undergraduate students, including first generation college students (students from families in which neither parent has a four-year college degree). Please know that you belong here. You are an essential part of the UC Berkeley community and we will support you in having a rewarding college experience. We have numerous offices, groups and services at Berkeley and the Educational Opportunity Program is a great place to start. This incoming undergraduate class also marks our most ethnically diverse freshman admitted class in more than 30 years. We are committed to encouraging and supporting all underrepresented students through programs like The Office for Graduate Diversity and the Centers for Educational Justice & Community Engagement.

We’re hoping this email can provide more information to help you make your decision. In general, if you can reasonably live and learn where you are right now, staying there may be the preferred choice for you. However, you may decide to reside in the Berkeley area if you have on-campus housing, critical in-person classes (depending on public health conditions), in-person research or work, or other specific directive to come to campus; or accessibility, accommodation or other needs. Fortunately, the federal government has rescinded the rule that would have harmed our international students. They can now make the decisions that work best for them.

Learn More

We are hosting a series of “conversations,”live-streamed events where you can learn more.

 

Student housing (including on and off campus housing): Tuesday, July 21, 12-1 p.m.

Instruction: Wednesday, July 22, 12-1 p.m.

Newly admitted undergraduate students (for freshman and new transfer students): Wednesday, July 29, 5-6 p.m.

Student experience (including professional offices and student groups and events): Tuesday, August 11, 5-6 pm. 

 

Help Us Support You

To help us better understand how to support you, we will asksurvey you about your plans for fall and your public health habits so that we can create a program to support COVID-19 prevention practices. Your feedback is important. Watch your email for more details. 

 

Instructional Support

For graduate student instructors, the Graduate Division has created FAQs about fall instruction. 

 

We will begin by providing remote access to academic services such as academic advising, tutoring and peer advising and will assess other options as public health conditions allow. We are exploring how technology can enhance our services, creating toolkits for staff, and following guidance to support equitable access including adhering to ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) best practices and ensuringstudents have the technology they need to succeed.  

 

The Campus Experience

 

The campus experience will begin remotely. There will not be opportunities to gather with groups of other students on campus at the start but we hope to switch to a more flexible approach should public health conditions allow. The State of California is currently drafting guidance for universities and colleges, we expect to share that soon. We will provide more information at sa.berkeley.edu/covid19/Fall2020. 

 

Students who do come to campus, including living in the residence halls and apartments, will be required to adhere to public health and safety requirements. 

 

Financial Aid and Scholarships

 

We are committed to offering financial aid to support students in covering the estimated total cost of attendance, including tuition, housing, books, food needs, and more, whether they are living on or near campus or outside of the Bay Area with their family. 

Students not living in on-campus housing are encouraged to update their “Cost of Attendance” information in CalCentral as soon as possible. Click on “Update Housing” and select “Living Off Campus.” Please review Financial Aid & Housing Updates for Fall 2020 for more detailed information. Should the standard allocation not match your actual living expenses, you may request a cost of living adjustment in mid-August.

On-Campus Housing

 

On-campus housing for students in the residential halls will be single occupancy only; you’ll get your own room. We will be able to accommodate all students who have received housing offers. Occupancy levels in apartments for undergraduate and graduate student and student family housing (University Village Albany) remain the same. All housing complexes will continue to have residential life, housing, custodial, maintenance, and other critical staff on site. Additional information is available at housing.berkeley.edu/fall2020covid. 

 

Off-Campus Housing

 

We remind students that off-campus housing (including private apartments and houses, fraternities, sororities, and the co-ops) is not owned or managed by the university. You are more likely to contract and/or spread the virus if you live in crowded, congregate living environments. We advise that if you are living off-campus in Berkeley you have your own bedroom and you not socialize in person with anyone outside your household (the people sharing your apartment). For group living environments with large numbers of residents, we encourage students to create smaller social bubbles like we will have in the residential halls. 

 

Preparing for Positive Cases

 

While we are working diligently to mitigate the spread, we will reserve space in the on-campus Foothill housing complex for students who have tested positive and are in isolation; are waiting for the results of their test; or have had close contact with a known positive and need quarantine under public health orders. We will make sure students have meal service and other resources they may need during the isolation/quarantine period. Students living in on-campus housing will be given priority but University Health Services will also oversee a small number of spaces at Foothill that will be available to house high risk students who live off campus, as appropriate. Students who are experiencing symptoms or think they have come in contact with a positive case should call the 24/7 Nurse Advice line at (510) 643-7197.

Final Thoughts

 

Our plans will, by necessity, evolve as we receive direction from public health officials. This is the case all over the country with cities, counties and states easing and then reintroducing restrictions. We are grateful for your patience and flexibility. These are challenging times but we continue to invest in a robust remote experience - both instruction and student engagement - to ensure students can have a full and meaningful university experience no matter where they are learning. The campus remains as resourceful, determined and resilient as our students. We will get through this together, and our shared journey through these difficult times will make us stronger. 

 

Stay well, Bears. 

 

Sincerely,

Please do not reply to this message","yo why do I have a course materials fee if I can't actually take labs for the course...
bamboozled
Does the school have any thoughts about people living off-campus and can't cut their leases? Seems super unfair for us to pay \~4000$ over the semester for rent if everything's fully remote and not making the announcement until midway through summer
What does this mean for athletics?
how the fuck are they going to justify charging people 25k a semester when none of the facilities are open on campus lol
\*will begin fully remote
Tldr? 

I can't read this.
It's possible that you will be mailed a lab kit, at least that is what 16A is doing this summer.
Berkeley released a city ordinance that allows any student to cancel their lease with 30 days' notice. This is a city policy so it would supersede anything written in the lease not allowing this. Landlords have already gotten in trouble for trying to stop tenants from doing this.
 I foresee the Big Game played in April

If you think that they can still hold anything in person after starting and ending the semester fully online, I want some of whatever you're smoking.
The title
Imagine going to a world-class university and not being able to read.
Classes in fall start online, might go back in person if things get better, if you have a housing offer you can keep it but you can cancel it, and a couple other things for students to know.
seriously doubt I'm going to be doing 143 stuff at home tbh
You are still on hook for the rent until a new person takes over the lease, so it’s not really that helpful.
The issue is that leases are signed way in advance - finding housing is such a shit show that most students (me included) sign leases in like March, because if we wait until June we’d literally be living a mile and a half out from campus.
At least we get to keep the Axe?
He's probably including rent, food, alcohol, textbooks, condoms, and event tickets. Either that or he's out of state / international
I know leases need to be signed way in advance in berkeley (I'm actually the house manager of a \~40 person house). But even if you signed in March, you can still give them 30 days notice today. It will be a little annoying with Spring leases \*if\* classes are in person, but even if you signed a long time ago, you can still give 30 day notice today.
oos rise up
I see, this changes everything. Let me look into it, thanks."
