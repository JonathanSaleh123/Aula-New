Pros/Cons of UC Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tuxhf9/proscons_of_uc_berkeley/,2022-04-02 18:25:19,"Application season is coming to a finale and many prospective students have gotten their results! For those who were admired and are considering UC Berkeley, I wanted to compile a semi-extensive list on the pros and cons of attending UC Berkeley, in hopes to inform future students. If current students or alumni want to add anything in the comments about their experience or opinions that would be great! Also feel free to ask questions. Go Bears!

Pro #1 Academics

* All majors at Cal are highly respected by academia and industry. Almost all the professors are distinguished and more than qualified at teaching their subject. Although I had a few professors that were mediocre, a majority are as passionate about teaching as much as their personal research. A degree from Cal is an amazing accomplishment that will set you up well for whatever future you are interested in.

Pro #2 Brand Name/Reputation

* A taboo subject, but should be realistically considered. Cal has a rich history of excellence. From a constant flow of new affiliated Nobel Prize winners and past contributions to academia and advancement of society, Cal has a very strong reputation and is well known. This reputation can help graduates get into prestigious masters/PhD programs or help postgrad job placement.

Pro #3 Research

* With a history of amazing research, there are lots of quality research opportunities at Berkeley due to the population of grad students/professors. Although URAP is competitive, I found out that cold emailing professors actually is pretty effective! If you really want to participate in cutting edge research, you can find it.

Pro #4 Location

* Definitely overlooked in general. Cal is situated in the Bay Area, specifically the East side. Berkeley is a well populated city and the surrounding businesses cater towards students heavily. It’s an exciting city that has good college town vibes. What I think is even more underrated is its proximity to Oakland/San Francisco/Sacramento. Oakland is \~15 (car/bus) mins away. SF is \~20 (bart) - 60 (bus) mins away. Sacramento is \~60 (car) mins away. There are always events on weekends in Berkeley or the surrounding areas. My friends and I always visited SF or Oakland on the weekends and we felt rly connected to the Bay area.
* The weather is relatively temperate. Summers can be quite hot, but nothing crazy. In the winter, the coldest it gets is \~40 F. Some times it’s foggy, but most of the time it’s tht perfect low 70s type of da.

Pro #5 Start-up Culture

* With the #2 number of startups in the country (behind Stanfurd), students can be a part of amazing new innovations. Berkeley’s Skydeck has secured record breaking investments and has networks all over the world. Not to mention the recently completed Bakar Bioinginuity Hub will help foster science related innovations.

Pro #6 Non Campus food

* The food around Berkeley is simply amazing and diverse. Famous food areas include Asian Ghetto, Telegraph, Elmwood, Downtown Berkeley, Gourmet Ghetto, and Northside Asian Ghetto. In addition to food hot spots in Oakland and SF. There is a great range of prices and diversity in restaurants. Not to mention so many great boba shops.
* If you’re into organic/healthy foods, Trader Joes and Berkeley Bowl nearby.

Pro #7 Campus

* UC Berkeley’s campus is beautiful. I personally love the core neoclassical architect of many of the older buildings on campus. They give off such a regal & Roman/Greek vibe. Campus also has tons of green areas, where you can just chill in between classes. There is a creek that runs through campus and a eucalyptus forest on the west side. Our clock tower, the Campanile, is the largest college clock tower in the US & Campanile way is an empty lane that gives you a direct view of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Pro #8 Student Body

* The students at Berkeley are the best of the best. They are extremely smart and passionate. And although this can be intimidating, you should let this motivate you and try not to compare yourself to others. Learn from others and embrace that you are all going to one of the best universities in the world. I personally don’t think Berkeley has a toxic competitive culture and students are willing to help each other/be collaborative.
* Myth: Students sabotage each other. I have never experienced this ever and no one I know have complained abt this. Most students I meet are supportive and many want to form study groups and do projects together.

Pro #9 Public Transport

* The bus system is free for UC Berkeley students and is very very efficient. There is a free bus line straight to SF and Oakland. Buses are for the most part on time and reliable. In addition, the Bart system gives you a faster way to SF! You can explore the Bay area w/o the need for a car.

Pro #10 Sports

* Although Cal isn't typically known as a sports powerhouse, any sports that have to do with water, Cal is one of the best. Cal has the 4th most olympic medals in the country. Cal has 40 D1 sports. We have notable rivals w stanfurd and ucLa, which always draw big crowds in whatever sports they're competing. Nothing beats rallying the school around a common enemy. Our notable sports are water polo, swimming, rugby, gymnastics, and rowing. Some notable alumni are Collin Morikawa, Aaron Rodgers, Jared Goff, Desean Jackson, Marshawn Lynch, Jaylen Brown, and Jason Kidd.
* School spirit is very high and most students are proud (some too proud) they go to Cal.

Pro #11 Clubs

* There are more than 1000 organizations on campus. If you want to find a community you can. Getting into a club at Cal can be a very good way to find friends and build community. I can’t recommend it enough: JOIN CLUBS!
* Some professional clubs can be rly hard to join, but they really aren’t necessary.

Pro or Con #1 Difficulty

* There isn’t grade inflation like in many private schools. To do well, you have to put in the work. On the upside, if you put in the work, you can do well in Berkeley.
* Myth: Grade deflation exists. If you get A in a course, it’s never going to go down.

Pro or Con #2 Greek Life

* Berkeley does have a sizable amount of frats/sororities. There’s a frat row with a bunch of frat/sorority houses back to back. If it’s for you, just know tht option is available too. Freshman and sophomore year I remember always going down to frat row to try to sneak in w my homies.

Con #1 Housing

* Housing in the Bay area, especially Berkeley is expensive and it’s hard to find a good deal. Cal only houses \~30% of its undergrad population, so there’s not guaranteed housing after freshman year. Good news is that Cal is planning to double its housing within the decade. Rent for double can be as low as 800$, but you have to look ahead and be vigilant.

Con #2 Campus Food

* Cal’s dining halls are on average meh. Dining halls at I-house and Clark Kerr are pretty good, but the largest dining hall, Croads, is like I said - meh.

Con #3 Crime

* I came from the suburbs and crime at Berkeley was initially alarming. Only later did I realize that most crimes were petty theft. Not to downplay it, but it’s not like people are getting assaulted everyday like some people make it out to be. Nothing personally has ever happened to me and I lived 7 blocks away from campus at one point. In addition, Cal/Berkeley is cracking down on homeless camps & building on Peoples park (epicenter of crime) this summer. (homeless people will be housed)

&#x200B;","Pro or Con but something to be aware of:

Cal is very large school and it’s easy to get lost in the shuffle. There are a lot (some)  of resources for support for problems - whether academic, mental, personal, financial BUT no one will offer help. You to make that first step of asking for help. While this is good training for the real world, this is admittedly a difficult thing to do, especially as a 17 year old freshman. But it’s also good life training.
Yes I can definitely agree with these. Just to add I'd also say:

Pro #2 Reputation: Especially because it's public and very difficult, employers are always very impressed when I say I went to Berkeley because they know that the grads are very competent. We didn't get in off of legacy, the classes teach pretty advanced material, and no one holds your hand so they know you're pretty capable.

Pro #3 Research: Yup I found research just by emailing professors and going to their office hours to discuss my interest in their lab. 

Pro #4 Location: Berkeley is also just very walkable and dense. It's so easy to get to all those great food places, go around bar hopping, hang with friends, go to events etc. There so much to do in the area.  
  
Pro #8 Student Body: We have so many different types of people. I found people generally very down to earth and in addition being very impressive academically, they're also chill and like to have fun. I always got so much help from my peers that helped me through classes, learn how to get research/internships/do interviews etc. And we also had a great time exploring cool spots and chillin together. I got to meet lots of different types of people and everyone was so genuine.

Pro or Con #1 Difficulty: Yeah every class I had was either curved up to help everyone's grade or not curved at all. Classes are definitely hard but professors, GSIs, and fellow peers were always very helpful and supportive. No one is trying to lower your grade.

Con #1 Housing: Definitely my one negative for Berkeley, but almost everyone I knew found off campus housing within a few blocks of campus so it's really not as dramatic as people make it sound. I'd rather live off campus anyway: it's cheaper, I can buy my own food, have a kitchen and living room, throw parties/kickbacks, have more privacy, etc.
Addressing pro or con #1 - grade deflation: bins shift for a lot of lower division weeded classes. I got bumped from a A- to B+ twice (mcb 32 and socio 1). However, I also got shifted from a B+ to A- once (data 8). Curving grade bins has its pros and cons, but they do shift for competitive lower divs
i love this!!
Hello!

I am currently considering Berkeley and right now I would say that I am 70% on board to go. 

My main concern though is housing, and if there is any guarantee or a good chance I find housing past the first year. I guess this question is applicable to all colleges, but after freshman year how can I ensure that I am close to Berkeley? 

Also, what are the implications of the court case from earlier this March and what are the effects (if any) on current students and incoming freshman?
thank you so much for sharing!! :)) I heard there is a lot of competition for classes - have you ever had this problem? Do you think it is so bad to the extent that people have to graduate later bc of it? Any tips for getting the classes you want early? thanks!

#4 could be a pro or con depending on how comfortable you are in a city. Like alot or cities and downtowns you can’t go out at night here in certain areas, and it’s recommended  if you identify as female to carry something like pepper spray or use bear walk late at night.
Cal and UCLA are different but have the same city vibes so if you’re ok with that ( and potentially seeing a dead body) it won’t be such a con vs. UCI  which is basically a bubble since Irvine is a major planned community . 
My friend grew up in a heavily populated city and said Berkeley is not as chaotic, I grew up near LA outside of the city and found Berkeley more Chaotic than of course a suburb. It’s important to know these things before you come here.
It was large my freshmen year - about 25k total. Now its MASSIVE. 45k students! Up there with ASU & tOSU in terms of enrollment...
And even if you ask for help, administration lacks coherence. For example one department like finances may refer you to Billings when really you need to speak to financial aid , but they won’t tell you that cause they seriously might not know who to talk to or how to help you
Also slightly concerned about the battle to get CS classes when you’re in Letters and Sciences. Is that a thing still?
I think that if you plan early enough and are proactive at it, finding off campus housing is not that big of an issue.  It actually gives you an early head start to real life, if you want to look at it that way.  Every student at Berkeley has to deal with this. It’s all a matter of what you can afford as well.  The situation gets better once a couple of dorms gets built, one at People’s Park, one at Oxford/Center, in the next year or two, and once the dorm for transfer students gets completed (on Walnut). That will help a ton.

The court case is a really touchy issue which is a big headache for everyone.  Quite frankly I do hope that the next few incoming classes do slow down in numbers because the school is pretty crowded now.
There are people sometimes who have to extend graduation because they missed out on classes, but that’s usually because of poor planning or they switched majors really late and couldn’t fit in all their required courses in on time.  

In theory, CS upper division classes may eventually get impacted to the point where some students may not graduate on time, but that’s why CS is trying to do this drastic reconciliation of students in the major that you’re reading about so that this sort of thing won’t happen to a ton of students.
now that you're officially a student how would you say the competition is?
When I was a student, we were 20k undergrad + 10k grad - I can’t even imagine it now; but on the other hand I’ve checked my scores and gpa and it’s depressing. I was a solid 80th percentile freshman candidate, but with my SAT/gpa matrix I would be in the 35th percentile or so if they even deigned to let me in now
This is life in a large multi-national corporation in my experience anyways
My dad who studied chemical engineering at Cal told me there's no way he'd get in nowadays. He was a solid student but it's just too competitive now. It's really said tbh how cutthroat Cal/UCLA are. I still like to think I had a chance at Cal Poly when they sent a letter if I wanted to switch away from engineering and to business which was my fallback major.
I mean I'm pretty sure I could still do the schoolwork (well, not now, but a 18 year old me)  and I was an excellent high school student, but to get in nowadays it looks like you have to be better than excellent."
