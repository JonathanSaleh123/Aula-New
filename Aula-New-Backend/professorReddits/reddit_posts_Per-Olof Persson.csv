Math 124 with Per-Olof Persson,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18rh2yt/math_124_with_perolof_persson/,2023-12-26 12:13:26,"Could anyone who has taken this class before give me a review about it in term of commitment and grading? How doable is it to get a B+/A- in this class if I have taken CS 61A, 61B and MATH 53, 54, 55? I may need to brush up a little bit on the differential equations part from MATH 54 and the proof writing part from MATH 55 if those topics appear in 124. 

For more information, this will be my last semester. I only have one class requirement left for my major and I’m also doing another 3-unit Data Science discovery project.","Not sure about math 124 but I just wanted to say that Per-Olof Persson is a great lecturer. I took math 128a with him and really enjoyed it.
Hey @bearseatcardinals I’m enrolled in Math 124. I think you’re definitely prepared enough. I think The closest course to Math 124 is 61a.

You can find the old website from spring 23 by googling. I’m enrolled because I’m a senior data science & I need upper division units. I expect Math 124 to be about the same workload as 61a/b, or data100. 

I was actually enrolled in Math 124 in Spring 2020, but after a month I left the course (or took an NP, can’t remember). I do remember falling behind in the class, I kind of slept on the workload because I was overconfident and stretched myself too thin that semester. I was really impressed by how good the course is, and honestly would have retaken it sooner but…well I’m here now. Anywho, look forward to seeing you in class next semester.
How generous is he in term of grading and assignment deadlines?
I am in this class as well. Does he record lectures?"
Has anyone taken math with Per-Olof Persson?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4ef1r7/has_anyone_taken_math_with_perolof_persson/,2016-04-12 00:22:10,"I'm probably going to be taking 53 from him next term, and I was wondering what to expect. RateMyProfessor was...polarized.","I had Persson my freshman year (Fall 2011) for Math 1B, and enjoyed it.  He gave pretty good lectures but sometimes he went rather fast--at least for me.  Still, nothing the textbook couldn't compensate for.  Also, exams might have been on the harder side yet they were reasonable.
I had him for 228A.  He was very thorough, although I don't think experiences in 228A are meaningful comparisons for 53.
Fall 2011, but for Math 1B:
His lectures are very fast but clear. I recall him showing all the homework problems that will ever be assigned on the first day, so you could do them ahead of time and plan for them if you wished. He also allowed a cheat sheet with whatever we wanted on it for us to take into the exams, but that is because his exams are quite difficult (he once said that he liked to show off to his colleagues the difficult problems that his students can solve).
I am planning on taking 228A this upcoming fall. 

Which semester and year did you take Per? 

How would you evaluate the rigor of the course in terms of mathematical theory vs practical coding in the lectures (which I see a more emphasis of on his problem sets)

What did you think of the class? Enjoyable? Require a significant portion of time to complete assignments? 

Sorry I just want a feel for the class from someone who has had him before. 

Thanks



Thanks. Sadly, he got replaced with John Steel, who's infamously terrible. Ah well. If I have to, I can watch Frenkel's old lectures on youtube or something.
Fall 2011

Numerical numerical analysis by its very nature isn't particularly chock full of mathematical theory, rather it blends mathematical theory with computer science to produce approximations that are excellent approximations of closed form solutions (which don't exist most of the time).  If you want to learn about PDE theory, then you should take one of the PDE courses.  If you want a crash course in PDE theory and want to see how to apply the theory to solve real life problems, then that is what you will get.  You will go into the general idea behind PDE theory, but you won't do very extensive proofs of all of the different theorems.  The homeworks are very problem set oriented, but require knowledge of the theory in order to approximate errors.  Some of the problem sets required extensive profiling to get your code fast enough that the problems could actually run--the naive implementation would often be too slow.

I enjoyed the class, I felt that it was a good split between application and theory.  Per is very clear.  The homeworks did not require a significant amount of time if you have a good understanding of the material and are a strong programmer.  I generally enjoyed working on the problem sets, just because it is cool seeing your implementation of a PDE mesh get drawn before your eyes and to see the heat equation evolve over the mesh.  If you are feeling lost in terms of understanding of the material, I would suggest going to office hours, he was always very helpful in his office hours, and I believe he would always take all of the questions from his grad students before he got to the undergrads if there was overlap in his office hours.
Thanks for taking the time to provide your description and perspective. I think that this class is exactly what i'm looking for, judging from how you described it. I agree it seems so cool. I can't wait to mesh my domain and build my own solutions!!!

By the way, have you taken Math 126 (PDE class, more theoretical) before this, if at all? If so, did it help?

Also, what do you mean by being a ""strong programmer""? I like to think that I am one of those, but I'm not too sure about the different methods that this class will teach. Do you mean knowing how implement ""extensive profiling to get your code fast enough that the problems could actually run--the naive implementation would often be too slow"" kinda thing? or knowing the limitations of the computers

If you can elaborate, that would be spectacular. 




I did not take either 123 or 126, but I did take 204 (the graduate equivalent of 123) at the same time as 228A.  There were a lot of people (I'd say more than half of the class) that were in both 222A and 228A.  Per would usually present the underlying theorems for the numerical methods and defer to 222A for any deeper understanding of the theorems.

MATLAB has an excellent profiler built into it that will be able to tell you exactly which line(s) of code are using up most of the time in your code.  The issue then is figuring out how to rewrite your code so that it will run faster without affecting the functionality.  Per will give hints on what not to do in MATLAB occasionally in lecture.  My hint: use the backslash operator on matrices/vectors every opportunity that you can instead of for loops."
MATH W128A over the Summer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1agmod1/math_w128a_over_the_summer/,2024-02-01 13:49:56,What was it like taking this over the summer? Was it pretty chill and lax? ,"I took it a couple of years ago and it’s surprisingly well paced. I took it with Per Olof Persson, he was really great and easy to follow imo. I’m not sure who’s teaching it this summer though."
"Course Reviews Fall 2021, CS 161, CS 162, CS W186, CS 194-177 (DeFi), MATH 128A",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rpi4ev/course_reviews_fall_2021_cs_161_cs_162_cs_w186_cs/,2021-12-26 23:45:49,"CS 161 (Raluca Ada Popa, Nicholas Weaver):

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: ~4-5 hrs per week, ~10-15 during exam weeks and proj2.

Pros:

• Probably the lowest workload upper div CS class

• Fun and interesting projects, 1 and 3 are not time consuming at all and can be done in a night. Project 2 is a large time sink but it was also fun and the class gives you a ton of time to do it even if you start late

• Amazing course staff - the course staff this semester was super accommodating and honestly the best I've seen in a CS class at Berkeley so far. Helpful extensions during stressful weeks, letting slip days carry over Thanksgiving break, extra hw drops, flexible exam procedures, quick piazza response times, discussion TA

• Reasonable exams - if you do past exams and make notes of the textbook/lectures on your cheat sheet it's on the easier side to do well on the exams compared to other upper divs (no weirdly hard exams compared to content like CS 188, past exams have questions that are slight variations of each other)

• Great online textbook, super easy to catch up with lectures by using it if you fall behind or don't want to watch lecture.

Cons: 

• Personally I wish the class went more in depth on some topics, but it is a survey class so it can't be faulted that much here

• Sounds weird, but the projects might be TOO easy. Projects 1 and 3 could be more in depth and I think it would be fun to have harder challenges than the ones that they currently have. (Project 3 in particular has easier questions than many intro level CTF questions on web security). Considering project 2 requires probably 30-50 hours compared to the ~6 for project 1 and ~4 for project 3, I think there could be a better balance especially when each is weighted equally. However, I still think that project 3 should be on the lighter side given that it ends up being close to finals week. 

• The midterm exam felt kind of pointless this semester. So many questions were thrown out that it seemed like it didn't matter at all and the scores ended up very samey. The course staff (again, amazing) did make the final clobber the midterm though so it made this less of a problem.

Overall, a great class and would highly recommend especially if you want to round out a busy schedule without adding too much extra work.


CS 162 (Ion Stoica)

Rating: 8.5/10

Workload: ~20 hrs per week

Pros:

• You will definitely learn a ton. Probably the single class that has increased my computer science knowledge the most at Berkeley so far but also conceptually difficult.

• Adding onto the previous point, really interesting topics if you care at all about performance, systems, design.

• Rewarding - once I got a concept in this class or figured out the homeworks and projects it truly felt rewarding and I could actually say I learned something significant for pretty much every assignment.

• Good lectures - a bit boring and slow, but easy to follow and 2x is your friend.

• Good exams - studying definitely pays off, although a lot of it is just knowing terms + concepts (make a good cheat sheet) 

Cons:

• TONS of work - this is basically a 6-8 unit class. With the additions to the 2nd project, the workload  is even higher (proj 2 is definitely now the hardest one). Projects are all long and you constantly have one the whole semester, HWs are long and some are pretty much projects in other CS classes (spent more time on average per hw for this class than projects for 161).

• Course staff could have been a bit more accommodating w/ regards to projects. Proj 2 now has a new part which is basically 1 to 1.5 projects on its own. The project could have used a bit more guidance considering it's new and some parts required some tricky solutions that were quite confusing to grasp using just the spec + design review. Additionally, some extensions to proj 2 definitely would've helped considering it was during the busiest time of the semester as well. They did mention at the end of the class that the curve was adjusted to compensate for proj 2's increased definitely so that was great of them. 

• Discussion was mandatory and required camera on (some may not see this as a con, but it was annoying to me), some sections had participation that wasn't just based on showing up (? Could be wrong on this) 

• I would consider having a good group as a pre req for this class since the projects are a huge part of your grade, extremely time consuming, hard, and must be done in a group of 4. Make sure you have people you trust to work hard(at least 3/4) in your group or it will be a bad time. I was lucky enough to have 2 friends taking this class w/ me which helped a lot and our fourth group member(found through class) was also great.


CS W186 (Lakshya Jain)

Rating: 6.5/10

Workload: ~8-12 hrs per week

Pros: 

• Good transition to upper div CS classes, projects and topics use and build upon many skills and concepts from lower divs like 61B, 61C

• Lots of resources - web lectures, review lectures, discussion, class notes (really good class notes)

• Balanced workload over whole semester, can expect to spend the same amount of time each week and it's a reasonable amount of time even though you will always have a project going on.

• Exams are straightforward and similar to past exams while still testing knowledge

• Projects help you learn the material well

• Accommodating course staff - respound quickly, helpful extensions.

Cons:

• While it's a good intro to upper div classes, most of the concepts are systems concepts and are honestly just taught in a more general and better way in 162. So it might be more worthwhile to take this class before 162. 

• I personally thought the content was pretty boring.

• While exams are straightforward, much of it is calculation bash for I/Os or trying to figure out what some SQL does. This makes the exams straightforward, but long and tedious. 


CS 194-277: Decentralized Finance (Dawn Song, lots of profs from other universities)

Rating: 8/10

Workload: ~8-10 hrs per week. Weekly lecutre quizzes (completion), 2 labs, semester long group research project.

Pros:

• I loved the course content. Super new and exciting field and the class definitely hooked me into it. Lectures gave an overview of many DeFi topics and it was cool to hear lots of different professors speak.

• Great course staff - gave lots of help and extensions on the tough Lab 2 and helped w/ projects.

• The class has 2 labs, the second lab was really fun content wise and taught a lot about writing smart contracts (more of this later)

Cons: 

• This class is only 2 Units!!! It is far more work than a 2 unit class should be. At minimum thisshould be 3 units but I probably spent more time on this class than 161 and 186 (could be due to choosing and working longer on a harder project though, not sure how much they were expecting in the end)

•Lab 2 could have used a lot more guidance from the class itself. There was only one lecture on smart contracts and the lab required us to have a lot of underlying knowledge to complete that wasn't really available from the single lecture. To complete the lab, tons of documentation had to be scoured along with a super helpful guide a classmate wrote.

•i wish there were more hands on assignments scattered over the semester rather than 2 labs, the first of which was basically a small math assignment. Of course, this would mean more work but this assumes the class is now 3-4 units.


Math 128A: (Per-olof Persson)

Rating: 6/10

Workload: ~6-10 hrs per week, weekly psets, ocassional programming assignment, biweekly quizzes

Pros:

• Easiest required upper div applied math major class

Cons:

• HW length varied drastically, some later hw were easily 3x the length of some previous ones and I wished the use of my drops was in my control earlier in the semester. 

• slow grading of assignments, not too transparent with grades. Didn't really know my quiz grades or where my grade in the class stood at all the whole semester besides exam grades.

• I thought the topics were fairly interesting, learning how some numerical methods work, implementations and proofs, but overall still very boring compared to all of the other upper div math

• MATLAB","loving all the review threads!

thanks for sharing :)
I think for 162, maybe op didnt explicitly say, really rewards hard work you put in. 3 projects weigh equally as 3 midterms. I also took it this semester and I got full marks on HW, projects and discussion attendence with only +0.4, +0.5, -0.5 on the 3 midterms (no finals in this class) and still came out with an A. The curve is pretty insane I would say for a upper division CS class.


I will say theres a slight learning curve in the beginning of the class because they do throw a lot of concepts at you about OS without you understanding OS. It will all start making sense through HW and projects eventually.

One other tip on the group projects is have each other at least contribute code that passes -some- tests they give. Initially, you will spend more time understanding the given code base than writing code and getting 1 test they give to pass is a BIG deal. Plenty of friends I know who slacked on Proj1 and say they’ll contribute in Proj2/3 never did because they never understood how everything works together. Since all 3 projects build off each other, theres no “restarting” after a project finishes. So get each other to write code that works even if its minor because the understanding it takes to write code that works far exceeds the time to write the code


One thing OP didnt mention is OH for this class, especially projects (and sometimes hwk) is almost useless. Yes you can get general guidance but if youre asking “why isnt X working with my implementation”, chances are they dont know it since your solution varies so greatly with the staff and other students. Debugging on your own (or with your team) is by far the most essential skill to succeeding in this class.
How do you square what you learn about block chain in 161 with taking a DeFi class?
You mention that the workload for cs162 is \~20 hours per week. Is the course workload just a plateaud level throughout the semester? I.e - same amt of hw/disc/proj workload every week. And i guess this also depends on what grade you were aiming for(guessing an A)? Would love to know cause im taking this class next sem :)
Are lectures helpful in 162? Is the textbook better? Can you jump straight into assignments?
for math 128a, are they slow to release hw solutions? if so how would you know where the holes in your knowledge are?
i've read that 186 was a heavy time commitment project class at the same tier of 162, has that changed?
is the workload including lectures/labs ?
For the Defi class, are there any prerequisites? I’m taking 161 and 170 next semester along with that class.
How did you feel balancing the 4 techs?
thanks for this detailed review!
how long exactly (eg how many hours total/or how many days) did proj2 in 161 take you?
if my 61c  knowledge is lacking, will 186 of 161 be harder and which would have more workload?
>:)

:)
This is good advice about the class. Also for OH I agree that it wasn't too helpful. In person OH during project week is a mess and online is only slightly better because I'm pretty sure some TAs just read off the staff solution to help you fix code which kinda leads u in the right direction. Not ideal, but still a bit helpful when you are stressing about the project.
Blockchain definitely has it's issues which weaver was pretty adamant about pointing out  during the Blockchain lectures lmao.  ut the DeFi class definitely showed me that it also has huge potential. I'm of the thought that it's probably too early for it to go mainstream given how many security issues and shady things go on in Blockchain but the ideas behind it and possibilities it offers are really interesting.
So much of the variability on workload depends on the quality of your teammates. You really can’t do the work by yourself (you can but the class would turn into a 8-unit course), you need a bare minimum of 2 competent people in the group to split up the work, and preferably all 4 pull their weight.  I had a decent group where we all had solid all-around skills, so we alternated each of the 3 projects between code and design in pairs. Also, there are differences in who your TA is, some can be assholes when divvying out participation points at the end, so choose carefully.  Participation points is a non-trivial part of the grade.
Hmm it's pretty constant, I kinda averaged in my cramming time but it felt like it was similar work per week throughout aside from project 2 which I spent probably 20-30 hrs/week on during the last two weeks of the project.
Ngl. Opened up screen usage for VSCode and it was ~40hr/week near proj due dates. Treat it like a 9-5 job. Every week you’ll have something to do whether that’s a proj or hw assignment. Generally good advice is to start really early and stay on top of your shit. There are really rough weeks where project and hw are due on the same week, along with a midterm before or after. So really manage your time well. I’d say an average of 20-30hr/week consistently is what you can make best out of it if you start early and stay on top. 

Also, if you really want to succeed, choose good partners. If they have internship experience or proficient with C, usually okay indication. Otherwise you’re just gonna have a bad experience. Teammates in my group who were initially friends are not friends anymore and we sussed out the imposters who cant code.
There was a textbook but it was more like extra material, everything for exams and course content was from lecture + discussions. I'd say for assignments(hw, proj) you can manage off only discussions but for exams you wanna go through the slides/lectures.
Hw solutions were immediately available, but the grades weren't. The hw were completion/effort based I believe but was still kinda annoying to not have any idea of what grades were entered until right before grades were released.
I wouldn't say it's close to 162 at all. It has a lot of project work since you have 6 projects and basically 2-2.5 weeks per project but each is definitely manageable within 10 hours and the easier ones took less time than that. They are also in java and are much easier to debug so it's far less painful than 162 C code and dealing with pintos codebase. Total time spent over all projects on 162 is ~100-120 hours(includes design, design review, coding, debugging) while 186 is ~50 hours
Way different. If you really want to get the most out of a design/systems class, take 162. It was much more rewarding than 186. I also agree with OP and took both concurrently this semester. Take 186 if you want an easy way out of the design req for CS upper division with some project based learning involved , although it seems like OPs review of 161 indicates that’s the better option.
Yup, although I definitely didn't watch every lecture or go to every discussion, this includes the time to learn the material per week.
The class being offered next sem is actually different from the DeFi one this past fall, but should be similar in areas. I think you could take it without any pre reqs, just basic cs knowledge and maybe some of the math stuff from cs70 will help (barely part of the class though, maybe more of a part in next sems version)
Was pretty rough especially during some of the midterm weeks where I would end up having 2 projects + 2 midterms due the same week and then more midterms next week, etc but I still had decent free time on weekends + time spent procrastinating during week. Im certain someone with better time management could have pretty free weekends aside from some busy weeks.
Any advice on which TAs to pick or avoid?
thanks, and what grade were yall aiming for? i feel like hours will vary a LOT if youre trying to get a good grade vs just pass
my 2 cents is that good partners != internships/being smart etc.

&#x200B;

everyone took 61c and knows c and knows gdb (some more than others ofc) and well we are all at berkeley so we are all capable enough at figuring out the material. but 162 introduces a weird codebase that nobody really will have prior exp working with and so what you really want to be looking for and, this is kinda hard without already working w them, is work ethic and time commitment imo. this class is going to asking for a lot of time sometimes and if a deadline is coming up, you need to make sure that your entire team is on the same page.
damn what if i am looking to just get a C- or above in the course, do you think it'll still be really bad? I'm not about to put in 40/hr week just for one class lol. Taking 162 just for the knowledge rather than the coding skills. Doing part time internship as well..
side question: how do people know whether the textbook's info is necessary to a class (any class not 162) or not? do they look at the practice tests super early? ask people who've taken the class?
what did you mean in math 128a that you wish you could've been in charge of your hw drops?
Yeah aiming for an A, although I feel like you would still want to go for at least a 90% on project points even if you weren't which still requires a mostly working solution, maybe subtract ~10 hours per project for debugging. Exam studying could cut down quite a bit of time however if not aiming for an A.
That is probably doable. I genuinely think you can’t fail a CS course unless you put zero effort, especially if it’s a curved class. If you PNP and put in some effort on exams, hw, and proj with a good group, I’d say P is guaranteed. But be low key amongst your groupmates about PNPing, cause they’ll think you’re a crutch to the group. Just note that in group projects, you’ll evaluate each other on how much work everyone contributed. If you think you can contribute to a fourth of the project or you’re willing to be a chad and contribute minimum effort and take a low group evaluation, go for it.
I honestly didn't even know we had a textbook, never looked at it. Everything is covered in lecture and the projects.
People usually ask on piazza at the beginning of class or during first lecture
Oh I wasn't too specific here but I fell sick and had to use some drops then also used another when I had a super busy week and didn't have any left for much harder hw that I wished I could've dropped lmao"
