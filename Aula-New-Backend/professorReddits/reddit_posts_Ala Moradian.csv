ME 110 Moradian,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h9mdb6/me_110_moradian/,2020-06-15 11:53:53,"Hello. Looking to take ME110 Product Development With Prof Ala Moradian. Has anyone taken this course? If so, could you comment on workload, difficulty, grading, etc. Thanks!",I took 110 in the spring with moradian and the class had a light workload but you are able to put in more work if you’re invested in your product and the teaching staff would be happy to help. The grading was explicit with clear point allocations for and within each individual and team assignment. No assignment took longer than a couple hours and there were one to three a week. Some took less than 5 minutes because they were feedback surveys for a guest speaker. Attendance is required and included in your grade. You don’t need to be a meche major to take the class but it would certainly help.
