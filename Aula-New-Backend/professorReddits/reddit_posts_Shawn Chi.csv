Econ 100B Professor Shawn Chi,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17vzyw5/econ_100b_professor_shawn_chi/,2023-11-15 10:21:05,"Hello!

I am taking Econ 100B with Shawn Chi in the spring and I was just wondering how he is as a teacher? Super hard? What is course structure? Lots of problem sets and midterms?

Thanks!","no problem sets, just practice quizzes (which are relatively easy, they‚Äôre online and unlimited attempts)‚Ä¶ two midterms. teaching is alright, i think he‚Äôs new so not that strong of a lecturer in that sense but he is a very kind person and understanding of his students! the first midterm was really hard and he promised to make adjustments for the next one (which is tmr morning, wish me luck)
As a lecturer, he's quite boring. But that doesn't mean he's a bad prof\*. You'll just be sitting in class a little distracted / unmotivated. The first midterm was hard, but if you study hard on concepts + the relationships between diff vars/policies, you can do well. I think the reason why people did so badly this sem was bc the hw assignments, disc questions and clicker questions (for attendance) were dramatically easier than the test content. Very unprepared even with practice material, but I still think the content was fair. The second midterm happened today and just like another comment said, he definitely made it easier. So he takes feedback well and def wants students to do well. I dont think you should be scared at all but if you ever need assistance, the gsis, the prof, and the slc are great resources. Just ask for help and it'll go a long way.

> i think he‚Äôs new so not that strong of a lecturer in that sense

This summed up a vast amount of professors. Being an accomplished researcher does not mean they are good at teaching others. 

Universities across the country should really invest into training their lecturers in public speaking, clarity of speech, grading, scheduling, etc.
Nice!! You got this!!!
Thank you so much!!
Great lol
Thank you!!"
econ 100b shawn chi,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15es0qr/econ_100b_shawn_chi/,2023-07-31 14:03:41,why is this 8am literally not recorded fml. is there anyway we can convince this new professor to recordd,"Time to set your alarm and take your coffee black, u gon learn about the E C O N O M Y  

(I'll see you there OP I also will die)
Yeah lots of econ profs don‚Äôt like to record if they don‚Äôt have to (especially if they‚Äôre on the older side). Tho 8 am does suck, I remembered good ole Hawkins who always had his class at like 5 or 6 pm
Nah fr my jaw dropped when I saw the Ed post.
I don‚Äôt think so, unfortunately prof doesn‚Äôt think wheeler 150 is a suitable room to record in üòì RIP to us all we‚Äôre all just gonna have to cope ig
literally dropped and taking it next sem once i saw that syllabus üíÄ
RIP
I read the title and thought you were making some Shang Chi joke
it's recorded all in media gallery
doesn't change the fact that midterm was AIDS
what did said ed post entail üò≠ i just took 100b w chauvin and i can‚Äôt imagine it getting any worse than that
U have to attend the lectures at 8 am in person cuz there is no recordings
ours was the same because apparently they can‚Äôt ‚Äúlegally‚Äù record lectures anymore ??? idk what happened but 8am is tough gl"
ECON 100b shawn chi,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/179dtwx/econ_100b_shawn_chi/,2023-10-16 12:05:12,Need to know! How is ECON 100B with Shawn Chi? Good? Bad? Better or worse than ECON 100A with Campbell? Let me know!!!!!!,"have him currently, would not recommend"
Econ majors: 100b with shawn chi or 140 w ben faber?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17w2vsj/econ_majors_100b_with_shawn_chi_or_140_w_ben_faber/,2023-11-15 12:27:45,Who's easier or ig less anal,"Takin 100b rn he‚Äôs ok
Faber‚Äôs class was a joke‚Ä¶ so I def recommend that
100b with shawn chi is fine. he's a nice professor, slightly boring lecturer, and not anal at all. he def cares for the success of the kids\* but that didn't kick in really until we all flopped on midterm 1. regardless of what people might say from this sem, the content of midterm 1 was fair, just timing issues. i think 100b in general is a doable class :)

i've only ever taken 140 with seamus li\* and while he's severely disorganized, econ 140 with him is v easy and smooth. assignments and tests were all easy points. would reccommend if you don't mind late posts, late professors, and if you like regressions.
Hi!

**Could you share more details about seamus li\~  I'm taking econ 140 with him this summer.**
Li's 140 is much easier than Faber's because it focuses on knowing the concepts and not so much of the details. His problem sets are heavily code but does not require any prior knowledge of R at all, I promise. The psets often consists of a copy and paste style-- so you very rarely need to create your own coding solution, just interpretation of a regression. In terms of exams, I think he writes pretty fair exams. They are not too difficult if you look at the practice material and the graders are usually generous with points. The class also has a final project aside from the 2 midterms and final exam that is a replication study. You find some econ study to replicate using thier dataset and write about it then present a short (3-5 min) pres on it.

Thigngs to note: When I took the class (Summer 2023) the exams were all short answers but now (as of Spring 2024) they have a MC portion then some short answers. The major con to Li's class is that he is disorganized and tends to make mistakes during demos and has a record of showing up late to class. He often seems frazzled and tends to repeat himself a lot during class (sometimes half of the class will be review of last lecture which does not actually strengthen your understanding lol. it's a waste of time and it continues to repeat over and over...).

Feel free to dm me for any other questions"
econ 100b with mirazimi fall 2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ccfiqx/econ_100b_with_mirazimi_fall_2024/,2024-04-24 18:28:08,"she seems to be a new prof but is currently teaching ugba 101b. if anyone has taken a class with her, would you recommend? based on course load, communication, grading?

idk who else teaches 100b since hawkins left except for shawn chi and idk if it's worth waiting for him to teach the course in a diff sem.","she‚Äôs currently teaching 101a not b. class is easy, but i wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs a good prof. her slides are messy and not high quality, and her lectures are really hard to pay attention in (ive also asked some others in the class and they agree). course load is light but not sure if that‚Äôs just haas being haas and if that‚Äôll change once she moves to econ department. her exams are all multiple choice this semester at least
do you mind sharing how her exams are and if they are relatively difficult or not? thank you!
was it easy to get an A in her class?
are her lectures mandatory to attend?
they're not too difficult. she curved every exam so the median is 80%
yeah. i got an A. this was her first sem teaching so she might've been more lenient but it definitely wasn't hard to get an A
yes - sorta. she has in-class quizzes that are password protected on canvas and you have to be in class to get the password. the quizzes are every lecture and its' just one question. super easy and you get multiple attempts if you don't get it right the first time. it's mostly an attendance tracker. the quizzes are worth a portion of your grade, but you can make up attendance via Ed Discussion
thank you! :D"
Econ 100b midterm,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1azxgds/econ_100b_midterm/,2024-02-25 12:06:55,I‚Äôm taking macro with professor Shawn Chi. Any study tips or something to prepare for his midterms? Thank you in advance,"Took 100b with him last year, good luck lol
i was literally about to ask this here i am personally freaking the fuck out
I studied for those midterms this order: Quick Quizzes/Work It Out/Other textbook stuff THEN EOC review for each chapter, Practice Midterm, GSI Selected Questions/GSI Practice Midterms (prioritizing the ones that were already in the same document and/or had answers with steps), then if I had extra time I‚Äôd redo everything I got wrong initially in the textbook stuff.
freaked out too before the exam yesterday - how did it go for you"
Econ 100B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17ih74z/econ_100b/,2023-10-28 09:19:24,"Hello!
How hard is Econ 100B? I have it with the new guy. I believe his name is Shawn Chi. Just wanted some insight because I am scared lol. I have already taken Econ 140, but I am jsut worried about 100B.
Thanks!","If you've taken 140 I don't think it'll be a problem. I can say he is definitely one of the worse professors but I think it may be because this is his first time trying to teach a class. Especially one of this size makes it kind of a logistical nightmare. The first test was online with no proctor and the average was 50%. Our next one is going to be in person. He said that ""As long as you do your assignments and show up to the tests you won't fail"". While I don't think he's a great professor, he seems to be willing to improve as a teacher and has already changed some things around for the better. If everyone else does.bad on the Midterms last semester he will curve it anyways so I doubt you'll have to worry about it. You'll be fine."
Help! Do I choose Econ 100b or Econ 101b,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17gu3t3/help_do_i_choose_econ_100b_or_econ_101b/,2023-10-26 04:14:57,"First year deciding between econ 100b with shawn chi or Econ 101b with GORODNICHENKO Y.

Idk
I am leaning towards yuriy over chi. Do you think 101a is better to take than 101b or should I take both. Also do you think you need math 53 for the class I am in math16b
I ha.ve also taken econ 2, but I also struggle in math a bit."

100b makes me wanna cry ngl
shawn chi is ass man
Slc for the econ classes and office hours for stat 20
Took stat20,econ100b and an econ upper div this semester + an easier class. It was rough, but I also had some other commitments that took up time. If you have the time to really focus on your classes during the semester, its manageable
any tips?
any tips for 100b üò≠
i've heard mixed responses tbh. how was your experience w/ him?
appreciate it
Pray to God
Real talk though I think you should give the practice/‚Äúwork it out‚Äù questions a shot those helped me somewhat. Other students say SLC is legit so ig that too. Prayer doesn‚Äôt hurt too much
nice guy who cares  
class average is 50% on his 2 midterms , avg test score is curved to B+  
barely can understand him talk
bet, thanks a lot!
oh noo üò≠ i heard ppl prefer reading the textbook over watching the lectures... any thoughts on that?"
Econ 100b midterm,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/176ca5s/econ_100b_midterm/,2023-10-12 10:20:26,wtf is this exam ?????? It's nothing like the practice exam ,"yeah who thef has a midterm out of 36 with like 9 multiple choice questions being calculations
if he doesn't give us all a fat curve up we should petition for a freaking clobber lol
I hate shawn chi bruh
I couldn‚Äôt upload the pdf images from my computer because the question didn‚Äôt wanna accept the file and I had to make a doc with screenshots and it took up so much time
It was ROUGH, hoping it gets curved ü§û
this is why u dont use basic ass arithmetic MCQ as hw to prep ur students for the exam
i don‚Äôt even think i could do any better on the final for the clobber to work üò≠
‚Äúbruh‚Äù describes my midterm experience too üòì
Literally the SAME!!!!"
