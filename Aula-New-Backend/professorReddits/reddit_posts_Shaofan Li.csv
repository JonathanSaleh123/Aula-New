ME C85,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s3n993/me_c85/,2022-01-14 00:17:28,"Hello, For those of you who have taken Me c85, what’s the difficulty of this course? Is it hard to get an A? thoughts on the Professor Shaofan Li? Have a tough courseload next semester (4 technicals) and would rlly appreciate the insight.","Had Prof Li for E7. Almost impossible to follow his lectures but the C85 material isnt very hard, the book does a good job and there's a youtube channel called the Efficient Engineer that goes over the concepts in a really helpful way. Li loves giving out As and again, the material isnt hard, so overall should be an easy W for you. May not even need to attend lectures
This is the first time Shaofan Li is teaching the class in a long time. With other professors in the past, it’s been difficult but not impossible to get an A depending on who was teaching. When Li taught E7 people said it was super easy but they didn’t learn much, so that’s what I would expect for C85 as well.
I took C85 last semester with Keaveny. The class average on final exam was 65 out of 100. He eventually give 10% curve. Never heard if anyone got A.
As far as Shafon Li is concerned, I never heard good stuff about him from my friends who took E7.
Please don't take 4 technicals with C85 you will regret neither you are gonna get A.
Not bad.  F = 0.   Rest is algebra.  Easy A- at the least.
Thanks! Are the exams hard for me c85?
Thanks! How are the exams for this class?
thanks!
Thanks
I took the class when we were online. The exams were a huge time crunch and they were pretty difficult, but you will have seen most of the material before."

I’m personally a bit concerned about this, mainly due to the fact that there are students who chose to stay home after being told that classes would be remote, and he only just announced today that we would be in person starting next Monday.","Dunno tbh since I'm alr here in person but I'm pretty sure there will be live zoom recording for those remote when the time comes.
yeah same here. just kinda confused why he didn’t just send out an email about this earlier"
