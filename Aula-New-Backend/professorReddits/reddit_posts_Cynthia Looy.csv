a fellow n curious bear :)","I took Bio1B as an engineering major (it was either that or Chem 1A) and actually quite enjoyed the course. It taught me to digest large amounts of information and improved my study habits. I do remember thinking the Evolution section was the easiest. 

We had a field trip up to the botanical gardens, which was really cool.

When I took it, we had a quiz where we identified a bunch of specimens in lab. It was surprisingly easy-you'll realize how much you've learned throughout the semester.

I don't know how it compares to other biology courses, but I heard 1B is relatively easy. Every now and then terms like ""haplodiplontic"" resurface in my head. Good times (I graduated this semester).
By any chance were you an IEOR major?"
