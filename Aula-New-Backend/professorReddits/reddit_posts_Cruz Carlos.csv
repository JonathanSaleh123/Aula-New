CIV ENG 60 Grade Bins?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uewduc/civ_eng_60_grade_bins/,2022-04-29 14:44:58,Hey! I was wondering if anyone whoâ€™s taken CE60 with Cruz Carlos (or any other prof) knows what the grade bins look like? Thanks!!,"they should be normal grade bins: 90+ = A, 80+ = B 70+ = C etc!
Alright thanks!"
