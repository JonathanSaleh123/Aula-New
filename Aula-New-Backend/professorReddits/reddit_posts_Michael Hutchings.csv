An Update to Everything Happening in Math 54,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10t23lw/an_update_to_everything_happening_in_math_54/,2023-02-03 18:02:36,"This is an update to everything that has happened in Math 54 over the past few weeks, the first post about this can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10qa5ll/an_explanation_of_whats_happening_in_math_54/).

On Wednesday night, the Math Department sent out an email saying that the replacement instructor for Dr. Talaska was going to be Norman Sheu. Up to this point, whether you were enrolled in Lecture 001 (M / W / F) or Lecture 002 (Tu / Th) in Calcentral didn't matter and you could go to either lecture and to discussions in either class. However, with Professor Sheu taking over, the email said that this would no longer be the case as the classes would be fully independent, and that students should make an effort to switch to the correct class if they weren't already.

Yesterday's lecture for Professor Wehrheim had been cancelled, but at around 3pm Prof. Wehrheim posted on the class's Ed forum. The post detailed a proposal for the class to keep relatively the same structure as before, resuming once Prof. Wehrheim returned from medical leave, which was at the very least planned until Feb. 8th. The post was long, but Prof. Wehrheim seemed to be committed to continuing the class.

Around 8 hours later, at 10pm, the Math Department sent out another email saying that Prof. Wehrheim would no longer be the instructor for Lec 002, and that they were looking for another instructor teaching the class according the standard department syllabus. Math 54 would still satisfy all university requirements and count towards pre-reqs, majors, etc., just that it would be adjusted because of the class essentially starting over three weeks in.

And now, a few hours ago, Prof. Wehrheim updated their proposal post on Ed to clarify that the Math Department had removed them as instructor without their consent and without consultation. Prof. Wehrheim mentions that they had met with the Math Department Chair Michael Hutchings on Tuesday, in which he had assured them ""it's your course, you're the boss"" and Prof. Wehrheim also uploaded all 45+ minutes of this meeting with Michael Hutchings onto the class's bCourses page. They went on to say that they would continue to ""support the learning and teaching of Linear Algebra and Differential Equations,""  apologized for everything happening to everyone taking the class, and that is where things stand now.","drama@berkeley
Lol she uploaded the meeting with the chair? Honestly her class format is pretty flawed despite being a good idea in principle, and also I was surprised how she described her format as flexible when it is the most prescriptive shit I‚Äôve ever seen.
Just to add on, yesterday's update included stuff like:

""Students who are enrolled in Lec002 and do not take these steps to opt in are encouraged to take their own steps to switch into Lec001 ‚Äî see the second paragraph above. In addition, I would provide a list of these students to our administration with the request to switch them into Lec001 ‚Äî or drop them from the course if there is no substantial work in the course so far, and no explanation for that. If that turns out to be impossible, then I would assign incomplete grades to all students who have been caught in this unfortunate situation.

Students who remain enrolled in Lec002 and don‚Äôt opt in ‚Äî or opt in but act in serious disrespect for our Community of Inquiry may be excluded from all support structures (including forum and take-home assessments) and assigned an incomplete grade. ""

We had to opt in (basically agree with their proposal) to stay in the class, or else you would be dropped/forcibly removed/given an incomplete.
Wait, what happened with Dr. Talaska? I had her for 10A
üëÄ üçø
That's crazy! Thank you for the continued updates. To all those in the class, wish you the best.
Welcome to Berkeleys, secret bad math plan. Designed to destroy society by either driving us all crazy, insisting we completely accept their math; or make us all really dumb, if we actually manage to ""learn"" it. Either way, it's an elimination of the brightest, plan. Made by those who passed and understood the bad math. 
Good luck. 
Remember variables matter.

Any more updates? What happened with this? Did the full 130-page manifesto get released?
Not in this class but curious: what's special about the class format?
That‚Äôs the dumbest possible take on the text you just sent. They (not she, they) literally said that you should not take their lecture if you don‚Äôt like the way they structure their class and instead take lecture 001, which is structured in a more conventional way. That is the obvious point of that post. The thing is not ‚Äútake my class or get dropped or an incomplete‚Äù it is ‚Äútake my class, or the other class, or get dropped or an incomplete‚Äù which seem to be the only options no matter who is teaching the course. How you got your interpretation demonstrates a shocking lack of reading comprehension.

What the post actually is saying: ‚Äúswitch to lecture 001 if you don‚Äôt like my class structure/if you‚Äôre not willing to do the work for the class

What you claimed it‚Äôs saying: ‚Äúdrop or incomplete if you don‚Äôt like my class structure‚Äù 

The two are very obviously different
Medical leave.
but she‚Äôs teaching 10B still?
Edit: I apologize for my writing. I recognize it is not my strong suit, but I tried to make it readable. Also, sorry for the long response; I think I might turn this into a post.

First of all there are no exams. Your grade is based on completing checkboxes through at home ‚Äúskill quizzes‚Äù, group work, and prework before each lecture and section. Hence why this class was considered an essay A. 

In addition to that, there are no official resources for this class in terms of a textbook, slides or a lectures you could watch. Lecture is another glorified discussion section where the professor might or might not take 10 minutes to explain something. Basically you have to figure everything out by yourself. And to be fair they link some resources at the end of each worksheet which are usually mathisfun links or chapters to an optional textbook. In my and some other friends‚Äô opinion these resources don‚Äôt usually match the depth of what we are learning.

The problem is you have 6 hours per week of mandatory class attendance divided in 3 lectures and 3 sections for Tallaska‚Äôs portion of the class (Werheim has 2 lectures of 1.5h) that are all group work and those 6 hours are accompanied by ‚Äúprework‚Äù assignments that are supposed to prepare you for the groupwork. These prework assignments are also really badly written which makes it super frustrating as they are the only thing we have to work with. 

Anyways, these format of ‚Äúinquiry based learning‚Äù could work if they gave you a foundation before group work (maybe let lectures be lectures) and the only materials the class relies on were well written. 

Lastly, a side note about accessibility:

I am sure Werheim had the best intentions, but I feel she achieved the opposite of what she was aiming for.  Sure, this class is an easy A and not a gatekeeping class, but students without a strong math background and time are going to have a bad time regardless of the grade. There‚Äôs a way more efficient way of making you think critically without wasting your time. Who is at an advantage here? The student who has 10-20 hours of part-time work or the student who doesn‚Äôt need to work to afford Berkeley (assuming a normal workload of 4 courses for both)? Sure, I get the thing about thinking critically and asking questions but university is also about sharing knowledge and giving you some things chewed as bad as it sounds. A lot of courses at Berkeley give you a foundation and then let you branch out from there by giving you hard problems to think about without reinventing the wheel into a square.

Furthermore, as a student with ADD this class was a nightmare. I like group work, but I cannot concentrate when all those 6 hours of mandatory attendance are group work. I am basically coming into these classes naked in terms of preparedness because the prework worksheets don‚Äôt give you any solid foundation and are badly written. Then I have to theorize with other groups talking all around me for a whole hour with my own group which is often also unprepared. Somehow I am expected to be focus and productive under all these circumstances. 

There are very few cases where I can see a class format like this working without being inaccessible. You have to have a very light courseload and the learning materials for the class are appropriate and not some messy overcrowded badly written mess of a weekly worksheet. 

I really don‚Äôt know what is going on Werheim‚Äôs mind to think this course is flexible and accesible. 

 Finally, a clarification before I end the comment. I don‚Äôt want to make it sound like I hate the idea of going to class by talking about the mandatory attendance. In fact I usually go to every lecture and section in my classes even if they are not mandatory. However, the lack of flexibility and super prescriptive format (6 hours of group work divided in 6 classes preceded by mandatory prework for each one) is frustrating. We are students, but we are also people with lives and responsibilities outside school.

Oh I'm sorry to hear that, she was always so nice to me.
Oh wait idk if she's teaching 10b this semster, I had her 2 years ago
Yes I'm in 10B and she is still teaching it.
This format also sounds like a nightmare for people on the autism spectrum. 6 hrs/wk of group work?
Wow, if you have a schedule conflict you have to take the only class available, & if you don‚Äôt like the only class available, you have to incomplete or drop. What part of this is specific to how they teach the class and not something that would be completely the same in literally any other class???

Edit: they blocked me and Reddit cared me for this lmao so idk what their actual reply is
It is funny that we had an assignment about privilege and disadvantages that people may have (invisible disabilities, low income, etc.) and then she creates a course like this lol
[deleted]
And these people are teaching math
Except you do realize how that expectation is not only completely reasonable but literally impossible for them to do otherwise? If you don‚Äôt like the class, aren‚Äôt willing to do it, and have a time conflict for the other lecture, literally what other option do you have lol?

They Reddit cared me too, imagine telling everyone who points out how stupid you‚Äôre being to k*ll themselves lol"

> You are hired to make stop signs, on a temporary contract which may be renewed if your performance is satisfactory. You make the stop signs bright colors such as hot pink, fluorescent yellow, etc., adapted to local preferences. Your employer tells you that you are expected to make red stop signs. You argue that your stop signs prevent more accidents because their brighter colors attract more attention, and surveys show that your stop signs are more popular than red ones. Your employer says that your stop signs are indeed very nice, but the tradition in this country is that stop signs are red. Your employer believes that unannounced color changes are in fact less safe because they confuse people, and in any case, you were hired to make stop signs according to your employer's specifications. You continue to make stop signs the way that you are convinced is best. Your employer does not renew your contract. You claim you were fired because your employer felt threatened by your superior stop signs. Really?

His response was kind of silly IMO.   Doesn't address Hutchings argument at all but instead just tries to make a thing out of the particular analogy he uses.

From what I hear about Coward from his students, I don't think he's making new and shiny stop signs as much as he's building roundabouts (or new ways to approach math). After all, don't his students still understand the concepts of math he's been hired to teach? Is the point of making a stop sign to teach drivers to associate red with stop or convey the broader message that they should be driving more safely in the area around them? Just like how roundabouts have been shown to be capable of keeping drivers safe, Coward should be able to teach if his students are learning.

I guess it didn't sound like he was pointing out that it's a bad analogy, but merely trying to say something like ""Education should be about GO-ing, not STOP-ing"".  But the comment was short so it's open to interpretation.
Do you really think if he used a ""better"" analogy coward would have actually addresses the substance instead of just trying to paint these people negatively by the virtue of them using an analogy, or should they just find new things to compare this to that he might like?
Coward didn't actually say anything. He basically said ""this is the thing you're comparing department policy to,"" and then followed it up with the punchline ""wow,"" as if that somehow invalidates the analogy.
[deleted]
Like it or not what happened is simply what happened in his analogy, he did not listen to his employer, as so was not renewed. Coward may have problems with the analogy, but he's trying to sell ""these people think of you as like a hamburger/stop sign, where I think of you as people""
[deleted]
While he has some leeway, as a lecturer he has to listen to the Dept, he does not get to teach however he wants"
