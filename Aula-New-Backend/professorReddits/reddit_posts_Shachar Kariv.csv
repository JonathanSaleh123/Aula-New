"Daily Cal released a database of professor's salaries. Professor Shachar Kariv of Economics tops the list at over $500,000",http://projects.dailycal.org/paychecker/,2016-09-21 19:17:19,,"Damn, lecturers who don't have full-on faculty gigs have shit pay.
How do some of these professors make so much? And what accounts for the huge discrepancy? Does just bringing in more grant money equate to higher salaries? I'm really curious all the variables involved.
Here is where you can look up the salaries of all UC employees:

Can't believe someone as incompetent and immature as Thorner makes $188k. 
Ma boi Denero only makes 130k smh

Where did they get the data from?
Private schools pay a crazy high amount for professors. It's just what the market demands for professors. I honestly don't find anything here that is too outrageous. Most of the highly paid ones seem to belong to Law and Business who are mostly professors for the graduate schools. 
One factor is negotiations to keep them. If they get an offer somewhere else, professors are in a good position to ask for a raise 
thriving in academia is a long/tough process. add the 5/6/7 years of grad school on a barely satisfactory stipend along with a publish or perish environment during post-doc and up until tenure, along with tenure itself being ultra competitive, not to mention all the politics drama that academia has, and it's understandable why CS is desirable.
This guy in econ academia is pretty much at the top of the top in terms of pay, a very small percentage of people who even can become professors will make this much money. People at that percentile of CS grads will make much more money, and the average grad will have higher lifetime earnings because while someone else is in grad school+postdoc+nontenure professor years their pay is significantly lower than an industry position.

If you want to maximize earnings becoming a professor is not the way to go.
As state employees, professors' salaries are public.
Obviously. Nobody goes to a PhD thinking it's the best paying gig. The most materialistic of them might think it gives good perks or reliability, but the point of going to that field is pursuing the creation of knowledge.

Econ 201A as an undergrad,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12dgcxu/econ_201a_as_an_undergrad/,2023-04-06 03:53:43,"Anyone here taken Econ 201A? I'm considering taking it this fall but was unsure if it would be too much for an undergrad. I have a decent amount of proof-based math experience (104, 110, 128A) and have taken Econ 101A/B and 103. It's being taught by Shachar Kariv and Christina M Shannon, and was curious about its relative difficulty compared to other math/econ classes","did you end up taking it? if so, could you share your expirience? thx!
I’m taking it next semester as an undergrad. In the same boat as you. Don’t really know what the class is about.
Did you need to email the prof for an enrollment code or something?
Yes. A- or higher required in Real Analysis too."
