is David Culler a good prof for cs162?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bay4uv/is_david_culler_a_good_prof_for_cs162/,2019-04-08 12:40:19,I'm thinking of taking 162 next semester. Culler doesn't have great ratings on ratemyprofessor but some buddies of mine said the lecturer for 162 doesn't really matter. Should I skip out on Culler and wait for a better prof or just take it anyways?,"imo I agree that professor doesn’t matter as much for 162 as long as you keep up with the textbook and discussion sections. I took it with Ion Stoica who was one of the worst lecturers I’ve had here (like 40/500 students showed up for lecture) and I still felt like I got a ton from the class.
I had Culler for a graduate seminar and I thought he was good, seemed like a nice guy and  smart. Obviously a grad seminar is a little different than an undergrad class, but I think he'd be fine."
Does CS162 usually have a final with David Culler?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/c81k3a/does_cs162_usually_have_a_final_with_david_culler/,2019-07-01 16:08:38,Title,"The last time he taught it was fall 2014, so its probably not a good comparison. Our last draft schedule had 1 midterm and a final, but that's being changed again so we really haven't decided."

"David Culler, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, was appointed to be interim dean for the newly created Division of Data Sciences. He will begin his new role on July 1 for a two-year term. He joined the Cal faculty in 1989, and since then has served as EECS department chair.",http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/05/25/eecs-professor-david-culler-named-interim-dean-for-data-sciences/,2017-05-25 23:07:16,,"Anyone know what the new organizational structure is for the ""Division of Data Science""?  Is it a department?  Is it underneath the EECS department?  Is it in the CoE or L&S?
Not sure about being underneath the EECS department, but I would be very surprised if it was in CoE. Reason being- the more ""math-ie"" your major is in CoE, the more physical sciences breadth you're required to take. For example- Engineering Math and Statistics has to take Physics 7A/B/C, plus Chem 1A/1AL; IEOR has to take Physics 7A/B, Chem 1A/1AL, and three physical sciences breadth courses (like ME 40, MSE 45, CE 70, etc...). 

There would be no real reason to ask Data Science students to take these courses, so I imagine that program will not be in CoE due to insufficient focus on the physical sciences.
Academic divisions are generally organizational units headed by an academic dean (not the dean of students who is a student affairs administrator). Each college/school is a division, except L&S which has five: Humanities, Math & Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Interdisciplinary Studies (the last one also includes all undeclared undergrads).

There is already a School of Information which includes classes/programs in data sciences. It's unclear if this new division will replace SOI, be part of it, or be part of a different college (perhaps COE). They have not released the details. 

Overall, I'm wary of it since it seems like either a case of administrative bloat and/or an over inflated title. Berkeley already has too many colleges/schools, and we should focus on making the existing ones work better. I'm a proponent of breaking up L&S into four or five totally separate colleges and merging some of the tiny colleges into them (e.g. COC into a new College of Math & Physical of Sciences). Title inflation has also been very prevalent under Dirks. If you compare the top administration org chart today to the one in 2013, you'll see he's been handing out Vice Chancelorial titles like candy.    
Isn't there a College of Information now? Also why not split up EECS as most students (?) just do CS and don't require Physics.
EECS already is split up. If you get a degree in the EECS department you have to chose between ""Electrical and Computer Engineering"" and ""Computer Science and Engineering.""
No there is no college of information

I meant [school](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/), not sure if the same thing as college though.
there's a difference between college and school
Ah, I thought you meant like a college as in L&S or Engineering. "

Data Science approved as an L&S major!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8cy6ti/data_science_approved_as_an_ls_major/,2018-04-17 10:09:25,"From the Chancellor:

""Dear campus community,

We are writing with updates on Berkeley’s active engagement with the burgeoning and exciting field of data science, which has the potential to shape numerous fields of study and practice.

Our undergraduates will have many options for studying data science in depth. Of note is a recently approved Data Science major in the College of Letters and Science, effective in Fall 2018, and one in Engineering, which is currently undergoing design and review. A minor is also under consideration for students in all colleges. Even now, more than 3,000 students a year are enrolled in data science courses.

Efforts are also afoot at the graduate level, where we already have three successful masters programs in data science, designated emphases for PhD students, and soon a graduate certificate. Particularly exciting is the student community that has formed, assisting faculty throughout campus to develop new data science-related curricula and discovery experiences.

Data Science is also having a major effect on the creation of new knowledge in nearly every field and profession including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), arts and humanities, and social sciences. Reflecting this evolution, this year we have asked that academic units consider, in their faculty hiring plans, the connections to Data Science that may exist in their fields.

Advancing our efforts in the field of data science was the motivation for our appointing an interim Dean of Data Sciences, David Culler. He is working closely with us and the rest of the Berkeley community on the question of organizational structures for Data Science that will best meet our needs. We anticipate that during the coming academic year we will continue to engage the campus community in broadly inclusive discussions to move our plans forward. We will keep you posted as opportunities to engage in this discussion develop.

For more information about transformative work underway in data science, please see data.berkeley.edu.

 

Sincerely,

Carol Christ, Chancellor

I wonder how hard it will be to transfer into Data Science from a CCC -- was looking at applied math w/cluster in CS but this looks enticing.

How does data science differ to the ORMS major?

Was wondering the same. I'm not sure how it could be much different other than harder for entering undergrads to get into. But hey, what do I know.

Going to his CS286B office hours to bug him about expanding enrollment sounds like a great way to REALLY piss him off. So does spamming him via email.

Look at the waitlist. Clearly there is a ton of demand. He knows that. Everyone knows it.

Demand is not the only or even main factor here. Room space and TA resources play a huge role.
