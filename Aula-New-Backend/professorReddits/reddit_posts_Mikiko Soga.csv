I didn't notice that either... good point. It seems like an interesting course as well, will the CalCentral system physically prevent us from joining the waitlist then?

That's unfortunate, what other courses are you considering for your International breadth then? I've been looking at GPP 105/115 (but those are apparently also reserved for a specific group of students), as well as envdes 100 and geog 130."
