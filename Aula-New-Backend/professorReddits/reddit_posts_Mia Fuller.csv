Italian Culture 40,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/prdqbm/italian_culture_40/,2021-09-19 11:40:23,Hi! Does anyone have any idea of how the Italian 40 midterm works? My GSI has been very bad at explaining. Professor Mia Fuller also said she does not have any question set or past midterm to help us study for the upcoming Midterm. Does anyone know anything about reviewing for this class and exam formats?,"Was wondering the same thing, idk I'm hella confused on what's gonna be on the midterm :(
peep this thread i feel like the guys quizlets would be helpful :,))

So sorry, I totally forgot to respond. But this was super useful and helped me get a good grade on the final!! Thank you so much!!
I do and I feel like she just goes off on these random tangents half the time 😭
I DO have Brenda, she's just too much all over the place and absolutely no content related to the class"
R&C part A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/oindyo/rc_part_a/,2021-07-12 01:50:21,Do r5a’s require prior knowledge about the language? because i was thinking about taking Italian r5a with mia fuller and don’t know anything about Italian.,"Nope! A lot of people take the R5 series because the topics are interesting and it’s known for being “easier” than the R1 series.
I'm pretty sure all R1A/R5A courses are taught in English. 

From the course description of Italian r5a:

>Reading and composition course based on works by Italians and **foreigners** about Italy and its culture and by Italians about their distinctive experiences of other cultures as tourists and emigrants. **Works studied will be primarily chosen from among fiction and non fiction narratives, both originally in English and translated into it**. R5A satisfies the first half of the Reading and Composition Requirement and R5B satisfies the second half.

Classes with prerequisites like language familiarity or previous classes will list them in the course description."
Italian R5A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nswe4e/italian_r5a/,2021-06-05 07:01:50,"So for the first half of R&C i was thinking about taking Italian R5A. Could anyone tell me if 

1)it requires basic understanding of Italian
2) I checked the average grade with Mia Fuller on berkeleytime and its A so it should be pretty easy right?
3) will it take a lot of my time outside of the classroom?","1) No, it just means it’s from the Italian department, you’re gonna be using readings from Italian authors, content, etc.

2) Average grade doesnt mean effort. But generally,

3) it will depend on how quickly you can write and be confident in it, also how dense your prof makes it
R&C classes are highly highly dependent on the Professor but usually if the grade distribution is high usually means the professors is less strict with grading not necessarily less work (but doable amount).

My advice is just check out what the first week is like, you can usually gauge what the Professor is like by then. Also heard it’s generally easier in the summer.
1) None at all, we read Italian authors like Dante and Calvino and other stuff (eg. Homer, Shakespeare, Ovid works that were set in/around Sicily and other cities).

2) I got an A+, but I put in lots of time for reading, writing, and editing my essays. Mia Fuller is the current instructor of record but your actual professor will be a GSI.

3) If you want a good grade, it *will* take time. Maybe 30+ pages of reading a week, depending on how the GSI created the syllabus. Choose one with readings/topics that actually interest you, as it'll make the work much more fun and enjoyable.
Do reading materials change from semester to semester, even if the class is taught by the same professor?
Hi! I'm wondering who will actually be delivering the courses and grading our assignments. Mia Fuller or a GSI?"
Advice on Spring 2021 Course Schedule + Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jg65ml/advice_on_spring_2021_course_schedule_professors/,2020-10-22 12:05:17,"I’m a freshman and am trying to transfer to COE for either MechE or CivE. I looked on rate my prof and there were some professors that had ratings and some that didn’t show up. Some of the ratings were for other classes the professor taught so I’m not sure if it all applies. If you have any advice on this schedule or the professors teaching these courses or the courses in general please let me know.

Spring 2021

-Chem 1A (Alexis Shusterman)

-Chem 1AL (Michelle Douskey)

-Math 53 (Zvezdelina Stankova)

-Engin 26 (Kourosh Youssefi)

-some r#b course
  
  - French R1B (Trevor Sanders)
 
  - Italian R5B (Mia Fuller) 
 
  - Asian American Studies R2B (David Pham)
 
  - Environmental Design R3B 

TLDR: pls give experience with any of these profs/classes","I'm taking math 53 and chem 1a/1al right now. As far as I can say, chem 1a/1al is a bunch of busy work, that might not all be fun or engaging or interesting or even intellectually stimulating at times, but it really requires you to be on your feet at all times. To be successful in that class, you gotta just either know the material beforehand or just watch a bunch of youtube videos on the topics, either from khan and organic chem tutor. Nothing from lectures has helped me anyway. As for math, it's been ok. As long as you read the book and do the hw, you should be ok.
I took E26 with Youseffi and it's a somewhat low workload class, especially if you already have experience with CAD. If you don't have experience, then the labs may take you a bit longer to complete. I didn't have CAD experience and I found the labs somewhat ok after asking for help from my GSI and friends. There aren't any midterms/tests but the final was tough. People who do have CAD experience find the class fairly easy so it depends on your background. I recommend going to lab sections if you need help.
Ok, thank you!
Ok, thank you!"
