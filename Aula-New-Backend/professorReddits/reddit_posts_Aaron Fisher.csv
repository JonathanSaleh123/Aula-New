Vote Aaron Fisher for Psych Major Commencement Speaker!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/119rfy0/vote_aaron_fisher_for_psych_major_commencement/,2023-02-22 23:13:29,"I know his class wasn't the easiest, and despite having mixed feelings about the exams, I honestly think he'd make for a great speaker. He's funny, memorable, and really gets to what actually matters. A lot of the popular professors spoke recently (Keltner, Chen, Hinshaw) and are ineligible to speak, and I think we should give someone new a chance!",Anything but gade
