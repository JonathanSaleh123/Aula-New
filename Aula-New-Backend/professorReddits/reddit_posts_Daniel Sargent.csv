Question about upper division history class,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/196uw66/question_about_upper_division_history_class/,2024-01-14 16:21:49,"Has anybody here taken History 130 with Daniel Sargent? It had a good grade average on Berkeley time and the Professor seems pretty cool. However, I'm a junior and this is the first history class I have ever taken and I was wondering what the workload was like? ","History major who had a class with Sargent (lower division tho). Just expect to show up to lectures to take note of important materials and do the required readings at a manageable pace (don't read word to word). Assignments will most likely just be papers so just keep in touch with the writing center if you ever struggle with drafting an essay. Don't stress it, I'm sure you'll be fine."

The president has had articles of impeachment against him voted in the House of Representatives.  The impeachment trial, and therefore the actual vote regarding his removal from office, has not taken place in the Senate yet.

The petition came from academics who believe that the articles are warranted and are encouraging the Senate to vote in favor of the articles as well.  2/3 of the Senate would have to vote in favor for the president to be removed, a result that appears remote at the present given the support the president enjoys from Republicans in the Senate, who make a majority of that body."
