Math 104 Fall 23 Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12tfzom/math_104_fall_23_professors/,2023-04-20 14:36:40,"There are currently three professors for 104 this fall. K Beal-Uride, Eric Chen, and Ryan Hass.

How do they compare? I saw on berkeleytime that Beal-Uride and Eric Chen gave better grades, although they only taught for one semester.","[deleted]
Hass 100000% man that man is a gem of math department
From what I have heard, they are all great, seems to be a lucky semester to take 104!
Thanks for the info. How's grading with Hass, tho? On berkeleytime he is below average grade of 104.
thanks but isn't he a tough grader?
lucky! thx

I mean you'll never forget what u learned with him tho
Mind sharing what textbook u used? I prob need some preview

which first year English class is better?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dlqhtj/which_first_year_english_class_is_better/,2024-06-22 00:52:08,"I’m stuck between choosing one out of these three options for my fall semester English class! What are your thoughts on these classes/professors/topics?

Thanks!

1) English R1A “Certain Uncertainties: Or, the Threshold of the Unfalsifiable” (Professor Wittman K, Dousa R)

2) Colwrit R4A (NOT R1A) “What’s Gender All About?” (Professor Oakes K)

3) Rhetor R1A “The Craft of Writing”; (Professor Atkinson N, Lau D, Roth M)

Note: All start at 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM, Tuesdays and Thursdays! ","Personally I took a history class to fulfill my English requirements (R1B)

Because I legitimately no longer have the headspace to analyze fiction/literature academically.
I’d recommend going on both [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/search/professors/1072?q=*&did=35) to see the reviews for each professor, and then also [Berkeleytime Grades](https://berkeleytime.com/grades) to look at the grade distributions for each class to compare the likelihood of getting better grades :)
Also, I’m a STEM a major so English isn’t my strongest suit. Preferably a class that is more suitable for someone busy with Chem/Calc and wants an “easier” A lot to ask for haha but one can pray ! :)
Oakes (#2) is great!
def look at reviews on ratemyprofessor, but i took colwrit r4a fall freshman year with oakes and i really enjoyed it! iirc, if you do all of the assignments you're pretty much guaranteed an a + i thought the assigned readings/content were really engaging. she's a really understanding prof who gives really thorough feedback on essays, and i thought the discussions in class were pretty interesting too! if gender studies is smth that appeals to you, i would def recommend the class
Have you considered an R1A class *outside* these majors? Maybe a topic you might want to explore related to your heritage/culture, or film and theatre?

K Street Flats,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11h6uzp/k_street_flats/,2023-03-03 09:19:48,"I know there's been a post like this before ([https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/aynxzk/how\_safe\_is\_k\_street\_flats\_6\_berkeley\_students/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/aynxzk/how_safe_is_k_street_flats_6_berkeley_students/)) but it's been a while and I was wondering how you guys feel about the place now, for those of you current renting there! Would you recommend it?

I heard stuff about homeless people and weed--how much of that is true? Is it unsafe / noisy?","I lived there last semester. It was horrible DO NOT not move here. The highschoolers like to break in and trash the building. Property managers do not care about their renters and if you look up the ""Berkeley building collapse"" where like 7 exnchange students died, this is where it happened
Been here for two years, really good management company currently. Had a few small repair things pop up and they were fixed next day. For safety I have never had complaints, the building is a key scan so the lobbies are secure. No noise recently. They had a fire alarm issue with the nearby high school but new security recently solved that. There is a small group of homeless people who hang out next door at the public library during the day, but they don’t cause issues and I have had nice conversations with a few of them. In terms of the history they do accept it and there are no more balcony’s around the property. 

My only complaint is that the elevators are a bit slow. Feel free to DM me any other questions. Happy to answer them. Overall would recommend.
Have been there for a year.
Major problem:1) high school kids smoke in the stairwell 2) noise from the streets(depending on which side of the property 3)packages have been stolen(but they do have a package storing system out recently 4)from an International student perspective: the leasing office had little patience for non-native speakers 5)according to my friends, the rent increases after your first year at kstreet
Hope this helps
I have some friends who lived there so last year I went there 2-3x a week. I honestly wouldn’t feel great about living there
June 16, 2015, five Irish students living and working for the summer in the Bay Area, and one Irish-American young woman from the Bay Area died when a balcony fell off this same building. Worst disaster in terms of loss of life in Berkeley history. Several were seriously injured, and one of the injured died in 2022. 

All the balconies were removed and the building--originally called ""Library Gardens""--was ""rebranded"" as K-Street Flats. 

Background information here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley\_balcony\_collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_balcony_collapse)

There is a memorial to the disaster and the dead, but instead of being next to the building, it's a couple of blocks north, in Civic Center Park.
Please listen!! DO NOT RENT HERE!!
A creepy maintenance guy works here. He is super sketchy...my daughter was staying here and came home and caught him with her dirty underwear.  Other girls told my daughter he is always saying hello and being TOO PUSHY FRIENDLY, if you know the type. 
Avoid K Street Flats for your safety.
Oh also if you want to actually receive your packages and not get them stolen dont live here

Least vandalized Berkeley public property
It's wild how there are always a few people out there who just want to destroy stuff for no reason. They make having a truly free society impossible.
Damn, that's frustrating
I'm over fucking People's Park. Somebody needs to get those people the help they deserve as human beings because right now students fear for their lives going back and forth to class. I grew up around Berkeley and People's Park is just not what it once was. It is full of violent people with mental health problems who need help!!! I hate that people are still clinging onto this old idea of a hippie park where peaceful protests would happen/people would gather. That shit doesn't happen anymore! Now people just get assaulted! Wake up fr get these people into treatment centers and build housing there. I'm SO over it.
Man. I liked hearing that when walking through Sproul.

Whoever did this is a genuine asshole.
Sad :(

AH YES FINALLY A PIANO I CAN PLAY
chaos.
From counterculture to crackhead.
Sorry but this took some time to vandalise, what was security/UCPD doing? You also got to think that there was CCTV covering this and it is not as if UCPD had to go far....
Have that same cup
This has happened basically every year for the last 5 years. It always sucks. Freecycle and Trashnothing may have some pianos available if someone can transport one.  


Side note: Why are y'all making this a People's Park issue?
Kudos to those of you who actually think someone from peoples Park did this.
This is reality lol
Let’s be real here.  I love playing that piano at night or between classes, and last time I went to play it it looked good to go but was functionally useless, probably due to people playing it like a damn drum set.  A piano out in the public will lose a key here or there but it was already basically useless with whole octaves no longer functioning by finals week, while looking like maybe one or two keys would probably not work.  That it looks like this now is just a visualization of its already existing subsurface uselessness.  It’s ultimately good that this broken piano is visibly useless so the people who graciously take it upon themselves to install pianos on Sproul are more likely to know that it needs replacing.
So sad!! That piano has been there and enjoyed by all for several years. 😢😔
This is sad
At UCSB, by Sands Beach, someone put a piano. I played it several times, was so lovely. Within two weeks it’s keyboard looked like this. 

I figured it wouldn’t last long, being in the weather and all. But somebody just decided to destroy it.
what brand is it anyone?
A couple of the local meth heads got bored.
I hope so! 😢
Well, you can, just not there..
They’re likely mentally unwell. They need social services.
Same kids who ripped up erasers for no reason in class
they hate to hear it
Build us another basketball court and community garden open 24/7 to the public in the same neighborhood then. 🤷🏽‍♂️
We literally had a whole series of concerts these last year but pop off sis you know best. You know folks from the neighborhood use the park tho right?
Build housing on it
Pave peoples park!!
what does that have to do with the piano
so brave 👏
It’ll be back. We’re on like the 5th piano now. He gets destroyed every final season, TBH.
just not in the most educated and socially conscious city in the world
Which Reagan and the GOP took away over 40 years ago and no one has ever restored.
Y’all are like vegans. That’s all we hear from the vocal anti-park minority.
Ur delusional 😂
For what? Shooting up?
does it really need to be said? most of us are capable of putting 2 and 2 together lol.
Peoples Park activists brought the second piano to campus 🤷🏽‍♂️
Great example of the Paradox of Tolerance in action. We are so tolerant and socially conscious that we welcome people who are hopelessly antisocial and intolerant...and now we’re paying the price.
And humble too
You forgot to say that they revere the arts as well but that’s cool. I guess in a sense this lowly piano is art too and says something as well when your statement is taken into context.
How does lived experience make me delusional. Don’t you think the ones sucking UC’s Oski, brown nosing the blue and gold and not having actual experience are the delusional ones 😮‍💨
Dude your dorm mates probably snort adderall and your frats are assaulting people nonstop. Students are just as fucked up if not worse cause you know better and can do better but you just complain on Reddit. Like… get off the high horse already.
the piano has old paint on it mentioning peoples park so the implication is that it’s peoples parks fault that the piano is missing some keys?
I like that. In my own personal experience I’ve found that absolute tolerance has led to enabling and disastrous choices for some friends of mine who dropped me because I would draw a line for what I believed was their own personal well-being. I’m not sure where that line is in society and honestly I’m glad Berkeley exists as it does to show us whatever it is we want to take away from it. To me, no place is perfect of course, but some do certainly have issues that aren’t as prevalent in other areas. It’s always a give and take though and one has to find the place they enjoy in my book.
Thanks for the ad hominem. I'm actually a woman and don't live in the dorms. If students are just as bad as the people in People's Park, maybe you should try your luck staying there? If it's just as safe as a dorm? Let me know how it goes!
lol there's no point in arguing with someone so blatantly blind to the truth. I think we all know that there's a pretty high chance that whoever vandalized the piano was a mentally-ill and/or drug addicted individual that places like peoples park attract from all over.
What is your major so I can judge you.
What is your major so I can judge you.
Compassion is nice but too much turns into enablement
I’m literally always there. And the fact you think “shooting up” is anything except pain relief is shameful. Please if you don’t like it you shouldn’t be at Berkeley. You are suppose to have a good education to get in. That means BASIC understanding of social issues including drug addiction. Students like you are bad and lack empathy. Still makes you a frat bro cause you’re no different.
Usually it’s people who are angry about finals. Not everyone at People’s Park are ill. Folks from People’s Park always play on that piano hence the graffiti 🙄
how do we know that a mentally ill person who lives in peoples park vandalized the piano? what is this based off of? vibes? how do you know random hooligans didn’t do it?

wild how things change . . . I remember being salty af that they implemented the “one late withdraw with no record on the transcript” the year after I graduated smh lol
essentially professors had a grading curve that they had to meet for their classes, and since most classes were notoriously easy the curve was extremely harsh and detrimental towards ones gpa - you could score a raw 96 in a class but receive a A- all because everyone did very well in the class - it made it so one small mistake could be the difference in a letter grade
3.2 mean
Now it's two. And everyone got those 2 ""new"" late withdrawals in like Fall 2020 whether they had used their 1 or not beforehand. Man, I would've taken like CS 162 twice if I knew that was gonna happen.

I wanna do cs61c but...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nlr87s/i_wanna_do_cs61c_but/,2021-05-26 13:53:30,"I'm not a Berkeley student. 

And you need a Berkeley account to view lectures and the autograder. 

I noticed that there are optional readings assigned from the K&R and P&H books. 

How closely do the lectures follow the books? If  I did the relevant readings, will I be able to do the labs/hw/projects? I could look for others implementations on GitHub instead of the autograder. 

Alternatively, if anyone knows any quality MOOC(s) which covers similar content to 61c, it would be great? 

Thanks!","Look at a past semester of CS61c (specifically, before the pandemic).

https://cs61c.org/fa19/#lectures for instance. Notice that the lectures are actually [all public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_hXH5-tbM4&list=PLkFD6_40KJIxaAvX0p_ZnB7915Ua-ggU0&index=3) for these. It's that the later ones are weird zoom lectures is why they're locked behind canvas.

Yeah, you won't get the autograder. No way around that; the university has to pay gradescope for server space to run that.

 Good practice, though, to write your own unit tests. And yes, you can also check the github solutions which shouldn't exist but nonetheless do.
For self-study purposes, I think it would be fine if you treated the slides sort of like a textbook alongside the Discussions

&#x200B;

Project 1 you may be able to run the code after some finessing with a Mac or Linux system (maybe Visual Studio on Windows, but I never tied...yet), for both Philphix and Game of Life

Project 2 CS61Classify is RISC-V emulated via Java, so you should be able to use it

Project 3 uses [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) to make the Computer Architecture circuitry using Boolean values and Forwarding techniques (circuit knowledge optional, but good practice in circuits helps a lot)

Project 4 requires an Intel CPU and OpenMP, and I tried doing a custom Makefile for my computer and another project, and it was painful. Unfortunately, while you can code it, you can't run it. You may find the concepts useful towards an NVIDIA CUDA kind of program, which via Visual Studio is possible.

&#x200B;

I would say the lectures are pretty detailed enough without too much textbook fluff; very to the point, but otherwise I myself don't recommend any of their listed textbooks, except the C textbook they have (it's pretty good)

&#x200B;

For the first 1/3, it is the C and memory management portion. [MIT OCW 6.087](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-087-practical-programming-in-c-january-iap-2010/) is very helpful here

For the RISC-V portion of the course (middle 1/3), [MIT OCW 6.004](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/index.htm) may be helpful

The last 1/3 on Parallelism, [MIT OCW 12.950](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-950-parallel-programming-for-multicore-machines-using-openmp-and-mpi-january-iap-2010/index.htm) is more related, but I never used it (plus we use Intel SIMD, and MIT OCW course doesn't teach that)
Look at summer 2020 version. By the way I want to take this course. We can start it now I have already taken cs61a and cs61b
EDIT: Just tried to watch lecture videos beyond the first lecture and it seems like you need permission to access the video (I assume only those with Berkeley emails have permission?) :(

Thanks, good to know i can view the lectures! If you have any idea, it would be really helpful to know if the readings closely follow the lecture material too
Unfortunately, as mentioned in one of the replies to a comment [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fhEE4J4QCps), most of the lecture videos aren't made public
Thank you, seems like a lot of configuration will be needed to set up my system, not to mention the lack of lecture videos and official solutions. I'll consider finding alternatives and the MIT links you've provided. Much appreciated
Yeah, I was thinking summer 2020 would be best given that the lectures are available.

I've decided to wait a bit, still have cs61b to finish off. But please do update if/when you've started and made some headway. It would be really helpful to know how you've got along!

Should I study abroad? Please help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13v6orf/should_i_study_abroad_please_help/,2023-05-29 14:10:40,"In case it wasn’t obvious from the title, I(22F) would like to study abroad.

Now, I’m admittedly reluctant to disclose the country that I have in mind because I know it’s a bit controversial so, before I do, please do try to keep an open mind.

Ok, brace yourselves: I’d like to study abroad in DPRK.

Now, I know what y’all are thinking: “Has she gone mad???” “Is this another shitpost??” “Why do I feel wet down there whenever I see Oski????”

In response to the first two questions, I’d like to say that, no, I have not gone mad and, no, this is 100% unironic. As for the the third question, same lmaoo.

Anyways, before you all advise me on whether or not studying abroad in the DPRK is a good idea, I’ll first give the myriad of reasons why I am interested in studying in the DPRK:

1.) The quality of life: I’m under the impression that the quality of life in North Korea is luxurious and unparalleled because, when I asked my friend what it was like to live there, he said, “I can’t complain!” Incidentally, I never heard from him again. :/



2.) Plenty of [amazing internship and employment opportunities to develop an outstanding work ethic!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwalliso) The best part is that Glorious Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un’s magnanimous three generations law GUARANTEES that my children and grandchildren will have a place of employment and they’ll have work ethic instilled in them from a young age!



3.) I really like anime ☺️💅🏻 and I really wanna marry a hot K-Pop dude 🥵😍



4.) I think it’s really cool and courageous that DPRK is the only country in the world that has the guts to wage war against Poseidon! And judging by the fact that DPRK has never been hit by a tsunami but that they’ve successfully hit the ocean with multiple ballistic missiles, I think DPRK is winning the war! 🚀🚀🚀

5.) [Opportunities to improve my programming skills! :)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group)

So then, what do you think r/Berkeley ?

Should I study abroad in DPRK?!?!

Thx in advance! <3

I went to the DPRK in August 2010 - it was the most interesting trip of my life, and oddly super relaxing - because they confiscated our cell phones and blackberries at the border and then returned them when we left. 

But once we got out of Pyongyang, you could see the country was really falling apart - and even on the government approved tours there were huge signs of famine and starvation - and the in Potemkin Village of Pyongyang, you could see huge cracks in society where things were falling apart - every “new” building had been finished in 1991 - which, by sheer coincidence, was also the last year the Soviet Union supported the Kim regime. 

Beautiful subway though.

Honestly, after the Warmbier incident, I don’t think I’d consider unless I became a celebrity because, then, NK would have a lot more to lose from killing me

Dennis Rodman and KJU are close to the point that Rodman is actually seen as a sort of unofficial ambassador
u/Cal_Aesthetics_Club
Yeah it was 2 days Pyongyang and then a drive down to Kaesong and the border (and two weeks later I was in South Korea looking at the border the other way) and the back to Pyongyang for one more night before flying out to Beijing. Non-Americans got to take the train back to China but the four Americans on the tour - we had to fly. 

Honestly would not have been able to tell about the famine, but one of the other Americans on the tour was a commercial farming consultant and he was pointing out what dire states the crops were in as we drove by.

Open team in Dynasty Baseball League,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/35vah9/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league/,2015-05-13 13:25:13,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. This isn't an all Berkeley league, but I figured this would be a great opportunity to meet other baseball fans at Cal.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward. 

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete). 

The team roster is below. The minors system is pretty barren and the roster has too many bench offensive pieces, but there's a great deal of elite talent here. A smart owner could turn this team into a contender in short order, either through rebuilding or with a shorter term strategy. Reply or PM me if you're interested!

If anyone needs a random unit, PoliSci 179 has plenty of space
Perhaps the single best thing about grad school is the fact that I never have to deal with this crap again!
Wait, does the 16-unit cap not apply during the Adjustment Period?
Is it too late to drop a class?
word.
**Alternatively**, if you're looking to lose 4 units, you can easily drop CS61B! [and get me a little lower on the waitlist]
How does registration work for grad students at Berkeley?
correct. the ""cap"" is now determined by your college.

hint- for those of you who are ambitious, as long as you are not at the college limit cap, you can add a class of any unit value.

example- say my college has a cap of 19.5 units. If you are at say, 19 units, you could add any class of any unit value, even if it technically exceeds your college cap. 
Nope! You can drop classes until the fifth week or something! 
I rage quit from the CS61B and CS170 waitlists.
Oh that's just the thing I was looking for! I was hoping not to be able to declare my major on time.
Pretty much the same way as it does for undergraduates. The difference being we always get our classes so it doesn't matter. At least in Computer Science. People sign up whenever they want.
Great tip; to clarify, you'll have to drop classes to get down below that cap by the add-drop deadline, which is the Friday of the fifth week of classes.
Are you a freshman? As a softmore I don't really have that choice unfortunately, but if you're a freshman then don't worry about it
What happens if you don't? Do they just randomly drop a class for you?
This is incorrect. You can keep all the classes you are registered for.

Source: Experience.
I'm a junior transfer. I'm going to take CS47B and CS188 instead.
Wait, seriously?

Do you mind providing details? It's been my impression that they don't want people taking more units and graduating before they pay years worth of tuition. You could help a lot of people out with that info.
Do those work as alternatives for those?
I've had the same experience (taking 20 units in a semester by adding a 4-unit class during the adjustment experience). You can also get the cap extended if you talk to your advisor i think (I've never done it, but i knew a girl who regularly took 25-30 unit semesters)."
ECON major 1st year cource choices,https://i.redd.it/co3hnhiw4l3d1.jpeg,2024-05-30 08:50:04,"HELLLOO, please help me choose my cources for the first year to declare an economics major. ","The first question is - what are you bringing over from HS in terms of college credit? Any Calc? Any English?
I do A levels so i believe I am not bringing in any credits
I do Maths and Econ my bad
Will you be required to take any classes in the calc series? Math 1A/B? If not, definitely avoid them. Same with econ 1/2 if you can help it. If you've passed out of both of those I believe all you'll need to take is intro stat and one upper division econ course between Macro and Micro. I'd sign up for intro stat your first semester, and one of the upper division classes (100A/B) second semester, dependent on who is teaching. I took stat 20 my first semester, and with a HS stat background it was fine.
So when you say Math, do you mean you’re going to get college credits for the equivalent of 1 year of Calc?  ie Calc 1 and Calc 2?  You probably want to check first, you might not want to repeat stuff you’ve already gotten college credit for already. (A lot of students do repeat stuff though). 

So your Math and Econ prereqs might already be done. For Stats, usually people default to taking STAT 20, but I recommend taking Data C88S as your requirement. But in order to take that class you also need to take Data 8, either as a prerequisite or as a co-requisite.  IMO learning Python via Data 8 is somewhat more in vogue than learning R via STAT 20.

The intermediate Econ classes, you’re not eligible to take until later on.
Also, a ton of Econ students these days tend to minor or double major in Data Science, of which Data 8 is a requirement. Something to think about.
is it possible to double major in ds if accepted into l&s?
It is possible, but no one really knows the outcomes and odds of switching to/double majoring in CS/DS/Stats until next year. You apply, go thru a comprehensive review and wait and see."

“Being idle in the wooden building, I opened a window. 

The morning breeze and bright moon lingered together. 

I reminisce the native village far away, cut off by clouds and mountains. 

On the little island the waiting of cold, wild geese can be faintly heard. 

The hero who has lost his way can talk meaninglessly of the sword.

The poet at the end of the road can only ascend a tower.

**Why else do we come to this place to be imprisoned?**” [CENSORED]

•Gumport, R. K., & Smith, M. M. (2000). The Chinese experience in 19th century America. Champaign, IL: Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies, Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
“From 1910 until 1940, people arriving from China were detained on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay to await approval or denial of their request for entry into the United States. Even people who had been long-term residents of the United States and had only left the country for a short time to visit friends and family in China were subject to the same procedures of detention upon their return. Detained for weeks, months, even years in crowded, unsanitary quarters with only the barest necessities, many Chinese wrote poems on the walls of the dormitories to pass the time and express their anxiety, sadness, fear, and frustration. The poems were discovered in 1970 and have been collected as a testament to the dreams of the thousands of Chinese who came seeking entry into the United States.”[Poem #38](https://imgur.com/gallery/J59ugtt)","Wow, thats really unfortunate.

Also Rivoli got dropped?! I haven't even been there but I am super surprised, from what I've heard about their food and service. My guess is people haven't been to some of these spots and are voting for what they know. 
Gordo's is the epitome of white people getting ahold of good ethnic food and making it bland and unappealing.  It's basically a higher margin taco bell with less options.  And no quesalupas.
if they go head to head winner will take it all imo (dont want to bias the voting tho)

Context: Robert La Follette was a progressive Republican from Wisconsin who helped to revolutionize the state's structure, and made it a blueprint for other states to come in creating a government that responded to the needs of the people.  During the early 20th century, La Follette pushed for the initiative and referendum systems, the recall vote, called for strong unions, and helped develop public policy based upon research and the findings at the University of Wisconsin, embracing the benefits that learning and higher education could bring to the state.  He was eventually elected to be a US Senator.  He dared to break from President Taft during the 1912 presidential election but refused to support Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Party at that time.  He was an outspoken critic of Woodrow Wilson and his choice to join World War I while senator.  He would eventually become the presidential candidate for the Progressive Party in 1924, where left wing supporters and socialists voted for him against Calvin Coolidge.

____

To put this another way: the EE~~(CS)~~ department students at Cal were so Anti-War they actually sent a telegram at the outbreak of World War I and instead of writing to their own Senator, they wrote to the most outspoken opponent of the status quo.  They did this while the sitting president of the University, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, was a personal friend of the Kaiser [\(nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize!\)](https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show.php&id=8363) and held pro-German sentiments from his time learning and teaching in Leipzig, Heidelberg, Jena, and Berlin.

Wildfire Air Quality and PPE Infothread,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9xal9s/wildfire_air_quality_and_ppe_infothread/,2018-11-15 04:03:23,"EDIT: - MOVED TO [MEGATHREAD COMMENT](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9xfjew/megathread_air_quality_megathread_complain_about/e9rwm8l/)

Sup Berkeley - instead of studying for my midterm I thought I'd help put together a bit of an information post regarding the wildfires and respirator masks so you don't have to put in the time to ~~procrastinate~~ research. Reposting because I got caught in the spam filter the first time around.

Perhaps even useful for future wildfires - this won't be the last time California is on fire.

&#x200B;

*TL;DR summary* \- Awareness by checking fires and AQI, and buy/wear a valved **N95-rated respirator** (NOT a regular surgical mask) and **ensure a proper fit/seal** if you don't want **short or long term respiratory problems/failure**.

&#x200B;

**GENERAL INFO**

**What's on fire right now?**

[Official California wildfire maps here](http://www.fire.ca.gov/general/firemaps). A colored highlighted section will appear when a fire perimeter for a significant fire is created, like the current Woolsey fire in Southern California.

&#x200B;

**Tell me about the Air Quality Index (AQI)?**

[Official EPA AQI website here.](https://airnow.gov/) The AQI is a metric used to measure air quality and certain pollutants, such as PM2.5 and ozone.

You should wear a respirator for an AQI of about 150 or above.

&#x200B;

**What is PM2.5?**

PM2.5 refers to fine dust particles less than 2.5 microns/micrometers in diameter - these are the particles that come from heavy pollution (see: China) and wildfires (see: California). In short, they damage your respiratory systems like no tomorrow (depending on concentration and duration of exposure) for both short term (asthma, heart attacks) and long term (respiratory disease risk increase). [Source.](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.particle) [Source 2.](https://blissair.com/what-is-pm-2-5.htm)

&#x200B;

These particles are **microscopic** and cannot be seen, which means the best way you should check if you need to protect from it is to check an official AQI source, NOT simply check if it's smog/smokey outside. (FYI context - the average virus is 0.3 microns in size.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**RESPIRATOR MASKS**

**What protective equipment do I need? (mask vs. respirator)**

A respirator is a mask intended for filtration of particles and/or chemical (gas) - this ranges from disposable respirators to full blown ""gas masks"". There's essentially three types - disposable, half mask, and full mask.

A surgical mask, like the kinds given out in hospitals, are intended to protect other people from the wearer (think: sneeze guard). They do not filter PM2.5 particles and are minimally useful/practically useless for particles.

&#x200B;

**What do respirator mask ratings (N95, P100) mean?**

This is a American NIOSH standard by the CDC that tests and certifies a certain filtration rating. There are two parts - **a letter (N, R, P) and a number (95-100).**

&#x200B;

The first letter refers to how oil resistant the mask is. The number refers to the percentage of particles filtered out by the mask (95 - filters 95% of airborne particles *0.3 microns or larger*, 100 filters out 100%).

The minimum recommendation for general wildfire protection is N95. If you're extremely sensitive, perhaps consider a 100 rating filter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Buying a respirator?**

(Edit: Seems people are having trouble finding respirators in stock even online. I recommend mixing up search terms between disposable/non-disposable masks and different NIOSH ratings higher than N95.)

&#x200B;

*Where:*

Typically respirators are sold for construction/workplace use - check pharmacies (Walgreens) and hardware stores (Ace Hardware, Home Depot). They also typically sell out within a day of an air emergency announcement, so either stockpile ahead of time or ship it online ASAP via Amazon One-Day (or 2-hour Prime Now if lucky).

*What:*

Stick to name brand - 3M is the best. Averages $1-2/each for a disposable N95 mask, usually in bulk packs.

Half masks (3M 7500 series) are generally one size fits all (but have small, medium, and large options (3N 7501, 7502, 7503 respectively)) and have better sealing against your face, with options for various cartridges.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

About exhalation valves - some have them and some do not. As long as they're rated properly (N95) it will work, but the valve is for quality of life :

1. You will be breathing harder trying to inhale air through the mask filter material- the one-way valve will help with exhalation.
2. Exhalation valves reduce temperature and humidity buildup under the mask (\~15 degrees reduction). Without it, you'll be uncomfortable and will want to take it off under prolonged use.

&#x200B;

**How do I wear a respirator?**

The most important thing is to ensure a **PROPER SEAL AGAINST YOUR FACE -** otherwise they perform **just as poorly as a surgical mask, or no mask at all**. Your respirator needs to have at least two bands, for the upper back and lower back of your head. Facial hair affects sealing -  shave or use petroleum jelly on it to seal against your mask.

&#x200B;

Perform a fit test:

The mask should cover all of your nose up to the bridge, and down to a bit of a lip around the bottom of your chin.

[Disposable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kIYxfJXfhc&feature=youtu.be&t=1m5s) \- there should be a metal piece for fitting snugly against your nasal bridge.  Breathe in, and feel for airflow around the edges.

[Half/Full Mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtHi03dFno) \- block the input filter(s) with your hands and then suck in — if you’re getting any air, that means it’s sneaking in somewhere. You should also notice the mask sort of cave in as you create a vacuum inside.

&#x200B;

**Bonus - HOME AIR FILTRATION**

Firstly, keep windows and doors shut.

Air purifiers with HEPA filters are [""rated for 99.97% of particles that have a size greater-than-or-equal-to 0.3""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA), which can filter PM2.5 particles.

If you don't have a dedicated HEPA air purifier but do have a box fan, [you can stick a HEPA filter on a box fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU) for reasonable results relative to the cost.

&#x200B;

Which type of filter should I choose for wildfire?
AC for temperature/humidity regulation?  Not sure what you mean by that, but if you meant for airflow exchange with the outside world, I believe that every building has central air intakes that circulate air into the building, and there are air filters over these intake openings. Depending on what you or your landlord bought, the filters over these intake openings should be good enough to filter particles of concern. Far better than an open window.

&#x200B;

I'm not an expert at home ventilation though. I do know that there is no such thing as an air-tight home, which is why running a HEPA air purifier to clean up any bad air getting in through the cracks is a decent idea.
Anything with the NIOSH particulate rating of N95 or better. See ""**What do respirator mask ratings (N95, P100) mean?""** section above.

&#x200B;

The bit about the organic vapor is for chemical filtration - not necessarily needed for our case. The N95 rating is for particulates, which is what you want for the wildfire smoke.

&#x200B;

Also double check it fits the respirator you have/are buying."

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",

Open Team In Dynasty Baseball League (Again),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3cvs25/open_team_in_dynasty_baseball_league_again/,2015-07-10 21:41:28,"Hey there Berkeley baseball enthusiasts. I'm in a competitive (and free to play) dynasty baseball league with simplified contracts and a minors system. A team recently opened up, and we're looking for a new owner. I've posted previously about a different team that was open, and a recent Berkeley grad wound up taking it. I'd love to meet more Berkeley students (maybe who are still attending, though I'm not picky) who are into baseball.

The league uses 6x6 H2H scoring (R, RBI, SB, HR, AVG, OPS, W, K, BB, ERA, WHIP, SV+H) with Yahoo as our main platform. We also have a Proboards board for tracking rosters and roster moves. I can provide full details on the rules, but most things are fairly straightforward.

I've been playing with most of the other owners for five years or more. Most of us are sabremetrically inclined, so frequent Fangraphs/Baseball Reference users are always welcomed (in fact, it might even be necessary to compete).

Here's the team. It's in definite need a rebuild, but there are several awesome core pieces (Cole, Wacha, Trout, Abreu) to build around or trade away for a haul depending on your strategy:

Salary: $99/$100 ( $68  on MAIN  $9 on Waivers; $8 on DL $15 from Buyouts

Roster: 23/25

DL: 3/5
