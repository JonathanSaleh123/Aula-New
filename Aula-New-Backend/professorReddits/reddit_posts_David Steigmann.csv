ME 185--- David Steigmann?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u57brg/me_185_david_steigmann/,2022-04-16 14:11:27,"Has anyone taken ME 185? If so, 

1.) How hard was this class? 

2.) How is the Professor David Steigmann?

3.) Anything else that would be good to know?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated","ME 185 by itself is challenging but very rewarding. It’s probably the most theoretical undergraduate ME course offered and because of this lays a strong foundation for forays into other areas of mechanics and dynamics. 

Steigmann is also extremely knowledgeable in the field - literally one of the worlds leading experts in continuum mechanics - and based on my experience with him in 282, it will be even more theory-heavy than normal.

If it sounds interesting you should totally take it! This course changed the path of my career. I took it my sophomore year thinking I would use it in industry after graduating and am now beginning a PhD program here in this exact topic. I’ll be in the class as well taking it a second time.
Steigmann is meh for sure, took him for 127"
