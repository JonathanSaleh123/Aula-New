Thoughts on James Analytis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/8n11z1/thoughts_on_james_analytis/,2018-05-29 10:43:09,"I'm considering taking physics 89 this upcoming semester. The professor is James Analytis, who is a 5/5 on RateMyProfessor but only has 2 reviews. For those of you who have taken him, what are your thoughts on him?  
Is he a good teacher?  
Is he hard?  ","https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/865053/17_did_you_just_get_into_berkeley_have_a_simple/ 

post here in the future
He should be alright. I know some people who have taken it with him or work for him. Also there are previous exams if you wanted to gauge the difficulty."
