Is professor George A. Akerlof still teaching in UC Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17rbhhq/is_professor_george_a_akerlof_still_teaching_in/,2023-11-09 04:06:03,"Hi, Iâ€™m considering transferring to UC Berkeley and I wanna study Economics. Professor George A. Akerlof is so famous and he got the Nobel Prize! Because heâ€™s old, is he still teaching? If he is, what course is he teaching?","Itâ€™s likely heâ€™s not teaching anymore but there are Economics faculty that have won the John Bates Clark Award, which winners often win a Nobel Prize in the future.

At Berkeley thereâ€™s Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman, and Emi Nakamura who you can take classes from.
Having a noble prize doesnâ€™t mean that they are good at teaching or even a good person â€¦.
His wife is also Secretary of the Treasury
Fun fact the full name for a nobel prize in econ is *The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobe*l. It is the only ""nobel prize"" to have this distinction of being in memory of, as the grand children of Alfred Nobel wished to make a distinction between this one and the other ones.
He retired from Berkeley in 2010 I think.
If David Card is still teaching, you can take a class from another Nobel prize winner.
100% this. especially as Nobel's are for research advances it has zero bearing on their teaching ability. And even dropping the name is of limited use unless you work super closely with them and/or are at grad level.
You could say heâ€™s a lemon of a professor ðŸ¤£
I think he retired

Akerlofâ€™s Nobel Prize contribution is for the market of Lemons https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons

Lemons are poor quality cars that buyers cannot be sure of.
Cool"
