Anthro 150 w Alexei Yurchak,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15enzla/anthro_150_w_alexei_yurchak/,2023-07-31 11:30:08,"Need to take an upperdiv humanities, and enrolled for anthro150. Is the class easy? Hows the professor? Any other suggestion on classes I should take to fulfill the requirement instead?","I took this course over summer and honestly enjoyed the class.  That said in the summer course we got a lot of information in a very short course and it was a lot.   A full semester would likely be easier.     For us 1/3 was participation in class 1/3 was attendance and 1/3 was a final essay at the end of the course.  

Prof Yurchak is nice and as long as you pay attention and make an effort it shouldnâ€™t be a problem.  

My one nitpick would be on grading.     I passed with an A+. But I only know that because it was entered into calcentral.   I have no idea what grades I got in the partipation/attendance/or the final essay just that I got an A+"
