Hi guys, do you have any 61B TA recommendations for regular, bridge, and exam prep discussions?","Jedi, if you are considering bridge

Dom is a grandma who gives out cookies but also benches you with one hand and boxes. 10/10 would recommend
I think Sherry is really great! I attended her exam prep section when I first took CS61B and she does a really great job breaking down the problem and explaining how to tackle it. She's also really goated - ask her any question and she'll give a really good response.
Vidya! super energetic and good at explaining, you won't be bored
Crystal and Jedi
Noah
Hairy Larry
Jasmine is great! She's really concise and detailed with her explanations and willing to take time to walk things through with you.
Crystal and Noah are nice af
I was in the same 61B class (fa20) as Sherry was and can confirm that she's awesome :). One of the most active on Ed our semester.
Yes!! Sherry's discussion was super amazing and her explanations were really clear
agreed! super engaging and really funny! hers was the only section i always wanted to attend bc her antics kept me awake (she literally stood on the table to lecture sometimes :D)
wholeheartedly agree, had Vidya during a hilfy semester and her discussion section was the only reason I still paid attention in class
This is the real answer"
