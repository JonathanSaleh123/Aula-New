Math 53 adjunct and going under 13 units,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mym0qs/math_53_adjunct_and_going_under_13_units/,2021-04-25 17:57:44,"I haven't attended a single Math 53 adjunct session after the first month. Is Michael going to give me an NP? If so, I want to late drop it, but doing so will put me under 13 units. Do I have any penalties for going under 13 units this semester for L&S?","I don’t think you should late drop an adjunct in my honest opinion. you only have one late drop and so you should probably save it for an emergency. You should probably talk to him about it
I thought late drops in Sp21 didn't count toward that limit - what I'm worried about is going under 13 units.
Ouu I didn’t know that! My apologizes !"

I am a freshman and need to drop one of those classes. I have all online classes (the only one that isn’t online is Spanish) and I am undeclared in the College of L&S. I am also taking a business and math class so would like help from anyone who knows the workload, professors, etc for these classes. 

Help is much appreciated and needed!!","Nutrition
I loved 133A so I'd recommend keeping it! Rosenthal is great"
EECS Funding Town Hall Materials,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/t1a3jm/eecs_funding_town_hall_materials/,2022-02-25 09:56:41," If anyone is curious how the EE/CS Funding Town Hall went, here are the materials! We had a pretty good faculty (and student) turnout, and there was some very interesting information shared! This isn't the end of the effort, but a good starting point, since now we're more on the same page than we were before. Hope it helps! :))

Special thanks to Josh Hug for the presentation and fielding questions, and Michael Ball for the organisation efforts.

**EECS 101 Piazza Post:** https://piazza.com/class/hyq0br1u3kx7dg?cid=16588","This is the way to go. Give priority to people who came in as CS. People who applied as Applied Math or whatever can still major but have to go through the application process. Hopefully this gets approved soon
Someone who’s watched it/participated, may you bless us with a tl;dr?
Is it possible to pitch to the Bay Area VCs to fund/donate to eecs department? :(
- Per surveys, the current 3.3 declaration model leads to widespread anxiety and mental health concerns, while significantly disadvantaging URM and students with less prior experience. This has led to L&S CS having 3-4% URM lately compared with EECS's 22%.
- Out of MIT, Stanford, CMU, UIUC, UW, and Berkeley, Berkeley has the lowest full-time employment count in CS and by far the highest ratio of FTE to CS degrees issued.
- The College of Engineering receives about $54 per student credit hour (where a credit hour is 3 hours * number of units) relative to the $100-120/SCH funding received. To make up this deficit, we rely on savings from faculty going on leave (which scales directly with the number of faculty, **not** the number of students), or methods such as philanthropy, one-time allocations, fixed allocations, concurrent enrollment, etc. (which do not scale directly with the number of faculty or number of students).
- The gap between costs and funding received means the department is operating under greater and greater deficits.
- For Fall 2023 and beyond, a new proposal is in the works to have ~270 L&S CS freshmen per year. 200 will be accepted directly at time of admission into UC Berkeley, and 70 slots will be reserved for those who did not apply for CS initially but wish to transfer into the program after a year. 50 slots reserved for transfers, direct admits only.
- Potential measures for existing students include reducing the size of lower division courses, prioritizing EECS and L&S CS-intended students over undeclareds, allowing for alternatives such as Math 54 over EECS 16B, etc.
Looking at the draft plans, I would say if it gets approved, it would be a University of Washington style admission process.
Probably; something we wanted to talk about but didn't get to was external funding for EE/CS. One of the topics proposed was if we could get funding directly funneled into a fund for TA budgets instead of being stuck at the administrative level but that needs more digging into before we can concretely say that's a possibility.

Apple hardware for example though has been directly funding some EE/EECS courses, highest being CS152 I believe, and honestly if you're at an internship it might be possible to talk with people about funding the CS side. Opening a conversation tactfully shouldn't hurt anything.
> while significantly disadvantaging URM and students with less prior experience. This has led to L&S CS having 3-4% URM lately compared with EECS's 22%.

This is nuanced.

* EECS hit 22% a single year (last) because they changed admission criteria (remember CS is on academic merit - EECS is more holistic, that is subjective). It's back to 12% this year regardless.  I also don't think it is fair to use the word ""disadvantaged"" (at least in a meritocratic sense) until we have enough data on the GPAs of different groups under this revised admission system.
* LS CS has a significantly higher representation of women (28% vs 20% for EECS).  This bellies the ""less experience"" claim and also suggests the EECS admission criteria is actually *disadvantaging women* (they get in at higher rates under the more meritocratic assessment - and may be more risk averse to apply directly to EECS which can lower their chances of getting into Berkeley)

One thing Berkeley should consider is transferring rejected EECS applicants to the general L&S pool - which at least reduce the bias toward risk taking EECS produces.

On another note, did the video cover why money is not being transferred from other departments given demand for CS?
what's the impact of less FTE? i can see how there are less classes offered, but how less FTE affect class sizes? I would say barely; I would've thought the main variable for scaling classes is hiring TAs to scale with the increased grading and discussion sections and office hour
I thought it was weird that the L&S admit size was ""tuned to get the same admit rate as EECS,"" since he also speculated that people will be more likely to apply L&S to avoid being shut out of Cal. If they try to keep the rates the same the CS admit size will grow, but if they hold onto the CS admit size the CS rate will instantly be worse than EECS. It's just inherently unstable. With any luck they will get to a unified applicant pool quickly because alternatives all end up with miserable game theoretic angles.

I am at least glad that they noticed that the UCSD lottery was a dumb idea (seems like they realized last year, before it failed).
Oooo this is such a good idea, I imagine it will be a win win for both the company and the school.
It makes sense at the university level but not at the department level.  As someone reminded him, if your majors want 189 but can't get in, the play is to make your own customized 189 with blackjack and hookers (e.g., Stat, IEOR); if you do it right, you ask your dean for the added FTE and your department funding grows!
I think something that's also been a bit of a concern is if we actually **do** manage to get private funding and wind up relying on that, how much control do private corporations (or VCs) have on how we teach our courses, what we teach, and more. Almost like when politicians rely on funding from corporations.

The company's main asset would be establishing a direct pipeline to their company, but I'd imagine as a company, they'd want incoming students to have specific types of knowledge, which may not be what the course wants to teach (or primarily) teach and that could cause a conflict of interest.

So all in all... _complicated_!
It also seems large such a dangerous place to put the department in? The university should never *ever* be able to suggest that a department go beg industry for funding, and if EECS starts funding large parts of its TAS budget through it I don't doubt that the university will start expecting them to continue to find external funding and therefore never bother growing or expanding their budget."
