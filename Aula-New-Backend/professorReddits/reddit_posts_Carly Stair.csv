"Dilemma.. I injured myself during winter break and still not healed. Missed first week of classes, what can I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10hh0eh/dilemma_i_injured_myself_during_winter_break_and/,2023-01-20 19:01:25,"Over winter break I injured my knee pretty badly. Did some tests and doc said it’s likely an ACL injury and Im worried it might require surgery. It’s been a month since the injury and while things are very very very slowly improving, I still cannot walk without crutches and can’t imagine being on campus having to travel back and forth between classes on crutches, going up/down flights of stairs, or even walking to the parking lot to get to my car. I had a class in moffit last semester and the thought of me holding up a literal hoard of people behind me gives me so much anxiety 😭

I’ve missed the first week of classes… one of my professors has already assured me my spot is ok and the class  and participation is on bcourses/course capture so he said I can take all the time I need. My other two profs have been unresponsive. One class I’m waitlisted in, the other I’m enrolled and the prof basically said she doesn’t think it’ll work for me if I miss more than 2 weeks - she posts absolutely nothing on bcourses and when I asked for the syllabus she did not respond to me :(

Has anyone here ever been in this situation or know someone who has? I’m hoping I can drop the two unresponsive profs and find some online courses I can replace them with, but I’m so stressed and having trouble because it’s literally about to be the second week of school and most are full (fml 😭)I’m also dealing with other health conditions and a family crisis (usually manageable but this injury is causing additional stress), and I work full time across the bay. 

Or (and sorry if this is dumb!) would it be possible for me to drop the two classes, just take 1 course this semester, and submit a petition/request to the school for my time at Cal to be extended by 1 additional semester? (Update: Just realized I cannot do this because of financial aid :( so pretty much my only option is to find 2 other classes to take that are mainly online?) 

I’m really sad about the timing of my injury… for sure I’m going to try to schedule an appointment with a counselor next week to sort everything out.","don’t worry! this situation is survivable. first and foremost, tell the loop program on campus (call them) and get a loop card, and they can pick u up and take u to and from ur classes. My roommate was on crutches and it saved him the walking time. Also, it’s free of course. I don’t know what ur major is but both stat 2 and psych 1 are online and are not very difficult so u could take those if they apply to ur major. I think the semester extension would be premature, you can use the loop system to get to ur classes. I’d drop the unresponsive profs if you don’t absolutely need those classes. I hope this helped a little.
You can talk to both college advisor and dsp advisor to see what they suggest you to do. Maybe they can offer you loop car service or something like that! I’ve been through much worse situations but still survived.

Hope you recover soon!
definitely reach out to an advisor/dsp advisor! however if you’re searching for online courses, eps c20 and nusctx 11 are both online and offer online sections. eps c20 expanded the class size today but i’m not too sure about nusctx 11
Not much advice here, but just wishing you a quick recovery and hope that things get better soon <3
Definitely contact the DSP office immediately.  You may qualify for [temporary academic accommodations under DSP](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/new-students/temporary-conditions).
What everyone is saying about your advisor is good, and I want to add that this is a disability - so I’d reach out to the accessibility office as well.
also check out the course catalog and filter by asynchronous, there should be a few more options
Hey thank you so much! These past couple weeks have been quite stressful and I definitely am jumping to extremes suggesting the extension. I’m gonna spend the weekend looking up the asynchronous classes, hopefully it’ll all work out for me this semester. Thank you so much!! I really appreciate your advice. Thank you also for reminding me about the loop program!! 🙏🏽
i’m not sure if the deadline has passed but you could also enroll in a cross-campus online course through uc online"
