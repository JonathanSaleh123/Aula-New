GWS 14,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rxym3b/gws_14/,2022-01-06 20:28:56,"Does anyone know how this class is as a gpa-boosting breadth? Courtney Morris will be the professor. I'm planning to take Math 1B, Chem 3a/3al, and GWS 14 next semester so how would that workload look like?

Are there any other gpa-boosting breadths that you guys would recommend for international studies or philosophy and values? (I've already done my AC requirement btw)",
