Any further context? Economy? Housing?
Berkeley is experiencing a housing crisis that it may or may not be coming out of ([https://belonging.berkeley.edu/deconstructing-housing-crisis](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/deconstructing-housing-crisis)) and a relatively serious homelessness issue. However, if you have the money to afford living there comfortably, its is a beautiful city with lots of culture and history. Additionally, it has some of the best weather in the country outside of southern California in my opinion."
I just dont understand Berkeley College Republicans(BCR) with regards to the Ann Coulter event.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/66m2n9/i_just_dont_understand_berkeley_college/,2017-04-20 18:09:37,"BCR invited both Milo and Ann Coulter.
Im going to assume that the Milo incident was an unfortunate incident. so lets move along to the Ann Coulter event.

""Officials had previously warned that due to a lack of an available, protectable venue, staging such an event on April 27, **the date students had picked for the controversial speaker’s appearance — and which campus administrators only discovered when it was reported in newspapers** — made it impossible for police to ensure the protection of students, attendees, the inevitable throngs of protesters or Coulter herself.""

so they didnt go through appropriate channels to secure resources for the event. that seems... weird. they did so the first time. and i quote their website **""We would like to thank UCPD and the university administration for doing all they could to ensure the safety of everyone involved.""**  even with preparation the first time, it was a disaster and security was a joke. why did they choose not to notify campus admins like the first time and take **additional steps** to have the event proceed smoothly rather than cutting them out completely?

""UC Police Capt. Alex Yao said his department **had intelligence on “specific and credible” threats regarding the announced April 27 event. ""**

then the event got cancelled because Ann had security concerns and her conditions couldnt be met within that time frame. but the university gets the blame for it. ok, so lets have it rescheduled then so there would be ample time for everyone to be on the same page, and the event would carry on.

""BCR spokesperson Naweed Tahmas said **the organization had “no intention” of working with campus administrators with regards to the scheduled May 2 event.**

**“We’re still moving forward with Coulter coming on April 27,** no matter how many times the campus whines about it,” Tahmas said."" 

they're insisting to move forward on the date where the police said they had intelligence on specific and credible threats?

so, for postponing the event due to ""specific and credible threats"", organizing the event and acknowledging it officially, BCR apparently has a beef with the administrators. 

are you serious? im confused if they would prefer the event to proceed smoothly or not, because this almost seems like sabotage to me. im smack in the middle and im for free speech. the right calls the left whiny and snowflakes but oh the hypocrisy here...

the university is way bigger than one talk. why does it have to go to extreme lengths to provide your every need, at your beck and call, especially on **finals review week.** its just unconscionable and doesnt align with their apparent intentions and shows a severe lack of good faith. am I the only one that thinks theres more to it than it meets the eye? dam, even for a stanford prank, this is crossing the line.

if i were to put on my tin foil hat and stretch the hell out of it, imagine ANTIFA infiltrating BCR and inviting speakers knowing there would be push back, intentionally reducing the chances of a smooth event, coordinate with the police to stand down and let the world burn !!!  bet you 20 bucks i can sell this story to infowars. make it 30.

**edit: folks, Ann Coulter is insisting on her April 27th visit. citing HUNREDS OF THOUSANDS in rescheduling costs. PSA: according to her shes doing us a huge favor https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/855209189328551936  this news is sweeter than the story of easter. oh spread the good word of the chosen ! apparently they wont rest till shit hits the fan. book sales, air time pays the bills right? i mean free speech. sorry i meant free speech pays the bills.**",".
Because they're trolls.
>they're insisting to move forward on the date where the police said they had intelligence on specific and credible threats?

BCR is using a similar tactic employed by Milo and Ann Coulter: they are letting their opponents appear anti free speech by baiting them with intentionally provocative messages that will cause a fraction of protesters to attempt to shut it down.  They are fully aware that it will cause an overreaction (hence the preference for a date and location with greater likelihood for problems).  

It's a perfect opportunity for them to appear sympathetic and virtuous to the general public; and as an added bonus it makes the left look hypocritical.  BCR could choose from a variety of speakers whose credibility is based on the quality of their ideas, but instead they choose career provocateurs and at this point the reason is becoming pretty clear.  From a strategic standpoint it's a win-lose situation that favors them.  

One of the best responses that students who self-identify as progressive could do in this situation is publicly distance themselves from others who feel entitled to shut down Ann Coulter.  BCR is baiting their ideological opponents.
Threats of violence should not ever be used by administration as an excuse to eliminate or postpone a speech. It sets a horrible precedent and will only lead to more threats in the future. BCR is entirely in the right here.
I am not sure that it is factually true that BCR invited Coulter.  At the very least, it wasn't just BCR that extended the invitation.  My understanding is that Bridge USA had significant involvement in organizing the talk.

Here is a little info on Bridge USA:
https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/bridgecal
Bomb threats and threats of specific harm were used against school integration, too. Does freedom become chained when harm is merely threatened?
Step 1: Try to exercise freedom of speech at a public university

Step 2: Get harassed by protestors with bike locks and M80s as cops do nothing

Step 3: Upload footage of the violence and cops doing nothing, pass around dipshit articles written in the Daily Cal supporting violence

Step 4: Profit

For the people genuinely interested in free speech, the endgame is supporting the First Amendment. A public university must provide a platform for every speaker who is invited by a university group that goes through the correct channels and protect them and their supporters from harm. It doesn't look good when police are sitting in their vans while ANTIFA are lobbing fireworks at people.

For the people who just hate the left and Berkeley in general, the goal is to put pressure on the Trump administration to remove federal funding for a university that appears to not uphold American values like the First Amendment and whose federal nuclear research could be done at Oak Ridge instead.

In my opinion, it doesn't matter how outlandish or bigoted a speaker is. They have their right to the freedom of speech and assembly, no matter what their ideals are. 

Disclaimer: I don't go to UC Berkeley.
If the campus culture didn't alienate Republicans and force an ideology through the AC requirement, I doubt they would retaliate like this.
O GOD OF GOVERNMENT GIVE ME A SAFE PLACE ON THE VIPER TONGUE OF BABYLON, AT EVERY FALSE CHRIST TONGUE SET ON FIRE OF HELL BURNING JUDGMENTS, WHERE THIER IS NO SAFE PLACE WHILE GOD IS FELLING EVERY TOWER CALL 911 FELL YOUR TOWERS.

about your question on the BCR, please refer to my tin foil hat theory.
Harmeet K. Dhillon is female. huh.
Antifa should be mass arrested, they shouldnt hold sway over anyone's basic human rights. 

Fuck them and anybody who defends them. 
> One of the best responses that students who self-identify as progressive could do in this situation is publicly distance themselves from others who feel entitled to shut down Ann Coulter.

And there's the rub.  The MAJORITY of folks of any stripe are distancing themselves.  It's easy to point to an editorial board made up of an exceedingly miniscule fraction of the population that have a mission to speak their mind as the standard bearers for public opinion - but they are un-appointed voices and nothing more.

The overwhelming majority are distant and grumbling about the polarization of this entire situation.

And you're right, it's all expertly crafted outrage from the incredibly vocal few.

Go to a local bar this afternoon and ask if anyone really gives a shit - you're bound to get answers from 95% of folks that they just don't care and would prefer people STFU on both sides.
firstly, threats of violence come in a huge range of degrees. what risk are you willing to take? mob of 5000? bomb threats? rather than call it an excuse it can also be called a valid concern? considering the primary responsibilities of a university is to educate and ensure the students is it not? i mean if i were in a mall, darn it would set horrible precedent if they evacuated the mall cuz it would only lead to more threats in the future.
the police said they had intel. of course im speculating - if they have a lead to investigate the lead, should they not make it a priority?
sure free speech is important, very important actually, but i view the lives of students who who spent the past few months grinding their arse off and their safety as a priority as it is the primary responsibility of the university.

last time i checked, it was a university, not a free speech auditorium. judge a fish by how fast it can climb a tree, you'll forever think its an idiot.

firstly bridgeusa is an org born outside campus https://www.bridgeusa.org/
secondly, no doubt there are other groups involved, but they are dwarfed by the size of BCR in terms of membership and influence. BCR was the group in contact with the admin later on and the admin acknowledged BCR was the group that invited her. 
sure there were other smaller orgs involved but thats like bringing australia into the iraq war discussion 
Are you really comparing Ann coulter speaking at a Berkeley rally on a specific date to school integration?
do schools and malls evacuate when theres a bomb threat? how about the freedom to education or to shop, or to just be free?  how dare a bomb threat interfere with my freedom? 40,000 kids on campus, 95% have no part and honestly dont care about the event for or against. dam lets all forget about the bomb threat, since we got no time to investigate by the event date. 39000? who cares, the freedom of maybe a hundred or more students can attend a talk on finals preparation week. seems like no duh right?
a venue is being provided with timing less than 2 weeks away.
i agree with your points. its turned into a political prop by both sides. and i agree with what you say about free speech. the most outspoken credible liberal professor is actually for the event too https://www.facebook.com/RBReich/posts/1543112875701303
but can you imagine you're heading to the library and there are protests and riots. you got 3 projects to finish, meetings to attend, reports to write, and finals to cram, all when this mess is going on? and on another note, if your campus had intel on security issues that might risk your safety, would your parents prefer they postpone the event to make necessary arrangements? if you were a parent and your child was a student, would you prefer the admin go through due process to ensure safety of all students and faculty? in this case i feel that the university is acting in its best interest with regards to its priorities as a university as an education  and research facility and putting the safety and academics of its students first.
How exactly do you think The First Amendment is being violated?  That would imply that the government was punishing people who expressed certain beliefs. The police not acting the way you want them to does not violate any law.  For instance, if my friend hits me because I call him an idiot and the police didn't immediately shoot tear gas canisters at him, that doesn't violate any principle.  However, if a government official tells tells the police to shoot tear canisters at me because I called him an idiot, that would violate the First Amendment as well as freedom of speech
if i recall you only need to take 2 AC requirement classes. and the ones i took happened to be very open dialogue to the point where you could stand up and disagree with the professor. personally i found those classes to be the most open minded class i've ever taken still pretty surprised thinking back now. i dont think the campus culture alienates republicans. the biz school has/had a ton of them, IIRC some BCR members are biz majors. i feel that there is a distaste for trump's policies than conservatives in general IMO.
Yeah but republicans are irrational as a rule. Their assumptions about the nature of reality are almost always false.

Academia is overwhelmingly leftist. Republicans alienate themselves by getting an education.
>The MAJORITY of folks of any stripe are distancing themselves.

That's why I think it's necessary to make their voices heard by doing it publicly.  Otherwise the miniscule fraction become the standard bearers and misrepresent the populace.  
If they're calling in bomb threats, attacking people with deadly weapons and using explosives. Why the fuck aren't these people being treated like terrorists?

I understand that you're motivated to make the BCR a bogey man and that discounting BridgeUSA's involvement makes it more convenient for you to further your narrative.  

I don't claim to have full information on who was involved and to what extent, but for whatever reason, you're motivated to cast aspersions at BCR.

If you are to believe this NPR article, 3 separate organizations invited, organized, and/or funded Coulter's talk.

http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/20/524830514/ann-coulter-vows-to-speak-at-uc-berkeley-despite-planned-speech-cancellation
>Are you really comparing Ann coulter speaking at a Berkeley rally on a specific date to school integration?

No. That would be silly and I thank you for clarifying! The only comparison is in terms of people shaping behavior they dislike by violence. I don't think that there is any law protecting Coulter's right to go speak at Berkeley, but there is a guiding principle. On the other hand, many court cases struck down the ""separate but equal"" farce as unconstitutional.
>do schools and malls evacuate when theres a bomb threat? how about the freedom to education or to shop, or to just be free?  

Do you have information about a bomb threat? You should tell campus police about that very soon. All I have seen so far is people from Berkeley Fight round 4 planning to bring slightly larger sticka to Berkeley Fight Round 5.

For the rest... That has become policy sometimes. For reasonably credible threats of large size. But how many bomb/gun threats failed to cancel graduation, inauguration, etc?
>a venue is being provided with timing less than 2 weeks away.

Oh jeez... I just heard about this. Maybe if they sell tickets they can afford the police overtime.

I agree that safety concerns must be met, but the University still has to actually try to fulfill their part of the deal by providing actual security. Obviously, they haven't done that.

Finals week isn't as important to them right now. It doesn't matter to them what other students think, because they feel as if they're already against BCR anyway. The opinion of thousands who they feel hate them anyway means nothing against the potential national coverage they could receive from an anti-Coulter riot.

It looks to me that from BCR's perspective, the University's already ripped them off to the token of several thousand dollars in security fees, only to have a total lack of security. Why should they work with an administration that's screwed them over already?

Combine that with the high morale following their recent victory against ANTIFA and their like, and they're thinking that they can just beat the Hell out of anyone who tries to fight them. They don't need the police, they'll think. They didn't do anything in the first place and we kicked their asses last time.


[removed]
I'm gonna use a bit of an extreme example here.

The police, as public servants, have to at least try to protect the non-violent parts of both sides. For example, when the Westboro Baptist Church slings their bullshit at funerals, the police make sure the church is separated from everyone else, because SCOTUS has ruled that as long as they don't try to physically hurt anyone, they're exercising their right to free speech.

Most importantly, when people start throwing rocks or other shit at them, the police evacuate them immediately. 

At the latest Berkeley protest, the police managed to keep the two sides separated (initially), but then proceeded to not do a damn thing when ANTIFA started lobbing M80s at people. They then decided to keep not doing anything while people were slugging it out in the streets.

By sitting there in their vans, they failed to try and protect the non-violent groups of both parties. If the police had done their jobs, there would be a free speech rally on one side, and then a counter-protest on the other, without any violence going on whatsoever.
If the syllabus explicitly states the purpose of the class is geared towards a more open and inclusive society and some of the subject matter includes immigration -- sure, you can write an essay that goes against the grain. And if you don't work twice as hard on it compared to a liberal viewpoint on the same paper, count on that grade going down.
You say that while your campus is being burned down by socialists.
Yea, because its always republicans out there destroying shit because someone they don't like gets to speak. Your statement is comically ironic considering that the entire point of inviting these speakers is to publicly display how irrational leftists are. 

Yes, academia is overwhelmingly leftist, which it seems is why we are seeing a massive wave of anti-intellectualism, anti-free speech, anti-debate, and radicalism. 
I can never tell when someone is being sarcastic on this subreddit or trolling, but on all non-environmental issues I have found the Republican thought pool to be much more grounded in reality not ideology. It simply assumes that people are more self-interested than compassionate, which from my experience people are.
> Academia is overwhelmingly leftist. Republicans alienate themselves by getting an education.

You realize this is because of anti-conservative discrimination, right?
Or call people out on outright fallacious statements that these vocal few on either side are representations of the majority.

I've always had a strong distaste for the idea that there's a moral obligation to decry or denounce positions to maintain your own perceived morality.  It cuts both ways.  A fiscal conservative should be under no obligation to denounce white nationalists because they hold a conservative view.  I'm under no obligation to denounce antifa's actions because I hold some socially liberal views.  (I do and I have stated that numerous times here, but I'll be damned if it's my moral obligation).
Major threats of violence are being made by antifa. The question is, will they act on them. After the free speech rally, antifa upped the ante and they were saying in online forums that they were going to procure firearms and combat training for the next showdown.

call up the white house and ask. if they were viewed as terrorists the national guard would be here rather than have cops standing around.
both extremes of the aisle enjoy the drama dont you see. the pundits and the media thrive on the coverage, cooking up a hot pot of poo. as i mentioned, justice and free speech dont keep their lights on or pay their bills.
WTH? And you wonder why people consider you folks crazy. Yes Cal has a problem with some other crazies who disrupt any event they dislike, that said advocating for killing them isn't a particularly well thought out idea or anything close to an actual solution.

""And late Thursday night, a lawyer for the Berkeley College Republicans, which invited Ms. Coulter to campus, threatened to sue the university unless it permits the speech to go ahead.""

1. i mean really, if there werent the most heavily invested in the event, hire a lawyer? if their lawyer is heading the negotiations, it would be odd to assume they werent leading the charge right?

2. BCR were the first to flat out reject the reschedule but the other orgs had a different tone.

3. BCR also invited controversial speakers in the past.

4. theres an overlap between the orgs. 

5. the word choices between Ann Coulter and the BCR were similar.
you seem to want to bring up bridgeUSA so here we go.

""BridgeUSA Co-president Pranav Jandhyala said his organization is still evaluating whether May 2 will be a feasible date to host the event, citing concerns that Coulter’s security team may not be able to accommodate the newly proposed date. He was also unsure of whether the Young America’s Foundation would still sponsor Coulter’s talk.""

compare their tone versus BCR. then keep in mind the topic of this post was on good faith.
""“We’re still moving forward with Coulter coming on April 27, no matter how many times the campus whines about it,” Tahmas said.""

do i need to go on? 

now compare my points with arguments you are putting forth. isnt the whataboutism derailing the focus which is the lack of good faith?

lets review the definition of discounting. discount means i put them at lesser value than their role. however i did acknowledge their existence in prior comments, as did news articles and even official statements by the university. if their role is lesser, and i portray them in the lesser role that they indeed are, how is that discounting? would you say other allied drone strikes are discounted in media coverage?

with regards of what im motivated or not motivated. lets visit that.
the biz school is significantly more conservative if you were to compare them with other departments
and as a biz school alum, it is not in my interest to speak ill of fellow conservatives.
the dean who most definitely remembers me would smack the shit outta me if he knew i posted this and the professors i keep in contact with would frown upon this.
not to mention much of the leadership and spotlight on the BCR are my biz school juniors. 
so to assume that i motivated to make BCR a bogeyman, it would be conservative to call that a stretch.

lets talk about the arguments you have continually put forth that there were other orgs involved. the discussion was the question of good faith in organizing the event. so tell me the significance in terms of material discussion your points are adding. 

regardless of who they invite, how they do it and their agendas, they're still part of the school and community. unlike a whole stream of highly informed, well researched professional commentators that come in here everytime drama erupts, im merely pointing out a mess i see in our own house.  i would appreciate if you didnt paint me with the same brush stroke you use with the media and their adorable muppets.

you know when your neighbor's dog poos on your front porch, and your neighbor doesnt clean it up and it stinks up your driveway? disliking the dog doesnt have to have some kind of hidden motive, agenda, such as restricting the freedom of the dog to roam explore the neighborhood. it sometimes is as simple as its because it stinks up the driveway. 

your comment opened with bomb threat. i merely borrowed it. guess i got my point across. if they need time to coordinate with neighboring police departments im gonna assume the threat doesnt have anything to do with hugs and kisses.
hold up a second. how does the university fulfill their part by providing actual security if the actual security doesnt want to comply?

secondly, the university returned the security fees during the milo incident. so i have no clue what you're getting that from.

i agree with you on what the BCR might be thinking. and it probably has got to do with a publicity high. they feel empowered being in the spotlight. but man, it cheapens politics, free speech and the real issues.
OK, so you're dissatisfied with the way the police responded.  Don't act like it's a matter of free speech or the first amendment though.   That's disingenuous.    If attacked, the protest group also has a right to defend themselves.  And they can press charges against any individual who attacked them.  

hmm the only immigration i read in an AC class was in anthropology. i think i took environmental science too. about pollution.
there are probably a hundred AC classes. you gotta be interested in lets say gender studies to actually take gender studies right. its not like they lack options and force you to take very extreme liberal classes. its like ordering something on the menu. i dont understand why theres a misconception that you're somehow forced to take liberal classes. business classes are part of AC choices, some classes in economics too, literature? architecture? law? foreign languages? theres a gigantic list.
and from personal experience, ive written very controversial papers. even my application as a sophmore to biz school probably would have been Ann Coulter level of controversial and i was accepted. from my personal experiences, man i dont know where you guys are getting this from, but it seems like a different world from your words
Destruction, violence, gulags, forced labor, genocide are all A-OK when its done for socialism!
>Yea, because its always republicans out there destroying shit because someone they don't like gets to speak. Your statement is comically ironic considering that the entire point of inviting these speakers is to publicly display how irrational leftists are.

The issue is the content of the speech. Its all a load of drivel. Our actions are perfectly rational given our anti-capitalist world view. We're past dialogue, direct action is the way forward.

>Yes, academia is overwhelmingly leftist, which it seems is why we are seeing a massive wave of anti-intellectualism, anti-free speech, anti-debate, and radicalism.

The point is that academia is overwhelmingly leftist :)

Right wing **views** just don't cut it, they don't qualify as intellectualism and therefore don't exist in the intellectual sphere. Republicans are basically just reactionaries.
>It simply assumes that people are more self-interested than compassionate, which from my experience people are.

this statement alone shows how pathetic your understanding of the world is. from egoism to dialectics, the left has produced highly nuanced conceptions of human nature and that we should structure society along these lines, which is pretty counter intuitive.

The right assumes everyone is self-interested, which is true, but they assume that self interest necessarily leads to greed, conflict and competition. It doesn't occur to them that this view serves those in power.

I'm not going to explain to you exactly how human nature works, its yours responsibility to educate yourself: read up on dialectical materialism, watch some Steven Pinker, Noam Chomsky, etc. 

the republican party elected Donald Trump as president, they have people like Ben Carson within their ranks. the fact that you're telling me that republican views are grounded in reality makes me crack up.
no its because conservative views are wrong.
Moral obligation?  No.  

Pragmatic obligation?  Hell yes.  

I don't know if you've noticed, but lately American society has been rather big on this concept of ""identity.""  If you don't want shitty tangential people to define the groups you identify with (in this case, ""liberals""), then you should tell said shitmeisters to eff off.

Berkeley is synonymous with progressive liberalism.  The main imagery that came out of the April 15th free speech protest, in Berkeley, was a bunch of black masked fuckers coming in to the protest and being violent, in Berkeley (emphasizing Berkeley for a reason).  Whether or not _you_ think Antifa = liberal, or whether or not the conservatives were KKK or not, it doesn't matter, the defining ethos that emerged from the protest can be wordcloud summarized as: Berkeley (and by association, liberal) Antifa counterprotesters shut down free speech protest.  

So through no fault of your own except _not_ denouncing Antifa, the liberal part of your identity is now associated with Antifa, in exactly the same way that fiscal conservatives' identity, rightly or wrongly, is now connected to white nationalism and anti-Mexican sentiment by way of some other conservatives who supported Trump. 

Therefore, while it's not a moral duty to denounce them, it definitely hurts the rest of your liberal causes to _not_ denounce them. 
I disagree. Anitifa is preventing people from exercising their free speech rights and nobody from the left is doing a god damned thing to stop them. 

Yes, I do feel that the other leftists in the crowd have a moral duty to hold back their violent members. Otherwise, 95% of people being against their actions means nothing if they aren't willing to act to prove it. 

The peaceful minority are irrelevant unless they are willing to help stop the violent ones. 
Breaking news... from the Chronicle:

""The student groups that invited right-wing pundit Ann Coulter to UC Berkeley gave campus administrators an ultimatum Friday: Let her speak on campus Thursday evening or they will sue the university in federal court on grounds it is violating the students’ constitutional rights.

The Berkeley College Republicans and a nonpartisan student group, BridgeUSA, gave administrators a 5 p.m. Friday deadline to decide, and have hired San Francisco attorney Harmeet Dhillon to help them.""

http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Student-groups-threaten-to-sue-UC-Berkeley-over-11089797.php

I have admitted and continue to admit that I'm not privy to all the information.  As Mark Twain said, ""if you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed.  If you do read the newspaper, you're misinformed"".  I'm just saying that you're drawing conclusions all of which lead you to cast aspersions toward the BCR.  My only dog in this fight is the freedom of speech and not cowing to a howling mob.  In that regard, I find the BCR as holding the moral highground even if that might mean poking some people in the eye while being very assertive.  And again, it's not just BCR that is involved in this fight... BridgeUSA and YAF are involved, and I suspect FIRE will also become involved.  At some point, this issue goes well beyond BCR. 
>your comment opened with bomb threat. i merely borrowed it. guess i got my point across. if they need time to coordinate with neighboring police departments im gonna assume the threat doesnt have anything to do with hugs and kisses.

 I colored with the big marker there. Free speech should never be subject to limits based on fear. Dubya was a coward to create 'Free Speech zones' and Obama was a fool to strengthen penalties for being unruly in them (Felony?). If nasty people can shackle freedoms just by threatening, liberty loses.

Coordination: The strategy of the Berkely PD looked (based on their interviews) like having a lot of police to make a perimeter and stand ready, but not strolling through a crowd of people to make arrests and risk escalation. I am not qualified to comment, but I have raised an eyebrow and accept that it's one approach that got 0 people killed. I can't help but think that their policy rewards wearing masks.
Was that City or Campus PD standing there and doing nothing?

If I were in a position of power at Berkeley, I would want to have a dedicated campus police unit that could fulfill these security operations without depending on the city PD. The lack of ability to protect their students is a long-term issue that a campus with a reputation of protests and rioting should have taken into account a long time ago.

In the short term, however, the University is in a bind. I doubt that campus PD can do their job independently of city PD at this point in time, so until whoever is in charge of city PD's response gets their head out of their ass, the University is going to keep taking heat.

As for the refund, I didn't know the administration refunded the fee. Good on them. But the experience still remains. BCR paid for a service that they didn't get. Luckily, they got their money back.
The ""protesters"" (and let's not call them that, they were thugs) were the ones assaulting people. Furthermore, this is an issue of Freedom of Speech: If the University fails to provide an adequate venue – with security and all – to a group on campus based on a Heckler's veto, then that group simply has no freedom to voice their speech on this public university.
It's an American History class, I would not call that an extreme liberal class.
Truly bizarre to see you have Econ in your tag and also identify as 'anti-capitalist.' 

Your actions are only rational in the context that you betray all of the ideas that you champion. Going around, calling others 'fascist' while you go promoting some other flavor of totalitarianism. Praising concepts like diversity but hating difference of thought. I don't identify as right wing but what's coming from the left is a whole lot less conducive to freedom and values this country was founded on. 

You talk about 'direct action' but that really only extends to the boundaries of your safe space, the university. You can be bold and violent when in numbers and with the blessing of the administration, but outside of that your cause is futile, and only causes conflict and counter-productivity. 

So I figured you were trolling, so I looked up your search history. Looks like you're serious bud. You are literally the reason I hate this campus.
Yeah, that's why they run most of the productive industries outside of academia.  Have fun in your bigoted echochamber.
No.  Period.

No one has the moral OR pragmatic obligation to be trapped in the cycle of denouncing others actions because someone else suggests an alignment.  You're contributing the the spiral you suggest.

It's utterly fallacious and the argument should be against that very concept, not a continuation of the ""you're a gun rights advocate so you should be responsible for denouncing every gun action""

I don't get where this silly shit it coming from.  Do you monitor and denounce every slight that occurs within alignment of your values?  Seriously?

*AND* I have personally denounced the actions repeatedly.  How far has that gotten me in the eyes of folks flooding into this sub?  It's a fallacious horseshit argument and I'm certain you understand that.
The same as conservatives have no obligation to control or denounce white nationalists, ""the left"" has no obligation.

I entirely disagree with you.  At the most basic, my words and actions are my own.  I'm not obligated in any way to monitor and continuously clarify my position on others' actions and speech.  To suggest as much is patently ridiculous.  Anyone using that against me is being incredibly lazy and outright fallacious.

The same as gun owners have no moral obligation to defend their rights or denounce the actions at each and every violent use of a gun.

theres new information thought you would like to know.
http://www.dailycal.org/2017/04/21/berkeley-college-republicans-threaten-sue-uc-berkeley-coulter-event/

""Although some news outlets have reported that BridgeUSA is also threatening to sue the campus, BridgeUSA Co-President Pranav Jandhyala said the organization is not involved with the lawsuit at all.

“We don’t want to take that approach. We think it’s unnecessarily combative, and that’s not appropriate,” Jandhyala said. “We think that we can use different ways of trying to make sure this event happens at a time that is good for students, at a time that is good for Ann Coulter, but we don’t think that taking it to court right now is necessary.”""
oh trust me the PD and the mayor is flooded with phone calls and complaints, both by residents, students and angry parents. the PDs have been in and out of court rooms due to the BLM police brutality court cases.
they're all associated. you cant separate them, especially when they all answer to the same boss. its a norm actually, even for private schools to have local PD take care of problems. 
the issue with the PD started during the BLM movement. then they went in and out of court rooms for police brutality when they tried to control the BLM riots.

its a tricky situation.
you could get the instructor fired. not kidding, im not gonna give examples here. give the university a choice between academics vs liberalism. they'll pick academic credibility every time.
If anything it was studying economics that radicalized me! You very quickly realize that the underlying assumptions that justify the free market either don't exist or are propped up by social constructions. Once you realize that the concept of value itself is subjective, economics becomes the study of how to allocate resources to meet needs and wants rather than the study of capitalism.

>Praising concepts like diversity but hating difference of thought. I don't identify as right wing but what's coming from the left is a whole lot less conducive to freedom and values this country was founded on.

I don't support diversity of thought. I think everyone should be a communist. I'm not a relativist or a liberal. I believe in free speech for the left, the right should be silenced. Diversity of thought is really a condition of the world we live in, the point is to move towards a world with less of it.

Our worldview is totalitarian in the sense that we're okay with imposing our views onto others. Relativism is logically incoherent as a concept, btw and so is free speech. Its self-defeating. If speech threatened to undermine free speech, then those in power would have two choices with one outcome: to restrict free speech or to lose power, which would restrict free speech. I believe in free speech as a principle but I believe in pushing my worldview within that context; therefore not only should speech be free, so should the ability to take direct action and riot. If our actions counteract their speech then two fundamental rights undermine each other. At this point you realize that principles are fundamentally self defeating and the only thing that's real is the power to bring about change. Anarchists believe that power should be as decentralized as possible and in the hands of the people.

> You can be bold and violent when in numbers and with the blessing of the administration, but outside of that your cause is futile, and only causes conflict and counter-productivity.

Check out Rojava. Anarchist principles are being put into practice there.

Anachism is also about supporting indigenous struggle, unionization, pushing for individual self determination (not just free speech) and opposing oppression by systems of formal authority.

I'm happy to concede that antifa isn't doing anything highly productive because not everyone we bash is real fascist. But as anarchist I support antifa in its struggle because I don't think what we do is actually bad.

any republican who chooses to come to Berkeley probably shouldn't have gotten in.
hahaha, most American innovation has taken place in the public sector and universities. These inventions are implemented by the free market for profit.

Most R&D is high risk, low reward a priori, especially in the short run so the private sector doesn't have much of incentive to develop really cutting edge technology unless they're receiving government subsidies like the military-industrial complex. Google is a great exception to this but they've got money to throw around.

also the fact that industry is run outside academia is an obvious truism. You' re saying that as if its some sort of argument. academia provides the theory and passes it to students who apply it in the real world. the primary purpose of academia is to impart rather than apply knowledge. universities don't run factories, its part of the definition of a university.

also its hardly a good response to 'conservative views are wrong' because most industry leaders are neo-liberals who voted for hillary. educated folks who live in the cities tend to vote center.


I have no idea what you're trying to express, your language is really unclear and your writing skills are terrible.  

My point is, if you're a liberal, and a bunch of murderers come along claiming to be liberal, you will eventually be lumped in with the murderers if you don't quickly and resolutely fight their cause. 

You're perfectly entitled to not do anything or say anything to anyone if you don't please...just don't be surprised when it comes back to bite you in the ass, which is what Antifa is doing to Berkeley and liberalism right now. 
Except when the right doesn't do it, the left does nothing but attack them on it. Remember ""TRUMP REFUSES TO DENOUNCE KKK LEADER""

http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/28/politics/donald-trump-white-supremacists/

Even the free speech protest was being called a white supremacy protest by the left because some white supremacists were part of it.

So you can't have it both ways.

>The PDs have been in and out of court rooms due to the BLM police brutality court cases.

Good luck to them!

I did not like what happened but I can't guess what was prevented. There are some good pictures of the weapons kept out of Berkeley Fight 4.

Now, you can just guess how many years of experience we internet people have in directing and managing Police forces to respect rights and ensure safety. Zero.
They all answer to the same boss? Who's the boss?

As far as I know, the campus police where I am don't answer to the city government, they answer to the Georgia Board of Regents, which is a part of the state government.

Do the police at UCB answer to the city of Berkeley?

Even if that was true, it's not worth the effort for me. I'm just trying to get my degree. But it's far from the exception from my experience. Two of my classes had homework postponed following the November election. In another class --atmospheric science -- we derailed from lecture material to talk about how we can retain liberal values after Trump won. It goes on and on, it's awful. It's getting to the point where I once cringed at BCR I start to chuckle a bit when they start shit, because I'm sick of it.
What is the goal of communism? For the world to all be communist under one world government, or for sovereign individual countries? 
They let you in, didn't they?
sorry it's so hard.

i hope you make it.

i'll manage my own ass biting, thank you.
You're doing it right now...  you're calling the left what a few voices say.

You might be shocked (SHOCKED) to know I don't agree with the criticism of trump in that regard.  There's enough to directly criticize the man for.

This sub has been full of, yknow what, mm.  Enjoy your night.


if theres a riot, city police steps in. UCPD takes care if minor issues like frat fights, someone stole my textbook, hobo took my sandwich and coffee kind of incident, you get my point. all the pictures and videos shown were of berkeley PD and oakland PD and they're called in for the protests and riots. they're the ones equipped with riot gear, water cannons swat and what not.
dang sorry to hear. what major are you? seems like you're getting exposed liberal ideas left and right. biz school tends to treat politics more like a circus show so i doubt i can relate, but i understand how faculty can freak out. i mean even my conservative relatives freaked out when trump won. its not a matter of conservative ideas because we have an idea what they are. trump is unpredictable and generally people fear the unknown. well the world hasnt ended and probably wont any time soon. hope your experience gets better from here. cheers !
To abolish states, so no countries. But that's in the long run.
maybe
That's funny, you're not morally obligated to bite yourself in the ass, yet that's all you seem to be doing.  Ironic. 
That makes sense. 

I hope nobody gets hurt when Coulter gives her speech on May 2nd.
Thanks, I'm hopeful they will. Have a good one.
Implementing communism into the US is an impossibility. It will never happen. Why bother even putting so much effort into fighting for its existence? That is truly irrational, firstly being fanatical about a system with an epically failed in the past and fighting for it in the US. Any good commie student knows instability, turmoil and discontent are the greatest incubators for communist influence. That exists in many places of the world, but because those countries don't provide the luxuries and opportunity found in the US, the epitome of capitalism, you remain here in a place you claim to loath. This fact indicates you would rather live in capitalist US, then go where you actually might have a chance at implementing communism, so its implementation isn't your real goal, purely its promotion. What is the motivation for this? It really is an interesting psychological study..
I'm merely an efficient queue, get in line.

You know you want this
from what i know she complaining about costs of rescheduling how it would cost **hundreds of thousands of dollars** on her end. so far shes insisting on speaking on April 27th. https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/855252826934583297/video/1  what can i say that i havent already? lol. it would actually be in her interest and she probably wont mind if people were hurt or even killed. it would simply send her book sales soaring. hashtag - reasons why im not a fan of political pundits.
We wouldn't ""implement"" communism. There's plenty of evidence that capitalism is self-destructing and that Democratic socialism is the next step. Change is a historical process, it isn't necessarily implemented from above.

Views change. Most millenials support Bernie, socialist views are on the rise. People work harder and harder for less and less. Inequality is sky high. The US doesn't provide a good quality of life
by any means, Peter Temin an MIT economist recently published a [paper](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/america-is-regressing-into-a-developing-nation-for-most-people) pointing out that for up to 80% of the population, America is a developing country (think Flint Michigan).

Democratic confederalism (a model of an anarchist society) is currently being implemented in Rojava and people have flown in to help. Personally I like my life here because everyone I know lives in America.
I mean, I honestly don't see why she can't just say ""Hey, this date doesn't work for me, I'm available on this date, this date, and this date, does that work for you?"" 

She's just spouting shit off to spout shit off in that segment.

At least the University's trying to get her a platform despite the safety concerns.
thats why i dont believe on her end or the BCR's end that there is any good will to actually make it work without issues. political pundits require drama to stay relevant. free speech doesnt pay the bills, air time, booksales  and exposure does. she invested early on the trump train and shes milking it as hard as she can. i mean from a business perspective i cant blame her but to do it in the name of free speech... business people are pretty unethical but this is new territory."
Any NE Patriots fans in the area?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3lgeht/any_ne_patriots_fans_in_the_area/,2015-09-18 10:16:31,"I'm new to the area, from Boston originally, and I was wondering if there are any Pats fans in the area that would like to meet up to watch the games?

Any fellow New Englanders (or just Pats fans) out there? The game this week should be pretty good. Actual hype for a Bills game!

Last week my GF and I watched at the Daily Pint, but i don't think they open until 11am AND there's a 49ers game at the same time this week.

Go Pats!

","As a Colts fan, [you make me sad](http://imgur.com/gallery/5Pveps8), but I am always glad to see more football fans!
Here here. Can't wait for the Bills game with that defense, should be a good challenge for our offense. Not too worried on defense but I wouldn't discredit their running game.Edit:Is Stork still out? Our rookie actually did pretty good at C.
My best friend and I (both Cal alums) are Pats fans. Happy to watch some games with y'all!
Pappy's seems to have multiple screens going on NFL days.  Not sure what time they open though.  
Yeah.  Berkeley not surprisingly isn't a huge NFL town :/
Stork i think is IR designated to return. I heard something about week 8.
Good to hear!

We have had some good luck at Daily Pint for the later games. We just watched the pats game at 10am at home cuz it was so early. 

Talking with Dominic from daily pint, if we came in with a crowd it shouldn't be too hard to get one of the Tvs for the pats game. They have sunday ticket. "
!! DO NOT LIVE AT IDENTITY LOGAN PARK !!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15hkmx7/do_not_live_at_identity_logan_park/,2023-08-03 17:11:27,"My roommates and I have had the worst experience living at Identity Logan Park. For a small and mediocre 2 bedroom and 2 bathroom unit, my roommates and I paid $5969 EVERY MONTH for a place that didn't offer the bare minimum. Like what the other post says, the student workers are not an issue at all. The main problem is the most uncompromising, rude, uncooperative, and lazy office workers (AKA: ""M""). They state that their apartment units are equipped with the best amenities, but in reality, there's shit quality furniture, a restroom fan that runs literally 24/7 (which you are obviously charged for even though you can't turn that shit off), the whole apartment doesn't retain ANY HEAT, and the fire alarm goes off more than I can count (FOR EX: A few months ago, the fire alarm went off THE WHOLE DAY. Not just that, but there were multiple instances in which my roommates and I were woken up at the ass crack time of dawn or late at night because of the fire alarms.) THERE IS LITERALLY NEVER A MOMENT OF PEACE. 

Emphasis on apartment not retaining any heat: Initially, my roommates and I didn't think that it would pose an issue because we never had to turn on the air conditioner during the summer. But once the winter hit, we struggled. From November to May, my roommates and I had to live in an apartment that was consistently 64 degrees (during rainy or windy days, it would fall even more). We would turn on the heater for about 30 minutes to an hour, but after we turned it off, THE APARTMENT WOULD GO BACK TO 64 DEGREES within 10 MINUTES. The money spent on utilities is an absolute waste. And the number of times we've gotten sick due to the poorly built apartment building is unimaginable. 

Moving on, everything about the apartment is an issue. From the study rooms that smell like literal ass and trash to the horrible ""luxurious"" gym. There are literal crackheads also living in the units, and I have heard of many instances in which the residents were scared out of their minds to ride the elevators late at night. SAVE YOUR MONEY. The horror stories I have can never make up for the financial loss that I along with many other former or continuing residents' parents have faced. The apartment management does not give two shits about the safety and well-being of their residents. There are definitely better options out there that are also CLOSER TO CAMPUS (IDENTITY IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO CAMPUS AT ALL LOL). 

Save your money and time and live somewhere else. As a former resident, I regret ever living at Identity Logan Park. I am leaving Identity Logan Park with random water fees that topped over $100 when no one was there for the past 2-3 months --> heads up: my roommates and I have never spent more than $20 A MONTH on water bills so this was really shocking. We've called ""M"" and all she said was that they couldn't reimburse us HAHAHA. And to make sure that our parents' credit scores aren't affected, all we could do was pay it off. You will find yourself being charged random fees for water and other shit every month. ONCE AGAIN, SAVE YOUR MONEY. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH, MONEY, AND TIME!!! I have so much more to say, but it's not even worth my time anymore to talk about Identity Logan Park <3
