## **Instructor's Piazza post**

> The Berkeley AUTOLAB (Automation Sciences) is seeking highly motivated EECS students to pursue state-of-the-art research on Deep Learning for Urban Driving.  EECS Seniors and MS students can obtain course research or MS/senior project credits to work with us on the design and implementation of a very fast first-order simulator of autonomous cars driving in a configurable urban environment to be open-sourced for research in Deep Learning.  The research will provide experience with state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms, Multi-Agent Control and Graphics Rendering.  Candidates should have strong Python programming skills and grades in at least two of EECS 184/188/189.

"Rolling Stone: ""There's a lot of fear out there [about automation],"" says Cal roboticist Ken Goldberg, head of a ""People and Robots"" initiative to enhance human-robot collaboration and is working on surgical robots. ""You're paying this star surgeon to sit there and sew. It's not a good use of time.""",http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/inside-the-artificial-intelligence-revolution-a-special-report-pt-2-20160309,2016-03-09 21:46:15,,
