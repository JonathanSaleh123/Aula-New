A student asked on the classroom forum Piazza:

> **Sahai -- what are your daily rituals?**

> From the very beginning of the semester you've stressed the importance of time management and many times have both implicitly and explicitly stated that after eating and sleeping we should be working.

> For a source of inspiration, would you mind sharing what an average day of being Prof. Sahai is like? I'm sure me and many others would find it interesting.


> EDIT: Or maybe even a college version in the past when you were a student vs nowadays, if you're so inclined.

Professor Anant Sahai replied:

> College Anant Sahai:

> I didn't keep detailed records of my time, so this is from unreliable memory.

> Took a nap pretty much every day. Aaah Foothill La Loma dorms --- so close for naptime. (I moved into Foothill the first fall it opened.)  And the lounge space around Sibley Auditorium --- perfect for napping. Later I lived essentially across the street from Tolman --- also close enough for napping.

> At the beginning, called home every single day. I missed my brother tremendously. Also wrote paper letters to folks back home --- long-distance phone calls were expensive! And there was no widespread email.

> Lived freshman year in Clark Kerr in a suite. The building was rather antisocial back then, and my suite was close to the entrance. So me and my suitemates would order a pizza every night (I hit my lifetime quota of Fat Slice in about a semester and a half) and prop the door open. It was a salon of sorts --- late night pizza, random philosophical conversations, and playing some cards. (The Monty Hall Puzzle came into it when it was sweeping the country. Main card games: speed and 24.) People paid their share of the pizza, but my suitemates and I put in the effort to make this happen. Lots of discussions in the evening about the material we were learning in courses, life, religion, philosophy, and political speculation. That kept happening throughout undergrad. We also played a rather grotesque variant of 20 questions in which you had to guess how someone died and why. 

> Took Math H50A (the then equivalent of Math H54) and H50B (the then equivalent of Math H53) as a freshman. Immensely challenging homeworks that really made you learn the material. It was also amusing to watch a class start with 50-some students and end the year with just 5 of us. Great fun. I learned everything in Math 110 as well as the usual 53/54 content, as well as a chunk of Math 128. This is the course that, more than any other single course, impressed upon me what Berkeley was really about. Why this is the greatest University on this planet. Oh by the way, H50AB was taught at the time by a faculty member who was joint Math and EECS. (He is now retired.) 

> Took Physics H7ABC. Also great fun. Loved the hard homeworks and fun exams. Enjoyed hearing stories from older Physics faculty reminiscing about the Manhattan Project. Had entered Berkeley unsure about EECS vs Math vs Physics. Seriously considered Physics before realizing that EECS really had the theoretical depth that I wanted.

> Spent many hours on the Math and Physics problem sets. And enjoyed every bit of it. Had study group sessions with others in the course. In general, throughout undergrad, I learned a lot by helping others. It really is the best way to understand something.

> Enjoyed 60ABC (the names then for 61ACB) a lot. Made it a ritual along with his friends to climb to the roof of Pimental before any midterm or exam and dance around. (DO NOT DO THIS.) Found these courses mostly quite easy --- although 60C with Prof. Hilfinger took some time and was great fun. (As was 60A with Stuart Russell and 60B with John Ousterhout, both fun but not very time consuming.) 

> Attended a great mini-course by CSUA and XCF on advanced Emacs Lisp. With his best friend (who he met in H50A and H7A, took most classes with and who came with him to MIT for grad school), wrote an emacs lisp program to help automate playing DikuMUD (a text-based multiplayer role-playing game).  Fun. We did this in the evenings of freshman year first semester while taking 60A.

> Used to watch Anime every monday evening at the Cal Anime club. (With that same best friend above --- who used to take Japanese courses.) 

> Spent countless hours in the Eta Kappa Nu office just chatting with people and tutoring folks. And learning by osmosis. You'd be surprised what all you can pick up just by watching people tutor others in upper-division courses! I believe my friend and I might have been the founding compserv officers and we were one of the originators of the ""challenges"" tradition that candidates have to do. 

> I ate food in the dorms at meal times my freshman and sophomore years. After that, I moved into an apartment when my brother also came to Berkeley. Then I used to enjoy cooking. 

> I tried to sleep a good amount every night, and following my parents general rules, no studying the night before an exam or in the near vicinity of an exam. I could help others though --- so final time was always great fun. Lots of spare time to enjoy myself! Dead week started later while I was a student.

> Never took an American Cultures course --- that requirement started after I had joined. My brother took it though, so I learned a lot of the material in the linguistics one indirectly. 

> Took lots of Math courses: I think 104, 113, 185, and 125. 

> This was before 70 and 126. So I took Math 55 and Stat 134. It was before 127 so I took an IEOR optimization course. 

> The classes that kept me up late: EECS 192 (I believe I was in the inaugural class for that), 150 (It was a big class then. In my year, the project was essentially a trick. If you tried to solve it directly, you were doomed. My group [with my best friend again] and a group of grad students were the only ones who finished the project. Both of us realized that it was easier to solve a harder problem --- design and make our own computer, write our own compiler for it, and then write a computer program to solve the given project.), and a special Engineering course that taught us everything you needed to know to start a company. (This was before the dot com boom.) We proposed a company to deal differently with email that we had called SpectralMail. One of my cofounders (also one of my best friends and fellow HKN officer) went on to found HotOrNot while a Berkeley PhD student. Another has also had a bunch of startups. 

> I took 221A and 222 as an undergrad. That was fun. Grad courses were a lot more work. And intense. No real study group though because I was the only undergrad in the course. 

> Spent my summers at research internships. Back then, Berkeley had a formal internship program for top EECS undergrads. Lots of places like Xerox PARC and HP Labs and so on would only take undergrad interns from MIT and Berkeley. Grad students only from any other place --- which made sense I guess given how our curriculum is so out of everyone else's league. 

> Anyway, for the most part, I always made sure to eat, sleep (including daily naps), and have fun. It was a lot easier to be focused on study-relevant fun in the days before Facebook, laptop computers, mobile phones, and the world-wide-web.  As far as I can tell, the only really good thing that has come from the internet age for education is Wikipedia. Not sure if the others actually help anyone learn anything better given the amount of time they suck up. Computers are nice, I guess. But even back then we had things like Mathematica and programming environments. So, we could explore things on our own even before the Internet. 

> EDIT TO ADD: Forgot to mention that I was on the Berkeley ACM Programming contest team. My year, we didn't do so well. When my brother was on the team, we won the International competition. Best in the world.

A student asked:

> Have you ever bombed an exam, or had moments where you felt you couldn't keep up with all your classes?

Sahai replied:

> Unfortunately, I never really had those kinds of feelings personally, at least not in a way that is real --- in that I felt bad because I really did do badly. But I did have close friends who felt that way so I have some empathic experience with them. I know that it can be hard to walk out of high school a star and then find yourself in the middle of the pack here in Berkeley. I've seen enough tears from my fellow students when I was a student, and tears from my students as a faculty member.

Another student asked:

> I'm asking these questions because I was thinking a lot about it and I'd like to see your input about it, prof. Sahai:

> 1. question: Have you ever felt that you are missing out on life's opportunities (say, backpack through Cambodia for 6 months or move to another country) by basically sacrificing everything to Mathematics or science? Not to say that they aren't worth sacrificing for, but to me this seems to be a curse for talented people (which makes me happy that I'm a mere mortal)...

> 2. question: How do you perceive brain drain? While you yourself were raised in California, I believe you (and advisors in general) are very influential in the development of (graduate) students, many of whom are international.. And I have noticed on your website that basically all your students stayed in the US. Is brain drain just a necessary evil on our path to evolving towards a global community or is it a real issue that should be counteracted?

Sahai replied:

> These are easy to answer:

> 1) No. Serving learning is a wonderful calling, and it is no sacrifice to spend time and effort on what you truly love. Are there tradeoffs? Yes, but they're due to the nature of time and space, not learning. Is the world perfect? No! But when people say that academia and learning will break your heart, they aren't referring to the nature of Math, Science, and Engineering. They are referring to the flaws in an economic/political system that blocks talented people from doing work they love that also truly needs to be done while helping humanity, just because they have to eat and take care of their families and the powers that be refuse to let them do so.

> 2) As an American, I like things that help the people of the United States. Having smart people coming here and staying to contribute, well that just makes good sense. Does it hurt other countries and other populations? Not really. If the other country wants to support them, they are free to do so. Most people would gladly return to their home region to contribute there. Look at Europe. Lots of people go back there. But I have seen far too many cases of places that basically refuse to do this. They know what needs to be done (give people freedom and create decent paying jobs with autonomy) and refuse to do it. Because in most cases, the local powers that be want to keep the rich and powerful rich and powerful. So, a person doing research in the USA is actually doing more for the people of their home country than that person would be doing back home.

> Lots of people contribute charitably back to their countries of origin --- and many I hope also contribute to help support the kinds of reformist and revolutionary organizations/social-movements that are needed to actually make real change happen.  (I'm not saying that the powers that be have any better motivations in the USA --- hierarchical power is inherently corrupting. It is just that social movements in the USA have, in the past, helped tame those forces at least a bit.) It is the will of the people and the blood, sweat, and tears of activists that matter. They made a better life for people and the ones active today are planting the trees that future generations will enjoy.","I think Sahai really hit it home regarding his opinions of how ""weaker"" students are treated at cal. During my time at cal, I saw many weaker students who were probably well better off at another university. I went from a high school star to being just a tad above average in engineering at cal, and even that kinda hurt. I can't imagine the kind of pain students go through who end up well below average even after giving their best efforts in their exams. Not only does that destroy their confidence but it also hampers post graduation dreams, which ride on the marks you received at cal. 
[deleted]
I have tons of respect for Sahai, and he clearly does for all of his students, but I will never enjoy theory even nearly much as he does. His CS70 class was by far my least favorite CS class I've taken so far (except for 161 with Tygar, but that was for a whole other set of reasons).

Sahai's comment about the *Los Angeles Times* article:

> I'm surprised you folks were able to pull up a news article from back then.

> When you're a senior in high school, you attribute things to whatever is cognitively most available. I had spent 2nd and 3rd grade in India where I walked into classes being horribly behind in Hindi and multiplication/arithmetic. The numbers had always been friends, but I needed drill to catch up. So my mom helped me. Pilani at the time was a little neighborhood around the research center surrounded by sand dunes. (Seriously, we had sandstorms and everything!) My memories from then are mostly of riding my bike around the neighborhood, playfully planning the (purely theoretical and theatrical) destruction of my school, and the gorgeous night sky filled with stars (in summers we used to sleep outside under the stars). And following the ants around to see what they were up to.

> Looking back, the real special advantage I think was just my family and upbringing --- especially having a brother so close in age to me. We had so much fun together doing math, programming, legos and (yes) playing video games and writing our own ""kid's constitution"" and playing all sorts of make-believe games involving everything from TV cartoon characters to the lives of subatomic particles.

> Also, I now think that my elementary school education in Thousand Oaks was actually very good --- I was just an arrogant little kid at 17 who dismissed it in high school looking back because it had seemed very easy by comparison. But it built confidence and encouraged a love of learning and curiosity --- e.g. my 4th grade teacher put up with my childhood fascination with nuclear weaponry (I shudder to think of what would happen today to a kid who was fascinated by nuclear weapons) and fusion reactors. My 5th grade teacher let me do my own thing vis-a-vis math and reading. I also learned great lessons in macroeconomics, taxation, and public spending from an elementary school experiment of trying to create a class-room-sized economy. In junior high, I remember one of the highlights was trying to simulate trials for figures from history and writing our own constitution. And learning how to do research papers (I did mine on the works of Isaac Asimov) in English classes --- the first place you get exposed to scholarly thinking. At those ages, I think it is good to focus on actual learning instead of worrying about some absurd attempt at measuring performance. I never thought about any standardized test. Ever. It is sad that many of you can't say the same.

> Anyway, the cusp of high school and the years of college are a magical time. You feel your powers coming in, and it is exhilarating. Especially at a place like Berkeley where every hard homework makes you stronger. The joy of actually feeling the magic flowing through you. It is simply indescribable. You all should enjoy it. All the tiredness will fall away and leave your memory. You'll just remember the fun.
Anant's a real prodigy and he really really loves Cal. Even when he was a grad student at MIT he told everybody who would listen that his dream was to be a prof at Cal. Provably, he did choose Cal among all other places he could have joined as professor. 
The most important question and answer:

Q: What was your favourite anime? I bet it was Ranma 1/2.

A:
>This was before Miyazaki's work was mainstream in the USA. So, for me, I would have to include his great films at the top of the anime list back from those days. In particular from back then: Laputa, Nausicaa, and Totoro. Other works that I still remember (which I guess makes them my favorites from back then) were, in no particular order: Vampire Princess Miyu, Record of Lodoss War, Ranma 1/2, Kimagure Orange Road, Oh My Goddess!, and yes, Urusei Yatsura (which I remember not liking quite as much as Ranma 1/2). I, of course, watched many many more including lots involving big robots. But those blur together in my mind after 20+years.  
 
>Watching anime at the Berkeley club was particularly fun back then because a lot of the subs were actually fan subs --- many done by the active club members. So we were watching things that simply were completely unavailable to anyone else.

Eric Brewer was an ugrad here as well.

Yeah, it sucks.

-weaker student
I'm transferring to Berkeley Engineering in the Fall and this terrifies me.  And I was just starting to convince myself that it's normal to feel intimidated by the rigor of Cal.  I can't say that I've ever ""fired on all cylinders"" though, so maybe that's a good sign. :/
I'm graduating this semester then starting a PhD program in option II EECS in the fall and recently I've been going around thanking all of the professors that helped me get to where I am. I want to express my gratitude to Professor Sahai because I would be nowhere without the three courses I took with him but I'm scared that he'll ask me what I'm doing with my life... I know he will say the same thing to me D':  
You don't think that getting into MIT for grad school might be an indication that you had what it takes to compete at that level? 
Will be taking his class in fall, any tips on how to do well? I heard the practice problems are tedious, is there anything else I should be expecting?
A student asked:

> ""Sahai has been accepted at the University of California, Berkeley, and has also applied to the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University.""

> http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon

> Why did you and your brother choose Berkeley instead of some other school? What about Berkeley stood out to you?

Sahai replied:

> Berkeley is the best, of course! Why else? Berkeley essentially has more top ranked departments than anywhere else in the world. That was true then as it is true now. Berkeley is the number one choice of winners of the National Science Foundation fellowship for graduate study. Despite being smaller than MIT as far as science and engineering go. This is true now, but I didn't think about this when I was in high school. I just knew that when it came to academic reputation, nobody really tops Berkeley. I had also heard the reputation of Berkeley as a place that didn't pull any punches or coddle students. It expects the best and doesn't care if people suffer. That no-compromise stance appealed to me as compared to places like Stanford. 

> I also was drawn to Berkeley's comprehensive excellence. It isn't just the best in Engineering and Science, it is a powerhouse in the humanities, social sciences, and the arts. In my mind then, that was one of the main negatives of MIT. CalTech was just too small for my taste. In hindsight, I think that I expected too much interaction across the humanities and engineering. So while I took a full year of Sanskrit at Berkeley and attended a few courses outside the Northeast Quadrant of campus, my connections to the rest of campus were mostly through attending the occasional seminar or evening talk. (MIT has those too and when I was there, I actually took Sanskrit literature courses at Harvard for a bit before deciding that I was too busy and riding the #1 bus a few times a week was too much commuting for me.) Stanford is also well rounded but I didn't perceive it as such when I was in high school. 

> I had visited both Berkeley and Stanford in the summer --- and the intellectual vibe and intensity at Berkeley really hit me. The city around campus was also different for me --- having grown up in SoCal suburbia. 

> Honestly, I don't think there was ever a day that I ever regretted going to Berkeley as an undergrad. I got the best possible education in every possible dimension. And looking back, it made sense. I was Berkeley's type. 

> As a faculty member, I have come to increasingly feel that while Berkeley is spectacular for super strong students like I was (and most of my friends who were all in HKN, etc.), **lots of weaker students would be better off elsewhere at places that are generally more supportive.** Our EECS model (and 70 in particular) of high expectations tempered with high levels of support is a bit of the exception on this campus. And even our support presumes that students have ample capacity in reserve after doing very well at high school. (Again, like me. In high school, studying schoolwork more than an hour or so per day after school was rare. I studied other stuff for fun, hacked computer programs, did origami, etc.) **The student who was firing on all cylinders and only then able to hit high marks in high school --- the pain that awaits them here makes me shudder at times. It isn't the party line, but I have to say it out of compassion for students: I think that this university doesn't always support all the high-striving students that it admits. And that isn't fair. If we take someone on striving, we should have supportive paths for people who are striving. But we largely don't. So students make heroic efforts. And maybe that grows their character and makes them better people. But there is a pretty wide stream of tears that flows through Strawberry Creek into the Bay.**

A student asked:

> ""The student who was firing on all cylinders and only then able to hit high marks in high school --- the pain that awaits them here makes me shudder at times. It isn't the party line, but I have to say it out of compassion for students: I think that this university doesn't always support all the high-striving students that it admits.""

> +1. I studied my hardest in high school to get into Berkeley, which has been far harder than my high school. I try my hardest and frequently score below the average (sometimes a standard deviation below the average) on tests.

> I sometimes wonder whether it would have been better to study somewhere else. Less rigor and less pain, more support and hopefully better test scores.

> What would you recommend Berkeley do to support students in this situation?

Sahai replied:

> It is because of students like you that I wrote what I wrote. 

> I think that for students in your shoes, the most basic thing that Berkeley can/should do is provide an on-ramp. A recognition that not everyone gets through material at the same pace and that some people just need more time to get up to speed. Firstly, the unit minimums are just insane. Why not let someone take 6-7 years through the system? If they aren't just taking lots of courses, then who are they hurting? It's not like they are taking seats away from someone else. This way, students can choose whether they want to take the slow and steady path where they could work hard to build themselves up. Yes, it's a few more years of your precious youth and $100K or more in lost income. But for some, the sacrifice is worth it. For others, not so much. Let people make that choice. Second, the campus should support the development of self-paced companions to core courses --- this way, there would be a more structured set of resources available for students who want to spend more time on a course. Third, students should be able to self-declare an incomplete in a course if they want to take it spread out over two semesters --- or a semester and a summer. Since this does take up extra seats, instructor permission should be required. But looking at the distributions in 70, we would be talking about at most 30% max of the students taking this option. This could be compensated for by giving such students lower priority in their choice of section times, etc. 

> More controversially, I think that Berkeley should offer two options that are not offered now. (1) Slow-start admission --- where students are told that we would love to have them here, but only after they complete a couple of years of courses somewhere that can help bring them up to speed in an environment that is a better transition. This could be a CC or it could be another UC or a CSU or even a place like Harvey Mudd. As long as they meet the required grades at this less competitive place, we should tell them that they are in. We know how to deal with transfers, but some people should be pre-emptive transfers. This combined with the on-ramp ideas above should probably take care of many cases. The transition will be smoother for many if it is less abrupt. For many, it could simply be a matter of style. There are plenty of other ways to teach people the basics.

> (2) Berkeley should have a system that is the equivalent of the ""minor leagues"" in baseball. For many students, they don't know that they would've been better off elsewhere until they actually show up here and experience it. But by then, all their other offers have evaporated. They're stuck. And if they leave, there is no clear way back. I think that at the very least, the other UCs should participate. A lot of students who struggle here could be stars at Riverside, Merced, Davis or Santa Cruz. Confidence matters and if there was an easy path to another UC, a lot of people would/should take it. Then, after they have built up their basic skills and rebuilt their confidence, let them have an honest shot at transferring back if they want it and feel they would benefit. Let them visit for a semester. Try it out again. Then (if they do well), let them decide if they would rather complete their degree here or back where they were sent.

> Basically, the system needs to be built to help people succeed rather than just giving them a shot. 

> What I would actively oppose is simply reducing the intensity of the Berkeley education in an effort to be more inclusive or supportive. The world needs many different kinds of places just like it needs many different kinds of people. Harvey Mudd exists. They have a kinder gentler approach to CS. That is good for many. Kudos to Harvey Mudd for supporting that. But I think that Berkeley's style of uncompromisingly intense education is also something that is important to have in the world. What does ""access"" even mean if you take away the very thing that people want to access?

A student asked:

> ""I think that at the very least, the other UCs should participate. A lot of students who struggle here could be stars at Riverside, Merced, Davis or Santa Cruz.""

> Wouldn't this be offensive to those other UCs though? It's like saying if you can't make it at MIT, you should go to Berkeley. Those other UCs would become the ""backup schools"" and serve like CCs that you try to transfer out of rather than institutions where you get your full undergraduate learning.

Sahai replied:

> If someone can't make it at MIT, they'd get wiped out here. MIT is better at supporting weaker students. For many students who are struggling here, they would be better served at MIT. For others, even MIT's support model can't help them. Many of those would be better served at Stanford which has yet a different model. Harvey Mudd is another place that is very good about supporting students who would struggle here.

> What I am saying is that there are different styles of teaching that work well for different students. Intensity is only one dimension. We believe it is very important for making the ""special ops ninjas"" that we like to train. But not everyone wants to be a ""special ops ninja."" When they were choosing Berkeley, they had no idea what that even meant. Many people had very little idea what they were getting into. (Not everyone has PhD parents and family friends who know what different schools are really like.) There are even people out there who (shudder) actually believe that the US News and World Report rankings for undergrad places overall mean something. (They don't realize that most of the faculty members in the most of those places would rather be at Berkeley than where they are.) What matters is how well students do in terms of getting something out of the courses and how well they contribute to the campus community. 

> If someone is mismatched at Berkeley and finds a better learning environment at Riverside, that shouldn't be bad for either Berkeley, the student, or Riverside. Nobody should accept slackers. I am talking about the hard-working students who just find themselves mismatched. Helping students is more important.

A student wrote:

> I keep hearing that Berkeley doesn't support students, but professors and TAs have weekly office hours and student groups like HKN have tutoring sessions. There doesn't seem to be a lack of support here. You and a lot of other people say MIT, Stanford, Harvey Mudd, and other UCs provide more support than Berkeley.

> What kind of services/support do they provide that Berkeley doesn't provide?

Sahai replied:

> We in EECS support students pretty well. It is not clear other departments here do as much as we do. But as I said before, all of our support is predicated on students being able to put in the time. We currently have no real mechanisms to support students who are simply hitting their maximum waking hours limit. At most of our competitors (MIT is a possible exception for certain courses where they are pretty much like us), there is simply less stuff in the courses at less depth. So there is more headroom in which support can be activated. That is the main advantage that other UCs can provide. A pace that is more manageable for many people.

> I love Berkeley. But it isn't for everyone.

A student wrote:

> Oh, so you're saying that Berkeley covers material at much more depth and at a faster pace while other universities don't? Is there any hard evidence or studies for this, or is it just anecdotal? It's difficult to believe that MIT, CIT, or CMU (for example) aren't as challenging (or more challenging) than Berkeley.

> Is it also because Berkeley is on the semester system so covers more material and most of the UCs aren't? Would changing to a quarterly system make the pace more manageable for more people?

> ""there is simply less stuff in the courses at less depth. So there is more headroom in which support can be activated.""

> What kind of support do they activate that we at Berkeley can't activate because of more depth? Andrew of 61A and Mona of 61B do Guerilla sections. Is that the kind of support they activate—more help from the TAs at a more individualized level?

Sahai replied:

> I know only from courses that I have taught personally as well as from courses that I saw when I was an undergrad vs when I was a graduate student, and conversations with my colleagues at other schools. MIT, CMU, and CalTech are pretty close to us in general. But for example, compare the old 126 (before 70 became a required prereq) to MIT's 6.041. There was a pretty big difference in depth. (And there had to be --- 6.041 serves more majors than just EECS.) New 126 has 70 required so the comparison isn't even fair anymore.

> But in general, the following is a representative comment from faculty elsewhere (not MIT/CalTech/CMU): ""I wish we could teach that here, but we don't have Berkeley students. Our kids won't put up with that sort of intensity."" as well as ""I don't have the TAs that could pull that off.""  

> Like I said in the first lecture, I like Berkeley students. :-)
lol @ no dragon ball z. What a joke of a list.
It's been cancelled?!? Do you know why? I heard Professor Sahai is teaching CS 70 again in the fall, but I assumed EE 121 would be pushed to Spring. 
He said on the first day of CS70 this semester that he only applied to Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT for both undergrad and grad school, and got into all three both times.
[deleted]
Read the published lecture notes before lecture and work out the proofs yourself after reading through them. Then read through the notes again. Then start the homework, and finish at least before the weekend so you can re-do everything you did wrong. Repeat every week for a semester. 

Or just skip Sahai's semester and take it with an easier professor.
Same as elephonky said. I also highly recommend finding a group of people to work on the homeworks together with. Sahai also runs weekly homework parties (basically large group office hours) where you can get help from TAs if needed.

The most important part is start early. Each problem set can easily take 10+ hours.
A student asked:

> What would you say the top things are that an EECS student should ingrain and do these next few years going through college + grad school?

> We missed out on developing the iron man work ethic you got as a young child, but what can we do now to be the best we can be?  What kind of habits should we develop (and how!) and what kind of character traits should we build?  What should we live by?

> If it matters, I feel that my interests match very closely to your interests as a college student in terms of loving the applied math + theory in EECS.

> How does a strong student, who you say can really benefit fully at a place like Berkeley, take themselves to the next level?

Sahai replied:

> Help others. This will help you understand the basics. The basics are the most important.  

> Take challenging classes. This will make you spend time. And spending time is the key to affection.

> And finally, eliminate the emotional barriers that separate yourself from the material. You need to let yourself live and breathe it. To feel it flowing through you. To understand the nature of its existence. It might seem corny, but you have to let yourself truly love the subject.

Another student wrote:

> Hi Professor,

> I really loved the response. Quick question though - you mentioned that your parent had ""general rules, no studying the night before an exam"". Did this always work out for you and your brother?

> Also, were there any other study routines that your parents enforced that you found particularly different than other students?

Sahai replied:

> The idea was simple: studying is an integrated part of our existence, not some sort of weird exceptional activity. So, if someone has a birthday party, you go to the birthday party. Studying or homework or an exam is not an excuse not to go. Family obligations come first. Because, first and foremost, you are an integral part of your family. 

> My parents grew up in joint families and felt that we should have some approximation of that family feeling of having many kinsmen. So, they concentrated on making sure that we had a group of family friends who were as close as kin. Family values must be lived to be shared and propagated.

> I think that the biggest difference that I see between my upbringing and many students today is just the vast amounts of unstructured free time that my brother and I enjoyed. (Maybe we took swimming lessons when we were younger.) All of summers growing up were largely free time. As were essentially all afternoons and weekends. We did whatever we wanted. Explored whatever we wanted to explore. Dug holes. Read about bugs. Made lego armies. Decided to make origami cranes. Played cards. Wrote our own little computer programming language interpreter. Whatever. My parents believed that childhood is for being a child. And the essence of childhood is playing and curiosity. We had close family friends and would get together every week at least, and with some family friends, every other day. Then us kids would play. Free-form make-believe play, as well as the usual suspects of tag, hide-and-go-seek, etc. Little to no adult supervision. Sometimes, we would just read. Or tell each other stories. Or puzzles. One of my family friends (she was also one of my co-valedictorians from my high school and also came to Berkeley) did Rubics cubes and taught herself card-tricks --- the great thing was when she went from having a finite number of card tricks to having an infinite number. (She would never repeat the same trick twice unless we forced her too.) 

> I feel sad for students today whose lives are so structured or who are under the tyranny of their mobile phone. 

> Anyway, our parents weren't really in the loop overtly. As the Tao Te Ching wisely says:

> *The best leaders are those their people hardly know exist.*

> *The next best is a leader who is loved and praised.*

> *Next comes the one who is feared.*

> *The worst one is the leader that is despised …*

> *The best leaders value their words, and use them sparingly.*

> *When they have accomplished their task,*

> *the people say, “Amazing!*

> *We did it, all by ourselves!”*

> I owe everything to my parents, my ancestors, and my teachers. I suspect very little of it is actually me. But they didn't impose things with a heavy hand. And that is why they are great. I am not that skilled.

> Hi Professor Sahai!

> It's been very intriguing reading your responses in this thread--I really appreciate you taking your time to answer these questions for us! :)

> I've noticed all semester that you have a disdain for social media and cell phones. This definitely makes sense in the context of a college professor and a college class--Students waste time playing Candy Crush or chatting on Facebook when they should be studying and therefore do worse on exams. But after your response here it seems like your dislike for procrastination-prone technology goes past studying and work ethic. The line, ""I feel sad for students today whose lives are so structured or who are under the tyranny of their mobile phone"" is really interesting for me. Can you explain what you mean? One could argue that last decade's card games are this decade's Words with Friends. And, in what ways (besides cell phones, social media, etc.) do you think students' lives today are more structured?

Sahai replied:

> There is a huge difference between a card game, where we can all decide to change the rules mid-hand, and ""Words with Friends."" In one, you are in charge and empowered. In the other, you have to follow somebody else's rules because the silicon serves only one master --- and that isn't you. 

> Especially for an engineer a good general rule is: if you can't hack it, you shouldn't be using it. 

> But I was referring mostly to kids whose parents plan out nearly every hour of every day --- maybe giving them a couple of hours of freedom per day. That is horrible! And then, to see that kid trade that precious freedom away to just wear the pretty shackles prepared by someone else?!? Even worse. A golden cage is still a cage.

A student wrote:

> Do you think a kid's time is better spent exploring on his/her own rather than going to after-school programs or team sports?

> I think it's interesting that you emphasize free time so much when you spent the first lecture showing us guidelines for planning out the 24 hours of our day :) Do you think free time is still beneficial to college students?

Sahai replied:

> I think that free time spent in curiosity-driven intellectual exploration is beneficial to everyone. 

> Free-time spent on Facebook, Snapchat, etc. is not. 

> My point was that exploring stuff related to your classes is a kind of free time when it comes to college students. Because you choose your courses freely.

> I don't consider 10-15+ hours of 70 homework every week to be free time. :0

MIT thought you have what it takes. I doubt they are wrong. You could have more faith in yourself.
Thanks you for the tips. I'm planning to prepare over summer too, any advice on how I should approach it?
thank you!
how you do at mit
Enjoy your summer. Make an app. Get a job. Go camping. Get drunk.

Seriously, unless you have absolutely nothing better to do, wait until the semester starts to deal with CS70. You could read lecture notes from this semester and do the homeworks, but I would be really impressed if you got past the second or third homework. They were an ungodly amount of work. 
thank you :)"
