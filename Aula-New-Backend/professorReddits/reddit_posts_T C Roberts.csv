"If I don’t get a C- or higher in physics 8A, can I still take physics 8b?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15t6vwg/if_i_dont_get_a_c_or_higher_in_physics_8a_can_i/,2023-08-16 17:11:23,I was looking at the pre-reqs and all it says is that you’re supposed to take 8A before 8b but it doesn’t specify the grade you’re supposed to get. Unlike chem which specifically says you need a C- or higher to take the next course,"yes you can, the physics series all cover different areas of physics, you don't neccesarrily need 8a knowledge to learn 8b. The only problem is that if you didn't pass 8A due to insufficient math background, you probobaly will still fail 8b cuz they have same math requirement

U.C. Berkeley chancellor Robert Birgeneau makes list of 500 most powerful people in the world,http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/the_500_most_powerful_people_in_the_world?page=full,2013-05-01 11:34:18,,"the title of this post makes it seem like Birgeneau created the list himself, as opposed to being selected to be on the list. 
I was a big fan right up until the whole fiasco with the beating of students with clubs.
i think its bs

Can you imagine just him sitting down writing a list with a pencil. 
I read it the same way and thought his sense of self-importance must be enormous to attempt such a task.
thought so too!
It is a shame that only students affiliated with campus clubs got beat. 
elaborate? 
Bachelors of Science?
Robert Birgeneau is the chancellor of one of the most powerful research and educational institutions in the world. Why is it a shock that he's on a list of powerful people?
I'd disagree with that. He's an incredibly charismatic figure with an honest dedication to actively change what he feels is important. It's no wonder that he became Chancellor, despite the fact that he was the first in his family to graduate from high school even.
With a huge smile on his face.
You're confusing what it means to be successful with what it means to be powerful.
And he has the success to do that"

This clown is a SF media whore.
Hey look, old Scotty boy is jumping on another bandwagon to try to get himself in the media spotlight.

If Wiener actually gave a fuck about students he'd pass a law forcing the UCs to build new housing for 100% of their enrollment increases so students didn't have to deal with the stress of fighting for market rate housing but he doesn't actually care about students. 

Scott Wiener's top donors are all for-profit developers, and they back him because he pushes new market rate housing as the solution to everything and is actually AGAINST things like subsidized on-campus housing.

This guy is a stupid right wing tool. He doesn't like public nudity. He's a freaking nazi. If a man can't flop his his phallus around in the Catsro there is no justice in this world.

These stupid politicians are so uptight.
Cal has tried to get student housing built and the community pushes back every time. People’s Park is a prime example. 

Wiener may have developers supporting him but it’s because he’s one of the only politicians that is consistently pro development.
>Scott Wiener

He ain't a right winger, and he's more than a nazi type, he's also BLM supporter and a pedo.
Wiener is pro-development because he's funded by developers. He only jumped on the YIMBY bandwagon once they started cutting him fat checks.
So what? We need to be developing and bringing more units to the market. This is a good thing.
So what is that he's not out for your best interests, he's out to represent his donors. His only interests are in helping his developer buddies maximize their profits and he would absolutely block nonprofit below market rate housing if he could.
Lol well he can’t so why would you even mention that? This is a tiresome argument because your accusations - which I question to begin with - are essentially that he is supporting development because he is bought by developers that want to build housing which supports the interests of most every renter and employer in the Bay Area by delivering units to market in a housing crisis. If that makes him a bad guy, then I’d like to see you offer other solutions or maybe run for office yourself."
Just saw Oppenheimer. AMAZING!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/155zpac/just_saw_oppenheimer_amazing/,2023-07-21 13:47:27,"Very well done and thought provoking.
Expect academy award nominations for Cilllian Murphy, Emily Blunt and especially Robert Downey Jr. . They mentioned Berkeley at least five times!!! Get your tickets yesterday, preferribly in IMAX and 70 mm.  I wore my Berkeley t shirt, got some approving nods from other moviegoers and several high fives from the Chinese Theatre's staff, much to the chagrin of the guy wearing his Caltech gear.

 Cons, the negative effects that the bomb testing had on the Native Americans around Los Alamos should have been mentioned.

 Overall, great film!!!","plug for the specific biography it's based on, american prometheus, as well. delves into a lot of what he actually did at cal and how much he liked it here . makes walking around campus a little more special when you're reminded of what has actually gone on, and how many of the buildings are still intact. i haven't seen the film so i dont know if they touch on this but he was a social butterfly and a complete dog while he was at Cal. good reminder to stem majors that u can be cracked and also touch grass
UCLA is not mentioned AT ALL!!! I guess because UCLA is soo connected with Hollywood,  that it made sense to someone. Well, they'll have to hear Berkeley 5 times and Caltech once.
I could only get a decent seat for 70mm IMAX a couple weeks out and the wait is gonna kill me.
Wasn’t the soundtrack great too? I liked it a lot and it really sticks with you.
Great film! Will see a number of award nominations!
The guy in Caltech gear lol he probably thinks we’re the posers
Got tickets to see it at the Chinese theater tonight, will definitely wear my Berkeley tshirt! c:
Y’all forgot about Cambridge 😭
UCLA, CalTech, and Berkeley campuses are all shown in the movie? Man I feel like Nolan should've just picked one
Saw it was 3 hours. Did you have to pee bad towards the end? Not sure if I should buy a drink
it's cool that they included Feynman and his drum
Can’t wait to see it!!
I saw it and there is absolutely no need to watch this film on IMAX, save your ticket money.  It's an okay film, I was hoping to be blown away and I was definitely not.
I was not a fan. Good one but not spectacular 😬
Awesome film. This will be the iconic Berkeley movie of our generation. No more The Graduate being the best Berkeley movie.
Great movie - I’m deeply familiar with the Manhattan project and physics and so it was cool to see all the names I know so well mentioned on screen and awesome seeing all the shots of Berkeley and the campanile. Cool to see them using edwards stadium, though in there movie that was supposed to be Stagg Field at University of Chicago. Loved the visuals and soundtrack. 

However, even though I loved the movie, I’m a bit of a Nolan hater, and this movie still suffered by his trademark Nolan-isms: ham-fisted, poorly written and cliche dialogue that he attempts to mask by over relying on the soundtrack to distract the audience from how bad it is, and very poorly written female characters. The soundtrack does do a good job of hiding that dialogue and giving emotion to the experience, but it just can’t fully distract me from groaning at the lines.  Take away the soundtrack and the dialogue is shit and character development garbage. Regardless, great film, and that’s my only critique but I already think Nolan is overrated so I was expecting those weaknesses going in and managed my expectations.
The movie is a historical farce further white-washed by Nolan's inability to comprehend anything other than a white-washed experience.

Pornhub has more historically accurate films.
Does Berkeley is shown a lot? like students and stuff ?
Agreed. Nice recommendations!!! Almost impossible to buy or rent those books though.
Those details are not omitted in the film. Don't think that counts as a spoiler
Complete dog, what does that mean ? Like a womanizer?

Some scenes were filmed at UCLA and some people were already getting salty here last year I believe
Very Cool!!! Not the it's gonna kill you part, I mean cool you got a ticket. It will be worth the wait.  You are not alone. The announcer (yes the theater had an announcer), said that only 13 theatres in the U.S. have the capacity for IMAX and 70mm. The fact that you are in that rare group makes it worth the wait imo. I wanted to see this movie as Nolan intended.  In the meantime, check out some articles, the discussion will be probably going on for weeks.
Absolutely, Some instrumental, with a lot of haunting synth. Really took it out of the solely old-time vibe. The music bridges the gap between then and now. Unexpected and really nice!!!  Sound design was bonkers as well!

Absolutely, MANY nominations!!!
Yeah!!!!! Keep in mind, if you get IMAX screen 7 IT IS IN THE MAIN THEATER ON HOLLYWOOD BLVD!!! The original one with the handprints of the stars in the courtyard, on the west side of the Hard Rock Cafe. I mistakenly went up to the smaller theatres by the Kodak Theater. Still got my popcorn and diet coke and made the previews in time. Have a nice time.!!!  Go Bears!!!
True, true. Harvard as well. Apologies.
Hmm, I must have missed seeing UCLA and C tech? Or, it is (unconscious/biased) selective memory on my part. I remember seeing the Campanile though!
Do not drink anything
omitting von neumann was baffling tho
I can't wait for you to see it!!! Three hours went by fast!!!
If you mean blown away as in Avengers,  Mission Impossible, and Fast X?  yeah, not so much. However, If you're looking for a film that gives us a sober look at the flawed and brilliant men and women who changed our word forever,  then strap your neurons down, this is the history pic for you. Obviously that's my point of view.
It was fantastic
I feel like much of the fuss is from people who couldn't have identified Oppenheimer, or perhaps even the Manhattan Project, one month ago. 

So they're reacting to all the big ideas raised in the film, which aren't original if you're at all conscious of history.
Same.  solid 7.
I agree!!!
I’ll agree with you on some of the cringe dialogue

 Just looked it up apparently the princeton campus was in it too. I wonder if they strategically tried to stuff as many universities into the movie to get more alumni to watch it lmao
Blown away as in Inception, Interstellar and Tenet.  You don't need Christopher Nolan to make this film.
Not a bad film, but the sort of film you are perfectly fine watching just once.
Winning at life then. Brains and broads

A small community college with a fraudulent President
Our tower is better!
Agreed!!
Well, Berkeley and Caltech were places where Oppenheimer heald two professorships at the same time! Berkeley was where Oppie laid the theoretical groundwork for the bomb, and partied harty (see Oppenheimer 4:1 honey and lime martinis)!!! 

https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/07/19/j-robert-oppenheimer-history-tour-berkeley-kensington-1-eagle-hill-road

Princeton is where Einstein was in residence, and where Oppie taught at during his later years.  Not sure about UCLA .
Inception was awesome, Interstellar was a huge disappointment. Something, something, we're saving earth, no we aren't, alien library, I told you I'd come back ??? Didn't get it. Tenet, haven't seen, but want to.

 Ultimately no film needs to be made , and no director needs to make it. But I'm sure glad Nolan did!!!

Btw, those films you mentioned are all sci-fi, action/adventure.
As I mentioned in the first response (restate), If you mean blown away as in action and sci-fi pics like Inception, Interstellar, and Tenet? Yeah, not so much. However, if you want....

It seems like you were disappointed that Oppenheimer wasn't reimagined as a super hero with nuclear powers. Like you were expecting car chases and a final hand-to-hand showdown between Oppenheimer and Hitler on top of The White House. It seems like big explosion movies have jaded you. You put Nolan in a box , and he disappointed you. That doesn't make it a bad film or unworthy to be seen in IMAX
BTW Interstellar is on Prime rn
I'd been looking forward to seeing it all year; wasn't blown away.  Then I wonder why I'm not such a movie fan anymore, and maybe it's me that's changed, and the films are better than I think.  I felt the editing was quick, and maybe made for shorter attention spans.
Oh ok. I thought it was the waste disposal plant for Cal and the place where we send the toxic runoff from Strawberry Creek.
UCLA was just a set piece for Cambridge
okay... I get it. You don't know what I am talking about, just going off on tangents that have nothing to do with it. And thank you for the synopsis of Interstellar, I see it went right over your head... but it's okay, you don't have to understand every movie out there.  BTW, those three movies I mentioned were directed by Christopher Nolan, saved you having to search that.
I have the DVD for all three. Interstellar is at my house all the time.
Could also be true!

Is that a bad thing? The radical left should be provoked relentlessly, the public needs to be constantly exposed to whats fomenting on college campuses. 
Complaining about how her free speech is being blocked but she charges $20,000 and puts forth a list of demands that Berkeley must abide by for her services.  One of her demands is that student protesters disrupting her speech be expelled. 
>When they list Maajid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali as anti-muslim extremists, it's time to realize they harm progressive causes far more than help it.

I don't have time to go through every single thing you linked, but  just picking out one example to respond to:

Hirsi Ali deserves respect for rising above major hurdles in her life, but the SPLC is accurate in describing her views as extremist and anti-muslim.  She literally said that the entire Muslim faith is a death cult and the main vision is to beat gay people and kill apostates.  That's not to say that there aren't extremist factions within the Muslim religion, but she depicts the entire Muslim religion as if it's a monolithic death cult.  If she said the same opinions about Christianity and ignored the many different sub groups with differing interpretations, she would similarly be labeled an anti-Christian extremist.  [Here are her own words on Islam:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali#Social_and_political_views)

>Just like Nazism started with Hitler's vision, the Islamic vision is a caliphate – a society ruled by Sharia law – in which women who have sex before marriage are stoned to death, homosexuals are beaten, and apostates like me are killed. Sharia law is as inimical to liberal democracy as Nazism.... Violence is inherent in Islam – it's a destructive, nihilistic cult of death. It legitimates murder.
so someone reports on one crazy person and suddenly everyone on the left side of the aisle thinks that way? so by david duke supports trump does it equate to all supporters being members of the KKK? if one person in our neighborhood is a pedophile does the neighborhood run a pedophile ring? talk about hasty generalization and guilt by association. both sides of the aisle are guilty of fallacies like these but dont expect such idiocy not to be called out here.
> Anybody who is not actively apologizing or expressing some type of white guilt,

Proof?

>anyone who steps out of line will be plastered as a bigot

Citation please?

>and is often directed at a single ethnic group and gender....just in case you wanted an example of true irony.

You haven't provided any examples to back up your claims, so if you have any proof, I'm willing to listen and not write you off before listening to the merits of your argument.  
Yes, the University should not be used as a forum for hateful idiots like Milos and Coulter. 
I'm still not particularly seeing the irony here. 

I think the fact that she particularly said protestors **disrupting** her speech should be expelled is worth notice - means that they can still protest her speech peacefully, but will get punished for trying to go any further with sabotage or violence like the other speeches had happen during them before.

Its one thing to protest fairly peacefully, and another to try and start a riot by harassing speech-goers, sabotaging the speech, or causing property damage under the guise of protesting.
Congrats bro, that's a quote from 2007 that you found at the wiki. This is what ""Berkeley sjs"" consider research.

Regardless of how harsh those words are that criticize Islam (a religion), they hard qualify for listing her ""an anti Muslim [people]"" extremist.

What she actually writes is that Islam needs reform, but of course, the splc skipped over years of her writings about that, didn't they?

She's complaining about freedom while being supported by a foundation that promotes ideas which limit other people's freedom.  
Disrupting someone else's speech is still speech.  To demand that anyone who even attempts to knock you off your soapbox should be expelled isn't the words of someone who is interested in free speech.  If you believe that stifling someone's speech is wrong, no matter how repugnant the speech then you should be ready to accept that repugnant speech will lead to interruptions and that those interrupts are also an act of speech that should be protected.

Courts have held that the right to free speech extends beyond literal speech and have also ruled that there needs to be an interest in public safety to halt free speech (ie no shouting fire in a theater).  Expelling students for disruptive protests does not meet that bar.
>Regardless of how harsh those words are that criticize Islam (a religion), they hard qualify for listing her ""an anti Muslim [people]"" extremist.

The SPLC doesn't claim she is anti Muslim [people].  Rather than accuse you of being dishonest, I'll just give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you didn't do your research and are quite the hypocrite, evidently.  Quoting directly from the article on anti-Muslim extremism implicating Hirsi Ali:

>Fueling this hatred has been the propaganda, the vast majority of it completely baseless, produced and popularized by a network of anti-Muslim extremists and their enablers. These men and women have shamelessly exploited terrorist attacks and the Syrian refugee crisis, among other things, to **demonize the entire Islamic faith.**

In addition to calling for Islamic reform, she demonizes the entire Islamic faith, and in a very extreme way, labeling the entire faith as a death cult that wants to cause destruction and murder apostates.   And these words come directly from her own mouth, and 2007 does not mean her words don't count.  That's a desperate attempt at deflection by you and nothing more.

I am not a student and you know nothing about the row I've had to hoe. 
i think thats a pretty sweeping assumption. that highly depends on the environment. tech culture like sillicon valley, research institutions whether its medical or scientific, even wall street do have safe spaces. it highly depends on the environment and surrounding culture.

the right will say the left shoves their ideals down their throats. but what you're doing is assuming the right culture is prevailing in left areas and demographics as well. 
You go girl
I am genuinely curious where you learned this.

It would seem to be against everything ""we"" as a society have learned about free speech since the days of Voltaire and John Stuart Mill.

So I am genuinely very curious as to where folks like you are learning that disruption of speech is a free speech activity.
> Disrupting someone else's speech is still speech

It's absolutely not. That's called the Heckler's Veto and it's not protected under the First Amendment, mainly because if it were so everybody could just shut down everybody else.

Furthermore, these ""protests"" are not protests, they're riots where people get hurt. If students get involved in them they *should* get expelled, it goes against the student code and values of this school.

Let me explain in terms you might understand. If I set you on fire to shut you up, that would be a felony, and no matter how much I cite the first amendment, they'd still slap my carcass in prison. 
>> Regardless of how harsh those words are that criticize Islam (a religion), they hard qualify for listing her ""an anti Muslim [people]"" extremist.

Lulz, THAT WAS YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPLC'S CHARACTERIZATION.

> The Young America's Foundation, a group that offers a list of speakers active in **anti-muslim and anti-black movements according to the Southern Poverty Law Center**.

In the meantime, I repeat, if the SPLC and you, glosses over 10 years of her statements then you both got nothing.

""free speech activity""

That's rather arrogant of you to determine what constitutes fee speech and what is actually not free speech.  If you believe that disruptive speech does not deserve to be protected then you accept that there is in fact a limit to the freedom of speech.

You guys complain about the antifa deeming everything you say to be nazi propaganda, but in return, when people provide real and legitimate pushback on your ideas you declare your opponents to be enemies of free speech.
>Lulz, THAT WAS YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPLC'S CHARACTERIZATION.

You're the one falsely assuming I referred to Muslim people rather than followers of the faith.  You don't get to put words in people's mouths and then accuse them of your own assumptions.

My exact words, **in context**:

>the SPLC is accurate in describing her views as extremist and anti-muslim. **She literally said that the entire Muslim faith** is a death cult and the main vision is to beat gay people and kill apostates.

You're making a false assumption and I doubt you'll admit it.
Go away, you are a bore.
there are many instances that im not in favor of safe spaces. and before you call me a libtard im actually... well these days i would be considered a conservative.

safe spaces actually make HR a lot easier. you can read up how corporations use it to increase efficiency in the work place. its a strategy to reduce internal issues that can cripple the work place. from your perspective i doubt you work white collar in fortune 500/public listed corporations. you are in for a very rude awakening.
> ""free speech activity""
> That's rather arrogant of you to determine what constitutes fee speech and what is actually not free speech.

That would be me backed up by Robert Reich, most 1A lawyers and many free speech philosophers, including the Supreme Court.

> If you believe that disruptive speech does not deserve to be protected then you accept that there is in fact a limit to the freedom of speech.

Your rights end where my nose begins has always been one limiting factor, but I understand that fascists like you believe in assaulting people like Felarca did, glassing people like Moldylocks was caught doing, bike locking them like one professor stands accused, and throwing m80s at people in order to free speech disrupt speech you dislike.

Again, my question is, who taught you these things that are so anti-democratic, and violations of human rights?
You're going around in your own circles. And filth.

Taking quotes from the splc that she said in 2007 without ever once mentioning what she has said in the interim about how to reform islam that contradicts that is bullshit.

She is harshly critical of the faith. She even says that in that quote.  She has also stated that it can be, and needs to be reformed, and how to do that.

Her words are critical of **IDEAS**, and they do not mark her as you claim as an anti-muslim extremist which clearly has the connotation of creating hate and inciting violence against **PEOPLE**.

Team SocJus such as yourself, get offended when people criticize their favorite ideas. The splc is a fraud and likes to take your money when you get offended by people criticizing your favorite ideas.
Wait you are trying to tell me that you think that HR policies are the Same as campus Safe Spaces!?!? Is that what you are saying!?
> but I understand that fascists like you 

Suppression of speech isn't something that's exclusive to facist regimes, but hey look you're cool and can throw ad hominems around.

My point stands that whenever you're met with resistance to your beliefs you lash out a declare your opponents to be enemies of free speech.

I was pretty pissed off at the antifa following Milo, but given that you guys decided to meet their violence with violence I don't care anymore as long as long as you keep your brawls away from my apartment.  There are no saints in this and people need to realize that this is a contest in which everyone loses.
> Taking quotes from the splc that she said in 2007 without ever once mentioning what she has said in the interim about how to reform islam that contradicts that is bullshit.

If she retracted or walked back from her statement since 2007, feel free to quote it.  If you can't, then she should be held accountable for the ideas she espouses, like everybody else.  

None of your responses negate the fact that she accused the entire Muslim faith of being a death cult, and if she said the same of Christianity, she would rightly fall under the category of being anti-Christian.  To claim an entire religion desires destruction and is a death cult is clearly an extreme characterization, whether or not you care to admit it.

> > but I understand that fascists like you

> Suppression of speech isn't something that's exclusive to facist regimes, but hey look you're cool and can throw ad hominems around.

You've explicitly condoned violent disruptions of speech as free speech. It is not ad hominem to label that as fascist.

But also, long before I called you a fascist, you had already been labeling me. So you dislike my labeling you as a fascist, but it's okay for you to label me. Get out of here, chucklenuts.

In the meantime, I have asked you several times now, and you have been impolite, rude, and an asshole, in not answering my question:

Who taught you that disruption of speech is part of free speech?

So answer the question, or shut up.
Hey spez, I found the infinite loop!
Yeah. I didn't think you had any clue what you were talking about. Explain to me what in your mind you think a corporate Safe Space looks like. Also just to be clear there are probably a few places in Silicone Valley that have them but they are practically non existent in the real world. It's obvious you never had a real job in your life and honestly I doubt you ever will.
If you believe that violence is the only way to disrupt shit then you are sorely mistaken.  Furthermore I invite you to contemplate on the true meaning of facism - a right wing movement centered around a strong nationalist identity.

Like I said earlier, you don't truly care about free speech.
Still waiting for any supporting evidence whatsoever to any of your claims.  Obviously you don't have any.  Great research skills!   
You're shifting the goalposts and shitting your bed.

No one is worried about non violent protesting and non violent disruptions of shit.

Everyone is worried about your team, team antifa and their m80s, beatings, bottlings, bike lockings, assaults, and vandalism.

If antifa came to town and carried signs and allowed speakers to speak we wouldn't be hearing Dirks say that UC Berkeley has no protectable free speech venue for Coulter.

Anyway we're done, since I have answered your questions and you still refuse to answer mine. I accept your refusal in the face of my constant reminders as your concession that you got nothing and you know antifa AND BAMN is a fascist terroristic group that has no rational defense in democratic society."

Funny how Berkeley makes it sound like their innovation, when Smith did it first: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/fashion/fear-of-failure.html
Sure C isn't failing, but that grade may seem awful to students that have been getting straight A's for all their lives. A family friend got a C in chem 1A and that lead her to switch majors and transfer to UCLA. Of course that was overly dramatic, but she was the first person in her family to go to college and also had high expectations from her parents, so no one told her that getting a C was okay.

Update: reviewing all the crispest water on campus,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/utao28/update_reviewing_all_the_crispest_water_on_campus/,2022-05-19 12:06:45,"I will never let anything die! I am writing this as evidence of a realized hobby. Godspeed to anyone who reads any sentence of this.

[here is the last post for context (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2csl0/crispest_water_on_campus/)

Armed with the curated list of the recommendations of the last post, i put on my urban hiking (aka gentrified walking) playlist and I tried the crispest fountains of youth this campus cradles.

Methodology:

I condensed the list to only include potable water sources. I didn't try blackwell, because I don't know anyone who lives there and i am not trying to trespass. Further, I excluded the recommendation of the gym fountain, because I have an intensity about me that I fear would turn me into a gym bro if I set foot in a gym. I do not wish this fate upon myself so I am guarding my feeble sanctity by not crossing the gym line. Next, I opted for a non insulated metal water bottle so that leftover chill from previous water fountains could not influence the taste of the next water fountain in the case fountains were tried consecutively.

At this point we reach a Shakespearean impasse: to spit or to swallow, that is the question. Whether ‘tis nobler to only taste the water fountain or to become bloated from all the water I consume in one day trying to hit up all the fountains. Normally when faced with this impasse, I gargle. You would be surprised how little liquid it takes to gargle. However, for the sake of science I chose to swallow all of the water I tasted.

Importantly, fountains were tried on different days. Peer reviewers have pointed out this weakness in the methodology. However, a good fountain will consistently spit good crisp fluids into the crevices of a bottle even if there was no other water bottle filling action before the current fill, so the day of fill should not impact the crispness of water.

Scoring: **Anxiety (A)** was scored out of 2 (0 being please let the hot light of god shine upon me so that I may evaporate from this dreadful world and 2 being luxuriating in comfort). Anxiety noted the fearsome echo of the water bottle fill in comparison to a quite yet populated environment, general amount of people around (I don’t like having more than one person looking at me at any given moment), and if any worrisome leaks surrounded the fountain.

**Beauty (B)** was scored out of 3. Beauty includes any general aesthetics surrounding the fountain experience.

**Crispness (C)** was the main scoring factor which is only fair given the list’s method of curation. As is such, crispness was scored out of 10. Crispness includes freshness of taste and bone chilling temperatures. I wanted the water to transport me to Antarctica so vividly that I could remember if Antarctica was at the bottom or top of the globe.

14. The opulent vlsb fountain: 4 = A: 1, B: 3, C: 0

I could make tea with this tepid water.

13. 4th floor of etch to the right when exiting the main elevator: 5 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 2

The only thing i can say is that thankfully with time this water will end up in the toilet where it belongs. Disliked! Blocked!

12. Cory hall fountain near supernode: 7 = A:-1, B: 4, C: 4

Fear of eecs peoples societal superiority over a shivering social science girlie factored into anxiety. However, I confuse fear and admiration, so my type is eecs boys. The raw Chad eecs energy that made me scared of being hurt boosted the beauty ranking. These two biases balance out each other as a net neutral in the score. Controversially, I believe the water itself is actually overhyped.

11. first floor physics north and 3rd floor at the end of the hall: 7 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 4

You could go through the trouble of measuring the temperature of this water in kelvin only to find it is room temperature

10. asuc near amazon storefront: 7.1 = A: 1.8, B: 1, C: 4.3

i had to deduct from the anxiety ranking since my shoes for crews non-slip new balances sounded like spongebob squeaky boots walking to the fountain. Though, it sure was water.

9. 3rd floor of doe library by art history/classics: 7.3 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 2.3

With the amount of noise this fountain was making i expected water so cold even sigma freud would have penis envy of this spout. Yet i received nothing of the sort.

8. Gianni hall: 8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 4

hell is colder than this water

7. kroeber hall fountain, first floor: 8 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 3

people who use sensodyne toothpaste will enjoy the water of this fountain. I don’t and did not enjoy this fountain. Though, I enjoyed the house posts.

6. Evans ground floor: 10 = A: 0, B: 0, C: 10

Lovely as always, despite being in a building so bad even the university wants to tear it down.

5. campbell hall 1st and 5th floor: 12.2 = A: 1, B: 2, C: 9.2

The fifth floor is marginally better than the first floor. The fifth floor is so fresh that I felt like an Alaskan salmon swimming upstream against all the tasks i should be doing. Unfortunately, the salmon imagery for which this water transported me made me afraid as we live on a campus full of bears. Bears fish salmon. For this reason, this is an anxiety inducing fountain

4. stanley hall / the bottle filler next to yali’s qualcam cafe: 12.8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 8.8

I shivered.

3. Haas faculty: 13 = A: 2, B: 1, C:10

The sheer crispness of the water animorphed me into a polar bear. For this reason, I recommend this fountain for furries

2. mcCone hall, 5th floor west side: 14 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 9

right by a very beautiful patio view. I saw a berkeley squirrel (from afar) which coincidentally is the largest mammal i think i could confidently vanquish with my bare hands in a fight (now give me a sturdy stick and i could take on all the tigers at the Oakland zoo at once).

1. Morrison music hall: 15 = A: 2, B: 3, C:10

The parade people who have drank from this fountain have worn a pale yellow oval into the tiles just in front of it. You can imagine them standing in the center of the worn out tile oval filling up their water bottle; and you can imagine all the people to come doing the same, making the oval a little paler. You can do all this imaging while you know that in the present you are filling up your bottle standing in that same oval. That worn out tile was the first time that I saw like the tralfamadorians. And so I thought, maybe I should read Slaughterhouse-Five again. That or maybe i should just touch grass and let this stupid hobby of reviewing waterfountains die. So it goes.

Update of the update: they moved the elkay from the left to the right fountain in morrison hall. Therefore morrison hall water is no longer fire. This list remains in place but be cautioned that fountains may have changed.","I didn’t know r/Berkeley had off-season shit posting. A+ post
I'm honestly copying down the best locations for when I transfer in the fall. Thank you <3
I like you
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY DID THIS.
Glad to see Stanley Hall in the top five. As it should be.
can we be best friends because wow
Upvoted for the Animorph reference
What about that brass fountain outside Wheeler with the full-on ecosystem in it?  I'm blaming my bad grades on that water.

The amount of effort put into writing this is insane
Very nice and glad to see Haas in its rightful spot, but are photos available for those of us not regularly on campus?
The dedication 💯💯
This is the type of ground breaking research I expect to get us out next Nobel prize winner.
I’m so proud of McCone. The only thing they have going for them. Such a shitty building.
All the tigers in Oakland zoo passed away tho 😔
I would like to mention that the Etch water fountain just just had its filter replaced since my original recommendation. However I’m shocked it is so low. I’m going to have to see if these other fountains really are superior.
impressive. very nice.
!remindme 20d
Who would like to join me in hitting all these fine drinking locations in order?
not on campus but my fave water fountain was u1 slottman, that shit was so crisp
Certified water deity 💦💧🧚🏻
haha you should do it on a map
Water, water, every where,  
Any every drop to drink.
I guess I missed the call for suggestions. Sad to see my favorite, 5th floor Cory southwest, go underappreciated.
This is the beauty of pure science without capitalist interference. Well done.
Hesse hall has two water fountains that have quite crisp water, both on the lower floor. One next to the shop (adjacent to the ice machine?), and one close to the southward lower floor entrance that is close to a south-pointing McCone entrance (and the spiral stairwell that takes one towards Sutardja Dai), with a sabertooth tiger statue in the quad. The aesthetics may be lacking given the interior is quite drab, but I think for the crispness alone it is quite well worth it.
Im glad to see my recommendation for the Morrison Hall water fountain in the original post received a perfect score. I recommend any nomadic traveler passing through south west side of campus to seek it out as it hits just as hard as the water in the dune series must hit on Arakkis, just make sure to wait a few seconds holding the button as it reaches optimal chill
To the credit of physics north, its water flow is unsurpassed

P.S. I'm in your debt for this research. You've given me the hope and means for achieving my twin dreams of stalking squirrels and contributing to the generational wearing of tiles.
ya been to the McCone hall ground floor (north of the library) water fountains? The lower one has a crispness rating so low that it's good again.

like it's THAT warm!!!
Im not about to gatekeep the michelin travel guide of berkeley fountains until the season returns
Be careful. If they try to chase you away at Haas just puff yourself up and start yelling things like ""Corporate Synergy! Amplify deliverables to the consumer base! Disruption!""
I like me to
I never leave monkey business unfinished
Lol sure. Im always down to meet other berkeley students. You can message me haha
I am nothing but overly earnest always
My list represents both my own opinion and objective truth. Unfortunately, i didnt think to take photos when i tried the fountains.

South Asian eatery tier list(My personal opinion),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bb0oko/south_asian_eatery_tier_listmy_personal_opinion/,2024-03-09 19:41:02,"S tier- Vik’s Chaat, Udupi Palace

A tier- Punjabi Dhaba

B tier- Delhi Diner, both Momo places

C tier- My food :’)

D tier- House of Curries(sorry 😭 Haven’t eaten there in 2.5 years so maybe it changed idk)

E tier-

F tier- My armpits. I mean, I personally LOVE the scent of my armpit sweat but idk if y’all do hence the low ranking. Out of consideration for others though, I do apply old spice high endurance 48 hours deodorant every 6 hours. 


Edit: Sigh…okay I’m putting Punjabi Dhaba in B tier. I initially considered doing this but I felt bad bc the dude giving the food was super chill and remembered my name 😭😭

If you’re reading this, I’m sorry for betraying you :( ","never tier list again lmao
I heard good things about HoC recently from my friend. Other than that I agree with this list. 
You should also give it try to Xpression at north side. That was my favorite spot in last semester.
MOUNT EVEREST????
Viks and Punjabi Dhaba are extremely mid. Delhi Diner is very hit or miss - great when it hits. Udupi palace is nice for an udupi style dosa.  Bottom line is all the south Asian restaurants in the area are bad or lower mid tier. Take the BART to Milpitas on a weekend for good Indian food.
i thought vik's was mid at best. i don't get the hype
Go to South Bay for good Indian food.
Viks is overrated. Stick to their chaat items.
 Delhi Diner Albany seems to be the only one that's consistently good.
I'm an alum still crying over the loss of Chaat Cafe. That was SS tier.
Re: F - You’re not EECS?
Kabana is pretty underrated
[deleted]
need to add mehak’s on here. amazing food 😋
If anyone cares, Udupi Palace is very laid back when it comes to serving alcohol. They just want to see a birthday, if you know what I mean. The food is also very good.
[deleted]
Delhi Diner is straight ass. So is House of Curries. I’d go to Kabana on University or the new Guru Curry in El Cerrito instead.
Where’s Munch India? Should be S tier
the F tier took me out 💀💀💀😭
Ajanta?
Punjabi Dhaba on the A-tier is wild
all the places are ass tbh. You have to go to south/east bay for better indian food. Fremont+Milpitas hits hard
Don’t forget about Xpression and Bollywood cafe
If you think Viks is good you should go to chaat bhavan (although not in Berkeley)
Mad truth yo
Momo Masala is fire imo and the lady there is so nice
Expressions - the new one in front of North gate is pretty good and cheap

HOC is gone though right? Is it back? Would a young person confirm either way? When last I was on Durant it seemed p dark and empty and locked :'(  
\-an old who misses HOC
Bring back Urban Turbann :(
What about wrap n roll
if you like viks chaat you've either forgotten what good indian food tastes like or never had any
Mehak is the best in town, prove me wrong I dare you.
House of Curries on Durant was great, but I think it is gone now?
I wonder if the people in Dune two connecting their breathing tubes into your armpit. It’s such a crime to including your fantasy in a food topic 🤮
Don’t make tier lists ever again lil bro
Breads of India so neglected
I think your armpits smell nice but I'd have to check again just to be sure
Bruh wut?
Vik’s Chaat is really weird vibes they kicked us out at 7:45pm on a Friday night
udupi palace is mid i fear… their dosas were flaccid when i went
>I personally LOVE the scent of my armpit sweat

Sometimes it's best to just avoid arguing with people on this site. You're like that guy who tastes his own piss and tried to argue about Italian food
where is Imm Thai
on god bro is delusional
Noted
Will try! And I might HoC another shot
I’ve found the Delhi Diner location on Solano to be much more consistent than the campus location.
Hmm maybe…I’ll admit that I’m biased bc I do buy all my spices, lentils, vegetables, cooking oils, rice bags, etc. from Viks Market which is connected to Viks Chaat.

But one thing that blew me away was the punctuality.

Like today I ordered chicken curry thali and 2 samosas with mint and tamarind chutney and they had it ready in like 7 minutes. I was impressed
 Nope I’m not! 😅
Kabana is extremely underrated. They are awesome! What I like most about them is that it feels like the food of your mom's friend who is the best cook. You could eat that food everyday and not get sick or tired of it!
Will try!
Mehak's is definitely a little out of the way for people living around campus, but it's great. The quality is solid and the value is unmatched, one entree can easily feed two people.
Thanks for the recommendation! I haven’t eaten there yet but it looks like it’s only a 10 minute walk from my place so I’ll eat there soon!
no it is not amazing food
Yep, something else I like about it is that they primarily serve South Indian food. Which is nice bc the South Indian cuisines are super underrepresented among Indian restaurants in the Anglosphere imo
This is how you get the govt to harass a business. Spread this by word of mouth, not online for everyome to see bro
What part of it do you disagree with? You’re entitled to your own opinions but this is just mine.
I tried Delhi Diner last Friday for the first time, and I should have gotten the clue when the owner(?) directed me toward the salt and pepper sauce.

... I gave half of my food to my white friend after I was minimally satiated and she \*loved\* it. I think that says enough.
Finally someone who appreciates my humor 🙏
You’re right actually 😭

I’d just feel bad putting it lower bc the dude is super chill 😭
Not me! I haven’t gone to Moffitt in months lol
Will check and update you tmrw
Haha
Hey don’t judge my armpits until you’ve smelt them! They actually smell pretty good imo.

I think there’s some truth to “you are what you eat” bc they naturally smell like some kind of masala powder. Like a mix of coriander seeds, red chilis, turmeric, curry leaves and other spices and I love it. It’s so masculine and musky.
Will try!

viks chaat in s tier and momo places in c is criminal, brother is tweakin
You’re right 😭 I should have put on my armpits on S tier :P
if you're talking about HoC on durant, it closed down a few months ago. the one on sacramento is still open though.
yeah, the place is well-managed and efficient given the kind of crowd it attracts. have you tried Mount Everest on telegraph? they have an amazing butter chicken thali for \~$13 at lunch. it's sooo good and plenty enough for leftovers too
That accounts for your excellent hygiene.
i swear by their malai kofta, chef’s kiss fr
I agree! My roommate is South Indian and she was telling me the same thing. 

I want to try more South Indian dishes; what would you recommend I try?

Momo places are in B…

And Viks Chaat is great. I also love Viks market and buy everything from them except meat
Mount Everest was our go to when we lived in Berkeley.
I have not but I look forward to trying it; thanks for the rec!
Thanks!
There’re a lot of good ones! Idli, dosa, sambar, pulihora, ariselu, upma, pesarattu, rasam, pappu(lentil curry), etc

Was wondering how much work the class is including the readings and lectures and also difficulty wise? Thank you","haven't taken it over the summer, but I took it in Fall 2020 and got an A+ pretty easily without putting in too much work! According to [BerkeleyTime](https://berkeleytime.com/grades/0-5030-all-all) being at the 33rd percentile is an A lol
Hey thanks for the reply! Do you think the readings are useful or is only watching the lecs enough? Also how was the final (apparently it’s a series of essays but I’m not the best writer lol)? Thanks once again!
hmm well we had like bcourses quizzes every week out of 10 based on the readings that were v simple even if you skim (or just open in adobe, run OCR and then command + f for keywords haha). you can also take them as many times as you want and only the final score will count so theoretically they could be spammed by guess + check repeatedly

and the final wasn't hard at all. 3 essays \* 2 pages each = 6 pages only! prompts were pretty fun iirc :)
Ah ok thank you so much! Just curious how was the homework like? I heard it was like a bunch of short answers every week and it was really time consuming?
[removed]
it was time-consuming at first, but prof roberts changed it a bit after getting feedback that it was too long midway through the semester. it was basically short answer questions marked out of 25, but the only scores possible were 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 intended as a way to balance gsi subjectivity and make marking more consistent

Are the hw questions like really straightforward and easy to answer? Sorry for asking so many questions lol I’m taking another class alongside it so I just wanna make sure it’s not too time consuming. Thanks once again for your replies!

Another rescind question ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cm6417/another_rescind_question/,2024-05-07 00:28:51,"so my senior year of high school
- 2 C’s last semester 
- 2 C’s this semester and if i’m lucky only one
 will i be rescinded from college of letters and sciences? my gpa is still over 3.0 but i don’t know. thank you ","U won’t get rescinded, I don’t know a single case where someone got rescinded even w below a 3.0
U won’t get rescinded, I don’t know a single case where someone got rescinded even w below a 3.0
UC Berkeley may want an explanation for the C’s but I agree that you will not be rescinded.  For D’s and F’s yes. What does your conditions of admission state about C grades?
They don’t ask for explanation, at least last year they didn’t. There were 5 categories that they asked you to report. The grade category was if you warned a D or F or if you dropped below 3. Then there was a section to report why. That was it as far as grades. Go have fun your class few weeks of high school! dw
Why would they rescind a C
will they email me or should i ask them
I would wait for them to reach out about the C’s."
Transfers- anyone get a C in a major prep class and was accepted?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/194exr8/transfers_anyone_get_a_c_in_a_major_prep_class/,2024-01-11 14:46:57,"For context I have a 3.97 gpa rn and I applied to cal as a transfer. But I’m taking discrete math this quarter and I already know it’s gonna be super hard. Obviously I’m hoping for an A or a B, but incase I get a C how would this affect my admission??

I don’t report these grades so if I do get in hypothetically could they reject me as they require a 3.0+ in major prep classes? Has anyone gotten a C in a major prep class?? Would they make an exception if it’s just 1?","I got a C in DiffEq. Transferred as a math major. Had A’s in almost all other classes (One B in Lin Alg). You’re probably fine.
[deleted]
From some convos with admissions officers it shouldn’t alter the acceptance/rejection decision. You seem like a strong student regardless so you should be fine.
If you're transferring into EECS which is in the College of Engineering, it could be the death knell because you're applying directly to the major from JC. If you're applying to CS which is in College of Letters & Science then you have a little lee way since you're not in the major yet.

BTW, everything at Berkeley is harder than the hardest JC class.
If you already applied, none of the grades you earn moving forward ""matter"" with the context that they'll be reviewed for admissions purposes. You would need to fail courses, earn a GPA below a 3.0 or some other detrimental scenario to have your admissions negatively impacted. Just ensure you earn at least a C, and you'll be golden when it's time to enroll at a university.
Had a C in statistics and a lower GPA and I still got accepted. Write some good essays with a 3.0 or better and you’ll be rewarded
No, unless you got a D, you might be dangerous.
Going to say, for college of engineering you must have no less than a C and a 3.0 or greater term GPA.

  
Hit both of those and you're fine. Miss one of them, you might not be fine. Shrimple as that.
None of us work in admissions obviously, but I'll bet a C in community college for a class directly related to your major is considered pretty bad unless you have a good reason. From my experience, Berkeley classes are much MUCH harder than cc.

If you're applying to a competitive major like CS or DS, I am just guessing but I bet it will quite possibly prevent you from getting admitted.

Of course since you don't report the score at all then how would they know?
wait don’t take discrete math at cc if u expect to get credit for it at cal. ur way better off taking it here since cal doesn’t accept cc credit for 70
I got a C in Chemistry, a B in Linear Algebra, and a B in one of my core Physics classes. I transferred as a Physics major. Anything is possible lol
Yep! Got a C+ in linalg, transfered as a physics/CS major, but it was first semester of covid and I had lots of life things going on that I talked about in my essays. Basically straight As other than that as well.

If you can explain holistically, try to do so, I'm sure it helped me.
L&s as in the l&s college right?
I’m applying for cog sci and yes I’m aware it’ll be 10x harder which is why I wanna get all math done at cc lol
computer science is direct admit
A C isn’t a 3.0 tho, a B would be 3.0
Thank you, I wrote the best essays I could possibly write on my end so I feel confident about that portion
[deleted]
Since they’re intending cog Sci they should be able to get credit for math 55- discrete math
What do you mean 70? It’s articulated on the assist page for cog sci.
Woah thank you, I was just worried bc on the website it said no less than a 3.0 for major prep classes
they mean computer science not cog sci
Yes you're correct but C grades are still allowed so long as your cumulative is at or above a 3.0
Best of luck!
Did you retake calc? And I have the spring quarter left unfortunately but I’m just preparing for the worst case scenario
OHHH yes this is true. sorry i’m cs cog double so my brain is fucked from trying to figure out who articulates what
someone just clarified my comment (they’re right) so check their reply!
What do you mean by this? Per class? B's or above? Or cumulative?
Ohh I didn’t know that

Cumulative so for a semester your transferable uc gpa can’t dip below 3.0 (ex: you’re fine if you get 1 c and 3as)
I didn’t get a C haha I’m just worried I might!"

Yeah, those unknown professors like Michael Pollan who has given a TED talk, been on national television numerous times, and authored 5 New York Times best sellers. Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.  Truly, he deserves some sort of award to signify the important contributions he has made.
Most if not all of these are extremely well-known and have won many awards.
Robert Hass is excellent. He writes a lot about human connection with our environment. So does the other poetry professor next semester (John Shoptaw).

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47553/meditation-at-lagunitas 

is good, as well as 

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/06/27/the-problem-of-describing-trees.

His poems also have themes of semiotics, for the linguistics/philosophy/literary theory people out there.

> Or the other notion that,

> because there is in this world no one thing

> to which the bramble of _blackberry_ corresponds,

> a word is elegy to what it signifies.

That is, (my interpretation), if we see a blackberry and describe it as a ""blackberry"", as in ""I saw a blackberry today,"" we've essentially destroyed that blackberry's uniqueness and identity, unified it with all the other blackberries in the world. Just saying the word ""blackberry"" at once marks the funeral of that specific blackberry and sings its final elegy. There is, I think, the value of silence: in appreciating some Thing without putting a name to it, that clouds our judgement with our memories of all the other Things of that name (ever met a girl with the same name as your ex?).

That last line just struck me as particularly beautiful when I read it, as a sharp upper bound on what humans are able to communicate with each other.
What a BS article. That is not a list of *unknown* people.
At least as famous as a critical theorist, especially one focused on a field as specific as gender theory, can hope to be. I think all of us humanities people pray to be even half as notable as her.
> Alternatively, there is that unknown Nobel prize winning professor Randy Schekman.

Perlmutter too.

At least article writer can take solace that the Nobel committee agrees  with them that these guys ""deserve an award""? :P"
So disappointed ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cv4496/so_disappointed/,2024-05-18 11:42:47,"I was studying all semester and staying on top of one of my classes and was honestly doing average but I was honestly okay with getting a B if it came to it. I got my pre-final composite score and got exactly average like exactly down to the percentage average which again, I was okay with. I thought I studied enough for the final and felt well about it tbh. However I check cal central today and see that I got a C :( I guess I had my hopes high when I thought I would get a B. I don’t know how I did on the final because they haven’t released the exam on grade scope. I’m just super bummed because I watched all the lectures, read the chapters, took notes on everything, and did all chapter exercises as well. I feel super discouraged and disappointed because if I was honestly trying my best and still got a mediocre grade, what does this mean?? Does anyone have any advice on what I could do better? I was going to office hours and asking for help too so I just don’t get it. I would say I studied harder for this class than macro and I got an A- in macro so I just want to know what I can do better.

Edit: thank you everyone who commented wonderful advice and their own experiences :’)","Dude it’s happened to me before it’s ok. My gpa is still high. It’s actually not the end of the world. I got a C+ in a class once and it was humbling but it didn’t end my life or ruin my gpa.
“C”’s get degrees. You’ll be fine in the long run. Remember that grades are not a final opinion on who you are. Im sure you have a lot of other things to be thankful for. This is only a grade, not a judgement. Keep up the good work!!
Which class is this?
Some classes you just don’t click with the material! It’s totally okay, just let this one pass and tackle the next semester with the same enthusiasm :)

If there’s a consistent problem with you studying a bunch but still not getting the grades you want, you might also want to re-evaluate your studying methods. What works for others (ex: memorization, practice exams, lab practice) might not with the best for you. Try different ways of studying in different places with or without other people and see what helps you the best!!

Good luck :)
Try not to feel bad about it. In a course as large as DATA 88S, grading is probably pretty algorithmic. So maybe you bombed the final, and the grade wheel cranked out a C for you.

It happens. Never feels good.

Stats aren’t in everyone’s comfort zones, even if the growth of data science makes it feel like they should be. If it helps, macroeconomics is much more of an intuition-based art, which many find inscrutable. Many who are extremely good at statistics
Means you didn’t do as well as you thought
C’s get degrees! I passed stats with a C as well. Sometimes it doesn’t matter how hard we study, our brains just process different topics in different ways. I know I’ll never understand certain aspects of math, and that’s ok with me. 
Remember that your grade is not who you are. It’s not a reflection of your intelligence, or your worth as a person.
Intro classes tell you where your strengths are. And they may not be where you thought or hoped they were. If you really did the best you could it might be that this is just not a subject that comes easily to you. You might not have the background or experience needed, or familiarity with other necessary precursor subjects. 

Or you might just be average. AT CAL. You are at an elite institution, among the best and the brightest. There’s no shame in not rising to be the cream of THAT crop. I got a couple of C’s my Freshmen year and ended up graduating with honors because those grades told me to change my intended major and do the things I loved and was good at.  But either way, you are doing fine. Cs get degrees and CAL is tough. No grade inflation.
You said you did average and received a C. I don't understand the issue. C means average.
Was this more math based than the A- class? If it’s math based, you need to have a different strategy than try as hard as possible sometimes. Trying as hard as possible can even backfire if you become mentally drained and fuzzy. If you know the feeling of understanding a math concept, you have to keep trying to figure it out until you get that feeling. I have a different study style, but I usually ask myself questions to find holes in my understanding and have points where I ask myself how much I understand the material, go through all my knowledge, and make sure it’s good enough for the point of the class, like a Socratic dialogue type style. I personally get drained from people, but if you’re an extrovert it’s extremely helpful imo to have a study group so even at your worst you won’t fail the class but you’ll get at least close to their understanding (hopefully it’s a strong work ethic and sincere study group and not a cheating ring study group). It’s also possible to stack classes with similar content to master the material if you really want but I’m personally against it. I’m a last minute crammer so I don’t actually follow the one hour a day approach but I think it depends on your temperament too. Once you find what works, double down on it.
Welcome to the real world, where you try your best but you don't succeed. There WILL be people better than you, and realizing where you fall in the ranks is a good wake-up call.

At Berkeley I quickly learned I'm not a good math major. So I stopped going deep into math based on a low grade from a class.
Bad technique. Just watching lectures and taking notes doesn't inherently lead to understanding.

Identify the scope of what is being covered. 

Try to play teacher. If you had to create a test over any bit of material or a lecture eithin that scope - what questions could you write that dont provide the answers in the questions themselves?

If you can't formulate a good question or problem and then provide a solution or answer... you don't have understanding and need to fill a gap. 

Just writing notes you never look at again is... not reliable. Sure it's one step above simply observing a lecture. But you need to actually gain insight and understanding. 

Try to write your own explanation of high level topics. And drill down into the detail. This forces you to fact check and verify your understanding. You will identify gaps in your understanding this way. 

Sometimes assignments or projects will force this in some courses.
not a big deal unless you’re pre-law or pre-med. if so, damn RIP. consider reaching out to the professor.
“[As I like to tell the C students](https://youtu.be/cpDJb3ZQu0Y)...”
Grades in college to not matter in the professional world.
I'm sorry. That's tough. I really dislike the grading system in general but these big classes are hard to organize. I always tell my students: remember your worth as a human is not measured by academic grades.
Means you didn’t really understand the material. You definitely could’ve put in the work but maybe you didn’t do any meaningful studying.

Time spent studying =\= deep learning.
Well… you should stop wasting time doing what you’ve been doing and just focus on what the exams questions are or might be
All the time fail test re take it get higher hrde
Great advice and C+ grades are the worst.
Until grad school
Stat 88
Do you plan on going to grad school? Im not trying to mean or anything I'm truly interested if people can get C's here and there but can still apply to Grad school??
Well said!
Most classes are curved to a 2.7-3.3 average iirc
Great advice. I'm a professional engineer now, but when I was studying for the PE exam the most useful thing I did was teach someone else to pass the exam.  
There was a guy in my office who had taken and failed the 8-hour exam three times already. I knew he wouldn't be able to (actively) help me with tough topics, but I decided to study with him anyway because I (correctly) assumed he would have already gathered lots of practice exams and materials. The guy was pretty much dead weight whenever we studied, but that was actually where the magic started. 
I ended up explaining everything to him on such a basic level that I was able to identify, fill in, or strengthen gaps in my knowledge in areas that I wouldn't have realized I needed to, otherwise.
It turns out that dragging his ass across a lot of practice finish lines was just what I needed to make the exam a breeze for me! I passed on the first try and he passed, too! It was a happy ending for everyone, and a great lesson about the value of friendship . . . or was it helping others? . . . Whatever. It works.
I thought I was doing everything I had to do to understand it but atp I just don’t know what to do when it comes to future classes.
For real! And I did significantly above average on the midterm so I felt like I was at least gonna have some sort of a B! I guess I really ate shit on the final hahahah
Same man, I feel like I studied my ass off for the final, barely survived, stat 88 was hell this semester. it really should be a 4 unit class.
I didn't find this on BerkeleyTime lol. Maybe check [BerkelyTime.com](http://BerkelyTime.com) for the historic bins cause if you were average the whole time it doesn't make sense to get a C
Nope lol
It’s absolutely possible to get a few C’s and still go to grad school. Research experience and letters of recommendation are generally much more important than GPA. You will want to have at least a 3.5 for competitive programs, but you can still get into some very decent schools with a 3.0.
fellow grad student at cal, my undergrad transcript had a few D’s and C’s lol
Pretty much same.. I was a tutor for a few 1st and second year engineering classes the last 2 years of my undergrad and... I got exposed to myself about how poor my understanding was on so many things. 

When I started working I just documented everything I had to touch in a way that hopefully any idiot like myself at the time could learn from... then once new people started getting hired I just kind of mentored them and that helped flush out the initial documentation a little more. 

I could definitely get by on just full sending things and relying on my brain. But when the project scope starts to expand among 150+ engineers over many years that's not very reliable. People just update the existing documentation now and it's easy to refer back to years later for stuff we haven't changed in a long time and everyone's a little iffy on it.

+ it's helped our support teams alot on live calls when they need to double check something before pulling the trigger in an outage. Or scope out the impact when an issue occurs. 

Learning to be my own teacher from that initial tutoring was huge for everything after it.
Learn other people’s methods of studying. I like to study with a Buddy not studying anything related to what I’m studying. Give them your phone. 

For final exams, prioritize studying everything after the midterm. Even though most are cumulative, they focus heavier on the latter end because you haven’t been tested on it.

I like to start with the end stuff because it is fresh, and you usually need to know the fundamentals to solve harder problems or deeper concepts. If I don’t know the basics, I can’t grasp those harder concepts.

Also, learn to not just start studying during dead week. I always study at least the weekend before dead week. I find that 1 hr a day every day is better than 3-4 hours the last few days. Concepts stick better when you aren’t pressuring yourself to learn more in a shorter amount of time
See a comment I wrote a while back about 'studying smart':

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bb67wp/why_is_this_school_so_hard/kuasl6s/
I also like to study in not dead silent places to try and make myself distracted
mhm, whats your major? if i can ask?
I took notes throughout the semester of every chapter and actively explained concepts to myself and friends as well. I also focused on the chapters after the midterm too to make sure they stuck before dead week even started. I guess I just couldn’t solve the problems as correctly as I thought I did on the final.
I have the sneaking suspicion you’re going to make fun of me. I’ve changed majors three times, to be honest. I also transferred out of Cal two years ago to pursue a graphic design major closer to home, and I’m graduating next week. 
I have a lot of mental illness issues and a normal four-year program did not work for me.
Take this with a growth mindset. Perhaps meet with the teacher to go thru the test on the questions you got wrong so that you come out of the class *knowing* more than had you left without investigating. Let taking classes be more about the knowledge, not just the grade.
Don't worry lol its hard to make fun of others when you've had it happen to yourself lol, I dropped out of CC and returned and finally have done well so I'm trying to transfer to UCB. Congratulations on completing your goal though.
Huge congrats!"

Do you write by hand? I know writing by hand and typing generate very different thought process therefore final product.
The best way to improve your writing is  to write, write, and write some more.  It's like a muscle. It needs to be exercised.  If you want to be old-style, you can get a little  journal and  a pen and keep it  with you all the times so you can write at any time of day. To  improve your writing, you  have to commit  yourself  to rewriting.  Writing is rewriting.  (See what Hemingway has to say about revising.)  Write a  draft; wait a day or two; reread and edit the draft; show it to a friend and have them edit; rewrite. I know that is too many  steps when you have so many essays to write but do give yourself time to revise a draft! Reading  is also important as a means to improve your writing.  On Revision: See Joseph  Harris'  great book: *Rewriting: how to do things with texts* and William German *On Revision*.  Good luck with your writing!
At Berkeley, you  are required to take two writing courses your  Freshman year.    In those  classes, which  are usually taught by graduate students, you learn new  skills that  help you move beyond the  5-paragraph essay.  These  courses also help you to learn to read  texts closely and construct a strong argument.  

Art of Writing courses are upper division courses, taught by a  ladder faculty, on a specific topic that is of interest to the faculty  and their graduate student who team teaches the courses.   Classes are small; you get lots of feedback on your writing; you learn to revise; you read but you concentrate on thinking and writing.   You develop a supportivecommunity  of  writing with your fellow students. AND most of all you learn to develop your own voice and style and to see yourself as a writer.  These classes are a unique opportunity at a large university   like  Berkeley.
Like some other students who took Art of Writing courses, I wouldn't take just one! I would take 2 or 3 with different professors on different topics each semester.
First  of all, don't call  it writer's block.  It's a pause; a moment of silence when new ideas and words are coming-into-being. 

\--Be kind to  yourself and do  not judge  yourself.  Most writing blocks come from being over self-critical, comparing yourself to others; judging everything you write.  Be compassionate with yourself  and your words.  There are enough harsh  critics in the world.   Don't  be one  now. 

\--Try to schedule a time during the  day when you are relaxed. Read a  little, move a little, and then write.  Set a  limit on how long you write at first--say 5 minutes--and make  yourself stop  after that.  Write   a little longer each week.

\--Just write words. Don't reread; don't revise; just write.

\--For me, listening to music really helps me to write.  I imagine there is some activity that relaxes you,  or a place that makes you feel secure and expressive. 

&#x200B;

\-- Create a ritual  either before or during the time you write. One friend used  to  set very narrow margins  and make sure each line had the same number of words!  The words came--it was a *creative challenge.*
It changes  all the time.  It depends on my mood.

One summer all  I wanted to do was  read Dickens.  And so I did!
This  is an exciting moment in what is now called ""creative non-fiction."" Writers in this ""genre"" are not just interested in listing a series  of facts and maintaining an objective and neutral voice.  They want to tell a story, to find a narrative and style that  draws the reader in and catches their interest.  I don't know what you  like to read or think about but check out  some of the books by one of the Art of Writing  Guest lecturer: Michael Lewis.  A great writer; a great essayist and journalist; a superb thinker.  You can listen to his lecture on [artofwriting.berkeley.edu](https://artofwriting.berkeley.edu)  Check out Robert Reich also on his writing process and  practices on our website.

oh i got some thoughts about the mascot
I  have to think about that!  I'm always amused when I see  the mascot.
I absolutely  adore seeing my students become excited and absorbed by their  own writing and by the writing of others.  When I see students who are  curious about  words  and devoted to discovering the right words to say at the right time, whatever that time may  be-- I honor  that.  Students are the most creative people I am around!

For an aspiring educator--you have to love what you do and see it as a creative act.
I'll let you  answer that.
See my answer above on AoW courses. In fact, I just copied it for you. Let me also add that your writing will be given  the attention and care that will  help you develop as a writer in any  field.  Communicating  your ideas in writing  with  style and precisionis an important skill to acquire.

We have courses that are taught in the Engineering Department.  For example, Prof Mark Bauer just  taught Engin  185 Beyond Data: scientific writing for  non-scientific  writers.  Margaret Kolb will be teaching a course  in  Spring 2024 ""Writing Robots.""  Honestly, just  find  a topic that interests  you and  take the course.  The professor will help you  to develop your own voice and style.
That is a  long story.I had a great job in publishing but  I was deathly bored. I had to change careers.  So I did but I kept being  an editor. The  combination of being an editor and a professor and someone  who is writing on writing led me to become  Director.
Depends on the professor!

Spring 2024: WritingRobots.

Revise ChatGPT's essays and say it  in your own words.
I  mean this: Knowing how to write well  will serve you in  any profession.  A well-written email will get you an interview!

So just take a course that interests you, a topic that inspires you.
Pretend you are not  writing.

Read a writer who inspires you before writing an essay.
Lol, someone seems excited to come to Berkeley
You  decide after you take them all!

Read  read and write write.

Look at ads commercials, texts, instagram, etc and think  about the words  and how they are put together and how you would put them  together.

Just keep writing and if you can (or care to) take a  writing course.

I  find reading books on writing  or writers' memoirs on their writing and moments of not  writing very  helpful.
I do!  And I have a small but  loved pen collection  so I change pens often.

When  I can, I buy my students pens so they can have the experience  of writing by hand.
Not all first-year classes are taught by grad students. There are a lot of lecturers who teach those classes, too.

Ask your teachers for extra credit HWs to bump your gpa up to a 3.0. Good luck

They probably would say the same thing I jsut got done with all my classes and I saw it was under a 3.0 with just two c so I’m kinda devastated I really wanted to go to Berkeley. I heard you can email your admissions officer I just don’t know where to find it

You should probably get on that tho just so you can see what they say. Have you accepted your offer?

They just fully got turned in last week so I turned the update in then but do you know if it’s overall gpa or individual semester gpa?
it’s both individual semester gpas
Damn I’m cooked 😭
do you have a reason? if you’re like super unable to convince your teachers you could possibly convince admissions
I took 9 classes that’s my only reason I mean from what I’ve heard it’s difficult to be rescinded but it’s still a possibility
oh man how far under are you and are u failing anything
I just have a 2.87 I ended up getting two C which dropped my gpa to that. I’m not failing any classes surprisingly I’m just hoping I’ll be okay 🫡
oh dude that was my same situation. 2 cs in ap stats and ap gov… my stats teacher is being really understanding and grading missings so it’s gonna be a b for me but otherwise i’d be just like u. r u sure there’s no window for any of ur teachers? 100% better safe than sorry u shud enjoy ur senior summer rather than stress for half of it
I did all that I can with grades everything got rounded up already. How is it for you tho any new updates?
any updates? i’m in similar situation as you
it appears i will be making it out… i wish u the most luck though
I heard back from them they said it’s fine since my overall gpa is still a 3.0
Im confused did your offer get rescinded? My bad I’m bad at English best of luck for you in the future too 😭😭
thank you so much for the update! my situation was to the tee to yours so I was hoping you had an answer lol did you have to email them or call them?
noo i meant that i am getting a 3.0 unweighted gpa so im all good! thank you :) i hope u make it in the fall asw

Brokenhearted by Math 1B at Cal. How should I deal with the last math class I need - Math 55?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cw9xpa/brokenhearted_by_math_1b_at_cal_how_should_i_deal/,2024-05-20 00:42:06,"Ok, so freshman year has been a mixed bag. I have mostly A’s and B+ except for Math where I have a C+. I used to know Calculus. I don’t know what happened after the first midterms- I just got busy in the many clubs and assumed I’d sail through. 

Should I repeat this class at a CC for a better grade? Has anyone gotten into Haas with a C + in a prerequisite?

Now I’m scared of Math 55 which is a CogSci prerequisite. I’m not sure I’ll be able to face it this fall. I love CogSci and would hate to change my major to avoid Math. So beaten.

Anyone has any suggestions for me? ","Everyone in CogSci does Math 55 at a CC. Or at least the ones that are smart about it.

Stuff happens, I wouldn’t retake a class with a C+ personally.
C+ is fine once or twice
I ended up with a C+ in Math 1A my freshman year due to the GSI strike changing all the grading. Its scary to see on your transcript but my counselor/trusted adults have all told me its completely fine, no need to retake.
Math 55 is pretty different from Math 1B. The professors here are usually pretty good though.
So, as you probably know, Haas doesn’t allow you to take prereq classes at a CC once you’ve started classes at Berkeley. Now, Math 55 is not a prereq for Haas so I think technically you could still do this, but you should double check.  Also, not sure if Haas would still frown upon this anyhow.  If you’re going to do this, I might suggest you do this in the summer so that at least you can say that you’re moving ahead with your coursework.  As opposed to taking it in a normal semester, where it looks more apparent that you’re taking it to avoid something.
Thanks ! That’s helpful to know. I’ll just start looking for a CC equivalent over this summer and try to do better
I hope so! Thanks
Thanks, that’s reassuring!
Thanks! I was hoping you would somehow manifest:) I looked at some courses which are already running full. The others start later and get into August. I’m going to push this to next summer and do it in parallel to an internship I think."

Did you contact Berkeley about it and they told you no promises ?
I just called a few times and they told me that they can't tell me anything based on ""possible grades"" since I still have a C and I haven't taken my final yet. So I asked if I should SIR and they said at my own discretion. ucsb on the other hand reassured me that in most cases, based on my profile, I'll probably be ok when the admissions review my final grades. but I really don't know...my counselor said that she has never seen a student in my situation NOT get into berkeley. but ofc im really worried. idk what I will do if I commit to ucb and then i get removed yk? ...hbu?"

No, that is not a failing grade so it does not have to be retaken. Of course I don't know about specific policies in your college/department.

I just recently got into UC Berkeley as a transfer. I got in as a Statistics major and taking 5 classes this semester. I had a rough start to my calc 3 class due to some loss and grief I went through in the beginning of the semester. My professor has been the absolute worst and we aren’t seeing eye to eye. I tried to speak with him about making up some assignments/extra credit but he has declined my request and ignoring my emails. My grade currently sit at a 65.5 percent (around 3 percent away from a C) and I have a few questions. 

1. I am petitioning to file my final grade as either a Pass/No Pass. Will UC Berkeley be ok with this? I just don’t want the class to tank my GPA as it’s a 5 unit class. 
2. If I don’t end up passing the class will UC Berkeley cancel my admission? I’m doing absolutely everything I can to help my pass but the idea and stress of me not passing is haunting me and not allowing me to fully celebrate getting admitted. 
I am planning on meeting with an advisor this week but I would really appreciate your guys feedback/advice.

FYI: Calc 3 is a “Highly recommended” course for my major but not “Required”

","Regardless, Calc 3 is very helpful in the Stat Major. I would try reaching out to admissions and, in the case that you fail, see if you can retake it here. That would be taking Math 53 in the fall. I’m guessing your course load would look like:

Stat 20 (4)
Math 53 (4)
American Cultures (4)
L&S transfer course (1)

Not a bad semester at all.

I’m also a stats transfer in my last semester so if you have any questions feel free to reach out
You might be able to retroactively drop the class. It would go on your transcript as a withdrawal.  I had to do that with a stat class because I got pneumonia and missed so many days that even if I aced the final I wouldn’t have enough participation points for a passing grade. I suggest you look into this option to protect your gpa.
Responded to the DM you sent with a few insights! You're not necessarily cooked in this situation
I’m sorry are you currently in Berkeley taking the calculus or are you at another college taking the calculus?
Absolutely do not pass no pass
Reach out to the professor. I had to withdraw last year when my course load schedule at a cc and doing a full time ballet trainee program got too crazy and plus working on Sundays as a barista.  I took too many courses for my load and the professor let me withdraw when her and I had a discussion.  I am on track to attend UCB in the Fall.
I’m pretty sure Calc 3 is required, not highly recommended. I’m also a Stats transfer that just got accepted. If you look at the agreement on Assist.org, it shows Calc 3 as one of the “required for admission” classes.
Yeah I am hoping that if I don’t pass they will let me retake it at Berkeley which I won’t be too upset about. But do you think they will let me take a Pass/No pass instead of a letter grade?
Hey, I’m an incoming stats transfer student, can I DM you?
Unfortunately the withdrawal deadline passed last week. I was in a good spot before then but then my grade tanked after he graded an exam.
im a CCC student who just got admitted to berkeley. im taking the class at my college.
ya u think berkeley will be cool with it?
The deadline for withdrawal already passed unfortunately..

calc 3 is math 53 which is required to finish either math 54/53 but not required to finish both
Stat department does not like PNP you have to have a letter grade
Ofcourse
I’m not sure if the class will tank your GPA enough for Berkeley to rescind your offer, was your admission conditional on you maintaining a certain GPA? If anything I would email admissions or speak to a counselor. I think they would be understand especially since this class isn’t required.
Not sure. If it’s not a major requirement it should be fine i guess but seems like an important class
Are you sure it was the total withdrawal date or was it just the date where you would have been able to get your money back had you withdrawn before it?
Oh yes you’re 100% right
Awesome!  Thanks for being open to helping people with extra questions 💕
im actually more sure.. i never thought about that do you know if its normal for schools to let you drop after the withdrawal deadline and give you a a W on your transcript ? im not trippin about losing money tbh
Yes its a normal thing. Check, I think you might be able to drop it still bro.
i just checked everywhere at my college rn and couldn’t find a clear answer. but on my college eservice it still gives me the option to drop the clssss… but im not sure if it will let me 100% or if i do it will just turn into an F.. Do you mind helping me look? i got to Los Rios Communtiy College district
Damn bro it looks like you can't. Go to the tab labeled ""grades and grade point averages"":

It says you can't withdrawal after 75% of the class has been completed. Unless you have a legit grief excuse I think you have to take what you get at this point. Sorry man. I don't think this will affect your admission to Berkeley tho, just bust your ass for the remainder of your time in the class.
Damn ok. All good. I believe in myself to pass the class but that silent chance i don’t just scares tf out of me and i just really want to submit my SIR and move on with life. I appreciate your help tho king 🙏"

There will be no end to inequality if he and others such as Sanders think that we can inhibit inequality while maintaining a capitalist economic system.
I thought you meant Keynesian but I guess there's an economist named Kautsky. There's seems to be two main policies which we are told work: Keynesian policies and supply side policies. The former leads to high inflation rates and the latter leads to huge inequalities. None of them are stable in the long run. What to do?
Kautsky was a Marxist social theorist. What I mean is that socialist reform will not make society less unequal.

Keynesian economics works if productivity increases faster than consumption, but that just is not happening in the USA and in many developed countries. 
I thought the problem was that productivity was increasing way faster  than wages (statistics show this), and since higher wages lead to more consumption, the fact that wages were not increasing as much as they could have led to lower consumption than could have been possible.

BTW it seems that Sanders wants a Keynesian style of economics (Keynesianism is not socialism as far as I can tell) - he's mentioned that he's not much different than Eisenhower economically. 
You are right, this is essentially Thomas Picketty's conclusion in ""capital in the 21st century"". The rate of economic growth is much faster than the rise of wages.
Is it? I wouldn't know, I haven't read it (side note: isn't it a running joke now that everyone says it's a thoughtful and extraordinary read but no one's read it?). I'm just going off what I've heard from progressive and conservative economic explanations. Progressives (and many others) argue that wages have been stagnant even though productivity has been increasing. Conservatives argue that when workers get paid too much it will lead to high inflation (because then demand will grow and with increased demand the companies will charge more for goods which will then make employers pay more for their labor because they need to sell their products and so on until prices are sky high). Both argue for capitalist positions but both will lead to one problem or the other (neither will say that none of these solutions will work in the long run). "

You guys are amazing. Too bad campus doesn’t do a better job of it on their own
Thank you guys #godbless
So what the hell is that campus fee for? The one we still paid during lockdown
Who in this picture is single?
Zero waste by 2020.
Great job, though not as diverse of a group as I would have hoped. 

Fellow white people I am disappointed in you!

Can assure they are picked up after!
And thank you for sending us trash bags! Very much appreciated.
Clean ups are always Sunday 2-3, we post meeting location + more info on Wednesday nights, follow our instagram and discord for announcements!
Agree it could be cleaner, but def a lot of issues lie in people not throwing their own stuff away. These clean-ups, in addition to helping the environment, also show a bit of worker solidarity IMO!
It is very cool that people cleaned up. I appreciate and celebrate it but I’m still bitter about the campus fees being paid during lockdown and now I’m bitter about anyone paying it for any reason.
You thirsty bro?
The fuck, dude
\*around campus and off campus too! Thank you everyone and darn when will we be able to edit Reddit titles.
Picked up and disposed of at the fire station!

Ahh nice!
Happy Cake Day!!!🎉🎂🥳🥂🎈
My pleasure!😁
They should just pay you guys instead 😂
Some of it likely went to some buildings to improve seismic stuff + also make them safer for COVID-19...but do agree there should be more transparency to where fees go.
I could use a drink.
Oh, right, my bad. I forgot that ""diversity"" is code for ""less white people"" rather than actually wanting to see a representative cross-section of the population.
Ah that’s good; is the fire department in charge of disposing of hazardous waste like that? Or did you do it?

Campus hygiene is venerable.
I don't know what you're on about, but if more people see others as people instead of the lens that you have on right now, this ""diversity"" that you're wishing for will naturally arrive

So, in terms of seeing other people as people, there's a time and place to bring up ""white people."" This isn't one of them, as the more you talk about this on the smallest violin-playing issue, the more it falls apart on the bigger discussions that are actually important. The goal is to see everyone on the same page, including these ""white people,"" instead of driving them away
Yes, fire departments can dispose of biohazardous sharps. I just took it to them and a firefighter accepted the needles from me.

Discrete Math at CC or another programming language class,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17ntbu6/discrete_math_at_cc_or_another_programming/,2023-11-04 12:31:18,"I am an aspiring community college student who aims to transfer here and take CS61A and CS70 next summer.

I am currently doing Object-Oriented Programming in C++ and will be doing Data Structures in Spring. 

I am wondering on taking discrete math in Community College to prepare myself for CS70 (even if it doesn’t directly transfer) or learn another programming language by taking a beginner class in either Python or Java (it doesn’t transfer either but might help for CS61A).

P.S. I can’t take both because it would be an overload (I reached maximum credits)

Which one should I do instead?","Discrete Math class ran by students to prepare for CS 70: 

http://imt-decal.org
You can try taking a discrete class at CC but at least in my experience, the content of CS70 is on a completely different level. In about 2 weeks of CS70 here, we basically covered an entire semester’s worth of my CC’s discrete course lol Maybe you can find a more rigorous course elsewhere but I probably wouldn’t bother.
Honestly get in the school first before you think about this stuff
[deleted]
Good luck with that
Take as many classes at CC as possible
Yea I’d take the discrete course + study 70 at the same time. Also do not take 61A and 70 in the same summer. Even one course is an insane amount of work.
So as a cc student I underestimated how much Berkeley classes were.  Both of those classes at the same time during summer is not a good idea unless you are ok with low grades and no life.  I would recommend just 61A.
For transfers UC Berkeley does not accept any course equivalent to cs70 so they do not transfer that course from any CC
Would you think its better if I take an intro class in Python or Java instead? Adding either one would exceed the maximum credits that I can take.
I would be graduating from my CC after Spring 2024 and will probably live close to Berkeley (I don’t live in the Bay Area)

I’m not sure about going into another CC as I wouldn’t know the environment, the cost of classes compared to taking it here, and how I don’t have a car.

Since both are some of the few classes that corresponds to the CS61 series, how different are they?
What if I switch one of them with an upper-division American/breadth course instead? Would that make a significant difference?

Would taking CS61A in CC lessen the difficulty?
As a transfer myself, I quickly learned most of what I got from my CC courses didn’t really help. Given that you’ve already got coding experience as is, taking an intro course in Java/Python specifically isn’t particularly useful. I say this because the language you’ll pick up on pretty quickly regardless, what matters more from these intro courses is the fundamentals of programming that you get
[deleted]
I see, thank you for the advice.
Don’t agree with this. Take them here instead maybe not 61a but the others you should take here instead
[deleted]
Well you guessed wrong buddy. 61b is way harder than the CC data structures classes and it’s a fundamental course.
[deleted]
You guessed that I’m not a transfer. No you told them to take it at CC not study from the website

All you said was you can look at them lol

Guide to maximizing your score on your finals if you’re cramming [Serious],https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13c6atg/guide_to_maximizing_your_score_on_your_finals_if/,2023-05-08 14:59:43,"Preface: Unlike many of my previous posts, this post is a 100% serious no-nonsense guide to doing well on your final(s).

1.) Prioritize solidifying your understanding of content taught AFTER your most recent midterm for the class:

For most classes, the purpose of finals is to assess your overall understanding of the course content. 

With this in mind, content taught after the most recent midterm is likely to be overrepresented on the final since it wasn’t covered in previous exams.

2.) Your next priority should be to nail down content from the beginning of the semester for a few reasons:

a. You’re most likely to be rusty on this content since it’s from a while ago.

b. If you’re taking one of those courses where knowledge is cumulative, then understanding content from the beginning of the semester will help to understand content from later on.

c. This may also be overrepresented on the final since it wasn’t covered in a while and course staff want to make sure that students haven’t forgotten it.

3.) If you still have time, you can study content from the middle of the semester but, to maximize your score, your priorities(in descending order) should be as follows:

a. Things from end of semester(more specifically, things after last midterm)

b. Things from beginning of semester(more specifically, things before first midterm)

c. Things from middle of semester(more specifically, things between first and last midterms)

4.) Oh and get pegged by Oski for good luck!","True asf, all professors and head TAs must hate this guy for spilling the beans
bro im tryna skip straight to step 4
What if your last midterm was the Monday before deadweek and there wasn't really any new content after? How would you change your model?
Oski if you’re reading this please peg me
It's honestly kind of funny that I'm realizing this now... after how many years in school?
Nice
If you’re on a time crunch, I would consider skipping steps 1-3

thanks to the boy who stood up for me <3,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11entl0/thanks_to_the_boy_who_stood_up_for_me_3/,2023-02-28 15:40:11,"Was speed-walking to my language review session @ 2 and had to stop at a red light at the intersection of Telegraph and Durant. Man approached me from behind, close enough that I instinctively stepped away. When I turned to look, I saw he was raising his arm like he was about to hit me. I moved forward to put distance between us and avoid getting hit, but I had to step off the curb and walk back-first into the middle of the street b/c he didn’t let up. Thankfully, traffic was slow and the intersection wasn’t very busy. At this point, several people were looking at us and a student (young and wearing a backpack) stepped into the street with me, asked if I knew the man, then told him something to the effect of calm down. Being in my “I’m-late-to-class-must-hurry” mode and also eager to ditch the situation, I quickly walked away. 

Not at all a big deal, I was able to get to class no problem, but I didn’t have the chance to thank that boy, so I want to do it now: I’ve had my fair share of creeps, but I’ve never had one just two feet away from hurting me, and it was very brave of you to step into a green lit street with me. Sorry for not thanking you afterwards. If you're on here, thank you. If you’re not, I’m glad to be putting my appreciation out into the universe anyways.","glad you’re ok!

Cog sci and DS double major as a transfer? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cb7vfv/cog_sci_and_ds_double_major_as_a_transfer/,2024-04-23 08:44:47,"Hi guys I’m seeking some opinions on double majoring. I’ll be entering as a transfer student this fall and I was wondering if cogsci and ds are popular majors taken together. I have completed many of the lower divisions for cogsci, and the ones I haven’t overlap with the ones for DS. I can also have two more upper divisions overlap for the domain emphasis. I’ve also taken classes such as discrete math and linear algebra. 

How is the data science program there? I’m okah at math, and don’t have a strong coding background, I only know a little c++ and python. I wanted to add DS bc a lot of jobs like to see technical skills. 

I already have an associates in psychology so I didn’t want to double major in that. Imo, minors are pretty unless so either I double major or not. ","DS has moved into a different college, so you would have to do a simultaneous major, if you could get into DS as a major.  You would have to apply for DS separately. I would t hold my breath on getting in.
Is it difficult to get in?
No one really knows, since the comprehensive reviews only started this academic year.
Yes especially if you do not have the pre req done already it’s very unlikely for you to get a seat in those classes
I have most of the lower divisions done"
Business Club Ratings + Tea,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/peo2xw/business_club_ratings_tea/,2021-08-30 11:31:22,"Welcome back to school! I recently graduated and wanted to provide an honest but informed perspective of the various business clubs. These opinions are my own so definitely do your own research.

Club recruitment may seem trivial (because it is), but joining the right club can make or break the type of friend group you form, the parties you are invited to, and even the internships/job you attain.

If you feel lost or confused by the club scene, know that you’re not alone. Sproul Plaza always crawls with undifferentiated club salespeople screaming, “interested in \_\_\_?” I remember thinking, “what the f\*\*\* are consulting clubs?” Many of my floormates, however, came from Bay Area feeder schools (MSJHS, Paly, Saratoga, Lynbrook, etc.) and inherited an army of helpful upperclassmen that guided them through club recruitment. They freely received valuable advice I felt was hard to come by. This ranged from which clubs to target to what interview questions to expect. Although I eventually found my footing, I can confidently say the odds were stacked against me and will be the same for many of you. So I write this in hopes of (slightly) uplifting any fellow underdogs out there.

If I were to run the gauntlet again, some of the criteria I would evaluate clubs via:

* **Achievement**: How well do members recruit professionally, and what fields do they recruit best for? Sure, fulltime recruiting is largely an individual pursuit. But if a club consistently recruits well, that may indicate hard-working and professionally oriented members, a robust network that aided them in that journey, and a structured mentorship program to get you off the ground. If that matters to you, of course.
* **Commitment**: What is the club’s expected time commitment on a weekly basis? The standard is generally 10 hours/week, although this can vary significantly.
* **Culture**: How strong is the club’s internal culture? Every club will say their culture is strong. But to cut through the noise, the best proxy is an average members’ tenure. People vote with their feet, and if members truly care about the club, they stick around in meaningful roles. You’ll see clubs with sophomores (or even freshmen!) in leadership, and that is a huge red flag. That means juniors or seniors don’t give a crap and jump ship to focus on other endeavors. If a club’s juniors/seniors show up to events and are running the club, that means they still have a lot to learn/gain, or they just genuinely enjoy being there.
* **Development**: Will you learn a lot and get to work on interesting projects? And how well does the club train and develop its members professionally? This may come in the form of external consulting projects, structured development workshops, etc.
* **Diversity**: How diverse is the academic, ethnic, and professional makeup of the club? This rating will be relative to other clubs, given the disproportionate Asian & Business Major representation in the community. This may be the hardest to pin down accurately.

The broader club landscape and my ratings:

**Business Frats**: I cannot, in good faith, recommend you join a business frat. The pledging process – the process of joining – can be emotionally, verbally, and/or physically abusive. Unless you 100% want to pursue finance, I would advise against business frats.

**Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi)**

* **Achievement**: A, very strong for finance and consulting
* **Commitment**: F, literally your entire life for the first semester but that drops off after pledging
* **Culture**: C, retention is okay but some serious cultural issues similar to DSP
* **Development**: C, real learning is mostly done post-pledging in other clubs or internships
* **Diversity**: D, very little diversity in any category

**Beta Alpha Psi (BAP)**

* **Achievement**: B, mainly finance and consulting but slightly weaker recruiting results than the other two.
* **Commitment**: F, same as above
* **Culture**: C, same as above
* **Development**: C, same as above
* **Diversity**: D, same as above

**Delta Sigma Pi (DSP) / Rho Consulting / Undergraduate Business Group**

* **Achievement**: A, very strong for finance
* **Commitment**: F, same as above
* **Culture**: F, potentially worst among the business frats. They got disbanded due to excessive hazing and have unsuccessfully reformed underground a couple times (hence, the extra names).
* **Development**: C, similar to above
* **Diversity**: F, similar to above but only accepts (intended) business majors

&#x200B;

**Consulting Groups**: IMO, a legit consulting club is great for learning more about business and padding your resume with projects. All of the discussed clubs are fairly well known.

**Berkeley Consulting (BC)**: Oldest consulting club on the block and no specific type of client. Clout chasers and assholes, look no further.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly consulting with some finance and tech. Lot of Bainees this year, but recruiting success varies.
* **Commitment**: D, “pseudo-pledging” your first few semesters - 20-30 hours/week time commitment
* **Culture**: D, potentially the worst culture among consulting clubs. Some members are highly elitist and look down on other clubs and even applicants. They had a mental health workshop due to retention issues and burnout. Not classy.
* **Development**: A, in exchange for large time commitment, members come out well prepared. Projects are arguably the most robust among the clubs.
* **Diversity**: D, leadership diversity has been an issue. 5+ years without a female president. They have improved as of late.

**CMG**: Focused on big clients. They’re more under the radar but very solid as a club.

* **Achievement**: B, mainly finance and consulting. The multi-club members recruit better than CMG-only members, however.
* **Commitment**: B, 10-12 hours/week
* **Culture**: B, culture is generally good. This is where business frat kids go when they don’t like their business frat.
* **Development**: B, learning is generally good. Some very good consumer projects – Nike, Lululemon, Hydro Flask.
* **Diversity**: C, average

**Net Impact Berkeley (NIB)**: Focused on social impact with large companies or nonprofits. Overall very good vibes.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly consulting and SWE/product management. Members lowkey recruit very well.
* **Commitment**: B, 10 hours/week
* **Culture**: A, tied with TBG. Have really only heard positive things. Very social impact-heavy though in case that's not your vibe.
* **Development**: C, very good tech clients – Stripe, Lyft, GoDaddy, but not sure how legit their projects actually are.
* **Diversity**: B, above average

**The Berkeley Group (TBG):** Focused on pro bono projects with nonprofits. Overall very good vibes.

* **Achievement**: B, mainly consulting and SWE. Some members recruit very well, but the average member recruits okay.
* **Commitment**: B, 8-10 hours/week
* **Culture**: A, people are very nice and strong culture. Unfortunately, members pay out of pocket for socials because of pro bono nature, but they’ve been doing more paid projects recently.
* **Development**: B, would be an A for NGO-specific work but doesn’t have as much breadth in terms of clients. If working with nonprofits is your cup of tea, 100% would recommend.
* **Diversity**: B, same as above

**Voyager Consulting**: Focused on big clients, mostly Fortune 500s. Vibes are similar to BC but not as old and stronger reputation among other business clubs right now.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly finance and consulting. Have sent a couple to BCG and other good firms but varies by grade.
* **Commitment**: B, 10-12 hours/week
* **Culture**: C, varies a lot. Some friends really struggled socially in Voyager, but others like it. It can allegedly feel like Mean Girls. If you’re one of the mean girls, then all is well.
* **Development**: B, fairly good learning and very legit projects
* **Diversity**: B, above average

&#x200B;

**Development Clubs**:

**Berkeley Business Society (BBS**): Hybrid between a business frat and a consulting club. Used to be a stepping stone club for the clubs mentioned earlier, but they compete with consulting clubs nowadays. Fairly negative reputation.

* **Achievement**: A, mainly finance and consulting. Very good placement in big firms.
* **Commitment**: C, 15 hours/week if you’re in a project team
* **Culture**: D, people drag BBS culture pretty hard. They had a retention issue because freshmen kept joining for 1 semester just to quit and join a business frat after (they literally chose pledging over BBS lmao). So BBS forced new members (mostly freshmen in their first few weeks of classes) to sign a contract that prevented them from joining other clubs for a full year.
* **Development**: C, very cool clients, but most people I know didn’t learn a whole ton directly from the club.
* **Diversity**: F, referred to as Brown Boys Society, enough said. Send tweet.

**Berkeley Investment Group (BIG)**: The best group to join if you want to learn about investing. This may not be a good fit otherwise.

* **Achievement**: A, very strong alumni placement in finance. One of the few places you’ll see alumni consistently land buyside opportunities.
* **Commitment**: D, 20 hours/week for first semester during internship program and drops to lower amount.
* **Culture**: C, have heard mixed reviews and that it can be a bit snakey.
* **Development**: A, they run a really interesting internship program similar to an Analyst under a PM in a HF. One of the truly differentiated development programs.
* **Diversity**: C, average.

**Undergraduate Finance Association / Undergraduate Management Consulting Group (UFA/UMCG)**: What you get when members of all the clubs decide to make a joint club for extra clout. Low commitment and definitely the best network in Berkeley.

* **Achievement**: A, literally the most hardo of all the other clubs, but UFA-only members are hit/miss for recruiting.
* **Commitment**: A, 2-4 hours/week
* **Culture**: C, there really isn’t a culture tbh. A couple friend groups form, but it exists more for the network.
* **Development**: C, mentorship program, but people don’t feel bought in.
* **Diversity**: D, little to no diversity

&#x200B;

Some other well-known clubs that are probably a tier or two below:

* **180D:** Nice people, but professionalism does not seem strong.
* **ABA**: The oldest business club on campus. I consider this a “first semester club,” meaning it’s a great steppingstone to other clubs. But most people don’t stick around for very long.
* **Phi Beta Lambda (PBL)**: Knock-off ABA
* **Phoenix Consulting:** More low-key, but I’ve heard good things about the culture. Healthcare-focused, so it’s good for premed folks.
* **Venture Strategy Solutions (VSS):** Consulting club focused on startups. They’ve been ahead of the game with diversity initiatives.
* **Valley Consulting Group (VCG):** Tech consulting club focused on large tech companies and startups. Hybrid between a Blueprint/Codebase and a consulting club. Some solid SWE placement, and projects seem more legit now.

I’ll leave it there for now, and I hope that’s helpful for some of you. Feel free to ask additional questions in the comment section, and I’ll try to answer.","UC Berkeley, where we go Greekrank on our consulting clubs

best club for quant finance?
As a senior in the business community at Cal can confirm this seems pretty accurate
[deleted]
Which clubs would be good to apply to as a freshman with no business experience?
Dunno where you got your info from, but BC most definitely recruits on sproul, and the two people I know who are in BC are girls and happy with the club/involved in leadership roles. Both are super down to earth and nice people, maybe you just happened to meet a couple assholes who coincidentally were in the club
I’m in tbg and you actually did a great job in describing the clubs. We actually do pretty well with job placements, but there are less people interested in ib roles than consulting. I also haven’t had to pay dues yet but as we’re pro-Bono we don’t have Amazon giving us a bunch of $ for projects but since our mission is to help non-profits that don’t have the funding to hire McKinsey not being as wealthy as the other clubs is not really a priority.
a - this is sad

b - this is clearly written by someone who is not involved in the business community at Cal

c - pretty much all of the listed clubs are great; people should join whatever club has the people they like the most
Cringe LMFAO — over half of this information is verifiably false or purely speculatory. 

OP and the nature of this post are exactly everything that’s wrong with club culture at Berkeley. Deafeningly ironic and absolutely hilarious.
What are good social orgs where I can meet genuine people and not have to go through the rigorous application process of these clubs
First off, thank you so much for sharing! So glad I came across your post. 

Are there any clubs for Accounting focused students planning to get CPA?

I'll dm you!
I'd probably join a SWE club like Blueprint, Codebase, etc.. There are a couple people who break in from business clubs but not many.
https://traders.berkeley.edu/
if you are asking for a club about quant finance you probably aren't smart enough to get in. I interned at one of citadel/2sig/hrt/js, feel free to dm me
Check out traders @ Berkeley
CIB has a quant team, and I think BIG might as well
Realistically a tech club will be way better than any finance club on campus if you’re focused on quant
TBG: That's fair. It's very subjective, and regardless, members placing well does not mean you will nor should care all that much.

BC: Again, my opinion, but having friends in BC + a BC member literally writing this in her own [Medium article](https://amandaychen.medium.com/i-dont-dream-of-labor-and-other-thoughts-on-graduation-c34cadc9158f):

>the next one-and-a-half year or so felt like one big blurry haze. It completely subsumed me. **I spent almost every waking minute with them: working, drinking, traveling, rinse and repeat**. Friends from home made fun of me, saying I was in a cult, but I didn’t care, they didn’t know what it was like  
>  
>\---  
>  
>I had been convinced by members only a few years older than I was that there were only three acceptable careers available for “someone like me,” or in other words, people like us, **where it was implied that we were special and somehow more deserving of these opportunities than others.** **Turns out they never thought that highly of me anyways.**

In regards to hourly time commitments, that's def a good point. But hopefully they're close enough to the range that it's helpful for people to know. I might have underestimated a couple, but I'm confident in BC, BIG, + the business frats
They all accept freshmen! I would highly recommend any of the consulting clubs or an ABA/180D for your first semester. 

Not having previous experience is totally okay - you’re just a freshman! But it’s important to demonstrate why you’re interested by connecting past experiences.
I'm sure there are nice people in BC and agree people I've met are probably outliers.

And while they do table, I'm referring to how they don't actively approach candidates and the reason behind that.

Regardless, your point is well taken and I removed the sprouling part.
Thanks for the kind words and I def believe that. Huge respect, TBG does great work.
Unjustifiably calling > half of this post false or purely speculatory is ironically speculative. Please feel free to identify which parts you'd like more clarification on or believe to be untrue.

Some will disagree. But freshmen joining toxic and falsely advertised clubs seems reductive and not okay. I'd much rather be called ""deafeningly ironic.""
There are a ton! A lot of are affinity groups or have some sort of specialty. IMO, best approach is to go to Sproul, Calpalooza, and the other various groups and just talk with people to see who you like the most. Best of luck!

Fun thought experiment — try sourcing some of this information yourself and seeing what percent of claims lead back to ""something my friend said."" You will find much of this information, if not more than half of it, is purely subjective. 

And just to be clear, I have absolutely no doubt that some of these orgs have done terrible things, have bad diversity, or are stale social settings. I myself hated business organizations during my time on campus.

However, to present this set of information with the goal of 'protecting freshmen from false advertising' is what I do not agree with. The irony comes in where you present subjective information, as learned from peer-to-peer interaction, as worthy of transition into analytical information.

Essentially, the real irony I am trying to point out is this: 

**What you intended as the antithesis of false advertising became false advertising itself.** I do not make this argument on the premise that the information you presented is entirely *incorrect*, but rather that the information you presented is largely *untrue.* 

Anyways it was nice chatting OP, but anything outside of our scheduled time will be billed (consulting joke). Have a good one and try not to take it too personally—I'm sure this was a blast to write. From one armchair warrior to the other, good day.
That's fair. But you still need to show you're technical in some way for trading. Quant dev is obv less appealing than trading but is slept on imo.
if you want to get into trading or quant finance your accomplishments and what you can do become more important than what clubs youre in, unless you count being an olympiad finalist in math, physics, or cs a ""club"".

Get a 3.8+ in hard technical classes including grad level classes, do research, get competitive top internships, place in competitions, etc. Being in a frat won't help you seem more impressive when your competition is from a much more prestigious club called the ivy league/stanford/mit.

I'm just gonna put it out right now though that you sound kinda like an insufferable freshman and you'll find that the people who make it have a much bigger spike in maths/physics/cs than you, or are much more well rounded than you, even in areas outside of academics. It's good that you have your sights set on what you want early but if you think you're hot shit for taking half a dozen AP classes and getting 5s on the tests, you're in for some self esteem blows if your sights are set high because while the average berkeley student might me just above average, the people you're competing against are not.
Lol such an arrogant freshman. If you think you are hot shit just for going to Berkeley you need to lower your ego lmao. When I say you aren't smart enough to get in I don't mean the club, I mean breaking into actual quant. No trading company cares if you are an officer at ""Berkeley Quant Club"", they care if you are smart and good at programming/math/stats. Good luck
Ofc! Best of luck and hope you find the best fit for you :)
These are good points! Agreed that people should do their own research
I know my limits as someone who knows quite a few usamo qualifiers (and other olympiad finalists) personally from misc math/science comps in high school (think like hmmt) that did end up in the quant space.
I guess the idea of making friends at a club is foreign to you. No surprise given your toxic personality. Grow a dick and post these comments on your real Reddit account you coward.
I have plenty of friends and I also make way too much money. Hint: clubs want chill people to hang out with, not people who immediately start raging on reddit. Good luck
you are the most sad person I’ve seen on this app. Imagine needing to tell strangers online that you have plenty of friends and too much money, looking for validation. And you call yourself “chill”. 😭😭😭. What’s wrong, you can’t take some smoke? Go on ur main account."
How many people here still got admitted despite not meeting condition of admissions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12z0sba/how_many_people_here_still_got_admitted_despite/,2023-04-25 17:13:52,"Transfers preferably since that’s what I am. 

I’m 24, veteran, 3.84 GPA, 73 credits (5 pending), L&S admit (psych major). I’m currently only taking Calc I this spring. It’s NOT to meet IGETC or transfer requirements since I already took Stats which meets the quantitative reasoning requirement. I’m taking Calc because I want to get a masters in CS or related field eventually. 

My condition of admission says that I must finish the spring semester with a 3.0 GPA and no individual course grade below a C. 

That’s kinda confusing because I need a B to get a 3.0. But technically, I can get a C and still not have an individual course grade below a C. But I’m gonna assume that the GPA takes higher precedence so a B is needed. 

There’s a good chance I finish with a C in this class. We have 2 tests left (last chapter and one cumulative). The final is on May 12th. But we have to message admissions an update if we don’t meet any of our conditions by May 15th. 

I’m tempted to just tell them the situation now that I might not get a B in calculus just so I have a clear answer if they’re rescinding my admission or not. I wanna get housing secured ASAP. 

I’m just curious to see if it’s common for people to not meet conditions and still get accepted. As a mid 20s veteran, I’ve done a bit to get here and it’s crazy to think that an off class (my first C) would ruin it all.","I dropped 3 classes that didn't affect my major or IGETC. They sent back an email saying no problem. 

Just fill out the form and let them know the situation.
Transferred to Chem Bio in the College of Chem and I got a C in calc 3. The Prof was super absent and cancelling OH. I went to the dean and he promised me that if for some reason Cal wanted to rescind my offer they would change my grade. No one even blinked an eye, or noticed at Cal. I needed calc 3 because I had to take linear algebra and diff equations next. Point is, I’m sure you will be fine.
I am in the similar situation right now. Have you gotten any response back?
Psych isn’t an impacted major, nobody in the humanities is going to last long in the real world and industry because they have no actual skills to offer
 
Getting into Berkeley humanities isn’t saying a lot. You are acting way to confident in yourself…
Might be better to drop the class than risk not meeting the conditions?
I was in a sorta-ish similar boat. You’ll be ok just keep them in the loop asap
I was missing a class, and they let me take it during the summer. I also dropped one class which was in my conditions and they still said that’s okay. I just kept writing them and explaining my situation.
In a similar situation, i probably won't meet the 3.0 req (I'm taking 4 stem classes), will pass with no less than a C. My CC school releases grades on June 15th. I think I might just wait and update them on June 15. I doubt they would resend it that late, like I would probably get a housing contract before my transcripts release.
This makes me feel a lot better thanks
Also congrats! Sounds like you’ve worked hard! Don’t let idiots dissuade you of that.
Did you have under a 3.0 your final term?
I just sent an update form, which I believe goes right to our assigned admissions officer. Hopefully at least. 

But I did send a generic question to the admissions office about me getting a C in calc but not getting the 3.0 because it’s a C. They told me I have to send the update form unfortunately. 

Are you a vet too??
Unnecessary response and disrespectful.
If I drop it now then it’s a WF or withdraw failing.
From high school or CC?
any update??
[deleted]
Also am a vet! Good job getting into Cal!
For the final semester? I doubt it because it was only that class I received a C while I was taking two other heavy STEM classes and did well. So I think it was more like a 3.33.
Yea got the same response this would suck if they recend
It’s the honest truth tho, who the fuck thinks there is a future in going into the humanities
Also, talk to your professor,  ask about extra credit or anything you can do to squeeze a few extra points. Let them know your situation and the possible consequences. 

But again, even if that's not possible, I don't think Cal will take away your admission. I've not heard once of someone getting theirs taken back.
Cc
No issue going to enroll in classes tmr
As great of a teacher my professor is, she has a very “your grade is the reflection of your work” philosophy. I emailed her already about the situation but I didn’t really mention anything about the dire consequences. I had a tough week since I work full time and bouncing between days and nights. 

So I sent another email similar to this Reddit post about the magnitude of this grade is to me and its consequences. I just have to see how she responds to that. 

As a fellow vet, then you know how much shit we’ve already been through and put up with lol. I would be in disbelief if this one course diminishes everything else I’ve done. I’m hopeful of course but right now I need a strong message saying things will be good.
Still fill out that admissions change form in your portal. There are a few options you can select. Select what is best.  Then, there is a dialog box to explain the situation to Cal. Do that ASAP. 

BEST OF LUCK~ See you on campus!"

Required 61C knowledge for CS 162,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bat6it/required_61c_knowledge_for_cs_162/,2024-03-09 13:47:24,I took the equivalent of 61C at community college and don’t have to take it at Cal. Tbh the class sucked and it’s just basically some x86 assembly. What do I need to know from 61C to do well in 162 other than learn C.,162 is mostly self contained so long as you have a vague concept for how CPUs and caches work (do you know what a TLB is? Do you know how set associative caches work?) and are decently proficient at C.
Transferring out of Berkeley to pursue CS,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18qza2g/transferring_out_of_berkeley_to_pursue_cs/,2023-12-25 20:06:53,"Currently a cogsci major (fall ‘23 transfer admit) looking to double major in CS/DS. I’m on track to attempt to declare CS thus far, but in the case it doesn’t work out due to my lack of 3.3 average, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub has experience with transferring from UCB to another school to pursue CS…

CS minor: not entirely sure this will work out due to lack of enrollment priority, I’d only be able to take courses during the summers, which may end up taking a few years

DS double major: I don’t think this is feasible at all because according to the website, I would have to complete Linear Algebra, Data 8, and 61B all by the end of the spring semester….maybe it’s possible? Not sure, I took 61A this past fall and didn’t find it too difficult, but had difficulty maintaining calc 3 alongside it and had to drop (hence why I don’t think I’d be able to manage declaring DS alongside cogs)

DS minor: worst case/most feasible scenario. Not a bad option at all, but I’m really looking for the same opportunities as a CS major, which I’m aware a DS major or CS minor come close to offering


In sum: I need another option. If I can complete the lower div reqs for a CS minor here at Cal (61A/B/C/70), can I transfer to another university to complete the major?

Yes, I’ve talked to a CS advisor about this and they weren’t sure….they brought up the possibility of doing an extension program at another university (not entirely sure what that is)","Can you take a summer class towards your declaration for cs? Or is that reserved for 70?

Could also do linalg at a CC and do data8/61b in spring.

It will likely work out, I think you'll be able to declare.
I read through most of the comments on the massive comment thread but wasn't sure where to add this given the children comments just kinda collapsed from the parent comment, so I'm just making the following a separate comment: the LACCD has numerous Linear Algebra courses online (MATH 270) and CS 61B equivalents (CS 216/CS 136). I'm not sure if I read it correctly that you'd have to transfer in 61B, too, or take it here, but they're available. As a matter of fact, LACCD has a 5-week winter term with Linear Algebra still available with a few open sections starting January 2nd, in case this is of any interest. You can apply to any of the 9 LACCD campuses in less than 10 minutes, and after you're admitted, you can cross register courses within any of the 9 campuses. It's super convenient and a very streamlined, straightforward process. Hope any of this was resourceful!
hey idk if you have any conditions but if you have anxiety diabetes depression adhd etc get on dsp asap. u get priority enrollment
I’m actually considering doing this right now (totally different reasons though but shouldn’t matter) I came in originally as philosophy and cogsci but I found that cs was just so intellectually stimulating for me I wanted to switch it was the first time I had ever really been challenged before what I’m planning on doing is leaving for a year tops and then reapplying during the summer (I think it takes like a week for them to reach a decision) and if they no I’m hoping to go to maybe Cornell you could try the same thing if you can’t declare in time never hurts to try
Yeah I’m gonna be doing 70 next summer to try to declare…and even if I do linalg at CC, I’m not sure if I’d be able to handle the workload tbh. I’m a returning student (24) and I’ve found that I kinda have to take a reduced course load to do well (at least for now, while I get up to speed), but if it really is manageable in the eyes of the general population, then I’m always up for a challenge)
I just registered and am waiting for confirmation…thanks a ton, this was very helpful!! Being able to get this course done in 5 weeks will be hard but very convenient lol

So to confirm, I can only cross-register courses after I’ve been accepted to one of the colleges? (I applied to LACC)
I appreciate the advice - I’m already on DSP but didn’t realize the timeline required to add DS and now I’m scrambling to find data 8 and LA equivalent courses at CCs 😭
The way you described CS is exactly how I feel - 61A really intellectually stimulated me unlike any other course and I kinda loved it and wanna chase that problem-solving high lol

Unfortunately I’m not sure reapplying to uni from CC is an option that’s on the table right now, hence why I was wondering about the possibility of transferring universities
Nah do a reduced course load if you can.

You need what like a C in data8 and linalg for declaring data sci, and a B+ in 61b. So you do the reduced course load and focus on 61b and passing data8, which isn't too bad, and all you need to do is pass linalg at a CC. (Assuming they will take it which I think they will, check w an advisor). 

Math 54 at CC was easy. That semester will be a lot and I would recommend putting a lot of energy in, but you could guarantee a spot in data sci. 

Then you have data sci as a solid backup, and can do 70 in the summer. If that doesn't work out you could weigh your options then rather than now.
wait if ur dsp you have the priority registration you are fine
use assist.org!
Wait but I would have to do all in the spring right…lin Alg, B, and 8…? Where does the reduced course load factor in? To clarify, I have to complete all of these by the end of spring, so if you meant that I do Lin alg over the summer, I’m not sure that’ll work
Data 8 is closed though
Linear algebra at CC and then take 61b and data 8 here
u can’t do stat 20?
In the same semester (spring ‘24)?
I can! I didn’t realize until I just checked the website after reading your comment…didn’t realize i could substitute it given the fact that I’ve already done 61A…should be able to get in. Thanks !!
Yes
ok…I don’t think my CC offers linear algebra separately from differential equations, and I think that course is only offered in person so I’d definitely need to apply to take LA at a different CC.

That being said, do you think 61B, data 8, and Lin alg are manageable in the same semester ?
Yeah data 8 is free. Linear algebra shouldn’t be that bad at CC. Then it leaves you with 61B.
Yeah I mean if the strategy is to declare you're gonna be aiming for passing lin and data8 and pouring yourself into 61b to try to get an A- so you have a gpa buffer for 70. 

The next like 8 months will be a lot of work, but you can optimize and focus on 61b while working just hard enough to pass the other two. Pretty much guaranteed a spot in data sci this way imo. 

I think if I was you I would shoot for it, 'leave it all on the field' so to speak.
Gotcha, thanks. Is the fact that I haven’t done calc in about a year relevant if I decide to take LA in the spring? Also, I’ve heard that the DS major has a lot of overlap with the CS major and thus access to CS upper divs won’t be an issue… is that so? Sorry, off topic but since you’re replying I figured I’d ask 😹

A better way to phrase the first question given my scenario:

How does 61B + Linear Algebra at CC compare, in terms of workload/difficulty/overall manageability, to 61A + Calc 3 at Berkeley?
That sounds good, I think this is the way. Thanks for your help! 

AFAIK, there isn’t a GPA requirement (besides the standard 2.0) for the courses required to declare DS, right ?
Hey you can easily go to another community college and take it online. It takes like 5 min to register. 

De Anza or Foothill for example has linear algebra by itself completely online every semester, it’s a quarter system too so it’s shorter.

CC 61B and lin alg is way way easier than anything at Cal and also doesn’t affect ur Berkeley GPA.

Only a few colleges like Evergreen offer it fully tho
You def need to check with an advisor ASAP and make sure they'll take your CC lin algebra and the 2.0 average. 

Just keep grinding and when in doubt grind away at 61b so you have a strong chance at CS. You might have no life but imo it's totally worth it to get a degree in a field you are interested in from this school. 

Good luck!
I just noticed that all the LA courses at De Anza are full! If I took it in the spring quarter (ending June 28), do you know if that would count towards my eligibility to declare DS given that DS requires completion of the lower div reqs by the “end of the second term” for transfers ? I know it’s a shot in the dark but I figured I’d ask, I’ll definitely be talking to a counselor.
Yes I’ll definitely talk to an advisor! Thanks for your help! I don’t see it is “having no life” because I’m actually getting quite interested in the field and investing in a quality future is what I consider having a life! Lmao
I would honestly guess no, but I’d talk to an advisor anyways. 

If I was you I’d schedule an appointment and look at every quarter system CC for linear algebra. There will undoubtedly be some open, De Anza and Foothill are just popular because they have the highest acceptance rates to top UCs

And just as a side note if you can’t be a CS major you can still CS minor with CS61C online at CC, DATA C100 and NWMEDIA 203 during normal semester, and 1 CS class in summer
That sounds good, I appreciate you!
NP, just wanted to add as a last note that transferring after already transferring from CC might not be ideal.

A cog sci degree at Berkeley makes more money 6 months post-grad than a CS degree at every UC that isn’t UCLA. 

You can also do applied math which is the 3rd highest earning major after EECS and LS CS at Cal and just as good. Good luck with everything!
Yeah I agree and I hate to say this because it’s so cliche, but it isn’t about the money for me. Everyone I know in cogsci goes into consulting, product management, research, or psych-related fields, none of which I’m particularly interested in. I’ve only recently begun to form a real interest in computing and want to chase that because of the opportunities that exist (video game programming, robotics, etc)
Ah ok. Then if you have that dog in you, you can succeed without the pure CS major (but you’ll likely declare). 

I’d say transfer out again if you *really* wanna take CS classes, but not for post-grad opportunities.
Shoot I kinda have that dawg in me, but what I’ve found is that actually getting into the classes I need is a bigger roadblock to my success than the classes themselves 😭😂"
accepted to berkeley but given conditions of admission they know i didn’t meet already ? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cclqn7/accepted_to_berkeley_but_given_conditions_of/,2024-04-25 00:15:42,"hi so i got accepted as a cc transfer for fall after straight a’s in fall 2023 and a D in a non major, non prereq, non igetc, non essential skills winter 2024 class. was a really bad accelerated online asynchronous course with a terrible professor and i explained in the TAU and told them about the D. the weird thing is in my conditions of admission it says that i can’t get lower than a C in any in progress or planned courses or have lower than a 3.0 gpa in the winter intersession, and listed that already completed course i got a D in as one of those courses. feels like i’m waiting on hearing they’re gonna rescind my acceptance for the D even though they definitely should know about it being there in the TAU for super long. tbh would be a slap in the face if i didn’t do anything wrong and it was just overlooked. i submitted a undergraduate admissions update a couple days ago, and then another one the day after with a little more explanation. it wasn’t even that in depth so i think i’ll call too. i just feel a bit in the dark waiting rn as deadlines to enroll approach, so wanted to ask has this ever happened to anyone, do you think i’m gonna get rescinded, or am i overreacting and should just wait and see?  

also just got my tag rejected from ucsb because of the d so cal definitely got my update lol 
","Can you update us please same situation here
Hi OP,

Which department are you transferring into? We've definitely got a good number of transfers that had Ds and Cs just before transferring, but I'm not sure that they all had those conditions to follow. If you'd like to reach out to more transfer students, here is the active Discord: [https://discord.gg/rPp7QgwgNy](https://discord.gg/rPp7QgwgNy)

Come say hi, and I hope you are able to get in.
I didn't meet the conditions of admission and nothing happened to me lol. I wouldn't take a chance on it of course, tell the admissions staff ASAP.
I got a d in an art class my last semester of cc, just told them and nothing happened
I think Im gonna fail my math class and I think I’m going to do an EW- I’m scared for getting rescinded
Hey I’m in the same boat but I’m a physics major. I was sent the cancellation email last week and I has just recently submitted the appeal. Any advice on how to assure my acceptance is sustained ?
just heard back, offer of admission was sustained :)
thank you that’s really nice of you!! and im transferring into the l&s geography major which gives me some hope about it too all things considered
what do you think I should do if my bio grade will be dependent on my final?? the final is before the SIR deadline :( so when I get my grades in June....and if I get a D....I should tell them asap? as you can see this is a very scary situation for me :( the bio class (with a lab) is an igetc requirement. but my other grades are good, I have over 60 transferable units, and I am a spring admit ...
did you receive the cancellation email after your sir deadline??
I honestly don't know what might happen to you. I was basically in the exact same situation as you (got a D in a class, didn't meet conditions of admission) and they let me in. But I'm talking to someone else on reddit now who was just denied for a much less important reason (small change in schedule). It's possible they started to crack down more on this since I was a freshman.
No the deadline is June 1st.
Ohh i see , so your grade dropped even though the semester hasn’t ended yet so you told them immediately?
This is from a winter class. So when I got my acceptance letter I had to tell them. When I sent the schedule update I never got a response that was April 22. Then on May 13 they sent a notice of cancellation because I had violated one of my conditions of admission and said I had three days to appeal. I appealed and haven’t heard anything yet. 

I spoke with the professor of the class and she is in full support of changing the grade from a D to an excused withdrawal (EW). However she says she cannot do it from her end and I have to wait to see what admissions at my school says.
Ahh okay I see I see. I hope everything goes well for you. In my situation, I need to pass my final thats on May 31st. And it’s honestly been eating at me because I haven’t submitted an SIR. I want to see if I pass in order to SIR to Berkeley …if not I’ll have to choose a different uc who sort of guarantees that they’ll accept me even with a low grade. There’s so much pressure and worry. And it sucks because I’m graduating cc and getting awards and I can’t celebrate any of that, I don’t feel happy . And I’ve never felt so uncertain . This is stressful.
do you mind me asking how you’re feeling ? 
200% I understand you. First off you will pass your finals so don’t even sweat that. As for the graduation stuff , I get it. I am just trying to make the best of it. Just focus on finals and enjoy your graduation when it comes. Everything will work out in the end!
No problem. Honestly it’s extremely stressful and overwhelming. I feel almost like I haven’t done anything to warrant this and I only try to do my best during a difficult time. It’s difficult for me to communicate my situation because of this. 
Right now I am also very sad because like many others I have worked extremely hard for this and I have finally been given an opportunity that can really change my life. 

I just don’t really know why my admissions office is giving me a hard time is change this grade to an excused withdrawal. I wish I could have done it sooner so when I first submitted my update I could have indicated that instead of a D but it has been a month long battle so for with my school to change the grade. I have gotten the professor to formally petition for me so I hope my grade is reviewed fairly this time by admissions and I hope I can forward this information to UCB in time. 

I am also worried I may not be able to transfer as deadlines for as I is June 1"

","Can you go to your AP teacher and explain the situation?

They also saw that I demonstrated a strong work ethic prior to the F grade in their class so I assume they may have helped. I truly am sorry to hear about the passing and recent layoff. Please take care of yourself    As an aside OP, I am sorry to hear about this. If you want to talk further please DM me lol
I graduated from Cal last semester. I was in the same exact position as you, D in AP Calc AB. You won't get rescinded just send them an explanation on your portal, and they'll get back to you saying you're good.
I am speculating here, but if it is not a pre-req class, you might be ok. For starters, your grade isn't final so there's nothing to report yet. If you can talk with your calc teacher a little honesty, humility, and commitment can sometimes go a long way.

Once you get your final grade, that's when you should decide whether you need to submit the update form. (Which I would do sooner than later and if it's possible to include details, do so.)

In any case, for your own piece of mind, I would call Berkeley admissions and let them know what's happening. They will advise you. Don't be afraid to call them, they aren't going to pull your admit just for asking.
youre gonna be fine. talk to your admissions officer. it is a very common occurence."

How hard is applied math here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1chhu71/how_hard_is_applied_math_here/,2024-05-01 02:26:48,"I recently got admitted to the college of l&s under an intended major of applied math. I’m currently debating doing between this option or attending UCR for mechanical engineering. I’m very unsure what I want to do with my career, all I know is that I want to to something related to stem on the math side. I feel like for most, Berkeley would be the obvious choice in this dilemma however I’m really worried that I wont perform well academically here. For context, in high school I averaged Bs in all my math classes and Calc Bc was truly a humbling experience since I had a C for most of the semester, even with studying 10+ hours for exams. Because of my struggles with high school math, I feel like I won’t cut it at Berkeley so feel deterred. I also am interested in transferring into the college of engineering for bioeng but I know how difficult it is to transfer into this department here and I don’t know if I have what it takes to get the gpa necessary to even have a shot at transferring. If anyone has any insight on what to do, please help:) also side note, Berkeley is actually the cheaper option as I received more financial aid than UCR (I don’t know how that’s possible lol)","As an applied math major, I'm going to be honest: a good chunk of people I knew ended up switching out of applied math. If you're already struggling with high school math, you're going to have a very difficult time with applied math here.



That being said, UC Berkeley is a prestigious school with plenty of other good STEM majors to consider, and I'm not sure if you should lose that opportunity just because applied math might not work out. The nice thing about L&S in particular is that you are expected to branch out and explore different potential fields rather than sticking to one thing right away. This could be a good opportunity for you to figure out what exactly it is you want to study, and the fact that it's cheaper for you is also a bonus.
honestly, if you're a B math student in high school, berkeley will eat you up alive, spit you out, and eat you again for good measure.  with that said, if you put in the work and try your absolute best - meaning a attending office hours, labs, and basically annoying the heck out of your GSIs with questions - you'll get your B average and you'll graduate.
You may need more time to shore up your skills and figure out what you need to do. 

Go to CC, if you still like Cal, transfer in. Nearly all the transfers I knew were generally much happier with their time and experience than many of the people who started as froshes. Just my two cents. 

You really won't miss much other than some pretty low quality lower div classes. The upper divs and grad school are where Cal actually shines.
its brutal i dropped cs + applied for cs + ds
It’s harder than Oskis….
the problem is transferring in is almost as hard as getting in as a freshman.  i don't what it is now, but i think it was in the low 20 percent when i did it.
I disagree with this sentiment. Assuming finances aren’t an issue, the college experience is such a valuable thing and it’s just not the same for transfers. Also there are certain opportunities that are much more difficult to get as a transfer student. If they’ve been accepted and have the means to do four years at Berkeley I feel that’s a much better option. Besides, L&S gives a lot of flexibility so it’s not a bad place to explore options
I am going to respectfully disagree. 

Your first two years, unless you're truly interested in Greek Life or other activities that do benefit from all four to five years, are going to be spent pretty much in low quality lower division classes that'll drag down your GPA and just generally leave you feeling like: ""This is Cal?""

The classes I took were so uniformly bad, (taught by GSIs that had no business teaching, the way to get an A or B was pretty much just agree with the instructor, or were brutal weeders that were difficult for no reason than to be brutally difficult), that I seriously considered transferring after my first year. 

If I hadn't taken a couple really great upper division classes my second year, I probably would have completed that transfer, because the first one I took my first semester second year was also pretty goddamned bad. 

 Also, ""exploring"" when I attended was not really an option. 

You had to basically start fulfilling requirements from Day One with little opportunity to branch out when I attended because every L&S major required at least 16 units of subject classes minimum. Many required 28. 

Also, if you came in with AP Credits, you couldn't really use a lot of them at the time and were forced to retake classes, but it still counted against your unit cap and I received several threatening letters and emails saying unless I declared a major/intent and completed the course work to declare, I would have my registration blocked and might even need to complete my education elsewhere.

If that has changed -- I'm very glad to hear it, but I will still continue to advise people STRONGLY to go to CC first and transfer in."
My math class,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/17jkxau/my_math_class/,2023-10-29 21:01:06,"Hello,
I am taking this math class and I just need to pass it with a C, and I will have a 95 going into the final which is worth 20%. My motivation for calculus is gone and this is the last math class I’ll ever have to take and I don’t want tk take the final. Is this okay? Thanks!","Some classes, you have to take the final in order to not fail. That could mean just showing up and writing your name on it and turning it in blank or with doodles all over it, but no-showing can sometimes mean you fail even if your grade is passing still. Why not just show up and take it, but not stress about studying? See how you do with no prep
I mean yeah, you can choose to not take the final, but why not take it? I get it, finals are annoying, whatever, but it's three hours of your life, and why not end the class with an A or a B instead of a C?
Is it Calc 1 or 2?
Talk to your professor or gsi about your passing grade and what are the consequences of your final exam score will be in affecting your final grade.
Take the final. Finish strong. You'll be glad you did.
Why would you not finish strong? If I were you, I'd be less worried about a C or B- and more worried about the lack of a killer finishing instinct.
[removed]
That’s literally your fault
Ooh that is a good idea! Just sort of go into it with no stress. That is a great idea!
That is true 
Thank you!
Calc 2! I am an Econ major and I have gotta A’s in all of the other pre requisites so this wouldn’t tabk my GPA under the needed 3.0
Ok great, thank you!
Not online and that would be cheating but thanks for the offer!

Oh ok!"
Torn Between UCSB vs. UC Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dby8n8/torn_between_ucsb_vs_uc_berkeley/,2024-06-09 09:49:48,"I am torn between attending UCSB as an Economics and Accounting major or a (non-Haas) Economics major at UC Berkeley. I would be attending as a transfer student in my second-year of college. I want to be honest and thoughtful in my deliberation and consider these two options in the context of accounting, looking beyond arbitrary ranking and prestige. My goal is to become a CPA and I would greatly appreciate insight/advice to ensure I can make an informed decision. Thank you!

**BOTH**

* Comparable in-state cost of attendance
* Questionable housing

**UCSB:**

* Economics and Accounting major (fulfills CPA educational reqs), likely to graduate on time b/c I should be able to get my classes since I’m that major 
* Big 4 recruitment target (not sure if comparable to UCB but I’d like to work in the Bay Area after graduation)
* Seems like there are more school-based accounting opportunities, e.g., has an official accounting society, etc. than UCB
* Susceptible to homesickness

**UC Berkeley:**

* Non-Haas Economics major (can fulfill CPA educational reqs as long as I get all of my classes as planned, which is uncertain since the CPA accounting reqs are housed in the Haas Business School and they don’t give priority registration for my major), may not graduate on time given non-priority registration of CPA accounting required courses
* I think it’s also a Big 4 recruitment target but would be happy to be corrected if wrong. The only advantage I could think of is it may be easier to secure post-grad opportunities in the Bay if companies recruit locally
* Seems there’s a bigger consulting/finance culture and I couldn’t find school-based opportunities to join for during the school year. Again, please correct me if this isn’t true 
* Closer to home","To put it in perspective, I was a transfer student who got into UCSB and Cal for economics. I chose Cal.

I have a friend who didn’t get into Cal but got into UCSB for Econ. He’s a super intelligent student and deserves the same opportunities I’ve received. However, because he goes to UCSB, the recruiting for any field in Econ or finance is genuinely not great. He struggles to get into an interview room, while I, no better than him, have gotten dozens of opportunities and potentially have a job lined up in IB (provided I do well in my internship). This is mainly because of the school I attend and the connections it has in the corporate world and its reputation for producing intelligent and hard working individuals.

I firmly believe in doing what you want to do, but in this case, I strongly advise you to choose Berkeley for your economics degree.
Cal>>>
In what world does UCSB beat out Berkeley for recruiting into... anything. Ultimately, what matters is the networking and experiences (clubs, internships) that you have under your belt, but Cal is a wholehearted target school for Big 4/MBB for sure, and you will definitely have access to better resources here. That's not to dog on UCSB, since post-grad opportunities are also great with them too. As they are still a top California school, you would definitely have a great time recruiting in the Bay Area and SoCal levels, but in the realm of finance nationwide, Berkeley is several magnitudes more prestigious in that field. If you're only looking to work in Bay Area, then the difference will not be too pronounced, but it will still be noticeable, especially since Berkeley would then be geographically closer too.
Cal. Name matters
Berkeley.  No contest.
UC Berkeley and it’s not even close
Cal. As someone who just graduated as a transfer (not a related major), but I can speak to how going to cal just gets you in the room places.
Is there a single advantage to attending UCSB for you?
Did you get off a waitlist? Because the SIR was June 1st. If you haven’t submitted your SIR, you might have an entirely different issue on your hands.
lol you gotta aim higher than Big 4 if you went to Berkeley.
Given the timing of when you’re asking this question, have you been accepted to either of these schools?
... There's no way this is not a sh*t post
If you just want to become a CPA and work at Big 4 audit, just go to UCSB
Like someone else said, school name matters as fucked as that might be for other people who attend “lower tier” institutions. The Cal brand will get you in the door.
How’d you get IB internships? What classes did you take and what do you need to know
I mena except for CCS(accelerated honors program wonderful for people into academia), UCSB has no merit at all compared to Cal
Sb is gaining its traction lately because connections with DTLA corporation world too

still kinda lonely??,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xu3dxh/still_kinda_lonely/,2022-10-02 16:37:49,i found ppl to hang out with like maybe once a week individually but im not anyone’s first choice ig and im kinda struggling with that 😭 i don’t know how everyone else did it. i wanna hike big c and take cute pics and go to sf and have ppl text me for more than just hw answers yk,"it takes time to develop good friendships. continue meeting people and pursuing activities and interests both independently and at group events.  finding people to truly “get” you and be present for your journeys takes time, practice and effort.  being lonely sucks, it makes social rejection hurt way more than it would if you had more social connections. Unfortunately the only way out of it is to push through some rejection until you meet the right people.
Literally in the exact same position, I don’t have any actual friends to turn to and be like hey wanna hang out? It’s kinda frustrating when I see other freshmen with seemingly fully formed friend groups doing stuff all the time while im by myself lol
I hear you. Things you can do help yourself:

* Move into a social living situation, like the frats or the coops. (I lived in the coops.)

* Join a club focused on some activity you enjoy, with people you like.

* Take ""social"" classes that allow you to make friends, e.g. classes that involve camping and other group or people-focused activities.

Good luck!
[deleted]
i mean you’re not entitled to be anyone’s first choice. hanging out with people once a week is actually pretty good, considering how busy everyone is. if you wanna hike big c, initiate the plans. if you wanna go to sf, initiate the plans. you want people to text you about something other than hw, text them first

it doesn't get better, trust me kid. they see you piss in the sproul fountain once and you're a pariah. tried making buddies at kip's and it was a no go. just admit defeat my little chump.
I found that people wanted to hang out with me a lot more when I started giving out casual handies on BART. Just a thought.

For Current Students: What is something you heard about Berkeley that turned out to be completely true and/or false? (In your experience),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tpn5ib/for_current_students_what_is_something_you_heard/,2022-03-27 09:12:51,"A bunch of kids have just been admitted (congrats btw!!!) and I’m sure they’ve heard a bunch of stuff about Berkeley, true or false. I’m hoping this thread helps them determine what to take into account when deciding where to go to school. 

This is what I heard when I graduated high school in 2018: (sorry, I’m Berkeley Haas c/o ‘22) 

True: 1. Going to Berkeley will be the best decision you’ve ever made 2. Sports are not a major focus of the school and there isn’t a ton of “school spirit” around sports 3. The school is highly competitive 

False: 1. As a result of that competitiveness, other students will frequently try to cheat and snake you. 2. There’s never time to have any fun

I love Berkeley (and was deciding between here and Ohio State), and would honestly recommend any admitted student come here. You will not regret it.","Classes can be hard but honestly just like in highschool if you work hard and put time in it you will be able to overcome the courses. Fearing the first few intro classes just because they’re hard won’t make sense because you will eventually be taking bigger upper division courses later on in your career
True:
Other people (especially older adults/employers) bend over backwards when they hear the name Berkeley. The prestige on a name level is something I expected, but not to such an extreme extent! 

False:
Berkeley is super competitive and people will do anything to get ahead. First part is true, but not so much the second. Classes are not impossible (usually :) ) and classmates are there to help you, not see you fail. Even if it’s hard, there’s always someone/some resource you can turn to. People make it sounds more cutthroat than it really is.
I think there’s a lot of spirit! At least with alumni. Anytime i’m out wearing merch someone will yell “go bears!”
False: anyone can take CS70 to declare their cs major.
Edit:  also a 2018 HS grad, and Golden Dragon dude.

“You are set up for life with a degree from Berkeley.”

Outcomes came out really well not only for me but also for virtually everyone from my HS class that came for CS, which was a ton of them.

“Don’t go out at night, it’s too dangerous”

I never encountered any crime in my 3 years in Berkeley. And yes, I did a ton of late night runs to Gypsy’s or Blondies or wherever.  And when I was off campus I often even did a ton of 3 or 4 am Gig runs to 7-11 as well.  That’s not to say I didn’t take precautions.

“CS people don’t shower” (from reading posts here)

Hey I did my part to dispel that myth.  But I can occasionally see where that might be true.

“No one goes to lecture for CS” 

I did my part to uphold that, except for the first couple of classes, I never went.   Same with discussion unless I was forced to.

“Blackwell is an anti-social dorm” (from reading all the posts here)

I was an OG there, spent the first 1.75 years of its existence there. I would say it’s fairly true, but it depends on the floor and RA. To me, nice facility beats social any day of the week.
Okay mine is a little different- WEATHER. Coming from LA I was told by many people to be ready for cold weather and lots of rain. It does rain more here than LA, but a large majority of the days are comfortable and warm.
I was deciding between Berkeley and OSU too!

Also a 2022 grad admitted in 2018 :)
Something true is that it is competitive, but moreso in clubs/ecs than academics.

False is that it is toxic and cutthroat. There are so many people here and so many resources to help you! Everyone wants to see everyone succeed! (At least from my personal experience)
I heard Cal was #1 for drug use. After taking 6 years to finish undergrad, I can confirm that, yes indeed, UC Berkeley is #1 for drug use.
true: the city is sketchy & there is crime (although i have never personally encountered it)

false: not everyone is a stoner. i think i’ve met more people who are not very interested in drugs (aside from occasional drinking) than people who are borderline addicted
Any thoughts about berkeley premed?
""Berkeley is not the party school.""
I have seen parties and social events all the time here in Cal.
False: Berkeley goggles
Unpopular opinion: if you find that you don’t like it, that feeling won’t go away. Sure, I’m proud to say that I have Berkeley credentials, but my experience on this campus has been miserable these past several years.
“A Berkeley education is miles ahead of any other UC” my ass. Don’t feel bad if you don’t get into Berkeley and don’t feel as if you have to go here if you do get in. For undergraduate education, I’m pretty certain most UC’s are interchangeable.

Edit: yeah post-graduation outcomes are definitely better for Berkeley, forgot to mention that. Just keep in mind though that there are many other schools with great outcomes. I was more referring to the quality of undergraduate education.
I was told there was an elitist, competitive vibe here, and some students (though not all) will do whatever is in their power to succeed - even if this means harming others or using them as stepping stones in the process. 

I thought it was untrue at first, but then I attended the school for a year. This place has the exact same energy that my private, religious elementary school did. It's like getting in wasn't enough; everyone's always trying to be *better,* and others sometimes end up collateral damage in that process. 

It's not everyone, but it is a real thing here.
Honestly I haven’t found my true friends here yet, but I’m only a second sem freshman. I found I hated it here my first semester bc of huge classes and difficulty speaking w professors. But this semester I’ve made a consistent effort to go to office hours (you def should take advantage of this) because then the profs will know you and these profs here at Berkeley are on another level of exceptional than anywhere else. There’s a reason we have so many Nobel prize profs, bc this is a research institution. Speaking with these profs will change your life. This semester I can say with confidence that I’ve been loving and appreciating Berkeley more by the day. If you’re willing to put in the effort, you will make it big here.
True: the academics are competitive. Don't go to Berkeley if you are pre med. 

I'm a 3rd year in the MCB major. I never intended to be premed, but I had to take every pre med class. They are ridiculously difficult for no reason, and really competitive. I spent most of my free time studying, and only pulled 2 A's in the pre med classes. I highly suggest going somewhere else if you want to have a life outside of academics. Med Schools want a high GPA, Berkeley is pretty much the toughest place to get one (in the pre med classes, that is). 

If you are 100% sure you're pre med, go somewhere else. You don't need to punish yourself by going to Berkeley. If you spend less time studying, you will have more time for extracurriculars to boost your resume and med school applications.
Everyone being depressed and cutthroat
Grade deflation isn't as crazy as it's made out to be. If you put in the time, you can feasibly get above a 3.5 GPA (in my opinion.) Of course, there may be some exceptions to this rule.
""Asians have small Penises""

Turned out to be True.
You guys are listing boring shit. Putnam Porn, where some freshman invited a prostitute to the dorms and fucked her is 100% true. He even offered to take her to Crossroads after lmao
I agree. I have heard of the horrors of the upper div EECS/CS classes, but for me I’ve found that you can succeed and differentiate yourself by just applying yourself and working hard.
CS61B
100% agree. The claim of constant jockeying to get ahead has definitely not been true in my experience, even tho the school is competitive and classes can be hard.
The prestige thing is something I never knew about until I entered the workforce, but it’s definitely a thing
This is true. Hearing “go bears” somewhere random will make your day. Just not enough students show up to the sporting events :/
Touchy topic right now 😬😬
Wdym?
[deleted]
Great post. I was also in Blackwell… it was definitely not the most social but met some of my closest friends there for sure.
> Golden Dragon dude.

what is this, if you dont mind me asking?
Big time facts. Its been pretty dry here this spring/winter but the weather is unreal
Yeah Berkeley is a little cooler than LA, but it's not as huge a difference as you'd think.  Pretty much same weather as LA, but 5-10F cooler, if it rains a little in LA, it rains slightly more here, but not by a huge amount.
O-H!
You forgot the t hahaha
Totally agree!!
Haha! I grew up in Boulder and have been around CU boulder quite a bit…tough call if Cal beats out CU on that front. Lol
Don't
Don’t.

I know so many premed people who switched to Econ/DS/CS/Business/etc. Cal teaches you a lot and is rigorous, which makes for a lower GPA. You will be smarter by studying at Cal, but med schools don’t care; they only care about the GPA. 

Basically, if you do well at Cal then you can pretty much go to any med school of your choice (UCSF, Stanford, Harvard, Hopkins, etc). But if you are average at Cal, you will end with a mediocre gpa. And a mediocre gpa at Cal (3.4-3.5ish) isn’t good enough for any med school. 

For example, I am premed with a ~3.5 gpa. I majored in CS as a backup when I realized my gpa was gonna be shit. But I did really well on my MCAT (521, which is 98th percentile). And yet I haven’t gotten accepted to a single med school. 

But luckily I am a CS major and have good tech job offers!
^^
Agreed. Frat Parties were never my thing, but there’s always a house party or just a thing with friends where you can kick it and let loose
It's really not though. Parties occuring doesn't make it a party school. Go to Santa Barbara for the party school experience. You can just walk up to any party more or less. I've seen the fucking UN Club of UC Davis go harder than most frats here lol
Did my undergrad at Cal and wholeheartedly disagree lol.
walk the streets of UCLA and let me know
😂😂
Even though I had a great experience at Cal, I wouldn't dare to say to anyone with certainty that ""you WILL find your clique"" or ""you WILL find that extracurricular that speaks to you"" etc. It differs for everyone how enjoyable or fulfilling their time is at Cal. For the most part though, I think most people will find some sort of place for themselves. 

In hindsight, I've noticed that the people I knew who were not having a good time at Cal also had issues with their housemates, so I would say that one underrated boost to your well-being at Cal is finding good housemates who you're comfortable sharing a space with. Which is much easier said than done.
What's your major at Cal? I was accepted and  researching whether I should choose this school over UCSD. Thank you!
Education wise idk about but looking at job outcomes between UCs shows a stark difference in what the brand name of Berkeley can do for you. Whether it's justified in academic difference or entirely driven by legacy name power doesn't really matter for the sake of students.

But just looking at average salary outcomes, unemployment, grad school placement and other post-graduate statistics show a major difference between Berkeley and the rest.
“Interchangeable” is definitely up for debate. I see where you’re coming from, though. I 100% agree that kids shouldn’t be discouraged about the quality of education they’re gonna get if they get into Berkeley or not.
It really depends. There are a lot of areas in academia for example where the Berkeley name will give you a huge advantage over other UCs
What’s your major? I definitely think that this is a phenomenon here for some people but definitely not as widespread as people make it seem.
Weird. Going to grad school here is a lot more relaxed. People in my PhD program are the nicest people.
What’s ur major?
Fact or fiction?

As a two year year resident of Foothill, I feel this in my soul. That being said all of my best friends were people I lived with in foothill. All of us would go to the city together almost every weekend.
Those born in the year 2000.
Insane number of applicants to UCs as a result of this
I-O!
You a real one if you know this
Fine HAHA

The OSU :)
Please elaborate! Potential premed and I’ve heard that premed is not a good idea at cal from a lot of ppl, so I’m curious to hear about it from berk students.
I have never said Cal is the biggest party school among UCs. I just never expected much parties here because classes and life is hard here and intelligent students come to this place.
Idk maybe it's cause of the places I have (or haven't) lived in/been to up until I came here, but to me it feels like there's an insane amount of attractive people here. UCLA would probably blow my mind lol
I’m in the humanities. But someone (probably with a low grade in the class) last semester started a rumor that I was sleeping with the GSI for my grade. The rumor has followed me, and now my ethics and my grade are potentially in question… and for what? Truly, what was the purpose? 🙃

It’s not everyone doing this nonsense, at least, but people do still do it. Berkeley has all kinds of folks, which means we also have at least some spoiled rich kids who are used to getting everything they want 24/7, no matter the cost, and who haven’t quite woken up to the idea that college doesn’t operate that way.
I’ve got more grad friends than undergrad (by virtue of being a Bay native and older), and I’ve heard that a lot. Berkeley PhD programs are supposedly chill af, while undergrad will actively work to put you in an early grave. 

Guess a research university would prioritize graduate study, though. That makes sense, as they’re more likely to contribute to that research than us baby undergrads.

Data science and economics! tho I’m thinking of doing something w astrophysics / applied mathematics. That’s the beauty of Berkeley. you can explore so many diff classes and still not be behind. there’s domain emphasises within the data science major that u can explore more, like astronomy, Econ, physical science, math, etc
Almost entirely fiction, there is a lil here and there but most ppl r pretty chill
Ohio gozaimasu!
I'm not premed but I think the gist of it is that since berkeley has no medical school it faces a number of challenges for its premed program compared to unis who do have medical schools
I see but it still is very true that Cal isn't a party school or particularly social.
It’s definitely somewhat real 😬. CU Boulder in my hometown seems more like a BoutineLA model congregation than a university at some points
Your comment reminded me of another myth that everyone at Cal is a militant feminist / LGBT activist. Sexism and queerphobia is still very much alive at Cal unfortunately, though on average you'll find an accepting student body. Still hard in certain discussion sections (especially humanities discussions, in my experience) for women to get their voices heard and taken seriously.
Agreed"

On campus vs off campus as a 26 year old transfer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/134qxum/on_campus_vs_off_campus_as_a_26_year_old_transfer/,2023-05-01 09:18:19,"I’ll be starting my first year at Berkeley as a junior transfer in the fall. My financial aid is going to pay for my tuition and is also going to give me 16k for 2 semester because I chose to be off campus. I currently live with my mom in San Francisco so Iam not in hurry to find a place. My question is should I consider living on campus? I know if I was 18-23 I would but I am about to turn 27 this year and feel bit old to be in dorms. I want to be social and meet new people but I think I can do this without living on campus. Iam only going to be in Berkeley for 2years maybe 3 and want to make the most of it. If I had my own room I would considered it but sharing with 1-2 other people and also have the bathroom down the hall would make me not like it . Idk I just don’t want to feel like I am missing out on anything. 

Option c-I could also stay at my moms house in sf and pocket the money. But at a social stand point I don’t think that’s a good idea. 
Any input is appreciated","Don't live in a dorm, find a room in a shared apartment and make friends in classes and clubs.
this co-op ([https://bsc.coop/housing/our-houses-apartments/hillegass-parker-house](https://bsc.coop/housing/our-houses-apartments/hillegass-parker-house)) is for grad students + re-entry students only
The commute from SF to Berkeley each day is pretty brutal. Unless you live near the BART station, it could be 1-2 hours each way so 2-4 hours each day just commuting. If you drive, you'd most likely have to wake up at 7am and leave at 8pm to avoid the 40-1 hour rush hour traffic. I wish I signed up for co-op tbh.
I live in an off campus house across from Clark Kerr and we have people ranging from all different ages living there (19, 21, 22, 25, 31, etc.) and we all get along! Maybe you can consider trying to find something like that.
Coop is your best bet as a transfer. Even if you get stuck at Cloyne and it has secretly reverted to not-so-substance-free, as a 26 y.o. you should be able to self-regulate. I was a 23 y.o. transfer (a very long time ago) and my USCA (now BSC) experience was mostly positive. Also, it was dirt cheap compared to alternatives.
I wouldn’t live in the dorms but maybe consider a coop or join greek life or clubs for social life. Living in SF you will definitely feel pretty disconnected from Berkeley, so I’d recommend finding a place near campus if you can but maybe dorm’s isn’t a great idea since those are for freshmen. But for clubs/coops/greek life that’s not really an issue.
I was 25 when I transferred. 

I wish I had lived on campus, or at the very least, with roommates.
I was a transfer who lived with my dad in Martinez (town not dorm). I would alternate between BART and driving, depending on my class time. Most of my classes where scheduled after 10am. The commute wasn't too bad, but parking is expensive in Berkeley.  About $450 a semester. Plus there are plenty of places on campus to wait out rush hour and work on schoolwork. But my social life with the other students wasn't as good as it could have been. But looking at some of the places my friends were living I was glad to have a house with plenty of space.  Personally, i would try a semester living in SF and see how you like it. That way, when you start looking for co-ops, you can think to yourself if cutting the commute is worth it.
Look into the co-ops, they have one specifically for older/grad students are really close to campus/affordable if you are willing to deal with living with other people and all that entails (semi-dirty house, ppl being annoying).
Dorms are legitimately robbery.

They are so expensive for fairly limited benefit
I've lived off campus, i've lived on campus (two different years), and i've lived in the co-ops here and there. They're all amazing. I've gone back and forth, I just did this past year back in an on-campus apartment.

I definitely recommend considering on-campus living. You may take more out in loans, and be a little tighter on spending money, but both years I lived on campus (out of the 4 I've been at Cal, minus 1 year back in LA during covid), were awesome!

Source: Transferred in 2019 at 28, now going on 32 and finishing this Fall 2023.

My Conclusion: Apply to on-campus and see what u get. Especially your first year. If you get any on-campus apartment, if you can swing it financially, I would do it.

Questions: Not sure what the 16k in financial aid breaks down to. Those of us who have been here for years would probably understand your situation better if you just noted how close to 0 EFC you are.

Caveats: I'm from the just before covid era of transfers, so some things through covid were different. Nevertheless the transfer community and re-entry community is huge and helpful.

Bests
I’m 31 and live in the dorms. I have a single tho. Next semester I’m in a double so we’ll see how that goes lol. I would try to opt for a dorm on the north side of campus as an older student since it’s quieter
do not live in a dorm, whatever you do. not worth it. find an apartment, you will have a much better time
The co-ops would be your best bet. I am completely biased when I say this but I would try to get into Convent (a grad/re-entry house). I feel super fortunate with my experience so far. You get your own room so you have the ability to decompress if necessary and it’s one of the smaller houses so you only have 24 other housemates to deal with. It definitely comes with its own caveats but overall we’ve been rated one of the cleaner houses. When members of other co-ops ask how/why in meetings, I think it’s because we’ve fostered a tight-knit community that cares about one another enough to want to keep the place clean. 

I personally also joined a sorority because it is nice to have that additional social agenda. A lot of folks here are also involved in other clubs/orgs on campus. We also tend to go on adventures and always ask others if they want to tag along :)

HiP would be a great alternative as well. Overall, I’d suggest living off campus in Berkeley. You’ll end up getting a MUCH better experience out of it and it’s only for 2-3 years. It goes by quickkkk 😭
Yeah I would live in off campus housing. I came in as a 21 year old transfer and lived in the dorms for a year and that was a little weird for me. 

Dormmates were in high school 3 months before fall semester and I had already been in college for 3 years.
Don't stay at your mom's house and do get going on getting your place to live well before the semester starts. I lived in San Francisco for a year during my junior year and it was sheer hell going back and forth every day on BART or driving. You are going to be very busy while at Berkeley and you will want to have a place close by. There are not many places to relax on campus outside of libraries and outdoors, so having a bed nearby for naps is key. You are going to be frequently wiped out from the massive load of work you are about to endure. I also was a little older when I started, so your situation is very similar to mine. I regretted not moving to Berkeley sooner. It was way easier once I lived here instead of the City.
I was a transfer student too.  I lived in a dorm floor with all other transfer students. I also lived in a co-op,  next to Soda Hall,  in North Berkeley. 

I lived in SF,  near bart and commuted for my last year which I found so much better for my mental health compare to living on campus.  I tried to schedule my week such that I don’t have to come every day.
I wouldn’t even expect to be able to get on campus housing. I transferred this last fall (2022) and of the ~3,000 transfers like 300 got housing offers, and with more and more student admitted the odds of getting an offer gets slimmer.
I transferred this year at 22. I still felt way too old for the dorms so I imagine you’ll feel the same. It’s very weird having roommates who just graduated high school
dorm or student apartments only if you were a 20 or 21 year old junior, otherwise you'll probably be annoyed.  maybe you can stay home for fall and if you pledge a frat, you can move in during spring semester.  Or you can get your own studio for about $2000 a month if it's near campus (within a couple of blocks), or for about $1800 further away eg Telegraph Ave, about 10 or more blocks south of campus.  I was a transfer but only 20 at the time and lived at dorm during first year at Cal, then commute from SF for second year/senior.  it was a blast both years!
Transferred at 28 and lived in garden village both years. I’d definitely recommend the single room housing options through the university if you can get them. Makes life a lot easier.
As a fellow junior transfer, soon to be senior, who ended up commuting their first year from Pittsburg/Bay point, it depends on how big of a social life you want. Do you want to be active on campus, join clubs/groups, do research, go to school activities? Then find a place off campus and don't commute. In my experience, commuting does make you feel less connected to the school but, it hasn't stopped me from meeting people and making friends. If you put in the effort to get to know people in your discussions or lab groups, you can still make friends as a commuter.  The only negatives for me was not being able to go to OH or review sessions and 8ams are a pain. I'd say give commuting a shot at least for the first semester, if you can't stand it, you could start looking for a place before the spring.
There’s a really nice nursing home near the campus
Try International House.  https://ihouse.berkeley.edu/apply
You should definitely not live in a Cal-run dorm - their pricing is outrageous, and it will be mostly teenagers.

I highly recommend living with other people, even if you have to share a bathroom. If not the coops (which I loved), then in some form of group housing. Specifically, search the [rooms & shares](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/eby/roo#search=1~map~0~0~37.8932~-122.3093~37.8583~-122.2220) on Craigslist.
Off
Seconding this. Depending on your cooking situation, the meal plan might be a nice add-on to off campus housing.
\^\^ Solid co-op according to friends that have lived there. Objectively, it's the second best (#2 )grad student + re-entry co-op, so it's worth looking at. That same organization has the best (#1) grad student + re-entry co-op housing. Worth applying to imho.
I had a couple of friends who lived there and loved it.
Thank you I’ll check it out
Is there any other posts that describe all/a decent number of co-ops? I feel like there has to be some post on this sub doing that.
I commuted to SF for a year and had to get up at 4:30am each day just to make an 8am class. It was definitely brutal. I hated every minute of that long commute. Way better when I moved to Berkeley for my final year.
Bart from downtown Berkeley to civic center is 1 hour at most. I know plenty of people who make the commute.

You should 100% just pocket the money
it’s gonna be pretty hard to join greek life as a 26 year old
[deleted]
My efc is 0. 
Thanks I’ll look into it , co-ops sounds interesting to.
Going on 32 me self & Did a double this past year.Hopefully you get as respectful and cool roommates/housemates as I had ;)
How can you get single room housing?
I was 25 when I transferred, and I am thirding this. **Don't live in the dorms** (unless it's I-house). I knew several people who lived in co-ops and were super happy with it, especially if you are an extrovert.

I highly recommend living within 20 minutes of campus, though (even if by bus). Back in 2015, we got a free-for-bus AC transit cards and discounted BART.

I am an introvert and lived near Trader Joe's in a small 2-bedroom apartment I shared with one more person, and was very happy with my choices. I still had a ridiculously active social life and was on campus from 6 am to 8 or 10 pm every day, and would uber once a week home from parties on the weekend. If you do live off-campus, my greatest tip for you is to invest in a nice big locker at the RSF. Not only that encouraged me to go to the gym daily (which was awesome, especially for someone with sedentary tendencies), but I could also store my stuff and not carry everything all day with me.
3 1/2 hour commute?
It’s 25 minutes on the train.
>ut I am about to turn 27 this year and feel bit old to be in dorms. I want to be social and meet new people but I think I can do this without living on campus. Iam only going to be in Berkeley for 2years maybe 3 and want to make the most of it. If I had

I made this commute my first year as a transfer. It was around 40 minutes from leaving my apartment to sitting in the seat of my first class. I did live directly outside of the Civic Center Bart Station, however. The reason I don't recommend this commute is if you stay on campus late. Trains to the city start going an hour apart at a certain time and those trains leave a few things to be desired.
Not sure about sororities but I know plenty of frats wouldn’t mind it at all
apologies, freshthem
Thanks! I hope so!
You just apply and set your preferences. You’ll probably have a better chance as a junior transfer, but ultimately it’s not for sure and the results come out pretty close to semester start.
OP, I would second what this person said about living within 20 minutes via public transit if possible. I was 22 when I transferred in and commuted from South Bay. It was exhausting having to be on campus all day knowing I still had a 1.5 hour commute even during the best traffic conditions (~20-30 minutes to bus to my parked car). 

It doesn’t seem like it but even the small things like having a place nearby to take a nap or take a shit in peace is a big bump quality of life over 2 years
No, that includes getting ready, having breakfast, driving to the BART station, walking from BART to class, prepping for class. 60-90 minute train ride depending on what's going on that day.
That's real rough, buddy!

You made another good point: learn the places on campus where you can take a nap and find single stall bathrooms!

Also, most transfers stay 2 years, but some, like me, stay longer. I did this for 4 years after 1.5 years in CC. You never know if you will be one of the people Berkeley extends your stay (I got the invitation to stay in February of the year I was graduating), so I recommend avoiding burning out at all costs and commuting is seriously a quick way to get exhausted.
^* Hope the 4 at Cal after transferring were as good to you as they’ve been to me. 🫡
The first year was very challenging, and I was suicidally depressed with the workload and content, which turned out was really not what I wanted to do, but then I picked up the pace, switched majors to something I actually cared about (I went Haas/CS > Econ/CS (briefly) > CS/Social Welfare with a Psych Focus), and made friends. Then the years following were super wonderful and I was delighted when they invited me to stay, but by my true senior year, I was very ready to go to work! haha

Alas, 4 years later I'm graduating now with my Master's and returning to Berkeley for a PhD in the Spring."
did cal only accept like 100-200 kids for l&s cs this year? like im sure it's way more,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ngnak/did_cal_only_accept_like_100200_kids_for_ls_cs/,2023-05-20 19:42:14,"like everyone and their mom is cs at berkeley haha. im also kinda asking on behalf my of cousin whos waitlisted rn. maybe it's lower b/c of the whole capped thing and the new l&s policy. but i remember when i applied there were way moreeeee l&s cs ppl

Well the number they admit as “cs” has always been sorta low, but the number of actual cs majors are high cuz people in L&S came in undeclared and then switched into cs. So the true number of cs majors you see on campus is much bigger than what they admitted. Now that it’s capped the number of cs majors will be more representative of the number that actually get admitted from the get go.
as a lscs admit, feel like all i see are eecs majors and barely any cs incoming first years
[deleted]
Blame the greedy unions
does anyone know if its the same for ds this year?
According to the first town hall April 2022 the estimated LSCS enrolled number would be 250, so the admit number has to be well higher than 100.  Remember there are no more switchers anymore, so the admit number should be more.
yeah, same! nice to meet a fellow CS major
Ahh yes because it’s the union’s fault they’ve been over enrolling cs classes and refusing to staff them adequately. It’s the union’s fault that almost every single CS GSI and UGSI works significantly over their hours. It’s the union’s fault that office hour queues are 7 hours long. Oh wait those are exactly the kinds of things the union has been trying to prevent
The union can’t magically get the department more funding from the university. Pushing for absurd levels of TC like full remission for 8 hour positions. (I say this as someone on course staff) isn’t helping anything. Neither is fucking with Hug and DeNero.

Not saying the union is responsible for this (they’re not) but please stop acting like they’re some universal force for good that would fix all the problems if they had their way."
What CS courses helped you most with tech interviews?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1afa8pf/what_cs_courses_helped_you_most_with_tech/,2024-01-30 21:25:49,"Also, which CS courses have a lot of projects where you can make you own things?

Aren’t the basics (61a/b/c) usually all you really need skill wise in day to day work life in tech? How do other upper divs play a role in your day to day work life (genuinely curious)?","> What courses helped you most with tech interviews

I would actually say 61a, since it's what gave me my first exposure to challenging short-form programming questions. The material in 61b is more relevant, but I thought 61a was more challenging. Some of my interviews had discussions that touched on concepts from 61c and 162, but I don't think I was strictly expected to know that stuff.

(Although I enjoyed 170, IMO it's wildly overrated as interview prep. It's neither necessary nor sufficient, you need to leetcode.)

> Also, which CS courses have a lot of projects where you can make you own things?

162

> Which ones were most fundamental in your SWE job today in terms of what skills you use on a daily basis

some stuff from 189, data 100, and 182 (if I had taken it) are pretty relevant to my work, I'm mostly in ML. 

honestly I'm gonna sound like a mega-boomer saying this, but I think the most valuable think you learn in college for a career as a SWE isn't any particular subject but rather the ability to think critically and systematically.
It's hard to pinpoint. All those classes were hard as fuck and I think they just hazed me into a smarter person such that I kinda just ""got"" programming concepts. So yeah, take a lot of classes lol, doesn't really matter which ones.
How about cs170?
61a/b, 170
61a for critical thinking and 61b for data structures / algorithms knowledge.  My hot take is that 170 is not at all useful and I have gotten more use out of classes like 127 in an interview setting.

"Breadth, AP, and AH&I & R&C",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uk0kyf/breadth_ap_and_ahi_rc/,2022-05-06 16:46:39,"Do AH&I and R&C courses fulfills breadth requirements? (If taken at Berkeley)

If yes…
    my APUSH and APLang scores satisfy the AH&I and R&C courses but since APs don’t count toward breadth do I still need to take the 15 units for breadth? (That is I can’t subtract the 8 units from AH&I and R&C.)","FYI… I’m an incoming freshmen.
What college are you in?  It sounds like you are in CoC.
CNR microbial biology.
For CNR, each major has their own requirements for breadths.  In your case, it's probably the 5 non-science categories.  Whether you can fulfill any of them via AP, I'm not sure, each college has slightly different rules.  L&S does not allow AP credits to fulfill breadths, but CoE does allow limited AP credits (I think up to 2 classes) to fulfill their HSS/breadth classes.   I don't see any documentation online on this for CNR.

R&C classes do not fulfill breadths, with the exception of one class - AGRS R44.  That fulfills both a breadth and 1 R&C class.  AGRS R44 is a pretty heavy workload class though, and some have said in the past that you might be better off just taking 2 separate classes from a workload standpoint.  If you got a 5 in AP Lit, you would be able to cover (fulfill) both R&C classes.  A 4+ in AP Lang or a 4 in AP Lit covers the first R&C class.

If you went to HS in the US, you almost certainly will have fulfilled your AH&I already.  You do need to take an AC class though.  Usually you would take that in conjunction with a breadth class.  Look for classes that has the suffix AC at the end of the course code, such as ANTHRO 2AC.
My apush and AP Lang scores fulfill AH&I and RxA. Just took my AP Lit exam yesterday. I could ask my major advisor this summer before class reg about breadth in detail… just too anxious to found out. Thanks!!!
I’m pretty sure the AP classes won’t fulfill breadths, but check with an advisor.  Unlike L&S, CNR advisory I heard is a lot better and easier to access.
I’m in-state. Will ask lots of questions when I meet my advisor. Thanks!!!"

do I still have a chance to declare CS,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18lme2j/do_i_still_have_a_chance_to_declare_cs/,2023-12-18 15:04:28,"I came into Berkeley with zero coding experience and have struggled really hard with these lower divs. I clutched up on 61A final and ended with a B+, and I thought I could do the same with 61B, but final exam scores just came out and I ended with a C+. I know 61B is integral to computer science, so I don’t know what happened. I feel like the exam was so doable, but I choked after studying all of RRR week because I was managing my time horribly and had to guess on questions I knew how to do.

I have 70 next semester. If I try hard enough and get an A, I’ll end with a 3.2 GPA. I heard that they still get accepted with enough appeal because of the 0.1 difference, but 61B is crucial to the major, so will they?

I know I still have data science & that declaring CS isn’t everything. But I applied for intended CS going into Berkeley and I want it badly, to somehow prove to myself I can do it, and to make my family proud. Which is sad, I know, but I can’t help it. I know it’s unhealthy because a major is just a title & isn’t truly indicative of the skills you earn throughout college. I would just like to know someone’s honest opinion on this. Thanks!","Will they? That’s up to your letter of recommendation and statement for the appeal. If you want an honest opinion here it goes even though i’m gonna get downvoted to oblivion. I think you should’ve late dropped. It’s actually crazy imo to not get at least a B in that class. You just need 254/500 of the exam points for a B. That should be extremely doable for anyone barring some extenuating circumstances. That being said with a bin shift you may be able to squeak in a B- depending on how close you are. If you get a B- in 61b and an A in 70 you’ll have the 3.3. Trying hard in 70 doesn’t equate to getting an A but here’s my advice for 70. Study your ass off for the midterm content during the break and try to get ~2 SD and you can probably guarantee an A just from the midterm with the clobber. However it’s not Rao teaching 70 next semester so who knows if there’s even a clobber or if the exams would be similar.
I averaged around a flat 50% this sem in the 61B exams (post curve) and am ending with a high B. I studied quite a bit for mt2 and final because i know i am stupid as fuck and managed to pull these 50% scores. i aced the projects/labs after spending hours and hours. just like you I also had 0 programming experience prior to Cal, with my first class being 61a and also clutched up on the 61a final ending that class w a B+ (after failing the midterms)

to preface i am an econ major doing the ds minor, so you can take my next words with a grain of salt. 

getting a C+ in this class as an intended cs major is fucking wild. if you genuinely tried in this class and managed to get a B+ in 61a so you’re obviously not just naturally incompetent at this shit and then got a C+ it’s bad fr - honestly lil bro you just not cut out for berkeley cs it might be time to choose another major fr and that’s not a bad thing like it may sound like 

good luck in 70 and ik u can succeed in the future even if you don’t do cs but this is my honest thoughts
I think you should consider the opportunity cost of trying. Which might be that you take cs70 which you otherwise wouldn’t and maybe drop an extra class you could’ve taken. If that’s not a big deal then just try!
Can you ask for an F and retake the class?
i appealed w a 3.2 gpa if u ever want to talk about the process !
I appealed, pm me if you need anything :)
no ones getting 2 sd on cs70 willy nilly lol
you’re right this is honestly so tragic :( I think I could’ve gotten it but my work study job fucked me over this sem by being way too heavy , but maybe this is just me making excuses :( honestly projects were really fun for me and I always completed them so the only thing that held me back were my exam scores that I somehow always bombed?!
no
Yah to be in that ballpark you would’ve had little to no difficultly getting an A in the previous two courses
That’s how it is in 61A/B. 99% of people get full points on everything except exams"

Jaylen Brown Finals MVP,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11vaide/jaylen_brown_finals_mvp/,2023-03-18 20:51:25,"Waddup, Golden Bears.

The young blood here may not know who this man is, but I did my freshman year with him at Cal. In 2015, Jaylen Brown came into the University of California at Berkeley touted as the second best basketball recruit in the world, projected by some to be the next great shooting guard in the NBA. At Cal, he did not disappoint. While he was very raw, on game days, Jaylen Brown was electrifying to watch night in and night out, and he elevated the team through his sheer athleticism. This man, a literal one-and-done recruit and draft pick (guys like this do not pick Cal), embodies the spirit of the Golden Bear. To finish the year, Brown wrote a 35 page paper the night before a critical basketball game for the history of our school, our final appearance in the NCAA March Madness tournament, [Hawaii vs Cal](https://youtu.be/afpW8QdNaRw?t=45) (thanks professor!).

Tonight was a historic night. Tonight was the first game in Jaylen's seven year career that he was featured as the first option of the Boston Celtics. Despite the loss, despite the fact that the team was shorthanded without three of their most important players (Marcus Smart, Al Horford, Robert Williams), tonight, without a doubt, is the best the Celtics have looked on offense since they've been contenders for an NBA title.

I'm calling it right now. If the Boston Celtics have learned anything from this game, they will feature Jaylen more often as they have tonight. If this happens, Jaylen and the team's ceiling is without limit. This year, Brown has transcended the limitations put on him by his offense to produce as one of the top players in the NBA. As an extremely consistent scorer (like all of you guys <3), if he is feature in the playoffs like he was tonight, the Boston Celtics are not only winning a championship, but Jaylen Brown is also winning a Finals MVP.

Go Bears.","Just don't ask him about vaccines. Or Kanye.

The 2023 MVP from philly has something to say about who's winning the east.
Yeah lost a lot of respect for him over that. He’s a smart guy very evidently, I expected more
Completely agree. He mingled with people with Kyrie which destroyed the “Cal athlete/intellectual” image for me.
Only cause the Celtics and Tatum still freeze out Jaylen! Blows my mind!

failing to declare cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kfzbwj/failing_to_declare_cs/,2020-12-18 18:25:14,"I went into Berkeley super excited and really confident about CS. it always came naturally and easily to me. Cs61A I was loving—I was completely the projects, homeworks, and labs with no stress or sweat whatsoever. Come midterm one and I land myself in the hospital for a few weeks and can’t take the midterm that I had studied for extensively and was beyond confident about. Then covid. Then I couldn’t take midterm 2 because I was traveling. I gave up. It felt like the world was against me. Come the final I pulled a B+ (did extremely well on the midterm one content, pretty well midterm 2, and flunked everything past that. I was only a couple points from an A- but Denero wouldn’t bump me up). I told myself, well it’s ok, I’ll just do well in 61b and 70. I got an A in 61b over summer, and felt really good about only needing a B- into 70. Come 70 I don’t fucking understand anything. I drop another class almost a month in because it’s killing me, and end up having to spend a ton of time on a new class I added. As a result, I tank the midterm (-1.2 SD below the mean). No problem, I just study hard for the final, right? I grind all RRR week, I’m getting mean on the past exams with extra time and I feel genuinely confident going into the exam. Then, I get there, and it’s way more difficult than the practices were for me. I can’t do anything, I panic, start crying, and give up and underperform. I know I did horribly. Definitely sub 30% (I left all but 2 long answers blank, and looking at my short answer answers the majority of them are wrong. I can’t even look at it because I just start crying again).
I know I won’t get a B- now and I won’t be able to declare. Looking at the data science major requirements as I’m writing this and I’m just breaking down. I don’t have interest in these classes, I just want to do CS. I haven’t had an internship, UGSI, or research position so appealing is off the table. I am feeling genuinely hopeless and I just can’t get the thoughts of killing myself out of my head (I won’t do it, but it’s just plaguing my thoughts, I don’t really know how to describe it). I feel like I worked so hard for so many years towards this and just tripped and face planted at the finish line. ~~Once grades are in if I get a C+, C, or C- I’m thinking of emailing rao and asking him to drop me to a D+ so I can retake for an A-. Is this a good idea? I don’t have high hopes but shooting my shot is better than doing nothing, right?~~ (Edit: haha this was impossible queue another mental breakdown) Does anyone have any advice? 

Tldr; failed 70 and can’t declare. Don’t want to do data science and I’m just at peak depression.

EDIT: I got the B- :)","> Once grades are in if I get a C+, C, or C- I’m thinking of emailing rao and asking him to drop me to a D+ so I can retake for an A-. Is this a good idea? 

Hug actually use to do this on request, but the department stepped in and told him to knock it off, so unfortunately he's not going to do it.

Edit: oh yeah they also made it so that it factors into your GPA anyway

To OP, idk, maybe you'll surprise yourself with how you performed, but if what you fear is true, yeah you'll probably have to do DS.

DS is mostly fine as a major. If you look at the career surveys (although there's not a lot of them) it's basically the CS/EECS numbers + some noise.

The main issue is that DS students don't get priority seating in CS classes, and with how bad CS enrollment is getting its going to be a challenge to get into CS upperdivs. But I suppose you can just audit them.
There is a petition process for those below the GPA threshold.  Look into that.
I got a B- in CS61A, the midterms fucked me every single time, highest I ever got on one was 48% lmao. Homeworks were almost undoable for me after the first question, Labs were only things I could do consistently and I only got through the Ants project with help of an extremely talented foreign exchange student. 

I too got a A in 61B by one point lmao through nothing but hard work and grinding.

I have taken CS70 twice, I dropped in the summer after doing so poorly I got a D-. Now I retook this class and I got -.5/1 SD on midterm 1 and got fucked by this final like everyone else so I don't know if I will even get a B, much more B+ needed to declare. This summer I was so distraught like you, I felt I had no chance of declaring anymore and the joy of CS was sucked out of me. I didn't know what I would do if I didn't get into the major. But this entire covid situation, stress of online learning, and overall unwillingness of many teachers to change with the times has made me numb to the entire situation. I now have new perspective. If I don't get in, I don't get in, simple

There is literally no point in stressing anymore, the final and your lower divs are OVER. Accept that, you either will get into the major straight up or by appealing, or you won't. Either way it really doesn't change ur future. If you are as brilliant as you claim to be in 61A and on those 70 final exams ( I never got close to mean while studying this entire RRR week lmao), you will be just fine banging out leetcode with a CS minor/DS degree and getting a SWE job. I am not going to let berkeley dictate my future, idc. Just because I don't get a 3.3 doesn't mean shit to me, I am going to become a SWE and use my CS skills to start my own business. Either way after this semseter the pressure of lower divs will be off my back and I can spend more time honing my skills through personal projects, reading external material on SWE/business/etc. My future doesn't end with getting in or not getting into CS, neither does yours!
Wait until you have the final grade. There's always hope. I've seen some damn low final averages (my semester, an A in 189 was a 40 or 50%). Either way, take the next few weeks off, try to enjoy yourself, and then figure out what's next. Life isn't always a linear path from A to B - there will always be some twists, turns, and lots of circles.
unfortunately the policy changed so if u fail the score is still averaged into the final :(
IIRC for the purposes of declaration, even if you get a D+ and retake it, that D+ factor's into the GPA calculation to see if it meets the 3.3 requirement.

Sorry to hear that you've been struggling, OP. You might consider a CS minor, as well?
[deleted]
wait until the grade actually comes out, it's hard to tell just how good/bad your performance was when it's being compared to everyone else as well.

i am v-sad-boi because i also failed to declare, i cannot say it's done me much good to dwell on it because i am still using this account today

i compromised and jumped to DS when it first became a major, can't say i hate the content so that wasn't terrible, but im still sad i couldn't declare. in your case if you do fail to declare, you can still appeal into the major at a later date. if your work ethic could get you an A in 61b and you could sit down to grind content for a whole week for 70 you can grind out leetcode n get an internship by soph/junior year for sure. do well, get letter of rec, appeal in. you'll just have to deal with having no priority for CS classes and be very careful with your course planning til then. i was still able to get into most of the upper divs i wanted, minus the really limited/popular ones like 160. 

try being an AI for 61b, and see if being a TA could work for you cause they specifically note that in the appeal page as a plus iirc. otherwise just keep pursuing cs stuff and it'll still look good on the personal statement.

fuck cs70
I will cross my fingers for you being able to declare, but I also want to say that life is so surprising - just when you think some door has been slammed in your face, you find out a year or two or five later that actually things turned out really well and you've landed someplace that makes sense for you (I'm an alum so have a lot more years under my belt.)  

Later, once the dust settles, consider your options. I like the idea of a CS minor and frankly any other major (doesn't have to be DS). You can still try to take a few CS upper div even though I know it will be competitive to get a spot. Think about what it is you want to do with CS and see about building experience in that particular area whether it's one or two classes in that area at Cal, through online courses from another school or working on projects through a club or research. 

In both large and small companies, there is a lot of opportunity to switch jobs if you are proactive -- start in one group that isn't your dream job and work your way into the group that is. That's certainly what I did. Lots of paths! Hang in there and I'm pulling for you.
DS gets a bad rep at Berkeley for some reason, but I promise you - it's just as good of an education, you have similar job prospects (if not a little more diversified), and you'll take just as interesting classes. The support for the major isn't all the way there yet, especially since it's newer, but there's no harm in *not* doing CS. It's just what Berkeley clout goggles do to you. Keep your head up; grades don't define your worth. (:
I FELT THIS HEAVY
“Come midterm one and I land myself in the hospital for a few weeks and can’t take the midterm that I had studied for extensively and was beyond confident about.”

OP I’m really sorry to hear this :( I had a similar situation with the final, but I was able to get an incomplete and finish the class later. I believe it would have only been fair to have the same accommodation given to you—as others have mentioned, you should definitely explain this and everything else in your petition
This  might to be an unpopular question, but if you came into Berkeley set in CS, why didn't you just apply to EECS? 

Isn't EECS the way for people who are set on CS to say they're set on CS? 

It sucks to not make it into the major of your choice. Why did you put yourself through this nightmare if you wanted CS?
[deleted]
In addition even if you do retake after failing the failing grade is factored into the gpa cap now
Yes, I think this is the best advice. You can explain extenuating circumstances in your petition, like having a panic attack during the final. I petitioned to get in the major (I wasn’t sure if my GpA was going to make it), and stated my extenuating circumstances. In my case, my dog died right before a midterm and I flunked it. 

Rao is an understanding professor and if you approach him with humility, he might be able to help you out/offer advice.
Agreed with this. [Here is a link to more information](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/major-declaration-appeal). I know a couple friends who successfully got in on appeal, so it is not impossible and definitely a better idea than intentionally failing the class.

Also, even if you don’t get into the major, it is definitely not the end of the world. Don’t forget that you are at *UC Berkeley*, one of the most renowned research institutions in the world.

WHAT
[deleted]
dumb policy. The only way this works in your favor is if you get As in all 3 classes
[deleted]
good luck!! hoping the best for you
This! Not taking CS70 this semester, but from what I've heard from people who are the final really was ridiculously hard.
I didn’t look into the differences when applying to the UCs, like an idiot. The whole college apps thing was super stressful for me so I just went down the line and clicked whatever said computer science for every single school without realizing I wouldn’t be declared at Berkeley (they’re the only ones with this system). When I got in I was as like, 3.3? Shouldn’t be too bad, and it’s Berkeley after all. Mistake. I regret not choosing any other college
yeah, I realize that now. I thought a D+ was a higher point value for some reason, I feel like an idiot. Guess this just proves I’m bad at math lmfao I deserved to fail 70
It's been like this since 2016, people were intentionally failing classes if they didn't get a good enough grade so that they could retake. The CS department didn't like that and so now they factor everything in
[deleted]
It's not supposed to work in your favor, it's supposed to stop students from intentionally failing if they're on track for a grade that they can't declare with.

The EECS department is trying to have less people declare, not more.
Rip I was not aware ;-;
ignorant question but why don't they just raise the GPA cap if that's their goal?
1. Raising the GPA cap is a major political issue (not political as in US politics). Hug once threatened to *resign* if they ever raised the GPA cap

2. That makes it worse for students who aren't trying to subvert the GPA cap in a janky way

3. It makes overenrollment in lower divs worse, since now you have all these people who keep retaking them

4. It's janky and bad for students to be encouraged to fail classes. If nothing else it means some students will keep ""wasting"" semesters taking the same classes over and over again instead of accepting their failure and moving on
Well then you're selecting for a very narrow range of students. I don't think you should have to have a certain GPA to study anything, but the way the world is right now there are just too many damn people and CS is by far the hottest field. So it's somewhat like the SAT - you just need some arbitrary way to filter out students. Exact same reason Leetcode exists. But imagine if Berkeley only admitted people who got a 2300 on the SAT (or whatever the new score is) - you'd miss out on a *lot* of people who didn't bother optimizing for some arbitrary score (not to mention every class would be competitive as fuck), so that's why it's not really a good idea to just keep increasing the cap year after year, especially when we're a public university whose goal is to serve a wide variety of people and interests. 

I'm sure this topic's been debated to death (especially by the faculty), but nobody's really done anything about it yet so profs/department just kind of do whatever.
What is politics? And why did Hug say he'd resign? I think I understand the last 3 points..
interesting points, thanks!
L&S CS really needs to move to direct admission from high school at this point. It's incredibly toxic and stressful to force students to risk their first 1.5-2 years of college on a pathway that they might not even be able to major in.

Just embarrassing, honestly. There are so many people who might genuinely love CS and rather study it at another university if they're forced to study something else at Cal. I really hope the faculty considers this.
yeah definitely a really unfortunate issue with no easy solution
Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. The academic study of politics is referred to as political science.

EECS 16B vs. Math 54 for Data,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14u09jv/eecs_16b_vs_math_54_for_data/,2023-07-08 03:13:14,"I was intended CS but couldn’t declare due to GPA. However, I just need to finish linear algebra requirement to declare Data. I have taken EECS 16A and got a C- on it (forgot a midterm and finals was kinda hard). I don’t know whether to continue with EECS 16B since I have already taken EECS 16A or just do 54 (or waitlist for 56). I do hear that EECS 16B was easy at least compared to 16A though so that’s a plus.","I don’t know who you heard it from but EECS 16B is definitely NOT easy, especially compared to 16A
EECS16B is not easy, but it can be done if you put in the legwork. Previous class iterations have been known to require a lot of time depending on the professor. There's a sense of continuity if you take 16B from 16A, so if you decide on it, I would suggest reviewing the linear algebra you got from 16A.

Otherwise, the benefit of Math 54 will be a different kind of take on 16A's linear algebra parts, plus some treatment of diff eq which is treated in 16B a little less formally. You'll think about vector spaces and subspaces. A big theme will be transformations that have associated subspaces (column space, null space, eigenspaces, etc.), and related decompositions and operations (Eigendecomposition, Gaussian Elimination, Gram Schmidt, SVD) and proofs.
Do 16b
Unless you want to learn EE, I will recommend you take Math 54. It's a better way to learn linear algebra. And you will use linear algebra in almost every data and stat course in the future. And eecs16a/b is designed to be very hard to scare students who want to declare an EECS major. Math54 is more friendly, useful, and enough for data study.
Why would you take EE 16B for Data Science?

Module 1 - Differential equations and advanced circuit design

Module 2 - Introduction to robotics and control

Module 3 - Introduction to unsupervised machine learning and classification

Does this *look* like Data Science to you? Do you need DiffEq at all or would Math 56 do?
I got a better grade in B than A so i’d say B was easier (though i do agree it was atrocious at the start of the semester). They give a lot of extra credit in 16b so it pushes ur grade up
16B is literally like precalc knowledge. You cover 3 types of basic pattern matchable diff eqs and complex numbers and linalg is taught well with basically only matmul assumed as prior knwoledge. I would say it’s taught better & more motivated than 16a which made it easier for me as 16a was like braindead math spam or circuits presented in a dull manner
For me 16B was also a lot easier to understand since you aren’t guaranteed to have all the preparation for 16A but the only real preparation needed for 16B was 16A"

become part of the garbage, part of the din of space. wait for the dirtied pages that was your life to be reclaimed, to be cleansed, to be made empty by the great kernel above. 

only in this do we find release
Having programmed in C and C++, don’t listen to this. C++ abstracts some things away w.r.t. memory management, and even offers libraries that give you access to smart pointers which bridge the gap between C and languages with built-in garbage collection such as Java.

In other words, C is as nitty-gritty as it gets when it comes to memory management. If you can get C down you can program in any language in existence.
I found those tools harder to learn than C lol. I guess it is because there are a lot of different additions they included to be safe with memory and I wasn’t sure what good coding convention was."
I’m so mentally burned out rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12r6kg8/im_so_mentally_burned_out_rn/,2023-04-18 15:16:51,"Sounds like every other Berkeley Reddit huh? Well at this point idrc. I don’t think I have a proper support system and I’m just an over thinker in general. I’ve always been one to aim for good grades but I don’t think of myself as super hard core. Rn I’m trying to declare mcb but I’m scared. I’m taking math 1b chem1a and r1a(6 units) at this point I think I’ll get a B- or even c+ hopefully not in chem, c or something in math and I’m scared abt not passing the portfolio for r1a. I feel so done with everything and even tho we’re close to the finish line I don’t have the energy to cross it. The fact that my grades aren’t the best rn and I feel like I don’t have hopes for finals bc they’re like the bulk of my grades and I’m just so tired. All I wanna do is sleep and I haven’t been rlly going to any of my lectures. I feel guilty if I don’t go but if I go I feel like I didn’t learn anything bc it’s so fast paced I can’t comprehend everything and it’s so easy to fall behind. Idk if I should listen in lectures or take notes because doing both at the same time fries my brain. I knew Berkeley would be hard but I just feel so weak at this point for having bad mental health. I don’t think ppl around me rlly notice tho bc I obviously don’t show it. Idk it feels like everyone is doing just fine. And while that’s great and I’m glad for them. It makes me feeling even more alone. I’ve always been one to worry about the future. Hell I even worried abt getting into a good college and here I am complaining abt the next thing. I’m thinking of doing ochem and bio1a next yr for both semesters. And I feel like it’s gonna be even worse so I’m kind of dreading it. Plus cs/tech ppl feel so superior to me idk.

there's not much you can do at this point. summer break is coming up so that's something to look forward to. use that as motivation to get things done. learn from the mistakes of this semester so that you can avoid repeating them next semester.

UC Berkeley finally removed their trash from peoples park! Power to the people! ✊,https://i.redd.it/rkivpf2xmcba1.jpg,2023-01-10 16:21:31,,"Fuck that. Pave people’s park!

If you support people’s park i better see you lighting up a pipe there next time I walk by it
Move all student protestors into people's park tents. Sign me up! STOP THE RAID! STUDENT AMBASSADORS BY 2024!!!!
You fell for the propaganda when common sense is right in front of you
lol lets just hope that the uc continues to remove their trash including the trashy park
will you volunteer to help me safely cross around peoples park at night so that i can avoid being assaulted, you’ll need to be available monday-friday around 9pm! thank you for your sacrifice 🙌
L + ratio

Hey OP fuck you and fuck peoples park. Power to UC berkeley to pave that disgusting homeless encampment. Build that student housing for members of our society that are actually positively benefiting it in some way.
people's park ☕️
I think it’s funny how people think of the homeless in Berkeley as though they are Native Americans, and People’s Park is like “their land.” Even UCB feels morally obligated to build affordable housing units in place of People’s Park as some kind of weird parasocial reconciliation with the homeless who once lived there. I say, “fuck that,” just pave the fuckin park, make a bunch of regular-priced housing cuz they own the damn land and can do whatever the fuck they want with it. Then, do something that actually matters to bring down rent costs for all UCB students such that all housing becomes affordable, not just the small
subsection built over People’s Park.
They cleaned out all the homeless?
[deleted]
Maybe they will get to use tear gas now
A huge failure to all the students here.
That looks like Webcor's valuable construction equipment, just checked and the vagrants are still there.
Power to an extremist criminal tiny minority that cares more about being an “activist” than actually solving the homeless and housing crisis in Berkeley.
[deleted]
What was wrong with the telehandlers that they could not be driven?
Human beings are not trash.
Amazing
The park is a great green space with historical value but often times its not a park I would consider utilizing for anything that a park is generally used for. Its obvious the unhoused need a place to stay but the park is not the answer. I thought the construction was going to include low income apartments for individuals. Now they will go back to sleeping in their tents? What about the crime and other activity that is often associated with that park? I know at times its a great place to find drugs, that's not something I believe in protecting. The custodians at the UC cant even service the restrooms at the park due to safety concerns. If the park remains an open green area where typical park activates occur then I support it, but if it returns into another encampment for individuals who have often refused legitimate housing and/or services for addiction or mental health issues then I cant support that place. Guarantee we will get an advisory text stating some sort of crime was committed in or around that park shortly after it reopens and individuals occupy it again. I am not against them, I just know the trends.
SQUATTERS RIGHTS ARE STILL A THING.... THAT STILL APPLIES TO PEOPLES PARK. FUCK UC BERKELEY AND FUCK ALL YOU HATEFUL AND DISGUSTING STUDENTS ... YOU WERE QUICK TO HAND OUT TENTS... FREE METH PIPES AND NEEDLES WHICH U BOUGHT WITH CAL STUDENT AID...U HANDED OUT SHITTY VEGAN MEALS ...AND WATCHED THE HOMELESS SLOWLY DIE...U DESTROYED THE PARK AND KILLED WILDLIFE ON TOP OF TAKING PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES. FUCK YOU UC BERKELEY.... U ARE THE ULTIMATE ANTI CHRISTS. .. I HOPE U ENJOY LAUGHING AND SPITTING AT THE HOMELESS... HEARTLESS AND GODLESS DESPICABLE HUMAN BEINGS. FUCK YOU PEOPLE. YOU WERE NOT RAISED RIGHT.
How do you feel now lol
Cry never gonna happen haha
Not happening
I support human rights
You don’t even go here anymore go cry
You don’t even go here go cry
Not gonna happen us protestors here to fight back
That’s too early I would walk around midnight unharmed yall just a bunch of sussies
Thanks for supporting
Never gonna happen
I love it
Price will never be affordable
Nope they thriving there
Don’t keep your hopes up
Not happening lol
Students can go cry
The people will never leave
There’s nothing the city of Berkeley wants to do
Nah yall mad 🤣
They were completely destroyed by protestors
They are not
Yup so happy ucb removed their disgusting trash off the beautiful land
These people need to find a stable life first
You’re delusional bud, pave it on god
No you don’t. You care about being an “activist” instead of creating desperately needed housing.
Probably spent more time in Berkeley than you have in your whole life though lmao
And let me guess “us protestors” are the ones who also carry pepper sprays while walking by the park at 2am in the morning. Keep in mind UC Berkeley is a university, NOT a homeless encampment shelter service whatsoever. The “homeless encampment in disguised of a park” is owned by the UC and their job is to prioritize safety for the students by shutting that crime-infested place down.
nice so ur down to walk us all home, however i dont think the person who got assaulted via toilet seat last semester needs ur assistance first😍
Because you keep blocking any developments. Way to be a tool of the Berkeley oldsters that are actually deeply conservative
By thriving you mean trespassing private property (the park is owned by the UC regents SO NO IT IS NOT PUBLIC, so is the entire Berkeley campus fyi), infesting it with crime and needles, harassing students and making it a heaven for drug dealers?
you mean like permanent housing for 100 homeless people?

[https://peoplesparkhousing.berkeley.edu/supportive-housing](https://peoplesparkhousing.berkeley.edu/supportive-housing)

your protests have had a measurably negative impact on the lives of so many people and no positive impact except for your own sense of self.
By protestors you mean rioters and criminals. I hope you people get arrested and expelled from school.
[deleted]
Nobody except people who smoke crack would ever call this crime-infested homeless encampment beautiful lol
So your think it’s more stable for the homeless to live in tents rather than supportive housing?
Y’all delusional thinking it will be paved 🤣
Everyone needs activism
Nope uc doesnt care about the students, another year with the park’🎉
Not walking anyone home 🤣y’all old enough to walk home by yourself scaredy cats
There’s other places they can build on silly
Nope they are the residents of the park and deserve to be on that land
can someone explain this to me? i recently stumbled on this story, knowing nothing of california or UC Berkeley but i've been reading obsessively because i feel completely at a loss to understand whats going on here. The housing crisis in the California colleges was pretty shocking to me (everything I learned about california was shocking to me actually, really always thought people were exaggerating but man the state is a disaster!), and while I understand the initial concern about not wanting to proceed with development without securing a plan for what it'll mean for the people living there, once berkeley offered supportive housing, I really cannot possibly understand what the opposition is here. 

I understand that most of the people involved in the protests are students, but I used to work in social services in a city much bigger than berkeley, and not a day went by that I didn't meet with someone dreaming of a program just like this. There are so few programs that offer this kind of stability and support, that I'm curious if people don't really understand the gravity of what 100 spaces can really do. It's truly nothing to scoff at or dismiss and I understand it's not enough, but something like this will be changing lives for decades to come. Many of the programs like this we relied on were from the 70s and typically had 15-40 spaces at most, housing resources for the homeless, no matter how small, and particularly something like this which is regarded as a gold standard by many, always has an impact. and with 100 available spaces in a city as small as berkeley, I have to say as far as PR strategy concessions go, this offers long term impact in a way that impressed me. I get the sense that the housing situation in california is far more difficult and on tenderhooks than it is where I was (I can't seem to gauge if there are any real adults involved in the homeless outreach of this student movement, or any organized professional assistance or advocacy) but i guess I just feel like if the goal is to advocate for the homeless population, mission accomplished. this matters. 

if thats not the goal though, and its all about preserving the historical legacy of the park then thats fine I'll just never understand it i guess
Never gonna happen go cry
We dismantled all fences and destroyed equipment we are powerful
Drugs aren’t bad
not when it's anti-democratic. you're a vocal minority suppressing the will of the general public with the effect of harming a lot of people.
Weak argument
the university doesn't care about me and i dont care about the university. i also dont care about the mentally insane rapists who live in the park either. I dont care about the residence of berkeley.  I dont care about the protestors also. all i care about is myself and i want more student housing so i dont have to pay nearly as much in rent. how do you fix a housing problem? build more houses. FUCK THE PARK
ya bc statistically all the violent crimes in berkeley happened to children right, as if adults aren’t the one’s getting assaulted?
that's what they say about every proposed development.

that's literally what NIMBY means.
Nope honey. It is a privately owned land so no they are neither ReSiDeNtS of the park nor deserve to be on that land whatsoever. The correct word that you’re looking for is unlawful SQUATTERS.
A lot of people don't understand it. Students who protested it; they don't really care about the city of Berkeley. After graduating, they'll leave the place. And I've heard countless complaints from the UCB Alumni claiming that the city being unsafe and such. I just don't understand it either.
Oh but it will. Eventually you will lose.
Yeah crackhead
Nope just facts
The rapists are your frat bros and houses can be built in other areas
Y’all can go cry all you want the park is staying ✊
Nope they will stay there forever
Hey how about this. If you are okay with homeless people occupying privately owned land, why don’t you let them use your house and your parents’ house for housing first? Central heating at your parents’ place must be nice for them i think!
lol you really are a prime example of nimbyism. if you look into housing and renting anywhere in the bay area, you'll realize that sentiment of ""just build somewhere else"" doesn't work.

""just building somewhere else"" does ""work"" in places like texas but that comes at the cost of ruinously car dependent cities not to mention the environmental impact of endlessly developing previously undeveloped places.  

want to help homeless people and help people who are making minimum wage at the same time? build more homes so the cost of living wont be nearly as high. affordable housing is a matter of fixing the supply problem which people like you perpetuate.

arguably, your ""self virtue"" hurts poor people more than it helps. seriously, im not trying to be mean or anything, i seriously cant understand why  someone would not support the development of the park. why do you not support developing the parK?
Denying the eventual reality will not make it go away, but why would I be suprised that your are delusional.
The park will stay for another year, go worry about something else
And continue to be an eyesore and safety hazard yes unfortunately
Nothing y’all homeless haters can do about it
Why the fuck would you want support  the continuation of a dump/safety hazard to the community like that anyway? Do you think its good for the community to have homeless filthy drug addicted criminals living in our parks on our sidewalks etc you're literally brainless if you think this is a positive thing."
Should I take CS10 or CS61A?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14xvkfz/should_i_take_cs10_or_cs61a/,2023-07-12 10:50:35,"Hello fellow Bears, I am an incoming data science student and have to enroll in classes for the Fall semester. I was wondering whether given my experience, if I should take CS 61A or CS10? My high school did not offer AP Computer Science A or APCS Principles; however, my high school did offer two courses that were matriculated with CSU Sacramento’s two intro CS courses. I got credit for taking Intro to CS and Computer Programming/C++ in my high school, as it was equivalent to Sac State’s courses. 

However, if I am being honest, my only experience with computer science lies with taking Computer Programming/C++ my senior year. I didn’t really learn much in intro to CS since it was all block code. I did learn a lot in my Computer programming course, but I feel like I forgot quite a bit of what we learned in class. However, I did gain some experience working with C++, C#, and Arduino code. I came in a lot for after-school tutoring and tried my best learning programming. I earned an A and then a B for both semesters, and the equivalent college course was called ""programming logic"". Given this, however, I am not too sure whether to take CS 61A or CS 10, since I heard the course teaches python and I do not know any Python. Should I take CS 10 or CS 61A? I want to earn at least an A in the course and be well prepared for CS61B Data Structures. 

Also does anyone know how to sign up for CS Mentors? Thank you for all your help!","If you try out Python for a little before before classes start I think you’d be fine with 61a. In my opinion cs10 goes pretty slow, and is only worth it for people who haven’t had an introduction to programming yet. Go on [61a’s website](https://cs61a.org) and see if you understand any of it. If you’re semi-prepared up until midterm 1, then you’ll be perfectly fine.
I would look into the material on the site and see if you can somewhat understand the material up to recursion. If you have an idea of what's going on, 61a will be fine.

If not, you could look into data 8 as well. afaik, it's a requirement for data science anyway and is also known as a course that helps you prepare for 61a
as long as you know what loops are and how to declare and update variables you'll be okay. this was the only stuff i knew before 61a and got an A. if you know what recursion is, gg you should have an easy time at least up to the first midterm"
R&C and SEED Invites,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1146h15/rc_and_seed_invites/,2023-02-16 16:59:29,"I was told on the berkeley admissions portal that I am invited to be interviewed for the R&C scholarship. I was also given a chance to apply for the SEED program.

I just wanted to make sure as a candidate for the R&C scholarship, there is nothing that restricts me and doesn’t allow me to also apply to the SEED program, correct?

I have all the essays and rec letters done for SEED so if I am actually not allowed to turn them in that would be a bummer…","That's correct. There are plenty of people who are both regents and seed scholars
Got it thank you! Also for submitting the SEED rec letters do we have our recommenders send them directly to berkeley?? The instructions for submitting them are kind of vague on the portal..

Thank you!
Is there not a section you coudl submit the letters of rec in the portal? I would email the program just in case if you're unsure
  
The portal says to email them with a specific email address for SEED that they list out. I am having my recommenders send them directly because I think that is the most formal way to do it. I may email the program but the entire application is due tomorrow so I'm not sure if they will get the chance to get back to me on that :/"
Is an applied math major too difficult for someone who got a B in Calc BC? (& wants to go to grad school),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1btt0rr/is_an_applied_math_major_too_difficult_for/,2024-04-02 00:53:17,"I for applied math on my application and got accepted into the college of L&S. I’m not going to lie, I do enjoy doing math but I am not great at it. I have averaged low As to mid Bs in all my high school math courses. I am taking Calculus BC this year as a senior and had a C for most of the semester but luckily raised it to a mid B. I study like crazy and genuinely enjoy math as a subject but I only manage to pull off mediocre grades. With that being said, is Berkeley applied math too difficult for me considering I’ve struggled with high school math. Im worried about getting into a post-grad school if I go this route as I heard grade deflation is pretty bad and I am a pretty bad test taker. Another question…is post grade necessary for applied math majors? The idea of being employable right after undergrad is very appealing to me and I don’t necessarily prefer doing post grad. My other option for college is UCR for ME if that narrows anything down.","No, it’s doable! I was also a straight B’s student in high school math and didn’t even take BC. Just use the resources you’re given like office hours and focus on internalizing the material on the homework
Woah you remind me of myself. I had a B- in calc bc. I didn’t know how to study in high school and thought math wasn’t for me, but still decided to give it another shot at Berkeley. 

I had the option to go straight into math1B from high school, but decided to start from math1A with the idea of rebuilding my foundations (I’m not saying you need to start from math1A, it’s all anecdotal, what works for me might not be the best option for you.) Even though this was supposed to be an “easy” class I still had a lot of trouble with it. It felt like I was taking calculus for the first time. High school math is very different from college math (at least in my experience). I realized after I bombed the first midterm that I really had to update my study strategies and be more intentional with the work that I did. So i reached out to professors, did hw in office hours, asked directly how you’re supposed to study, asked people smarter than me what works, etc. 

 I ended up declaring applied math last semester and got an A in all my lower division math courses (except a B in 54 but whatever we ball) 

It takes a lot of intentional work, a lot of questions, and a some stubbornness to pursue something you’re not immediately good at. If you want to be a math major and are willing to put in the effort, you’ll be able to pull through. You might also take a few math courses and realize that maybe you don’t like math as much as you thought you did, which is also fine. A lot of people spend their first year just figuring out what they like and don’t like. I thought I wanted to do physics until I took physics 5a. I think you should give Berkeley math a chance. Worst case scenario, you find out you don’t like it and study something else. I personally wouldn’t choose UCR for the reasons you stated, math is hard wherever you go so might as well give it a try it at one of the best institutions to do it.

 As for your post grad question, it really depends on what it is you want to get into. I know of people who get tech or finance positions right after graduation. Applied math is really broad so it’s up to you to cater your courses and experiences in a way that makes you appealing for whatever industry you’re trying to break into. A lot of people double major too. 
Nah.

I almost failed multi variate calc in college, and statics too. I’m now doing a PhD in bioengineering at Cal, with a focus on statistics.
Level of ""grade inflation"" here varies wildly by professor. Some folks curve, others don't, some have bins, so your mileage may vary.

As the other person said, high school math and college math (especially upperdiv) differ quite a bit, so they could use different study styles and stuff. (This should not be a piece of discouragement)

Good luck!

Also, MUSA (the math undergrad student association at UCB) is hosting a ""Shadow a Math Major day"" on Friday the 12fth of April (the day before Cal Day) where you meet math majors, visit math classes, and stuff. Highly recommend you attend
Grades at this school are basically determined by tests. To be blunt, you do need good grades to go to grad school and I’m not sure your struggle in Calc BC is going to cut it. I’m not saying you can’t change and become an academic weapon but I feel like math is a subject where you either got it or you don’t. When you say post grad school I’m assuming you mean grad school. This raises another question. Why do you want to go to grad school? Also, I highly doubt going to UCR will solve the problem and that is not a good move in terms of academics and the opportunities. I used to enjoy math in hs too but then it got to a point where I was just spending my time doing repetitive problem sets. HS math is nothing like advanced math just saying so you might not actually enjoy it. Just proofs on proofs on proofs and more symbols, less numbers. Luckily L&S allows you to double major relatively easily so you could add something to it to make you more marketable if grad school is not the move.
You’ll be fine, if you want to do math berkeley is a great school for it, do not limit yourself like that. You got in so people at the school also believe in you.
If you're available on Friday the 12fth of April (day before cal day), MUSA (the math undergrad student association at UCB) will be hosting a ""shadow a math major day"" where you visit and go in groups to math classes.

yeah a big thing is to start the homework when it's assigned so you can sink time into really *thinking* about it
Am I able to take classes slowly ? I’m honestly not sure how it works but how many math classes does one usually take per semester? From what I’ve read online, the major has very few required classes. I feel like if I am able to take the required math classes slowly and gradually take upper div math, I’ll be able to not fail.
What did you major in for undergrad? I’m interested in bioengineering as well but because I got admitted to l&s, I’m unsure whether switching majors is even an option since it’s in the engineering department. Would you recommend I minor or double major with applied math? I’m honestly not really sure how it works
I honestly don’t want to go to grad school since I want to start working right after my undergrad  but my entire family is telling me that you need a masters degree or PhD to find a job with an applied math major that’s as well paying as say an engineering degree. From what I’ve seen, most statistician and mathematician jobs require higher education like a masters or PhD. What are other high demand job opportunities that I can look into that won’t require me to do more school?  Thank you!!
I majored in BioE too. My friends were able to minor in math, I almost did, but I was too busy doing premed. I ended up minoring in EECS. I like engineering, personally. I like the problem solving, projects, challenges."
I’m concerned about my new blind friend,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ws2ite/im_concerned_about_my_new_blind_friend/,2022-08-18 19:50:37,"I made a new friend whom I met at GBO orientation check-in and she is blind and uses a cane to guide her path.

Now, while I don’t know what kind of accommodations she has been given inside her classrooms when the semester starts next week, I was extremely shocked when I found out that the GBO Help desk, nor the DSP office gave her any kind of walk assistance to/from her Residence hall, to/from all her classrooms, to/from the dining halls when needed, to/from the restroom, and to/from any important event related to her courses and GBO.

My new friend said that they told her that she needs a friend/family-member to do all the above. Unfortunately, she has nobody except me that cares (she told me she has fights with her mom and a caring older brother who lives at SoCal; I don’t know the rest of her family situation). 

I personally am unable to help any further because, one, it happened twice that I became soo tired and just wanted to go back to my RH, two, I’m soo busy with my own things (I’m EECS major ☹️), and lastly, there’s so much overlap in our schedules.

Here’s my humble request: 

Is there anybody or do you know anybody who lives at Stern/Foothill that can volunteer to give her the walking assistance to/from wherever she needs? (PM me, if so) If not, can you file some kind of a complaint to the appropriate offices as to how the heck did she not receive access to any of these services! It’s my second day at Cal so I am clueless on how to do this myself.

Please guys, I know me and her met only yesterday but I DON’T WANT my new friend to be abandoned and forced to leave Cal simply due to a disability!! A degree from Cal will surely god-willing help her!

Thank you!


UPDATE #1:

First off, I’m am overwhelmed by the amount of support I received from all of you lovely students. Thank you so much!

So, here’s an update: Just for this week during the entire GBO week (08/18-08/22), I got permission from the GBO help desk to not only beat the long lines and get my own breakfast lunch and dinner early, but I also got permission to get my friends food as well. So like, every time I go to the group dining areas I get two meals: one for myself and one for my friend. Then, I’m able to deliver her food to her by her RH building main door and she’s able to use her cane to walk up to that main door and get her food.

As for all the other events, she insisted that she was totally ok with staying in her RH and not going to any of the events for the entire GBO such as the company-visit/excursion since everyone including me had to go to their own but yeah she was fine with it.

Finally, as for the most important assistance that she needs (food and getting safely to all her classes starting 08/24): It looks like her RH (which is a single and has her own bathroom) is located in such a way that she is easily able to access her local dining hall right next to her RH! (It was only GBO food locations that was an entire mess because she was unable to eat on her local dining hall next to her cuz apparently, it was reserved for other groups, but fortunately, it’s gonna get waaay better after GBO, that is, she won’t need me to deliver food to her after GBO anymore).

As for her classes, she told me she spoke to her counselor and they talked about getting all her Professors to release a recording of the lectures online for her to access and so she wouldn’t need to come to campus AT ALL, which she says would be a great help. (she takes mostly Sociology courses).

So with all that being said, I’m going to call her up 2 days after classes start (or whenever she calls me) and ask her how everything went and then I’ll give you guys another update.

For all of you who PM,d me offering your help and writing up some amazing suggestions in the comments (which I have made her aware of for consideration like the Loop golf cart, Ed Roberts Campus, etc.): I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH! Know that I see you, and my prayers go to you whatever you real names may be! May you all find the success you’re looking for! God Bless all of you!","If UC campus isn't helpful, consider reaching out to the [Ed Roberts Campus](https://www.edrobertscampus.org/) (basically on top of Ashby BART).

This sounds in line with their mission and they may be able to point you and your friend to resources.
I dont go to cal anymore but damn thats pretty messed up that they dont offer some help/services
That is absolutely unacceptable. I’m a DSP student and although I’m not blind, I have mobility issues due to my chronic illness. They offered me the golf cart system that can take disabled students around campus. I’m not sure if that would help your friend, but it might be a step in the right direction if she can get something like that. 

I also live in Bowles, which is close-ish to Stern and Foothill. I can’t walk too far and if I get tired really easily, but if we can get her to a halfway point and if her classes are close to mine, I can be a buddy to walk around with.
Next step is to complain to the 504/Ada compliance  officer. 

https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/policies/policies-guidelines/dsp-complaint-resolution-process

https://dac.berkeley.edu/home

Also, SF Lighthouse for the Blind, Cal Disability Cultural Center, Cal Disabled Student Coalition, and UC Berkeley Disability Lab for possibly more resources.
What the actual fuck is wrong with Berkeley lol. Ummm if I’d you I’d call dsp and ask why they’re not accommodating a literal blind girl. Im not quite who else to call/report this matter to. When you complain to dsp, ask them who else they should complain too. 

Or you know what email the chancellor department: chancellor@berkeley.edu and ask them what’s up. I emailed there before about a serious issue and they actually responded pretty quickly
Thank you for your solidarity. On top of what others have already shared, I have a number of other suggestions/elaborations:

1. Disability Access & Compliance -- aka the 504/ADA Compliance Office -- covers non-academic accommodations and ensures that these laws are followed to prevent disability discrimination. Derek Coates, who is Blind himself, is their Program Access Compliance Manager and can probably address this immediately (or connect you with [other staff](https://dac.berkeley.edu/about-us) who can). This may be more for one-off instances, but [their Mobility Accommodation page](https://dac.berkeley.edu/services/mobility-accommodation) allows people to request info on the ""\[e\]asiest, safest and most convenient path of travel"". Your friend should also be able to [get a service dog](https://dac.berkeley.edu/resources/animals-accommodations), though I recognize that may be a longer process than they have time for in their first semester. They also have [other resources on Navigating Berkeley](https://dac.berkeley.edu/navigating-berkeley) and [other disability resources more generally](https://dac.berkeley.edu/resources/students).
2. If DSP is not providing required services, the [Student Advocates Office](https://advocate.berkeley.edu/grievance/) has a whole department that is dedicated to addressing those kinds of grievances. They may also cover DAC, but if not there are many disability law offices, including [Disability Rights Advocates](https://dralegal.org/contact-us/) in Berkeley, who may offer pro bono legal services (they have done so in the past).
3. Contact the ASUC Disabled Students Commission -- via [email](mailto:disabledstudentscommittee@asuc.org), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DSCBerkeley), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asucdisabled) \-- which has other disabled undergrads and grad students who work together to spotlight these issues. (And/or join the [DSC mailing listserv](https://groups.google.com/g/DCCatCal/) to reach out to everyone who's a part of that.) For example, they are often connected to leaders in the disability-related offices and can collaborate with ASUC officials to make issues known and get action taken -- one of the former Co-Chairs is now an ASUC Senator, [Carlos Vázquez](https://www.instagram.com/senatorelect_carloscvazquez/). It's not always effective, but it may be. And your friend will at least be connected with others who have been wronged by the system and are working to address these issues.
4. If your friend needs an extra push, encourage her to reach out to the [Daily Cal](https://www.dailycal.org/about). They often cover scandals like this (news stories and self-written op-eds), and I've found that it often ends up pushing the needle.
5. It shouldn't take big tech to address basic issues of accessibility, but there are smartphone apps that use a live stream from your camera for an employee to provide audio directions for navigating campus. One is called [Aira, which offers visual interpreting services](https://aira.io/), and [UCSD even covers it for their Blind students](https://osd.ucsd.edu/resources/aira.html). If Cal won't do anything else and/or as a temporary solution, they should at least cover whatever this service costs.
6. [Georgina Kleege](https://english.berkeley.edu/profiles/45) is a rad professor on-campus, and [Ann Wai-Yee Kwong](https://dac.berkeley.edu/cacdap-members) is Cal's [Disability Community Cultural Center Coordinator](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/10/29/im-a-berkeleyan-staffer-ann-wai-yee-kwong-wants-you-to-thrive/); both are Blind. If either of them has the capacity (it's not necessarily their jobs to do this work, and the semester is starting for them too, but they both care a lot), they would be some of the few people on campus with lived experience and insider suggestions on what to do, whom to reach out to, and how to get action taken.

Feel free to connect me and your friend (via DM)! It always pains me to see this shit happening, though it's not surprising for me at this point. But again, thank you for reaching out for support.

Sources: I co-founded the Commission with other disabled student organizers, wrote op-eds and organized a successful campaign when admin defunded (or ""let funding lapse"") for an important disability program, met and collaborated with lots of comrades and allies who have worked for and within these organizations, minored in Disability Studies, and was generally pretty enmeshed within the disability community at Cal.
Actually i am at foothill so if you want to talk more about this DM me
DSP is full of a bunch of knuckle draggers who don't respond to emails and pretend that student disabilities will go away if they ignore them
Why do these people expect Berkeley to come find them and offer them help, a cursory Google search would have revealed DSP accommodations
Idk if this is gonna help but I’ll tag some berkeley-campus affiliated or related accounts I can think of. Hope they see this and can point to help or resources

Hi! Can you PM me? I work with GBO and can help
Hi, reach out to folks at the Disability Lab and they should be able to set her up with some accommodations sans UCB bureaucracy
From being a TA, my understanding is that if you have some condition which prevents you from going places then they can give you accommodations to not go to class without affecting your grade, have access to recorded lectures, etc but only if you're in the DSP program.

I'm guessing their friend isn't in the DSP program so they cant make any accommodations like that -- or that they do have such accommodations and that this is more about daily help outside of classes. In which case, a friend of mine who uses an electronic wheelchair was able to get housing on the bottom floor with access to a short direct ramp nearby, and he has a remote necklace to open doors automatically for him so he can easily go to/from the restroom. I would look into stuff like that as I think it could help you as well, OP!
I was thinking the loop could help too.
I'm at UCLA now. But looks like ya got some good replies in this thread!"
Help me pick a schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/146tsth/help_me_pick_a_schedule/,2023-06-11 06:20:32,"Interests: double major as cognitive science, political science with a minor in CS.

* reserved seats for Stat 8 and Data 8 for incoming freshman
* maybe a bit boring —> could take a fun decal class?
* after Data 8 I can progress to CS61B and be prepared for CS61A (though taking the class would cancel any credit I got) but I can’t take CS61C without 61A? how strict are the perquisites
* Would be meeting two perquisites for cognitive science

* losing out on reserved seating of classes above
* Meeting political science perquisite + cognitive science math perquisite 

\--------

Any suggestions/advice/anything really would be so appreciated <3

sincerely,

your classic over-thinker","I usually like to recommend 1 eng 1 math 1 breadth 1 major, so given that, maybe something like:

R&C A, Math 1A, PoliSci 5 or breadth, Data 8.
You can take CS61C but it would have to be in the summer because CS61C is a class that you take after major declaration. Also, I wouldn't place any bets on the CS minor. It's practically impossible to do because classes are restricted to only CS and DS majors, unless you take all the upper divs in the summer. 

I also noticed that in Version 1, you have Data 88C in your schedule, but you also mentioned that you already have 61A credit under your belt. You do not have to take it again, as Cogsci and CS will take both of the CS61A credit. If you somehow decide to do DS, the credit can be used as well.

So I would personally do Version 1, and replace 88C with Math 1A. But this would be a very intense schedule as all of them would be weeder classes.
If it were me I’d do 

- Pop Sci 5 (it’s in both of your schedules. Does it fulfill a breadth you need?)

- Math 1A (like you said, you need this. Plus your future CSDS classes may make a lot more sense with basic calculus and 1A isn’t all that hard. I think most CS and DS majors get all the way to 53 even though it’s not required for either major, and I don’t think you should fall behind)

- Data 8 (it’s relatively easy [i say this because it is by far the easiest technical class you will take but it is still more challenging than breadth classes] and you need it. It helps with 61A if you have no programming experience. Take it if you can phase 1!!)

- R&C (you can phase 2 this if you are ok with getting a theme you’re not interested in),
Thank you <3
Is there value to a cs minor in the workforce? I don’t want to be behind when it comes to the way the digital world is taking over that’s why I was considering the minor :(
I am super passionate about politics and 90% sure I am majoring in political science so it fulfills a prerequisite to declare the major <3 
I was thinking of doing stat 20 instead of data 8 but my advisor said its too difficult of a course for first year <3
I wouldn’t do Stat 20. It fulfills fewer requirements, it’s considered harder, and most students vastly prefer Data C8
It fulfils the stat requirement for B.A, legal studies, cognitive science. If I want to meet the stat requirement using Data C8 I would have to take CS88 with it for some majors.
I personally think everyone should learn programming but if you have no interest in it do Stat 20
I would love to learn how to program in fact I want to minor in CS but it seems impossible?

I am not sure I am quiet lost

Version 1 has data 8 and cs88, what do you think?"
How to fix this horrendous gpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ru1bwq/how_to_fix_this_horrendous_gpa/,2022-01-01 20:18:07,"Im a freshman and having completed one semester, my gpa sits at a 2.7 (i had 2 graded courses and got an A- in one of them and a C+ in the other). I finished high school with a 4.6 so im in a sort of state of shock? I knew college was different and I certainly did not expect straight A’s this time around but I also didn’t expect a gpa that starts with a 2. Anyone have any words of advice or encouragement on how to recover, fix my gpa, and move forward? Because im kind of panicking right now and feel like this is gonna hurt me in the long run, especially considering i wanna go to law school after this and my gpa will be very important","You’ll end up taking at least 80 graded units, assuming those were four unit courses you’ve taken at most 10% of your graded coursework, so you have plenty of time to turn your GPA around!
What class was the A- and C+ in? Did you like the class you got a C- in or not? What do you think led to that low grade - and what can you do to change that moving forward? What is your intended major? 

I ask because, while a low grade in intro history (for example) doesn’t mean you can’t succeed as a history major, it *could maybe* indicate that you don’t “click” with that subject. Law school is nice because you can major in anything so i recommend that you pick something you enjoy that you also know you can do reasonably well in. 

The other possibility is: you just did not have effective study/learning habits and/or writing skills to succeed in a college level class. Maybe attending office hours to clarify concepts and get feedback on essay drafts will help. Maybe simply more time needs to be spent studying (you cannot just go to lecture and expect to score highly as perhaps you could in high school, you have to spend more time reviewing and drilling information on your own than you spend actually in class). Maybe eliminating distractions will help. 

That is for you to reflect on and not for me to make assumptions about you :)
I started with a 2.8 my first year. I took some time off to work on issues besides academics, mainly mental and physical health. After making headway on those problems, I came back to school and was able to focus on academics. My GPA got better and I am planning on going to grad school for a PhD. I think grad schools will see it was your first semester of college and be somewhat understanding, more so if you were working hard and not partying all day.
Your situation reminds me of my own experience at the end of my first semester. I got a C- in Math 53 (getting something like 26% where exam averages were in the 30's) and I was also sitting at a 2.7 at the end of freshman year. I felt pretty discouraged especially because 53 came sort of like as a shock, making me face the harsh reality that college math courses were radically different from high school math courses. I proceeded to be pretty much a B / B+ / B- student in every technical course until my senior year where I received solid A's in every technical course I took. I ended up graduating with a 3.5 after everything was said and done.  

I think for me, the biggest change I made over the four years was learning how to study effectively for myself. My memory is far from photographic so I needed to start preparing for exams earlier than my friends, utilizing office hours prior to the exam date to ask questions on areas I needed to strengthen my understanding in, and re-reviewing the most important information (and making a cheat sheet) right before the exam. Sounds reasonable and somewhat obvious but I found that a lot of folks I know did not fully utilize all the resources (e.g. office hours, tutoring, etc.) available to students. Prior to my senior year, I, myself, was doing a lot of cramming a few days before the exam which ended up not being a good studying strategy (though I know it is effective for other folks).

It's hard for me to speak in detail, not knowing you or your situation too well apart from what you've included in our post. But do know that stumbling in life is how we learn. The moments where we struggle and undergo hardship can be the gateways that empower us to grow the most. You've got multiple years left in your degree, take this opportunity to reflect on the past year. You'll be stronger next year because of this.
It’ll be alright friend, I was almost exactly the same! I had a 2.8 GPA after my first semester. I was horrifically depressed and had absolutely zero motivation and ended up getting Cs in a lot of my classes just because I didn’t have the energy to turn in small assignments and go to class ( I didn’t step into a lecture hall after like September unless it was for midterms or finals and this was before COVID 😬) I think the best thing I did was giving myself a lot of grace - we go to a school that highly emphasizes grades and places them at the top in terms of success, but it truly is not the end of the world. Especially because it’s your first semester. Here’s some stuff I did to my raise my GPA (I have a 3.7 now). Take from it what is helpful! 
- Take a (or a few) language class if it fits in your schedule.I took French 1 the next semester, and it truly is a class that you can get an A in purely by putting in effort, since a lot of the grade is attendance and small in-class assignments. Since it’s 5 units, it’ll help boost your GPA. I actually ended up taking up to French 4 because I loved the class so much and it’s a nice contrast from the other classes in my schedule. 
- As many have said, take “easy” classes that’ll boost your GPA. Berkeleytime is a great resource for this!Something that was helpful was looking up the syllabus for a class you’re interested in taking, so you can see the grade breakdown and about how much effort you’d need to put in to get an A. 
- Take light classes over the summer. I took two breadth classes over the summer Freshman and Sophomore year (not concurrently - they were in different sessions) and by taking 6 or more units I was able to get a loan that paid for them in full. It’s a bummer taking classes over the summer but the extra units just helped in upping my GPA. 
- If you’re struggling in a class, talk to your professor. I know it can seem really scary but a lot of them truly just want to see you succeed - so many extensions, grade rounding, and overall grace in grading just came from talking to the prof about how I was struggling. Professors are people too! 
- If you can, try and pinpoint why exactly you think you got the grades you did. Was it poor mental health? Poor study habits? If it’s the former, I highly highly recommend expressing this to friends or family or a professional that can provide you with resources to get better because it’s very difficult to ‘willpower’ your way out of it. If it’s the latter, which is common as studying for college is a lot different than for high school, the school has so many resources to help guide you in the right direction, the SLC being the one I used a lot! They have a writing center and review groups for specific courses that coordinate with the professor and provide a shit ton of practice problems and online review sessions, and they have drop-in tutoring so you can drop by whenever fits your schedule. 
Just make sure to keep yourself in mind, you’re a person first before you’re a GPA or a law school applicant. College is a huge adjustment! Especially now in the super weird times that we live in. Give yourself the empathy you’d give a friend. It might seem like a huge deal now (trust me I’ve been there) but you really have a lot of time to fix this. This’ll be a speck in your rear view in a few years!
You should at least look through the exam rubrics to see what went wrong and see if that gives you ideas on how to improve. If that doesn't work, e.g. you can't find where in the course material the covered concepts are, or the rubrics don't make sense at all etc, you can contact your GSI or even Professor and ask them for a walk-through so they can give you more insights into where you missed out (the GSIs won't get paid for that as it's after the end of the class but inquiries like that are not very common so as a GSI I'd say most will be happy to help). Bonus with that is that you'll make some connections for references. Taking exams is about receiving information, choosing what to retain, applying what you retained and communicating the result of that application in a manner clear to the examiner; maximizing your GPA is little more than honing these skills over and over again. Also, remember that if there is a time where grad schools don't give a shit about your below-average grades it's definitely freshman year.
I am also a freshman here at Cal, first semester. Two weeks before finals my personal expectation for my overall GPA was 0.7. I ended with a surprising 1.5. I was a straight A, some B student in high school with a 4.8 GPA, top of class, sports, clubs, etc. Coming from such a well-rounded and successful high school background, I also never expected to be on academic probation. 
However, do not look at this 2.7 GPA as a bad thing at all, college is a learning experience and you will undoubtedly fail a few times before you learn the ways of how life works best for you! Don’t fret fellow freshman! We have seven more semesters here at cal! Make these next years count and everything will absolutely fall into place.
Take some gpa boosters. Music 27, music 29 and espm 6 are all solid options if you want very little work and almost a guaranteed A
First, I love how supportive this sub is. More so than you'd find on others. 

Second, the same thing happened to me and I just got into several law schools! You can recover and you CAN do this! 

Take a proper break, rest, and get healthy. Then dig into your studies and do nothing else unless it's related to your health or school. Workout, cook healthy meals, etc., but don't drink, don't party, don't do anything that distracts you for more than the time allotted. For me, that meant no dating. For you, that could mean something else. Best of luck!
I had a similar experience. Academic probation by my second year. Turned out I had untreated ADHD. I dropped out and got a tech job with insurance, got myself treated, and when I came back I pulled straight As. Not saying this is gonna be your exact story, but rather just pointing out that it's important to try and be realistic and introspective and self-compassionate about what's holding you back.
I got a D- in a class during my first semester and ending up graduating with a . . . 3.4? 3.5? Something like that. The D- was actually quite useful in terms of guiding me away from what I wasn't going to do well in, and was inconsequential by graduation time.

Don't worry, I'll wager you won't have any trouble finding a solid law school very willing to let you pay them tuition :)
Go to more office hours in classes you're struggling in. The hardest classes I took I ended up with the best grades from getting help with homework in office hours.
Bro, you're a first semester freshman complaining about a C- in a class. You literally have 3.5 years to fix this shit you're gonna be okay. Especially since its in your freshman courses and people like a good comeback story. You have 1-2 more semesters of shitty grades before people start you judge you harsher.
I think the first step is to not beat yourself up! This is your first semester and it was difficult one with it being hybrid. I think you should spend some time going over what you can do better in preparation for next semester. Also come up with a general plan for how you are going to approach fixing those mistakes. This was my first semester too but I’m a transfer student so I’ve had some college experience and I still have faults. This semester I spent too much time on my phone and procrastinating studying and I’m coming up with ways to be more productive next semester. Despite this I did pretty well overall and I think another thing that allowed me to do well was setting goals and expectations. I envisioned what grades/gpa I wanted and and once class started I created a game plan on how to get those grades (or close to them). I also HIGHLY encourage you to use rate my professor which I can say without a doubt has gotten me this far in college. Getting an idea about how professors teach the class and the workload is important and usually you can get an idea from rate my professor and Reddit!! I hope this was helpful, keep your head up and feel free to pm me if you have any questions!!
Just don’t list it on your resume, make sure you know the practical stuff. You should be fine
Me exactly, 36 years ago.  I graduated with a 3.8.  That was the only C I ever got.  First semester is a wake up call for many over-achievers.  The big brain that got you that 4.6 probably meant you didn't have to study as hard and things came easier to you in high school than they will at Cal.  You'll develop better study habits, make use of office hours and do more problem sets.  You'll find your way.  Welcome to the big leagues.  (My C+ was Chem 1A, after breezing through high school chemistry)
I agree with all the folks that say not to despair and you have time to turn it around, but I'll add something different. If you don't make the actual effort to turn it around you'll be making the same post in a year and at that time it will be a lot harder to resolve. 
Be an active participant in raising your grades. Use campus tutoring, office hours etc. Don't take quizzes and midterms lightly with the assumption you'll recover on the final. And start everything early so you have time to get help on stuff you're stuck on. Finally, take care of your health by eating and sleeping well - people underestimate how important that is.

So yes, you can turn it around but don't assume it will be easy and tackle it with everything you've got. You will be so proud of your accomplishments after - even if you accomplish straight B's - you'll know how much work and honest effort you put in. Best of luck!

If you want to go to law school, youre going to need to buckle down. You got time to spare, but no time to waste. 

Nobody looks at first two years of college on grad apps anyways. Just use this year as a lesson and grind harder. 

Choose two: Social Life, Sleep, Grades.
Did you try? And was that C a major class? Sometimes getting a C is an early sign that the material just doesn’t interest you all that much, and you should think about what to make of that as early as possible.
I was in the same place as you right after my first semester. Boosting your GPA is somewhat of an “art”… there is no formula to getting good grades like there was in high school - every class is different and every professor grades differently. 

With more time comes more experience. You’ll know what classes to take and what classes not to take. Talk to your peers, especially upperclassman, and ask them what they took to boost their GPA! Not to mention, freshman classes are always the hardest and most competitive. Don’t be discouraged. Your grades will naturally increase over time as you take more and more upper division classes that (IMO) tend to be graded more leniently.
I ended my first year with a 2.7 and now I have around a 3.7 and I still have a semester left!! Take classes during the summer and change how you study. Go to office hours, join study groups through discord, and prioritize understanding the material not just going to lecture and taking notes. Also, going to OH and asking the professor questions will help you see what they emphasize as important or not… naturally they will explain more about what they think is important to know and usually that appears more on exams because they write them. I also think taking classes with friends helped me so much with accountability!
What classes did you struggle with? Are they related to your major or simply ones that you wanted to try out? In the long run, college is a testing period to see what things stick and you can build off of — to develop interest anf cultivate it. Personally, I performed below average in one of my classes and didn’t achieve as high as I wanted in another, so I can sympathize with your concerns.
your gpa is only low because of one class. if you know why you did bad in that one class and it’s something fixable, or you don’t need to take a bunch more classes similar to that one, you will be fine. 

also, something that i tell myself that helps me accept grades is that they’re just a byproduct of your effort, genetics, and other external uncontrollable circumstances. control what you can control, and don’t worry about the rest (because there’s nothing you can do). simply worrying about grades won’t get them up, it’s understanding the material and demonstrating that understanding through assignments, projects, labs, exams, etc. 

the moment i became less fixated on numbers, and only focused on putting in my best effort while not making too many sacrifices in other facets of my life, my grades went up a lot, (3.0 overall first semester to a 3.3 overall in my 3rd semester, so it’s nothing crazy to be honest), but i was a lot happier while doing it. you aren’t in college to hunt for A’s on a transcript like most of us did in high school, we’re here to learn and get ready for careers in the real world and/or find a rich cs/haas sugar mommy.

of course, grades do matter, but i’m just saying if your life is going to revolve around school, make it about learning and not the gpa. because if you do this, the gpa will handle itself.
Don’t forget about pass/no pass. You can transfer units from another institution like online BYU I am actually not sure if this counts as a gpa now that I am recalling. But units are units babyyyy. Take less units it doesn’t matter if you finish in 5 or 7 years. You are doing great you are at the number 1 university in the world. Find some strategies that work for you. People abuse adderall too. Get your mindset right you can do this it’s all hard work. Read mindset by carol dweck. 

I had good grades in high school and thought anyone that didn’t was stupid. I never tried hard at anything and it came naturally. I judged others in high school by how smart they were with their fixed innate talent. Mine was better therefore I was better by getting a better GPA. Peoples smartness is not their GPA OR how innately genius they are. If you’re thinkin like this check yourself before you wreck yourself. There are so many ways to get better you just have to accept you can get better.
First semester is always a wake up call.
This is very comforting thank you so much!!!!
Thank you so much, i really really appreciate this response and has definitely given me some things to think about and consider
I felt shitty starting undergrad, but was able to turn around the downwards trend. You can as well
Thank you so much for your response. Good luck with the phd!!!
Thank you so much this comment! I really really appreciate your words and how much you’ve given me to think about and consider :)
Thank you so much for this comment, i really really appreciate it :)
Incredibly well balanced. I predict you will go far in this life of ours because you know how to deal with change and disappointment. Not that you’re a failure, just that it was a hard semester.
(ps - it was a Hard semester all around. Spring may also be hard.)


Bottom line is: this is just the beginning for both of you. Life is a series of failures with occasional wins.  How you choose to deal with setbacks is EVERYTHING. Sincerely. 

Keep your head up, soon you will be UC Berkeley graduates. Enjoy this time with all of its hardships, setbacks, and temporary struggles. 

You can do it!  Spring 2022! Woot!

Also, office hours, study groups, questions in class, department advisors.
Thank you so much :)) good luck to you!!
Gpa boosters definitely arent something i’ve thought about, thank you!
Fuck the music classes. Sight SINGING in front of the WHOLE CLASS??!?! You crazy. Art 8 is crazy easy also art 12 the drawing one? 

3 projects graded on how hard you’ve tried.
Do you happen to know which is an easier A, music 26AC or music 29? Thanks.
Right? This sub is insanely supportive its amazing. Congratulations on the law schools!!!
Thank you so much for your reply!! I really appreciate it :)

I'd be a little hesitant of this. So early in college, you should be more concerned with figuring out what you want to study, what career you want to pursue etc. than taking classes just to boost your GPA, can't hurt too much if it's a breadth though. It's fair to consider GPA since it's important for your career goals, but it's also important to remember to actually learn things and have a rich and educational college experience. People can get to a point where they won't take a class that is interesting/valuable to them because they're worried about not getting an A.

Besides that, just know that it's a pretty common experience. Some schools do all classes P/NP for the first semester or first year to help students get used to college which I think is nice. A big part of success in college is first understanding how it works (college classes can be very different from high school classes), then understanding how to effectively study/work and use resources like office hours and the SLC, and finally just putting in the hours. By my final years I would just study a full 20 hours for each technical midterm, mostly the week and weekend before, when I pretty much never studied for tests in high school.

But if you need GPA boosters at some point, some research credits are graded and would be pretty much guaranteed A's unless your supervisor is a dick. I worked in a lab for a few years and got like 3 semesters of A from research credit.
Dont be a pussy!
ACs are almost always more work due to readings
Thank you! Good luck, you got this!
Shakespeare-Bot, thou hast been voted most annoying bot on Reddit. I am exhorting all mods to ban thee and thy useless rhetoric so that we shall not be blotted with thy presence any longer.
I’d imagine you put considerably more work into research tho than you would have in those classes. I think what a lot of ppl don’t realize is that you can take a full course load of major courses and breadths etc and still tack on one of these classes. I literally spent like 2-3 hours total in espm 6 and like 8-10 hours total in music 29.
I agree you shouldn’t shirk your education or growing opportunities for the sake of your gpa. But sometimes it’s nice to use wet wipes instead of 1-ply
Thank you so much."

Freshman asking for tips to raise my GPA? How to change habits to increase GPA to 3.7 or 3.8+,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bvrygh/freshman_asking_for_tips_to_raise_my_gpa_how_to/,2024-04-04 09:42:17,"Hello! I’m a current freshman studying EECS and I have already taken/am taking Math53, Math54, EECS16A, CS61A, CS61B, CS70, BioE100 and Physics 7A-C.

I typically try to start homework the day that the lecture covers it or like at least Tuesday/wednesday if It is due at the end of the week. I often times make a lot of careless mistakes on exams or I don’t understand the content thoroughly enough. I feel like when I study if I study my hardest I end up barely getting 0.5sd on everything, I feel like I’m doing something wrong. Maybe my friends are just overachievers bc I’m too scared to tell them about my grades. They all have 4.0’s and score >1.2 sd on all their tests.

I feel like I study a decent amount (or maybe it’s still not enough) but I still don’t get stellar grades. I really want to raise my GPA so that I can have the option of applying to grad school or else I think I’d be discouraged from applying to grad school to specialize in AI if my GPA < 3.8 or 3.7.

My schedule: Go to all lectures (except physics bc early morning classes are too hard to wake up to). I wake up around 8 or 9am everyday, go to all discussions/labs, start homework semi-ish early, spend the rest of my time doing practice problems, at my 2 research labs, occasionally at my club. I don’t know how I can raise my grades.

I had a 3.5 summer b4 fall freshman year then 3.66. I feel like cs70 is kinda hard and if I keep this up my gpa might stay around that range this semester too. Also for cs70 I feel like discussions/hw are not sufficient practice for the material… any tips? Thanks so much. I really wish I could do better and get >3.7","I highly recommend checking out Cal Newport's books and videos.

Beyond grades, the happiest and most successful people in life are those who develop solid relationships (friend as well as romantic), not necessarily those with the highest GPAs.

E.g. the CS grads who get the best jobs in AI (or wherever) will be those who have friends working for hot AI companies.

"Physics 5A vs. 7A question (another one, but this time it’s from an astro major)",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ecehc/physics_5a_vs_7a_question_another_one_but_this/,2023-05-10 20:58:53,"
I’m an incoming freshman who is planning to major in Astrophysics. I do not plan to double-major in physics. I’ve taken AP Calc AB (got a 5) and AP Physics C: Mechanics, and I have not taken Calc BC or E&M. Frankly, my high school isn’t very strong in math or science, so I just don’t feel confident about my physics background.

I’m planning to take Math 1B and either Physics 5A or 7A first semester. I’ve heard that Physics 5A can be extremely difficult if you don’t have a strong background in math/physics. Is it fine for an Astrophysics major to just take the Physics 7 series? Or should I definitely take Physics 5?","Don't do 5. Not worth the trauma. Fucks up your GPA unless you're insanely talented in physics. 
7 is usually more than enough
if you’re sure about not doing physics then just go with 7A, requires less math and physics background compared
hey! Astro major here who has taken the 5 series. I don't recommend starting with physics 5a unless you have completed Calc BC/math 1b. A lot of my friends who were in math 1b while taking Physics 5a struggled a ton.

If you do decide to take the 5 series (which I would recommend you do in the spring!)  Some of my friends are also creating a decal to help students in 5a, if you ever decide to take it!

That said, a lot of Astro majors do the 7 series track. The extra stuff you learn in 5abc (relativity, thermo and quantum especially) are helpful, but you learn what you need to know in your astro classes anyway.
I strongly advise against taking 5A concurrently with Math 1B. The textbook they use is Kleppner & Kolenkow so you could take a look at that to get a better idea of the difficulty. The 7 series is perfectly sufficient for the astro major though"
Conditions of Admission/IGETC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13wx5y4/conditions_of_admissionigetc/,2023-05-31 13:32:15,"So, I got a D in a math class which doesn’t meet the condition of not receiving anything lower than a C in a single course and it means I’m one course from fulfilling my Full IGETC. I’m freaking out a bit. I see a mix of how rare it is to get admission rescinded and how it’s important to fulfill the IGETC. 

As much I beat myself up, I did have a significant mental health crisis that required immediate treatment in the middle of my 18 credit hour semester, 6 of those credits being honors classes. My performance took a hit, but after some treatment I pulled out with 3 As and 2 Bs. It’s just with math I already struggle to keep up, and so my C I had been maintaining dropped to a D because I was struggling to catch back up on top of general anxiety during math tests. 

I’m enrolled in the same math class this summer to hopefully update the grade for the sake of my gpa (totally sad to have lost my 3.9) in the mean time. 

I know I won’t know for sure until I contact them (I have to wait until tomorrow because they’re closed today) and submit my form, but can anyone speak to their experience? Especially as transfer? I would be devastated if all the work I’ve put in means nothing because of a math class. I’ve been in every semester and intersession since fall of 2021. Anyway, insight or information helps.

I absolutely need this! I moved to Berkeley last week, and I’ve been very lonely. I really want to meet new people and I feel like I've missed out on a very integral part of the college experience. I feel so forgotten, hurt, and neglected by New Student Services (NSS), who even explicitly stated that we were not welcome to attend the events that were held this past week… The sadness and lack of excitement I feel because of the coldness from NSS has really soured my impression of the school. Ever since I've moved here, I haven't been happy and entered an episode of depression because of the isolation I've been experiencing. This especially hits me hard since I'm a very social person. I would have never expected being made to feel this way by NSS, who I actually thought would welcome us with open arms and understand the circumstances we came from, having to begin our college experience completely online without any human interaction... I feel like I don't belong here, and I feel like NSS wouldn't understand why a lot of us are hurt or even care... I'm especially sad about missing out on the Late Night Events. I really wish NSS could hold the same events for us...

Sorry for my rant, but hearing this from someone in the UC Berkeley community who was a GBO Leader warms my heart. I feel like someone finally understands what we've been going through, and actually cares to do something about it!

Your post means so much to me. It has resulted in the first instance of happiness that I've experienced here at Berkeley :) Also, do you happen to still have your GBO Leader outfit? It would be so cool if you could wear it!

no public FBI record as far as I can tell. so either the guy is a genuine scammer whose attempting to fake his own death, or the person who put this flier up is a scammer offering a fake $30K reward lol

beautiful poster though
So I live down University and I’ve been seeing these signs all around the area for the last 8 months or so, and recently someone (whoever is putting them up) put new ones out. Probably within the last week. 

When you Google this guy, it says he died Summer 2022. What are these posters for? Why are they putting more up if he’s dead? Can anyone offer any insight on who this dude was and why these posters exist?

When I lived in Berkeley, I collected fliers from campus and the surrounding neighborhoods. Some were protest-related, some were political, and some were clearly made by folks struggling with severe mental illness, like this one. All of them were entertaining though. Wish I still had them all…
i've been getting regular emails from an old decal ""prof"" claiming they're a victim of ""cyber rape and chi hacking"". they're often filled with ""evidence"" accusing different people they've never met. i think this is a similar situation

I saw this guy walking down telegraph on Monday!
I worked at a computer repair store on shattuck a few years back, wild dude would come in and want an air-gapped computer install because a hacker was after him.  Maybe related?  lol.  The same customer also invited me to a park one day to ""teach me about self esteem.""
At least he's not a satanist, eh?

It looks like the plaintiff (Hamilton) in these cases against Fontenot is a registered sex offender who lived in the same apartment community in Berkeley.
Your answer is mental illness.

There’s someone in Alameda County court records who has filed civil suits against this person. Could be legit cases, of course. But considering that he’s being targeted even in death, there’s a nonzero chance that the plaintiff in these cases is your poster culprit.

This got voyeuristic and macabre so I’m going to drop the curiosity now.
The only answer is he faked his death and stole someone’s identity. If he’s as good a hacker as they claim, then this is your answer.

How can someone type the correct zero for 30 but somehow use O for the rest? Makes O sense

So what do you make of that
Oh wow. That’s so interesting. Thank you for some insight!
That’s what I was thinking too!! It would be so insane if he faked his death or something crazy like that. But what’s even weirder is there’s absolutely no info on this dude being a hacker on the internet. And there’s only one picture of him online, which is the same as the poster picture and the one on his obituary. Weird stuff.

61bl over summer (can I do it remotely) + need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12cfo96/61bl_over_summer_can_i_do_it_remotely_need_advice/,2023-04-05 03:26:34,"Thinking of taking this summer as a rising senior hoping to add DS as a double major. I’m lowkey very scared to take it as someone who took it 3 semesters ago and late dropped since I didn’t need a C-/C to tank my already low GPA ☠️

That being said:

1) How can I best prepare for the class? Planning on reviewing 61a material but what else might be useful? The biggest problem I had taking it the first time was finally understanding a topic a week too late, pretty much for every topic. Currently taking D100 so I’m not completely lost on how to code

2) will it actually take over my life and if so, should I not work at all? I’ll need to take a separate class though for FA purposes but can prioritize this class over everything if it’s actually that bad

3) will I be able to take it (mostly) remotely? Probably can come back for irl exams since housing isn’t an issue 

Also if anyone can give advice as someone who sucks at coding, pls do 🙏 rlly wanna give it my all since this is p much the only thing keeping me from declaring 💀",I think you should go through 61b material instead of 61a and do the assignments/projects.
How do I pass my class?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16z7cq9/how_do_i_pass_my_class/,2023-10-03 16:36:05,"Clickbait title aside, I’m at a loss for words.

I’m in Math 16A right now, and my past 3 exams have been a 75%, 39%, and today, a 12%. (No curve)

The lowest quiz drops, so I believe I can still get a low B or C, but I’m afraid - I’ve spent countless hours studying, doing practice questions, watching videos - and I’m still bombing exams.

I can’t understand a word my professor says, it’s like he only speaks in theoreticals. My GSI has an accent which I can hardly understand as well - and as much as old resources from previous professors have been helping, they’re clearly not enough. I have a tight schedule which leaves me unable to do the precalculus fundamentals class; so what can I do in order to ensure I pass this class?

Any resources can help. I think I’m in over my head, even if I’m only in the bonehead class","Hi, i would recommend a few things.
1. Go to office hours with the professor and ask questions about what you don't understand (in surveys of graduating students in BioE or COE, the number one thing they would have done differently is go to OH in their 1st 2 years).
2. Try to find the best TA for your class and go to those discussion sections 

Maybe your approach to studying isn't working. For math and physics, solving problems is key. The problem is finding solved problems to help you. I recommend using Schaum's Outlines, which have many of these. Even better, you can find them online through the Berkeley library.

The process is to try to solve a problem, if you get stuck, peek at the solution. Then keep going. You may get stuck again, then peek again. After you get all the way through, then try to solve it again and maybe you get stuck only a couple of times. Keep doing this until you solve the problem without peaking. Solve a few more problems this way. Then later solve them again, hopefully without getting stuck. 

This is not a memorization approach, but pattern matching. Then when you take a test, you don't freak out trying to remember how to solve a problem. 

BTW, pretty much all students at Cal hit classes for which they have to work to understand the material. It can happen earlier or later in your 4 years. 

Hope this helps.
Lol I had the basically the same exact thing happen to me my first year with 16A arun sharma. Not everyone learns from lectures. USE THE BOOK. it’s honestly much easier to understand. 

Make sure your homework answers are correct and ur on the right track even though they are only graded for completion.
I forgot to mention that you could also find some help on campus through the learning center.
I'm going to ask you some questions. Have you taken AP Calculus before? What about honors math in high school?  I ask because Math 16A should be very easy if you have taken those classes before, as most of the content is just a rehash of those. Do you have notes from those classes you can glean through? 

""I’ve spent countless hours studying, doing practice questions, watching videos - and I’m still bombing exams."" How do you study? I ask because the way I studied math back in the day was very different than the way I studied in chem. I see that you did practice questions, and this was the way I studied as well. When you solve these practice questions, do you go over the questions you got wrong **without looking at the answers and how to solve them?** This is a very important factor in studying math imho, I learned a lot this way.

""my past 3 exams have been a 75%, 39%, and today, a 12%."" Do you remember how you studied back when you got the 75% vs when you got the 12%? How did you study for them? This big of a score difference usually indicates that there was a difference in studying, or there was a fundamental misunderstanding of the content.

""I can’t understand a word my professor says, it’s like he only speaks in theoreticals. My GSI has an accent which I can hardly understand as well "" Do you have access to course recordings? Going back through them usually helps for understanding what the professor says, no matter how hard what he is saying seems at first.
This is kind of a last resort but you do get 2 late drops
Hey! I flunked out of 16a my first sem and took it again last sem-- I was on my way to get a D the first time and I ended up getting a B! I failed all my midterms/finals and still got a B bc the prof (who said no curve initially) ended up curving our grades so don't lose hope. Like others are saying u have late drop as an option. I skipped every lecture and instead taught myself w the book. Honestly the math profs here are not my style of teaching. That just means we have to studying harder on our own. I'm failing 16b rn tho lol, I got a 30% on the first midterm...
12% is crazy
If you can fit it in, the student learning center is a great resource for help. They are very familiar with classes like 16A. I’ll put the link [here](https://slc.berkeley.edu/programs/mathematics-and-statistics/courses-supported/math-16a).
You need to ask more questions and find the exact right place to look for more answers. In my opinion ChatGPT is really helpful when learning math. It explains everything and you can spam it like crazy. Learn a little latex or just type questions in and you’ll be on your way. Other things I’d do is look at the textbook and figure out exactly what you don’t understand. Listen, you know some things and you don’t know some other things. Your job is to figure out what you don’t understand from the prereq material and understand it in a very fast fashion. Then youll be caught up. Obviously everything right now just seems like gibberish theoretical bs and I have been where you are but it’s just because you haven’t taken the prereq. So can you succeed? Yes if you put it a ton of work like you’ve been doing. You just need to adjust because obviously you’re missing some level of understanding. So those are my tips and I hope to see you succeed young one. Good luck
This comment was awesome! As a new undergrad I didn’t know about these resources. I’m gonna try this pattern thingy for sure
W
I have never taken an AP Calculus course, my high school didn’t offer them. I think I am fundamentally misunderstanding a lot of content: I do the practice questions; I seem to understand; but if questions on the tests don’t follow a similar form, I just can’t put it all together.

This was actually a really introspective comment lol, thanks. Helps me prepare better

if you're thinking about taking tech classes abroad...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dd6loa/if_youre_thinking_about_taking_tech_classes_abroad/,2024-06-10 22:29:38,"don't.

this is more specific to spain i guess, since that's where i studied abroad, but a lot of my friends and i had bad experiences with the stem classes we took. some of the professors didn't speak english that well, and had slides that were sometimes in spanish. the way exams were written tended to be very awkward, likely because they weren't properly translated into english, so semantics ended up coming into play. exams specifically are very different from berkeley as well (think like, writing short paragraph responses to questions for a technical course instead of actually solving problems) and tend to be very much rote memorization (ex. questions asking about a specific example from the slides). take it from someone who went abroad with a 3.9 gpa and came back having failed a class (failed or c-, still unclear rn) — and this was not for lack of trying. i fully believe i would've learned more and also done much better if i'd taken the same classes at berkeley.

most of the resources i found prior to studying abroad either recommended against tech classes for the sake of taking a chill semester or recommended taking them because they would be easier than berkeley's. i think they were easier than berkeley's and were less work (much fewer projects/labs with less time needed for each), but exams/assignments were designed to trick you and were graded much harsher. lab/project grades in fact often felt arbitrary — they consisted primarily of writing (several of my lab reports were 10-20 pages long, *not* double spaced) and had no specific rubrics or auto graders like with berkeley's classes.

language class was great though! 10/10 would recommend.","I've heard similar stories, but I had no problem taking technical EECS and physics courses at Lund university in Sweden via EAP. It helps that Lund is attached to an ""institute of technology"" (https://www.lth.se/).
i did my bachelor in spain and came to Berkeley for an exchange year as a stem student. this is def true, especially the part of rote memorization. while some argue that the huge workload spain gives its stem students is why they are valued abroad, it's definitely a consideration if you want to come to study here.

  
also, the university system in stem in spain is pretty different than berkeley's or the US in general. here we have fail rates of above 50% in pretty much every subject, while very few people actually give a shit about their gpa.

  
but i mean, in what world, studying at berkeley, would you want to come to spain for academic reasons? berkeley by all means an incredibly better university. if you decide to do a semester abroad, no matter spain or probably anywhere (unless you decide to go to other great unis ofc), one is looking for the experience of living abroad, learning a new language, and interacting with new cultures. i guess that the academics should be placed at a lower priority.
Take tech classes abroad in Asia. Hate my life now
Study abroad is designed for liberal arts majors sadly
man, I was planning to take two upper division techs abroad (EECS). I'm sorry you had a less than stellar experience!
I'm not familiar with taking classes abroad but it seems odd to complain about taking a class in a foreign country and the tests are in the language of the foreign country?  Do international students expect their classes at Berkeley to be in Chinese/Farsi/German or whatever?
This is ridiculous. I would have thought tech classes know how to translate using chatGPT
YMMV sort of deal i guess. i'm sure it definitely depends a lot on the school itself — diff teachers, academic culture, all that. i will say i was taking CS courses and i was later told that the CS dept was not well organized while other depts (math specifically) were much better.
Hard to understand the professors?
These classes were offered in English. Usually the same classes were also offered in the local language."

What Academic Probation because of Cancer looks like (My Ranting and looking for support on SAP),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bg41xg/what_academic_probation_because_of_cancer_looks/,2024-03-16 04:34:15,"I’m an undergrad student right now. Last semester I started fainting regularly and going in and out of Berkeleys university health center. I spent most of my time in the Tang Center or in my dorm resting taking many free pills I got from the health service center and just maintaining this random Illness. I couldn’t explain what it was, I felt awful, my mental health was terrible, and I noticed my grades slip mainly because I couldn’t attend class physically. I had a language class that was attendance graded, everything was so new and so difficult for me. I made 3 C’s and passed a pass or no pass class. I got placed onto academic probation. Makes sense. I was one point insufficient by the way. Then, I went home for break and discovered I was at high risk of cancer and had to start treatment and tests immediately. What do I do?!
Everything to me felt like it was falling apart. I figured I could just hold on treatment and focus of going to class!! I’m on academic probation afterall. I wanted this year to be better. I could withdrawl? That wouldn’t work with my financial situation I come from a low income family and single mother. My mother currently lives in a single bedroom with my baby brother, there’s nowhere for me to go. I decided I’d do online classes, ask for a reduced course load and attain to my health.
I did that, I’m doing well it’s about to be week 10. Now. FAFSA.

The Pell grant!!!! WILL I RECEIVE IT? yikes. I’m stressed all over again! I only attend college under the circumstances that I receie aid. I’m under academic probation! Will I receive the Pell grant aid? I got an email saying I won’t receive the Pell grant, but why? Is this because of the probation? What should I do? 

That’s where I am currently. The health? Not good. Wait? Where are you living? Where are you doing treatment! Great question, I’m currently living with my dad’s ex girlfriend that he actually isn’t talking to anymore. I also don’t talk to my dad. She luckily let me in for the time being. 

Of course, there’s a lot going on in situations like this. I had a friend tell me, “You’re on academic probation? God that’s embarrassing.” Clearly, my situation is much different than theirs, they are a healthy person who can attend class and if anything fell through, their family pays for college and they definitely have at least a family home to stay at instead of an unwelcome house where they wouldn’t be battling cancer alone. I’m lost to be completely honest, and I’m here ranting on Reddit now at 4:31 am. Where should I go and what should I do next? I wish I could be in person and talk to some counselors, but most aren’t very good at helping me online and understanding that I have odd hours of being awake because of treatment.

It’s all so bad. Im extremely depressed and now on antidepressants and suicide watch while in active treatment. I want it all to end but school was once a dream for me, I got in with a full scholarship and completely paid housing. I was top of my class and worked so hard for these “times of your life,” I came from nowhere and now it seems like I’ll have to stay from that nowhere. In other news, my birthday is tomorrow! 19!!","Well enjoy your birthday please, then come back to discuss academic probation and sap. You’ve laid out many details, and it’s certainly quite a situation to say the least. That said, to help you understand and get through this, some things need to be clarified. 

You’re on academic probation but you aren’t dismissed, so that’s good. Now, did you currently receive the Pell grant this semester?

I’m a little confused on how with 3Cs and a pnp class, you ended up on probation, that’s usually reserved for a largely failing courses or being under 2.0 gpa. 

Now, you certainly have a case for appealing a SAP decision. But I can help you more in a dm if you want. There’s more details you’ll need to share, but I’ve been through academic probation and SAP appeals in order to receive aid, so I think I’m pretty experienced with this. 

With regards to SAP, I haven’t read anything in your statement that suggests you wouldn’t be able to get aid. And this school does actively try to approve SAP appeals if you go through a few steps to show some effort. 

Enjoy your bday, rest up, do what you gotta do for your classes this weekend, and when you have time, hit me up.
Please go talk to a financial aid advisor asap. There is special discretionary funding that the university has for cases like yours. Ask about emergency grants for housing (in the dorms too). Also, go to the disabilities office and ask for accommodations as you're going through extensive serious medical issues (you'll need a doctors note- but first go see them to see what kinds of documentation they require). They can provide things like note takers, free notes for all your classes, tutors, longer time for test taking, and more. Lastly, please take precautions against infections of any kind that can affect your immune system. Look up ""[mask blocs](https://www.instagram.com/maskoakland)"" organizations and ""still coviding bay area"" on fb to connect with groups to get you some free N95 masks. Last thing you want is to get covid, noro or whatever else is going around on campus (everyone who lives with you should be taking precautions) as it could be deadly for you. To see what viruses are going around see this [wastewater site](https://data.wastewaterscan.org/) where you can see data by zip code. Lastly, please get a free counseling at the tang center. You're under ALOT of stress and that is not good for anyone.
Hello!

I just want you to know that it will get better. When I was a freshman, I had a really bad flare up of a chronic disease causing me to just go home. (I took all Fs my first semester at Berkeley). I was on probation my next semester.

I’m a rising senior now, in good (decent) academic standing 

If you haven’t started the probation process yet, I want you to know the counselors are extremely understanding. Most of them also have a really quick turnaround time for emails. They will give you the benefit of the doubt for your medical reasons, especially since your gpa is so close to a 2.0 and if your a freshman or sophomore. 

Please, take some time to gather your thoughts and courage. You can push through this. And just know that even if you can’t this semester, this is not the end of the road. There will be numerous opportunities throughout your life to finish your degree. (Also, if you decide to medically withdraw for now, you will not have to go through the acceptance process again).

Last note, many many people are on probation for complex reasons, whether it be health, finances, or familial responsibilities. It is INCREDIBLY bigoted that someone in your immediate vicinity would say that to you, even if they didn’t know the reason for your probation.

Please recover well OP.
Happy birthday!!! It may not be cancer – people can develop chronic illnesses randomly. I developed vasculitis during my first semester of undergrad. My grades sucked when I was sick and undiagnosed and was also very depressed. My GPA/mental health got better after getting my chronic illness slightly taken care of.
I am a UC Berkeley student who was on acadmic probation. I can see the pain, whereare  you can  apply for SAP appeal to receive the aid, but will definely give added stress.

I did apply for SAP, and they did approve me twice. 

In general my mental health was bad, it also resulted in physical manifestations as you described, (such as faintlng).  Currently I am taking a 2 year break.    I would say, mental and physical well beings are way more important then grades and school.  UC Berkeley is a great school, yet is still, a tiny fraction of the world. I recommed taking a break and travel to different places of the world. The unsafe environments, and competitive cultrue is not good for healings.  In general, I think there are a lot of safer places than Berkeley.

I am 21 years old currently. I started my break last year. So far I traved to Nepal, Thailand, Malaysisa, China, Taiwan, etc in the past year. 

  
Taking a short break won’t mean to end your dream, there is always an opportunity to come back after your break.  It is reasonable to tie your personal identity to the school, however having an own unqiue identity to yourself, having a postive conversion with yourself is just as important. The identity of yourself, can give you strenght to overcome, and to be alive.  Don't let other people embrassing you by telling you ""“You’re on academic probation? God that’s embarrassing.”   Those friend(s) of yours may not understand your circumstance.

  
Please stay on top of your treatment. I think another pathway can be to apply for a medical withdrawal. 



I recommend: have an honest conversation with your parent(s), even if they are sepreated. More lilely than not, they will provide help due to your cancer, and mental health conditions.  If not possible, apply for medi cal, and they usually provide free medical insuance if you are not able to afford (you don’t have an icome if your parents don’t support you), and can provide hoursing. 

  
I am happy to chat, if you would like to diret message.
Happy Birthday ! Definitely try to enjoy it. Things may seem scary now now but know you're not the first person to go through something like this and the university has resource to help. Just try to look after your health the best you can and reach out <3

Also fuck your friend for saying that to you they sound fake af
I am a UC Berkeley student who was on academic probation for three consecutive semesters. 

As someone from a low-income family, I definitely understand that being able to attend this institution because of grants and scholarships is crucial. You can apply for SAP appeal to receive the aid, would also recommend to talk to the financial aid advisors at Upper Sproul. In addition, also attend academic advising, this really helped me when doing my SAP appeals since I was told that the academic advisors are the ones that review the SAP appeal and they have records of when we attend sessions which proves that we are taking action on improving and able to explain our circumstances. 

Also this experience is very lonely and the whole process is already mentally draining, so having close people be unsupportive or unable to understand our situation doesn't make it any better. There is a class called R2R, Road 2 Resilience, and although the class didn't work out for my schedule, I would look into it. The class was 1-2 units in which you could get a letter grade thus would help GPA .   
Like everyone has mentioned, I emphasis to go to eTang and get a referral to get accommodations. DSP accommodations aren't meant to give people an advantage, rather make it equitable for everyone, so don't feel bad asking for resources that would help you during these struggling times. 

Feel free to dm me if have any questions! 

P.S I also made a similar post and I think the comments really helped me feel better even if at the time I felt like my world was falling apart. Our experiences are different, but definitely feel free to read through the comments and take any advice!
I was so bad my first semester in the 90s I got thrown out. I made a deal with the dean to take Berkeley classes through extension for a semester and to never get anything under a B my remaining time at Cal. I managed to graduate with a 3.71 and went to law school where my born again nose to the grindstone and anti depressants were a boon. It can be done. Get your depression treated, go to class, do your best. It is possible.
I’ll try my best to enjoy it! I believe I got a 1.98 gpa, so I slipped just barely through the seams. I did receive the Pell Grant for for this semester, I’m just so worried about the coming school year’s aid.
And thank you so much, I’ll totally message you privately! :)
Thank you for your message and support! I hope it will get better.
Thank you so much for your advice! I have considered that, I just felt that all I have is school. I feel that if I were to leave this now, I’ll die with nothing. I know that’s morbid, but I felt that way. I think i felt that I’d really be left alone with nothing left but what’s killing me, I can’t imagine traveling anymore, I can’t imagine living anymore either, I go to negative spaces in my mind a lot.  But, after reading this, it helped me open up to the idea. I think you may be right. I’ll definitely try what you recommended, and I’m totally open to chatting!
Thank you for your encouragement! It is possible! :)
A person's thoughts and feelings are confined to their current condition. You may feel like nothing is in control. But this feeling of ""nothing is in control"" is itself not in your control.  There is nothing morbid with your peronal identity. It is that your mental health and physical health condition making you feel this way.

Right now, school is causing stress, and health and potenial risk of cancer is also causing stress. Let’s not run away and keep on fighting.  Fisrt please go get tested for your high cancer risk. If there is cancer, fight for it. Get treatment and chemotherapy. Take my words for it, and go get the cancer threat eliminated.    

Death doesn't discrimate, when people die, no one can take away things. Please stay alive and stay hopeful. Light is coming.

You are stonger than you think❤️
You are not leaving the school permanently!!

School is just one aspect. There are so many beautifual and amzing things to be explored."

Getting Ahead During Break,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/egqbt7/getting_ahead_during_break/,2019-12-28 04:40:49,"I didn’t do too great this semester so I wanted to get a head start during the break, could anyone give me any insight on the work load for the following classes? Or maybe point me to a resource that can?

French 1 w/ Daniel Hoffman
Sociol 1 w/ Robert Braun (?) 
Sociol 127 w/ Edwin Lin
Sociol 169C w/ Edwin Lin
Spanish 135 w/ Nasser Meerkhan

I’m obviously not planning on taking them all but I wanted to gauge the work load to decide. Thank you!","Preface: I've never taken any of those classes, so take this comment with a grain of salt. 

In my opinion, the best thing that you can do to get ahead is to take the break to relax and destress. Play some video games, read a book, try a psychadelic or two....whatever suits you. 

Trying to ""get ahead"" over the break will just leave you burnt out when the semester starts.
I took 135 with Meerkhan.
Stay on top of the readings with him...don’t slack...review your Spanish grammar over break (especially formal essay writing vocab and grammar) since that affects your grade more than you think...generally it’s a chill class though compared to some other classes I’ve taken
Hey! Recently graduated from Berkeley (Fall 2019). For context, I took SOCIOL 169C (Cross Cultural Communications) for Fall 2019 (A) for three units so I can attest to the character of Professor Lin and the workload of the specific class for a three-unit student. There are a little more assignments for that class if you are taking it for 4 units.

In regards to the workload of 169C, there really isn't much that you're graded on. In fact, I don't think I've batted an eye at the readings until the final paper came around (I only used three sources for that paper and just skimmed them). At the beginning weeks of class, you will do your proposal for a cultural sub group project. The class, in my opinion, is centered around the project for you have two assignments based on that project: a headstart for your final paper aptly named ""Deep Description of Cultural Sub Group"" (4-5 pages, double spaced)and the final paper for the project. (8-10 pages, double spaced).

There is also a cultural self-analysis paper (4-5 pages, double spaced) in the early stages of the class. As long as you start on the papers a week to a week and a half before they're due, you'll be solid. 

Everything else such as participation, a group presentation, and a presentation within a small group during the latter weeks of class is pretty easy to get. Just be sure to engage with your peers and professor and you'll be fine on that front.

Professor Lin is pretty chill. Very talkative but tries his best to get the class engaged with others and with him.

**TL:DR 169C is a pretty easy class provided that you get a headstart on the papers and be engaged with your peers and professors. Lin is a nice guy, you'll find him cool.** 

PS: I suggest you don't get ahead during break because burning out before the beginning of the semester is pretty bad. Don't know about the other classes and the other one that you may potentially take with Lin (SOCIOL 127) but I wish you the best of luck.  


Feel free to PM with questions! Go Bears!
I’ll be sure to review my grammar for sure, thanks for the advice!
Thank you for such a detailed comment !! I really appreciate it :) you’re though I shouldn’t get ahead"
Do intl students need to complete foreign language breath requirement and intl studies requirement in L&S,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11dhedx/do_intl_students_need_to_complete_foreign/,2023-02-27 09:26:57,Two separate requirements but do you have to fulfill them if you are international? I can’t see on cal central because I’m in the process of watching from CNR to L&S. The forge in langue requirements says you need 3 years experience ( or two collage semesters ) and MUST have at least a grade C- or higher in a foreign language but most intl places don’t even use the later grade system.,"Yes you do. Most foreign language departments allow you to take a test to satisfy the foreign language requirement, try sending them an email.
What if the language you took in high school isn’t offered at Cal?"
Final Grades,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/z9y0ag/final_grades/,2022-12-01 12:01:19,"Being in math 53, I’ve openly had my teacher explain how he has no clue how he’s going to go about our final as he can’t give us his previous final as he cannot grade 350 exams by himself. Not having any GSI’s to help prepare for this final on top of already taking one of the hardest lower division math classes, there’s a pretty massive feeling of uncertainty and nervousness. My professor curves our class to a c- which is pretty damn punishing so all of this combined just makes it feel like we’re headed for an absolute train wreck of a final. 

I’d love if someone could shed any light on the situation and maybe how the school could fix/accommodate for this?","Curving to a C- is such bullshit. Anyone who does that should honestly feel ashamed. They’re choosing to make people’s lives worse for no benefit.
How is a class curved to c-?
Sethian?
We can use GPT-3 to grade the finals.
I suppose the professor him/herself will have flashback of undergrad lifestyle with very little sleep and whatnot. But to answer you, it does look like we're heading for a train wreck -- not like the grades will be any more generous but only putting the toll on the professor on top of the students. If anything, the professors should've raised massive concern when all the admin decided was to give 2 extra weeks to grade.
has he told you he's grading them? lots of profs are planning on proctoring the exam and then not grading them.
Anyone have any updates for how sheu will conduct his final
Oh James James James….
Curves to a C-?  Highly implausible.  You probably misunderstood something.
Seriously. You’re functionally saying that you can’t teach the material well enough for more than half of the class to get a C. It’s either idiotic or an indictment of your approach to teaching, and I’d lean both.
Class median is a C-
Yep
I took tataru’s back in the day😂
What does that mean
What professors are planning on doing that tho??
However this is true, and his exam is very difficult.

It’s a joke, anyone who knows anything about transformers knows that it isn’t reliable enough to do this task
lots- especially lecturers who can't not continue with the course bcos they have the no-strike clause but can refuse to take on tasks not otherwise assigned to them (the grading). They have to continue as though business is usual but then will not submit grades. The department I'm in (granted a social science) every lecturer is intending on doing this.
I checked Berkeleytime before posting.  It’s not true.
He has no clue how he’s gonna go about our final because he’s not grading during Christmas or
New Years and leaves for vacation. And if he can’t grade our final, what does our final look like then?"
Transfer student classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uo68x6/transfer_student_classes/,2022-05-12 10:24:56,"I got in as a transfer student in L&S for economics for fall ‘22 and was wondering the possibility of double majoring or minoring, or completely changing to CS. I’m taking an intro to C++ course at my CCC called CS10A and have really enjoyed it so far and have a good grade but I know we’ve only just covered recursion so that’s the extent of CS knowledge I know. I’ve seen people on this subreddit say how hard CS is at cal, I don’t want to get too ahead of myself with wishful thinking. My current CS professor at my ccc used to work at UCSD and based his class off the one he taught at UCSD and told me “if you get an A in this you should be able to do fine at any UC you go to” but the only way I’ve been able to do well is by continuously asking him questions when my code isn’t working during our lab time and working with other students when I need help which leads me to believe I may have a hard time when doing CS at Berkeley. If I do end up wanting to take CS61A in the fall, do I have enough knowledge from just taking an intro to c++ class to get above a B+? What language is it taught in as I only know c++?","61A is taught in Python and a little bit of scheme towards the end. Some semesters they also teach SQL, this semester they didn’t. 61A is a hard class but I think you can do well if you grind ! I’d definitely recommend taking a look at some course material prior to starting just to get a heads up. The class moves fast. I just took it this semester, feel free to reach out if you have more questions!
For this one final year for new students, yes you can switch to CS (or double major), as despite what major you put down on your application, you are free to choose whatever major you want.  

Once you learn one high level programming language, others should be fairly straightforward to pick up.  CS 61A uses Python, 61B uses Java.
I hate it here so much
I dont know if this helps but I’ve already taken calc 1 and calc 2 and am currently taking statistics also
Okay so I should definitely learn python syntax over the summer just to be prepared?
Yup! That would be helpful!"
Does Credit From Major Prereqs Taken P/NP at CC Transfer Over?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w0r7xc/does_credit_from_major_prereqs_taken_pnp_at_cc/,2022-07-16 14:43:46,"Title.

I also heard that Berkeley made some exceptions for classes taken Spring 2020, so I’m not really sure.","Yes. It will transfer
They did for me. My last semester at CC was during the lockdown, when P/NP was OK. My first semester at Cal was also online, and P/NP was still OK. So I took all my classes P/NP. Had no problems whatsoever.
If you took in during Covid you will get exception.

* [UC Berkeley Zoom Workshop:  Getting Started in Undergraduate Research](https://berkeley.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEkdeGhqD8vE93614-oR58MpRzgq-FT0yJn) on 8/10 from 4:30-5:30 pm (pst)  From description: Thinking about getting involved in undergraduate research? This workshop is a great place to start! You will get a broad overview of the research opportunities available to undergraduates on campus, with suggestions on how to find them. You'll also learn about upcoming deadlines and eligibility requirements for some of UC Berkeley's most popular undergraduate research opportunities, such as the Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program URAP, Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships SURF, and the Robert and Colleen Haas Scholars Program, a senior capstone experience for ALL majors.   In the second half hour, we focus on the process of securing a faculty sponsor for your research project. We will cover how to identify potential faculty sponsors on campus as well as how to prepare for the first meeting so that you make a great first impression.

The workshop will be especially useful for undergraduates, but is open to all UC Berkeley students (undergraduate, graduate, and visiting scholars) regardless of academic discipline.","Hmm, does anyone have any experience with urap? I've heard it's quite difficult to get research through this since there are so many applicants. I have a GPA of about 3.5, not sure what the cutoffs typically are.
I’ve done URAP for a couple semesters. Professors don’t see your GPA, but rather what courses you took and the letter grades you got for them. 

I’d say that your essay is the most important part of your application that can really help you stand out. Although I haven’t gone to the URAP workshop before, it should definitely help you build your profile when applying, so give it a shot.
My experience (albeit a decade ago) was exceptional; we had a fun project that introduced us to authentic research and three folks from my group ultimately went on to be professors in the field. (It turned out to be a remarkably generative project for everyone, professor included!) I would advise looking into the prof’s current and recent research projects and, if you’re interested, contacting them with questions about your fit for the project. For many faculty, research partnerships are more about “fit” than checking boxes on an application (GPA-wise). If you demonstrate interest and emerging skills in their field through relevant coursework and/or staying current on the lit via side-reading and/or work on related projects in your classes, side-projects, volunteering, or jobs…then you’re probably ready to take on mentored research.
I would second the comment about the essay, that's really your opportunity to show you're serious. Each person can apply to 3 projects max, so there are a lot of people applying but I think this limits the amount of applications per project. Read up on the project and the people involved and relate your experience and interests to the project. And if you don't get it the first time, try again in the winter or next year (I didn't get it the first time I applied).
I've been accepted into 2 URAP projects in the past, including 1 as an entering freshman. I would say that it depends on what lab and project you're applying to, but demonstrating interest and passion (and prior experience if you have any) on your essay is the most important part.
I’d say go for it.  I was only a freshman last year but managed to get one URAP for Fall and another for Spring even though everyone told me that it was hard to get one.  The only way to know for sure is to try.  Also, if I remember correctly there isn’t a GPA cutoff (though some professors might have one posted).  Just put in all relevant classes, make sure your essay is good, and really show your enthusiasm during the interview!"
Conditions of Admission,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13tgw2g/conditions_of_admission/,2023-05-27 13:09:01,"I’m a bit stressed. I was sitting at a low C in my math class and I just bombed the final. As hard as I try in math with studying and asking questions, it just doesn’t stick for me.  This will probably drop me to a D, but I think my GPA won’t go below a 3.0. It may effect my igetc requirement for math as well. I did 18 credit hours this semester and suffered from a mental health drop that I had to be seen by my doctor for, so that put me behind on top of my anxiety behind math testing. 

I know the consensus seems to be that it’s rare to have the admissions decision rescinded, but I could use some encouragement right now. Does anyone know what my chances are for being dropped?

Chem 4A,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vy6tgn/chem_4a/,2022-07-13 09:04:22,So I applied to L&S as a chem major but I think every freshmen enters as undeclared? It is recommended for me to take Chem 4a but on their website it says all seats are reserved for CoC students and Chem student in L&S. My concern is that I’m currently and won’t be allow to enroll. My advisor is out this week so I can’t reach out to anyone for help :(,"Unlike CS70 or a handful of other courses, I can assure you enrolling in Chem 4A won't be a problem. The worst-case scenario might be waiting until about a week after the class starts, but still enrolling at the end of the day.
If you're in L&S, you don't have to take 4A, most L&S Chem majors take 1A. 4A is the intro chem class if you're in College of Chemistry. 4A is supposedly much harder but might be more rewarding if you want to go the pure chem route instead of being a chem major because you're pre-med or smth like that
You are 100% guaranteed a seat in Chem 4A if you wish to enroll in it. This goes for every CoC class if you are a chem major. Additionally, Chem 4A is one of those classes that will expand to fit everyone since demand is very low if you're not in CoC. Shouldn't be an issue since you're L&S Chem so the 'undeclared in L&S' doesn't apply to you in regards to this class
not really following what some other commenters are saying but here was my experience as an LnS freshman a few years ago trying to enroll in 4A. It didn’t work during my enrollment period. I got into the class, then the CoC enrollment manager emailed me and said i can’t be in it and removed me. true story 😂 

I didn’t try and follow up with enrolling in 4A after the semester started. this may be the way you do it for lns students (email the coc enrollment manager and try to get her to put you in—all things considered, she’s generally pretty nice)
Stuck in the same situation right now. 

Is a waitlist necessary to have a chance of getting into chem 4a after the adjustment period? Or is it generally easy to enroll in chem 4a eventually so even without a waitlist?
\+1 and would recommend just doing the standard series for L&S chem (1 series, 3 series) over 4&12 just work-wise if you don't have to do 4&12. but if you're interested in pure chem then you should consider looking into switching into college of chem!
It’s weird for me now cause it says there are over 200 available seats but they put me on the waitlist when I add the course to my shopping cart…
If you’re also in L&S, I emailed an advisor in CoC and they said we have to enroll in 1A/L and then try to change to 4A during the adjustment period"

prob late drop but i think 70 for fall is full (correct me if im wrong) so youd have to take it in the spring

I need to take either a R&C B course or another humanities course (trying to fulfill the American Cultures requirement if I can). Unfortunately, all of the R&C B classes are full, and so are most of the American Cultures classes. Does anyone have advice on if I should try to get on the waitlist for a R&C B course or if I should get on the waitlist for a American Cultures class that I want? The open AC classes aren’t interesting to me at all, but should I enroll in one of them instead so I know I have a class at least? 
My ESS adviser is on vacation, so I’d really appreciate any insight. I can elaborate further if needed.","Are you an incoming freshman? If so, you have plenty of time so I recommend taking the r&c at a later semester so you have your pick of classes rather than scrambling to get on a waitlist. So I would say go with your other option.

Edit: and there’s no need to get AC over with quickly either. I suggest taking another breadth you need without regard to whether it’s AC or not
Sign up for an English class at a CC.
was it r1b w wendi bootes abt mistakes?? cuz that happened to me too! If ur a freshman, it'll be easier to take an r1b course during the spring, they are gonna have a lot and as for the a&c class try to just find one that is easy. to see which one might be the easiest u can see what the grade distributions are on berkeleytime. ess is engineering so since ur a stem major u may wanna take an easy ac class for a guaranteed grade boost, even if its not interesting to u. I took anthro 3ac it acc was kinda interesting. as for interesting classes after u get ur requirements out of the way, there are so many interesting classes here so dw abt that.
I only have room in my schedule to take my required humanities courses since I’m planning on a engineering major and minor that have a lot of grad requirements. I want to save my non-AC humanities for course thread classes in future semesters; that’s why I’m trying to take either AC or R&C B this semester.
I don’t really want to take classes at a CC since i’m already paying for tuition at Cal
It was that class! I am most probably going to wait for a different semester to take R&C B.
Even though I’m a engineering major, I’m not really looking for easy grade-booster classes if I’m not interested in the class because I can’t get myself to try in a class regardless of a rigor if I don’t like the material. Anthro 3AC is one of the classes I’m looking at that’s still open, but I couldn’t really decide if I want to take the class because the course description was pretty vague. What was your experience with the class/material?
Then your other choice pretty much is to wait until next semester.
i didn't buy the reader lol but the lectures were a bit boring. I NEVER used to fall asleep in classes but this one I fell asleep in especially because it was at 9:30. the readings (from what I could find online and hear in discussion) were acc pretty interesting we talked about cultural relativism, the history of sugar (which sounds boring but was cool to me), family dynamics, gender roles, the rights that families have to their relative's dead bodies, just a ton of stuff. discussions were kinda awkward most of the time bcuz it was obvious no one did the readings. so there u go cool material boring class.
My post is a little confusing but I am wondering if I should take a open seat in a AC class I’m not really looking forward to or get on the waitlist for either a R&C B or AC class I would enjoy taking. I cannot do both because of the 17.5 unit enrollment limit, hence the dilemma.
Aw the material does sound really cool. It's unfortunate people didn't read so the discussions weren't too productive.
I see - what does your current schedule look like? Can you take a major class instead, or a breadth?  You shouldn’t take a class you don’t want to take, especially if it’s not required.  Waitlist on breadths or English is risky, the 10% rule may or may not apply depending on the easiness of the course.
I'm taking E26, Math 53, Physics 7A, and a 2 unit freshman seminar, bringing me to 12 units.

I'm not really comfortable taking 4 technicals my first semester, which is why I'm not signing up for another one. I don't think I have to take breadth classes, since I'm in CoE.

What's the 10% rule?
Yeah as a CoE student you still would have to take 4 H/SS classes along with the 1 R&C B class in your case. H/SS are breadth classes.  It sounds like your R&C A is covered by an AP and you can cover one more of the 4 H/SS with an AP, but you would need to take the remaining 3 H/SS, plus R&C B.

The 10% rule basically states that 10% of a class generally drops a given class.  However there are many factors, such as the difficulty of the subject, the teacher, whether the class is required or not, etc, so 10% is a rough guesstimate."

On pay gap between uGSIs and GSIs,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yyt9l5/on_pay_gap_between_ugsis_and_gsis/,2022-11-18 12:07:01,"Referring to this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi_gsi_pay_gap_is_gsi_pay_really_only_16hour/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Is anyone else jealous of the uGSIs if the union demands are actually met? At least in CS, the majority of my TAs have been undergrads. This would mean all these TAs in classes like CS 61A/B/C would be getting $66/hr. Idk, this seems like a lot of money for undergrads just like the rest of us to be making, along with the fact that they don’t have to pay tuition. I would apply for these myself but I know it’s extremely competitive and I almost have no chance. What are people’s thoughts?","It does seem like $66/hr is a lot for someone without a degree. On an annualized basis that is more than $130K per year. And they have only a year or two more experience than the people who are paying them.
What’s the point of being jealous? It’s only going to make you feel bad. Also I doubt the administration will let this happen lol. They most likely will fleece the uGSIs outta their pay increase somehow by citing some bs reason like “oh they’re full time students they don’t need all this $”
Yes uGSIs are fighting for 66/hr + tuition waivers, but I don't see why you are salty given how much work they have to do, and I'm pretty sure TAs have more load in the lower divs you mentioned like 61A/B/C compared to an upper div.
Don't be jealous that other people are being paid more than you, demand a society that pays all it's workers fairly so no one will need be jealous.
classic EECS L mental
$66hr for undergrad tutors lmao. Holy hell as a previous undergrad tutor and a current graduate tutor that is just an absurd ask.
Yeah it's kind of annoying. Especially considering the fact that most eecs staff are just hired by their friends. UGSIs probably shouldn't get tuition remission tbh.
Even GSIs do not deserve anything near what the union is demanding, and uGSIs deserve it even less...
head TAs have to do so much work. I was a TA once and my friend was the head TA over a summer course and she was working upwards of 50 hours a week. She got paid 5-6 thousand in total that summer. I often had to stay until late at night to finish up the office hours queue and I missed my dinner period helping students after discussion. Also it’s not over 100k. They will work a minimum of 20 hours and will get paid a maximum of 20 hours pay.
It's labor whose quality is differentiated by experience and ability. You wouldn't pay Senior SW Engineers and Junior developers the same.
I believe the idea behind it is to make sure that uGSIs aren’t cheaper labor than GSIs. I agree with you in theory, but the department will likely turn to the cheapest labor available if there’s a substantial differential. The fact that uGSIs are now a necessary part of the Berkeley education is an indictment of the system, imo. This isn’t to say that undergrads can’t be great teachers (personally I loved tutoring in undergrad and it made me a much better GSI). However, the dependence on undergraduate labor for instruction is not how a college education should typically be structured
People need to be paid more but have you taken the time to analyze a budget?
Paying people based on fairness is too subjective and the world cannot ever be fair.

I'd say pay objectively. You wouldn't demand baker A give half his profits to baker B if baker B is not drawing in as many customers as baker A.
Exactly… of course the university will never agree to that.
lol everyone who tries in cs classes are just 2 connections apart so sure that might be true but you still have to work hard
I would agree that uGSIs should not be the primary instructors, tutors maybe. Feels like demanding they are paid more to drive the choice to more qualified people is kind of irrational. There must be a better way.  Like can't there be an HR policy stating qualifications for teaching, and in order to be qualified you have to be a grad student and/or achieved a certain academic standing.  Feels like gSDI should be asked to do less and also paid less.
What even is this argument? So we should pay TA’s with full discussion sections twice as much as those with discussions half as full?

Your argument is self defeating. You are claiming we should pay objectively while noting that how much someone should be paid is subjective.
How is baker A having more customers, and thus making more money, subjective?
How many customers someone has is object, it’s just a number. What is subjective is you saying that we should evaluate and pay that person on how many cakes they sell, not the quality, the the cost per cake, not taking into account the location of the business etc. you are proposing a payment scheme and thus making a subjective choice on how someone’s performance should be evaluated.

Stupid question,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12jbt3c/stupid_question/,2023-04-11 22:50:47,"I’m currently taking a class that I need to graduate this semester and I am really concerned that I won’t be able to pass it with a grade of C- or higher. If I were to get a D, would I be able to graduate this semester or am I absolutely fucked?

(My major is Political Economy and I’ll be able to graduate with a GPA that is higher than a 2.0)",A D is passing.
Transfer advices,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w5lxst/transfer_advices/,2022-07-22 14:28:19,"So, I’m going to apply to Cal this fall and honestly I’m really scare because my gpa (3.5) isn’t the greatest since I got a C in Calc 1 in the spring and my extracurricular is pretty none exist with just a part time job, and 2 certification from Google course for IT support and data analyst. I was thinking of apply as CS major because that’s my major but seeing how little people get into Cal with only 4% for CS make me rethink if I should just apply with the intention of majoring in another field cuz you’re going to be undeclared once you’re in Cal for transfer. Idk if I should be honest or not. One more thing, my PIQs will be focusing on CS. Wouldn’t go to much details but 3/4 will be pointing toward CS relate. Really lost about this.","You can’t switch into LSCS, per the new proposed admissions rules for LSCS which (if enacted) will take effect for the next admissions cycle.  You can only get into LSCS via direct admit.  There is a subsequent holistic possibility to get in, but I don’t think it’s going to apply to transfer students. 

If you got a C in Calc, you’re probably better off looking for another major at Berkeley, such as DS.  CS is very math-leaning for a lot of the classes.
apply and if youre dead set on going here go to CC and transfer (which is totally freaking worth it)
Cal is very holistic in their application review. One bad grade may put you on the bubble, and listing another major may help.

I would suggest that you rethink your piq topics. Do not have all of the topics be the same. They will see your interest in cs from the classes you take, but in the piq they want to see who you are as a person outside of what is in other parts of your application. Do you like to bake? Do you do cross-stitch? Do you like playing d&d with friends? It really doesn't matter what, but your piq should give them an idea of who you are as a person. what unique life experiences will you bring to the community beyond your academics?
The ""right"" thing to do would be honest, but the truth of the matter is that the system is fuckin broken.

If the backdoor is still open for next admissions cycle, then it is probably your only way to get into Cal because with your current GPA, your chances are slim to none if you apply as CS. I would be skeptical of your ability to declare given that you are struggling in technical courses at CC. Were there external issues that hindered your studies?

 I would only consider the backdoor if you are okay with potentially landing as a Data Science major here.
I got in with a 3.92 and no extracurriculars really. Cal takes a more holistic approach to choosing transfers allegedly. I agree with several others here that CS might be a difficult college to get into for you considering your math grades tho. Are you interested in any other fields?
What about Data science? It might be easier to get into it.
You’ll be fine
[deleted]
I’m currently in CC and really dead set on Berkeley cuz this is my second time applying 🫣
My Bs come from Japanese 1, geology, and music appreciation and C from Calc 1 (I was doing very well but final kick my butt). But all my CS classes are all As. So I guess I were just caught up that final were just a piece of cake but guess not.
Other than CS, it’s math. Really going to kick my butt this semester to get better grade on Calc 2
It’s all in the CS Town Hall on the Piazza EECS 101, some time in April (if Piazza still exists).
are you applying the next cycle?
I’m a math major so I might be a little biased, but math is still a really great field to study! I had no trouble getting into my courses this semester. Thinking about doing a minor in CS or some cluster courses. Maybe by doing something similar you could get some experience with CS without majoring in it specifically. I think someone else mentioned data science on here which is also great.
Yes 🫠
I fall in love with math after taking precal and Calc and really regret how I flunk after final and got a C. Originally, I was going to put math as my intend major when applying for Cal after seeing how much higher percentage of admit students got in with math as their major. But with my C in math and no intention of writing PIQs relate to math, I’m just stuck in a boat in a middle of an ocean.
There are still plenty of classes you can take at CC level and boost your gpa tho. Calc 2&3, linear algebra, differential equations, statistics etc. It sounds like you’re going to tackle your motivational issues. Don’t let one class stand between you and Cal. I think the only thing they require grade-wise is that you don’t have any required classes that drop below a C."
Jumping ship from premed to CS after being accepted to med school!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/lm1ilc/jumping_ship_from_premed_to_cs_after_being/,2021-02-17 10:45:08,"I’m a senior graduating this semester who‘s *already been accepted to multiple medical schools*.

However, I’m starting to realize the opportunity cost and miserableness of working/studying 70-80 hours for the next 8 years and having 150k+ in loans before becoming a doctor isn’t worth it to me.

I’m a Public Health major, EECS minor and I truly love CS. I’ve taken 16A/B, 61A/B/C, 70, 176, 161, 168.

1. If I were to try to find a job, would it be hard? I don’t have internship experience, except I did a little bit of teaching.
2. What is the starting salary for a Berkeley grad in software engineering AND what amount does it reach after 6-7 years of experience

Please help. I’m having a midlife crisis rn! ;(","You should look into CompBio which you could utilize both your Bio and CS skills.  Though the undergrad classes tend to lean more towards the CS side.  If you’re intending on changing your mind re:graduation and adding another semester you may want to consider taking CS 176 and/or BioEng 131 in the Fall.

Look at the BioSpace website which has a ton of health industry jobs in the tech sector.  That should give you an indication of what is out there.

Average starting salary according to the Career Survey for grads was ~$120K for LSCS and EECS grads.  Significantly higher depending on company once you add in RSUs and bonuses. FAANG positions usually range from $175-225K total compensation for grads.
https://www.levels.fyi/ is a good website to see salaries staring out and after years experience at various companies.
Levels.fyi is slightly exaggerated because people sometimes don’t divide their signing bonus over 4 years (well technically you could leave the company after 1 year and retain the bonus, but your second year pay is usually much less than the initial one, at least for new grad levels. But base and RSU is usually accurate. 

For a new grad position you are looking at around a 120k base, 30-40k (dollar value) in stocks though this varies by company a lot, and 10% performance target bonus. Sign-on bonus for new grads are usually anywhere between 15k- 100k (the higher end of that range is usually returning intern or have competing offers though). 
Thus you are looking at a TC of around 170k per year.
Though I don’t know much about CS, but I am pretty sure being a doctor carry you all the way with stable job until you die. After 4 years med school + 2-3 years residency, you can make good salary in the 6 digits. Do you know general practitioner in Alaska earn 500K per year? In just one year, you could pay off your debt so....

In fact, in California alone, neighboring city could have different salary for the same job (can be $100K in difference, eg, Sacramento vs Stockton). Although, most people enter the medical field not for the money tho...

source:  my boss is a doctor and my previous coworker was looking for a job, and she was surprised to see the $100K difference
bro how tf did you not consider this before applying to med school? I guess it is better to find out now than later, but damn.
Do you know anyone getting 175-225k offers?
[deleted]
For some reason, I don’t trust the ridiculously high numbers on there. I want to hear from real people on here that I’ve studied around about what’s really going on in the CS job market right now. To me, it seems insane to get paid 400k after becoming a senior SWE
I'm a graduating senior. I personally signed a ~160k offer, have a friend going to FB for 200+k and another friend going to a prop shop for 230k. So yeah, lol, it's pretty 'standard' for CS/EECS peeps from Berkeley to get these kind of new grad offers.
Speaking from experience as a current senior in SWE, yes, it's pretty common. This isn't even something exclusive to FAANG — off the top of my head, here are a few offers people I personally know got while applying for new grad positions:

- Uber, $200k
- Google $180k
- Facebook $190k
- Citadel $280k
- Jane Street $330k
- Google $170k
- Apple $200k
- Twitter $210k
- Multiple Amazon $190k
- Lyft $160k

Note that the 'traditional' tech firms have a different pay scale — they start off lower, but tend to escalate more rapidly (at first) via stock options, while on average finance tends to grow somewhat more slowly via bonuses, though it does still pay more overall. It's very common to be making 50%+ more than your starting salary within 3~ years of graduating, and if you end up at a FAANG once you're a senior swe (4y~ and on) it's pretty normal to make $300k/$400k.

I saw you ask elsewhere why everyone in tech isn't rich — the reality of it, from what I can tell, is that people _are_, it's just not something you notice unless you happen to know a lot of software engineers for some reason.
It’s a noob class to the world of CompBio.  If you plan on taking 176, no need to take 131.  The 131 class introduces a lot of bioinformatics tools and goes into some basic algorithms, whereas 176 goes purely into some pretty complex algorithms.
the numbers are very real 

&#x200B;

source: my intern numbers match up, older friends new-grad numbers line up, family friends senior swe numbers line up
This might help to understand some of the splits in software eng compensation: https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/
the numbers on levels.fyi are real. i can't personally vouch for the full-time numbers (although everyone I know believes them), but the internship ones are spot-on.

the caveat is that no one really knows if/how long the money in SWE will last. also, you can make significantly more than 400k as a surgeon (in a cheaper city to boot), though you'll have to wait 10 years for that.
These numbers are probably more real than hearing from “real people”. In reality, (some) people do exaggerate their offers a bit to make themselves look good when asked.

I do want to add though. Although CS graduates start with high salaries, not everyone can stay on top of the field when you get older. Being a MD does give you more job security especially when you get older.
The FB offer is wrong. It isn’t 200k+. That’s if you don’t divide the sign-on by 4. It’s more like 190k for the best interns, and 170k for the average new grad.
Great article
But then why isn’t everyone in CS rich? making nearly half a million dollars a year, starting out with 175-225k offers? i haven’t made many friends in CS, but the people I know outside of Berkeley in CS aren’t doing as well as levels FYI would claim
Boy is that true.  I can personally vouch for that.  My salary has generally stayed the same for the last 15 years, but that’s mainly because I went from a couple of top big dog places to big places in a shittier industry to now being at a small company since retirement is within sight.  All of my friends in my age group who started out as developers are either in management or doing their own business in other industries.  I’m pretty much the only one still doing some degree of development work.  You really do need to start looking for age-appropriate stuff once you hit 40 or 45 if you’re not in management.
Eh, it's pretty standard to use the sign-on for first-year total. Also, considering annual refreshers and fast promos (especially if you were a strong enough intern to warrant the 200+ offer), its not going to make a huge difference over time even if they stay at FB. Furthermore, most peeps will dip after one or two years to another company where they'll receive (most likely) a similar if not better package.
not everyone gets FAANG offers. the average company doesn't pay this much.
>  but the people I know outside of Berkeley in CS aren’t doing as well as levels FYI would claim

We're preconditioning on being a berkeley EE(CS) grad right? A minor in CS with a technical major is not ~that~ different from a EE(CS) grad. Especially since you're obviously driven and smart.
Yes you are correct. Also I misstated. FB offer is 190k (170k average) without sign-on (not sign-on divided by 4 as I stated). annual refreshers aren’t that high for new grad, but the fast promo part is true. Due to fast promo though, jumping after a year or two isn’t very common. Also refreshers for promo are lagging.
So I wouldn’t be making 175-225k then.

so my question still stands, how much is a typical Berkeley grad - one of my average CS classmates - making? Levels fyi isn’t answering that. I’m not familiar with all these companies, I just wanted to hear from people if there is anyone with this knowledge on this subreddit
the thing with CS is you have to make your way up the ladder to reach half a million and above. there's many levels to CS (new grad is usually labelled as level 1 at companies). It takes roughly 2-3 years to get to level 2 and then you start grinding to get to the next levels (i don't know the number of years after level 2 lol). anyhow even at level 3 you won't be making half a million a year. you have to work your way up through promotions or jump from company to company.
A friend of mine just got $300k/year as a new grad, straight out of college. Multiple others are making $200k~ in the same position. If you've been accepted to med school, went to Berkeley, and have a passion for computers, you're _definitely_ going to be able to do well enough to get a good job in SWE.

Think about it like this — some doctors make more, some make less; if you end up being an ortho doc or some other kind of surgeon, sure, you'll make boatloads, but one specializing in family care might not make _nearly_ as much. It's the same thing in CS: there's a big gap between the salaries you get at midwestern non-tech firms and those you get at Bay Area conglomerates.
I think you'll find that the truth is somewhere in between.

No, you probably won't be making as much initially since your CS background just isn't as strong as the candidates who do get those offers. So there's a good chance that, initially, you'll be getting average pay in the area (low - maybe mid 6 figures for Bay Area, sub 6 figures in random non tech hubs).

However given that you're smart enough to get into multiple med schools from Berkeley, I'd wager that if you can redirect that energy into CS (and interviewing) then you'd be able to eventually work your way up into top companies that do pay that much - say over the course of the next 3-5 years.

It's not hard to get a well paying job if you're really good at what you do and able to jump the necessary hoops. The hard part is getting good - that's what 4 years of rigorously studying CS + internships gets you, and why you get all these new grads making bank straight of the gate. But there are also a lot of CS grads who aren't hitting those high salaries.
for like a mediocre company in the bay area, 100-140k is pretty common. seniors at this company would probably be making closer to 200k.

anecdotal experience: the place I interned my freshman year made my intern friend an offer of $105k.

honestly if you can get into multiple med schools from cal though you're definitely smart enough to break into top companies. just spend a 1-2 years somewhere mediocre and start leetcoding hard.

also amazon casts a very, very wide net, you might get an interview even without experience.
This is a bit dated, but here's some official data from the 2018 Berkeley career survey:

[$107k for CS majors](https://career.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Survey/2018ComputerScience.pdf)

[$111k for EECS majors](https://career.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Survey/2018EECS.pdf)   

The reality is that most companies aren't at FAANG level of pay (which is why they're so desired). Also, people who choose to work at a startup are often trading current income for other future benefits.


Edit: [2019 is up in an interactive format here](https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey). 2019 CS median is $115k. 2019 EECS median is $116k.
What’s mentioned are generally bigger and more well-known tech Bay Area tech companies or worldwide consulting companies. There are lots and lots of companies where a starting salary would be more like $70-100K for a CS major all over the US, even in the Bay Area.  Lower, even much lower if it’s a startup or not looking to go public. 

But the salaries mentioned for some of the big boys are real.  Also, being a Berkeley grad helps tremendously as the big boys tend to go to the top schools if they’re going to be paying top dollar.
[https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey](https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey) filtering to CS here can help you get an idea, but keep in mind that the number there is just salary -almost all berkeley grads will also receive substantial stock compensation. you can see what companies many people ended up at and look those companies up on [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) to see what the new grad offers look like.

I'm a recent CS grad from Berkeley - not super comfortable sharing details publicly but I can share my experience in DMs if you want to learn more about what offers look like for new grads."

EECS classes worth taking for personal interest ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1darlhp/eecs_classes_worth_taking_for_personal_interest/,2024-06-07 18:41:17,"Hi,
I’m currently going into my second year as an IEOR major, and was wondering if anyone had recommendations on EECS classes that are great for personal interest. I’m not going to be double declaring EECS or CS due to a variety of reasons, but am realizing that with my current scheduling plan, I have about ~6 slots over the next 3 years for classes that I just want to take for personal interest.

I took EECS16A (Ranade) and 61A (DeNero) this past year and thoroughly enjoyed both. I didn’t really put in the work for 16A and ultimately got a C-, but in the last few weeks of the course I just fell in love with the concepts covered and thought the way linear algebra, EE, and CS came together was just beautiful. 61A with DeNero was obviously a great class aswell. I’ve worked part time as a professional python developer for 3 years now, and still found myself learning new content or just gaining a better understanding of the language in 61A. Both of these classes just made me so enthralled with their content, trying to learn bits of what they tease at long past leaving the class.

I’m debating taking 61B this semester as all of the concepts my friends in the class covered seemed fascinating, but am wondering if people think this class is not worth taking for personal interest due to the workload. Beyond that though, I want to fill the rest of my schedule with extremely well taught and developed courses in the EECS/CS department.

Im wondering what people’s favorite EECS classes have been, and which classes have just really made you fall in love with the content! I know this is a broad and vague request, but I’m really down to learn anything if people think the classes are great. ","If you're IEOR, you will like EECS 127 and the 227 series. However they may overlap with IEOR optimization courses if you are required to take those .
EE130 and EE143 if you are interested in how to make semiconductor devices! The 143 lab is a ton of fun!
It's hard to judge someone else's ""personal interests,"" but you might get more answers by asking ""who was your favorite EECS instructor?"".

I've usually found it's the instructor rather than the subject matter that determines students' enjoyment of a course.

I hope you find some good ones!
Advice 1: there might be some goofy ah responses here. 

Advice 2: just take 61b, 61c, and EECS16b if you want to learn more about computers. These are the most bang for your buck. There's a reason why they are core classes. 

Advice 3: A lot of compsci can be pretty boring. It's roughly 20% high level engaging ideas and 80% implementation. What you like depends on your interests. 

Advice 4: in my biased opinion, I found cs184, (computer graphics), cs161 (computer security), cs182 (deep learning), ee126 (probability), cs170(algos) to be the most fun. Aside from 182, these are fairly approachable as a hobbyist since they start from ground up.

Advice 5: cs161 (security), cs186 (databases), and cs162 (operating systems) are the most practical for general competency with computers and software development. These however might not be very exciting for hobbyists.

Childcare questions for community and students with children,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/16wqvdg/childcare_questions_for_community_and_students/,2023-09-30 20:50:17,"Hi all! My husband is a PhD student at Berkeley and I work full time. We are hoping to start a family soon but we know childcare is a huge expense and want to make sure we’ve thought things through and can afford it. The Berkeley Early Childcare Education Program does have slightly reduced tuition ($2,720 a month for infants). Unfortunately we make too much to qualify for reduced tuition, but not enough for this to not be a major monthly expense for us. With my salary and my husbands stipend, we make ~$130k.

For both community members and students: 
A.) how much are you paying per month for childcare?
B.) what is the set up? I.e nanny, daycare, etc 
C.) if you’re student/staff/affiliated with the school, are there any benefits or anything else I don’t know about that Berkeley can help out with?

Would appreciate all other advice!","I don't have an answer for you, but you might try cross posting the question on r/Berkeleyca, which has fewer students but more long time community members.

r/BayArea is another possibility for posting a similar question, but specify in the title or the first sentence Oakland/Berkeley area. There are more than half a million people on that sub. But be prepared for some snarky or unhelpful answers there, it's simply the way some people are. Just ignore them. 

There is also the **Berkeley Parents Network**, a fairly long established group where people ask all sorts of practical and advice questions like yours, from how to deal with school bullying to where to find a pediatric dentist. I haven't looked there for a while, but I think they also have resource lists.

Need advice as a student who was dismissed from Cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/w58mtx/need_advice_as_a_student_who_was_dismissed_from/,2022-07-22 04:50:05,"Hi, so I graduated high school 2020 during the rise of COVID and stuff and the pandemic really took a toll on my work ethic and this carried onto my first year at Berkeley. Unfortunately this was also during a time where I started to face the reality that was my mental state and admit to myself that I was going through problems. Another thing that kind of didn’t help was the fact that I didn’t know what I wanted to do so I was bouncing between two majors. After failing pretty much my entire freshman year the school was nice enough to still give me another chance and while I did improve the following fall semester, my gpa  wasn’t enough to meet Berkeley’s standards (thanks Physics 7A) and I was dismissed.

My academic advisor gave me a plan on readmission but this is where I have a big problem. I have been following the readmission process and have been taking classes at Berkeley City College with much better grades but I got a C (79% :/)in an English that would fulfill my R1B requirement. The readmission process states that I must receive B’s or high and I just don’t know what to do. Does this completely obliterate my chances of getting back into Cal? Am I going to have to start fresh at another community college for better grades? I am really scared to face the reality of this situation and don’t know what to do. This is a very hard conversation to have with my friends as they have been thriving at Cal where I have been doing the opposite. Any advice helps","Ask your academic advisor where you should retake the English class. Best to get a definitive answer from the source.
Is there a time limit to go through the community college classes for readmission?  Maybe taking the next year to work on your mental health and gain some distance from these setbacks would be a good option. There can be a desire to get on with things, but if moving forward if just adding more stress and negativity it may be better to take a new, slower approach, then come back a year from now  take the necessary cc classes with a clear head and renewed focus.
I don’t think you necessarily need to retake the English class. If it’s just that one you got a C in, you might be able to acknowledge that shortcoming in your personal statement when you apply for readmission and point out that you’ve done well in all your other classes. Things can be hit or miss with readmission depending on the department; I’d say your best bet is to just come clean to your advisor and ask them if it’s really that much of a problem.

Speaking as someone who was in a similar situation and just graduated this past semester, I don’t think it should mess up your chances. But work closely as you can with your academic advisor here at Cal, it’s quite literally their job to help you get through all the administrative stuff to graduate.
It just means you may have to do one more semester at the community college to make up for that one class requirement with the C. Check with your advisor first-- I got a C in a community college class and it transferred easily as a passing grade into Cal to complete a necessary req for graduation. As long as your advisor is giving you the OK, everything's good. Don't ever hide the problems from your advisor, be transparent with them. As long as they're in your corner and open about all your options in this boat, especially when you're struggling, you'll know what you can do. There are even options if you can't graduate or fail past graduation deadlines for years. Cal has had every kind of student struggle/difficulty before, they just don't advertise it, but it's got a long history and a big protocol for their options. Just ask. The stigma is high, but it's normal for them to deal with students in situations like this. There are a ton of students in your situation currently, and plenty from before too. There's always an ""after"" or alternative to the traditional route-- even if it's prolonged or feels terrible to need it.
someone already said mental health issues, but i want to expand on that. if you are dealing w depression or other mental health stuff, i cannot recommended anything other than treatment. getting your mental health in a good shape is the best thing you can do for your academic career. for me, treatment really helped me and allowed me to come back. you already got into berkeley so it’s not that hard to return even after a dismissal. they just want to see if you are prepared for school again, but if you aren’t… then you should focus on getting prepared. you can take a break, focus on mental health, and return later. i know plenty of ppl who have taken breaks from school, my therapist took a 10yr break, my friends have taken 2-3 hrs, and currently i have taken a 1 yr break. take the time you need to feel and get better before you come back or you will run into the same problems again.

additionally, mental health is a disability and you can dsp accommodations to help you transition.
You write pretty well so I'm guessing that bad grade was a ""work ethic"" issue. As you go forward, get some help with it. Therapy, self-help books, whatever it takes. It will dog you again if you don't deal with it. 

It seems you are facing your problems with determination and maturity -- good luck!
I just got dismissed too after my second semester. My first semester I had trouble submitting my final for a class and my grade dropped from an A to a D and I got placed on academic probation. I fixed the issue with my final and got my grade fixed back up to an A. This didnt take me off of academic probation though and I was dismissed after doing bad in my classes second semester. I was already kinda depressed beining of the semester, but after dealing with s.a this spring semester I got very anxious, developed an e.d and being in lecture freaked me out completely to the point where I absolutely needed to walk out of lecture. Im taking summer classes and trying to get my stuff back together. I can't help with the C, but I hope you know that everyone is going through stuff and that while it seems like everyone else is thriving, alot of people are just barely hanging on. I would honestly make an appoinment with an advisor, but from what I've heard, you should be fine if you only have a C in that one class, as long as you can provide a valid reason as to why you got that grade. You're not alone! I'm also trying really hard to hopefully get readmitted :)  I would also think about what documentation you're ready to provide when you apply for readmission.  (feel free to message me on here! I'm sure we can help each other out)
Hey dude. I went through dismissal and readmission for mental health problems about half way through my time at Berkeley. You should check in with your advisor. They’ll hopefully be compassionate and help you out. You’ll just have to address it in your readmission essay and maybe take an extra class. If your advisor doesn’t seem helpful or compassionate (some aren’t) PM me and I can recommend someone at L&S to talk to. 

If your readmission requirements were just to earn B’s or A’s in the courses required for readmission, you may be able to just take another course at BCC that fulfills your R1B requirement. If it’s B’s or higher in everything that’s a tougher spot. You would need to get your GPA up to a 3.0 at BCC. 
Honestly though, the readmission process is holistic and just wants to see that you’re able to succeed at CC before they let you back in to Cal with its much more difficult course work. You just need to show them that you’re ready. 

An alternative would be to take classes through another CC and then just send their transcript. Berkeley doesn’t have to know about BCC.
pm me, always happy to help!
How did you get them to let you stay after a year?
Grade grub (no, please don’t actually do that).
She needs to see if she can get academic forgiveness through her institution that will either replace that grade when she re-takes it or average a higher grade with her previous grade.
It's best to reach out to the academic advisor who gave you the plan for readmission. It may be comforting to read other Redditor's (Valid) experience, but ultimately it's up to the advisor. More often than not, they're there to help you be successful! Talk to them!
Best answer right here! ☝️ 

My girlfriend dropped out in 2014 and then went back to Cal in 2020. 

She researched a lot of stuff online, but ultimately it was not until she reached out on to an academic advisor that she got everything in order. 

She even spoke to multiple advisors to get different perspectives and opinions. Every advisor was welcoming and understanding.
hey if you don't mind me asking, how did you adress your readmission essay? I'm planning to apply for readmission for spring, but in order to do that id have to send in my essay by september so it doesn't interfere with my enrollment phase and I'm kind of stuck on what im supposed to address exactly?

"Admitted to Berkeley, got a D+ in last semester of High School, what do I do??",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/14dwomp/admitted_to_berkeley_got_a_d_in_last_semester_of/,2023-06-19 18:10:50,"So I got into Berkeley (undergrad)  but last semester of high school I got a D+ in AP Computer Science. Will Berkeley rescind my admission offer over this?  


This class was an elective for me so not an A-G, but I told Cal during the application process that I would be taking the class. I’ve consistently got A’s throughout high school, with a couple B's and rare C.  I have a reason for why I got the second sem APCS  grade, but I wasn’t doing too hot in the class first semester either ( passed that semester though).  (Not a CS major btw)

Questions:  


But what do I do now, It says that if you get a D or below to report it, but I got a D+, does this mean I don't have to report? 

What happens if you report or don't? 

What's the whole process like with admissions? 

What is the risk of the offer getting rescinded?

&#x200B;

Losing sleep over this, If anyone has any insight on ANY part of this process plsss let me know.  


Thx, Go Bears  


TLDR: One bad grade, will Berkeley Rescind?","Do a search on “rescinded d” in this sub and you are not the first one. You need to explain convincingly but imo shall be ok
Probably. If you fail to meet the admissions contract they probably will rescind u. Happens a lot every year."
What breadth classes should I take as a Mechanical Engineering freshman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ntphli/what_breadth_classes_should_i_take_as_a/,2021-06-06 09:25:54,I don’t want to write long essays and want to study something interesting. Does anyone know if “Introduction to International Business” would be understandable for someone who’s only done STEM in their lives? And how are the philosophy courses like “Nature of Mind”? Do they involve too much writing? Does anyone have any other ideas for breadth courses?,"There are a ton of breadth classes that don’t involve writing. I’m not sure if you’ve used this before, but if you go to classes.berkeley.edu and select particular breadths you’re interested in under “breadth requirements” on the left-hand column, you can read through the class descriptions. 

Introduction to International Business, although it has Intro in its name, is a upper division class at Haas and it’s mainly, if not only, reserved for Business students, so I’d cross that off your list unless you’re in MET.
Unless things have changed in the past three years, you don’t have to take breadth classes as long as you’re already accepted into CoE. You just have 6 humanities, two of which must be R&C A and R&C B. That being said, if the Intro to Inter. Business is considered a humanities course, which it likely isn’t, I would wait until after your first year
If you wanted something more thinking-ish and stretching your brain power, try Philosophy 12A Intro to Logic.
[ME 191K: Professional Communication](https://berkeleytime.com/catalog/MEC%20ENG/191K/). One of the easiest upper division H/SS courses you can take, and it's possibly even useful if you put in the minimum amount of effort.
I'd recommend starting with your r&c courses because they're good introductory courses, pretty similar to a HS English class. You can look on ratemyprofessor to see what professors assign a ton of reading/writing. I mean they're writing classes so there's definitely gonna be some but in my class we only wrote like 3 essays. If you got a 4 or 5 on AP lang or lit you can skip r&c A but you still have to do an r&c B class regardless of APs. Then after you do that you can ask around what humanities classes ppl have done that were chill.
Two of them are R&C, but the other 4 are Humanities/Social Sciences. I can chose the other 4 from any of the L&S Breadth List except Physical and Biological Sciences
Does it involve too many essays? And how’s the workload like?
I don’t think thats a H/SS course. Atleast on the page it doesn’t say it fulfils any breadth requirement. Am I doing smth wrong? https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2021-fall-meceng-191k-001-lec-001
So I am doing one of the r&c requirement in my first semester since I don’t have APs but I had space to fit one breadth requirement too!
It definitely counts don't worry: https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/degree-requirements/humanities-and-social-sciences/

""No courses offered by an Engineering department may be used to complete an H/SS requirement other than: BIOENG 100, COMPSCI C79, ENGIN 125, ENGIN 157AC, ENGIN 185, or MECENG 191K.""

So any of those classes listed CAN be used."
Econ Major CC Transfer Application,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wh8hpz/econ_major_cc_transfer_application/,2022-08-05 15:39:13,"I’m currently a sophomore at my local California Community college (DVC) applying to transfer this fall for the fall 2023 term, however I have some concerns about my application.

My first semester (fall 2021) I received a C in Calculus I and the next semester (spring 2022) I had to take a W from Calculus II because I realized I wasn’t prepared at all. I have spent the summer reteaching Pre-Calculus and Calculus I to better prepare myself for Calculus II and I plan on writing one of my essays on overcoming this educational barrier I am facing. 

The problem is I am still not confident I can pass Calculus II so I am not going to take the class in the fall, but the spring instead because by that time I will have prepared myself.

I have received all A’s in my prerequisites and supports classes except that one C, and if all goes well my GPA will be around 3.83 when I apply. I am worried my issues Calculus will hurt my chances. Any thoughts?","I got accepted for Econ but received a C in one of my Econ prerequisites, I had all As in my other pre reqs, and had a 3.83 when I applied as well. I was able to explain why I got a C in one of my Econ classes in my application and I guess it was enough for me to get accepted.
How were you able to explain it if you don’t mind me asking?
Also were you finished with all your major prerequisite classes by the time you applied?
To answer both questions: In my application I stated the reason why I received a C in my intro to microeconomics class was because in my area in California during the time I was taking the class there were wildfires which meant I had to evacuate. I explained how I couldn’t spend as much time focusing on the class as I was anxious about the wildfires in my area. It was also my first semester at CC, so I said I was still adjusting to online learning. If you have any external factors like that to explain your grades, it really goes a long way. For the second question, I had done microeconomics, macroeconomics, calc 1 and calc 2 when I applied in the fall, and I had to take my last pre req of statistics in the spring after sending in my application.
At the time, I was working two part-time jobs so it was difficult having to juggle that and school. I also think being online was challenging for me as it the support and real-time assistance wasn’t there.
I think that’s a very valid reason and you should definitely explain it in detail in your application, there’s a section specifically for extra information and you can put that in there"

The ones with the lowest chances are the last two. Are you sure you want to take those 3 technicals and a writing class your first semester? I wouldn’t recommend taking 70 your first semester and I also wouldn’t recommend taking 61a and b at the same time. To me it sounds insane. Either take 61a, 16a and a breadth (could be the college writing one) or if you really want to take take 3 techs take 61a, 16a and math53 for example. You’ll have plenty of time to take these classes in the future you don’t have to rush and overwork yourself
I’m an incoming freshman! Where do we find the enrolment time ?
🤷‍♂️ the same answer for most of these questions is maybe but also have backup classes in case you don’t get it lol. No one can predict how fast classes fill up. Cs70 would probably be the one you want to get first
I cut down three trees as an offering to Oski to get a better chance at my classes last year and even then I didn't get them all. I'd suggest five trees this time.

pros of CoC vs L&S for biochem?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pu71vj/pros_of_coc_vs_ls_for_biochem/,2021-09-23 16:08:22,"Hi everyone, for context I’m a first year in L&S majoring in molecular and cell bio. I was thinking of transferring to CoC for the chemical biology program and I was wondering how competitive the process will be and if it will offer significant benefits compared to staying in L&S. I want to transfer because I feel that CoC is smaller and more focused on chemistry (plus it would give me a BS rather than a BA). However I was also thinking of minoring in philosophy and I don’t know if it would be plausible/possible if I transfer. Any advice would be appreciated💖","Transferring into CoC as chem bio should not be difficult if you have reasonably good grades in lower division pre-reqs (gen chem, first math classes, etc.). CoC is great in that it is much smaller so it's a tighter community and you will actually get to have relationships with your undergrad advisors, and if you are interested, even the undergrad dean (John Arnold is the best). Nowadays, there is really no bias between B.A. vs. B.S., what matters is what the degree is in! Transferring into CoC would not prohibit you from minoring with an L&S subject, I double majored (called a ""simultaneous degree"") with an L&S major. 

You really just need to look at the curriculum of each major and see what speaks to you. Do you want to study a ton of high level chemistry? In CoC you'll take higher level gen chem and ochem classes than other majors, and will take a lot of other chem classes (inorganic, physical, etc.) that you wouldn't as a biochemistry major - but you'll take a lot less bio. 

Also, what type of research interests you? You certainly won't be prohibited from doing research outside of your major (i.e. as a biochem major you could do research with a chemistry/chem bio professor), but if your research interests are specific to a particular area, that might inform your choice. 

Finally, it's okay if you change your mind later on. many people do :)
Given that you're a first year, I think it's still possible for you to minor in philosophy after transferring. If you have AP credits, CoC's chemical biology curriculum offers a lot of flexibility to take other classes that interest you. However, as the previous poster noted, your classes will be mostly chemistry. Outside of Bio 1A (and bio-related classes in the Allied Subjects list), your first two years in particular will be mostly chemistry.

I'm not sure if they turn away non-CoC students, but if you want someone to talk to, maybe you can check out [peer advising](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/current-students/peer-advisers)
Hey C/O 2018 started as L&S MCB and transferred into Chem Bio in my sophomore year. Agree that BA vs BS is negligible. You get to focus a lot more on chemistry (and lots of MATH) in the CoC.
Hi! Thanks for your reply, it was super helpful! Overall I am more interested in chem than bio which is the main reason why I think transferring would be a good idea for me. I also want more personal advising and a closer relationship with my peers which I can’t get as easily in L&S. I’m glad to hear that I can still get a minor from another college, but I’ll definitely find out more info before making my decision :)
I have AP credit from Calc AB/BC and Biology which isn’t accepted in L&S, so if I do end up transferring I think I will get out of a few classes. I’ll check out the peer advising and see if it’s available!
If you don’t mind sharing, what were some of the main differences you noticed after transferring out of L&S?

Other than that, if you have solid cheatsheets, and study up until the exam, a 30% shouldn't be an issue, even with a complete lack of understanding of the material. 16B gives a lot of partial credit, so I would make sure to write something down for every question.

failing cs70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/3pu6os/failing_cs70/,2015-10-22 16:30:11,"As my username suggests, I’m failing CS70. I’m doing OK on homework, but shitty on the exams (2.2 standard deviations below the average to be exact). 

I don’t know what to do. I strongly believe that even if I retake CS70, the best grade I can get is a D. If the rest of my CS GPA was for example, all As, I wouldn’t be so worried, but I have two B+ and one C+, and another projected C+ in 61C. 

If I’m having this much trouble, should I even continue trying to declare? ","Well, what was stopping you from getting an A in CS70 (and your other classes)? (I don't mean this in an assholeish way--I mean it in like a, ""well, let's figure out what's been hindering you, and then we can try to work with that,"" kinda way.)

It may not be one BIG problem that's been hindering you but a gazillion little ones. Both cases equally hard to deal with.

""If I’m having this much trouble, should I even continue trying to declare?"" Depends. Is the difficulty stemming from a lack of understanding of CS, or other factors that make it really hard to actually sit down and study?
Why CS then? Do you enjoy coding and algorithms? if yes then continue. But if its just for a higher pay, then trust me it's not worth it. Keep in mind you are probably gonna be doing it for a long time, maybe your whole life so you better enjoy what you are doing. There's not much a person with entry level 100k can do that someone with 70k cannot do.
As someone who failed one of the CS lower-divs and retook it:

If you end up failing, retake it during the summer. Since you've already learned the material, the fast speed won't bother you as much, and from my experience, they tend to grade easier during the summer. 

With that said - you do have the opportunity to bring it up. You actually have some breathing room under 3.0, as long as you have a strong personal statement. If it's 2.6 or below you may have an issue though. 

>If I’m having this much trouble, should I even continue trying to declare?

The answer to that question is your answer to another question: ""Is CS truly what you want to do in life?"" If you don't really enjoy CS, it might not be worth it (I completely agree with /u/icmaster). But if CS is truly your passion and you find great enjoyment in coding and doing the projects, you might as well continue. 

With your grades, I think you still have a decent shot at getting in. 
Well, let's agree on one thing: Berkeley's hard. What's important is to not let yourself down and find out what exactly you need to change/do in order to bring your grades up and declare. That should be your #1 goal at this stage, if CS is what you really want to do.

This may involve cancelling out all your other commitments and activities until you declare. It may mean taking the minimum course-load until you declare. It may take all your focus on CS and P/NP-ing other classes. Whatever it is, you need to find out how badly you want to major in CS, and if you really love it, then go full force at it.

Maybe you can try changing your study strategies. Try studying in groups of focused, committed students. Do p-sets together. Go to office hours. Engage yourself in the material. Once you start doing these things, you'll understand the concepts and as a result end up doing better.

As the saying goes, do what you love, and love what you do. My $0.02. Peace and good luck!
Check out Cal Newport's books for great studying tips. Good luck!
One of the B+ was really frustrating. I was actually 1 point away from getting an A- (it was during the summer, and there was no curve apparently). The other B+ was because I didn't study quite as much as I should've/underestimated the class. The C+ was because I didn't study enough.

Now in CS70 it's probably I don't know how to study. I feel like I'm doing a lot of work for the class. Like I'm basically doing the bare minimum for my other classes (but they're going infinitely better than cs70) with the exception of 61c.
CS because I like the challenge of coding. The lower divs are actually enjoyable. But definitely not for more money. 
[deleted]
I'm a freshman and we need a 3.3 in cs 61A/B and cs70 to declare. If we're under, do we just retake it until we can pass the cap?
Due to family circumstances, I cannot take summer classes :(

But ok. I looked at the questions for the personal statement... I feel like anything I'd write would sound like excuses.

Up until now, I was really enjoying the coursework. But now in CS70, I hate the material. CS61C is slightly better, but I'm really hating the project/material right now. So now I'm not sure. 

I do plan on retaking though, since I'm only going to get busier, and the material's not going to really get easier. The only problem is when... The instructors will be the same next semester. Dunno if it's better to take with the same professors or take it with different ones.
3.0 is auto-in. 

Slightly below 3.0 is ""you have a decent chance of getting in if you have a really good personal statement"".

2.6 or below is pretty much screwed.

Right now, officially a minor. Been going through bureaucratic hoops to try to get the major. I've done all of the major coursework though.
You'd have to fail (letter grade F) or not pass (NP) in order to retake. They'd prefer if you don't take a class again just to get a better grade. If you're under, I feel like they'd apply the same policy they have now, counting upper divs you take if that makes your CS GPA higher -- so like try to get into upper divs and raise your GPA that way. 
From this point on is all probability theory though, so you get a brand new start (and there are two more tests to go)
>  I feel like anything I'd write would sound like excuses.

Christopher Hunn has always said, ""The more detail the better."" Don't come off as whiny - come off as passionate and stuff - if you're worried about it sounding like excuses. 

> But now in CS70, I hate the material. CS61C is slightly better, but I'm really hating the project/material right now. So now I'm not sure.

You'll only have to use some of the stuff in CS 70 in the future, and you basically never have to deal with the stuff in CS 61C again if you don't like it (if you avoid classes like CS 150/152/162/164). 

I still think you should try for summer classes if possible. :/ Most people seem to share a similar opinion with me that summer classes tend to grade easier. 
I thought you already graduated because you're '15 in ""DAE BIO/CSMASTERRACE '15 ~"". Does that mean you're graduating in December 2015?

Which lower div CS course did you fail? Why do you think you failed it, and how did you pass it the second time? Will the failed grade be factored into the GPA calculation for major declaration?

What kind of bureaucratic hoops do you need to jump through to try to get the major? I thought they didn't have the cap when you started presumably as a freshman. That'd be around 2011 if you didn't take a gap year, though if you're a transfer student then you started in 2013 around when the cap started to be put in place.

I really don't like the cap. :(
so what do you do if you don't make the 3.3 with the 3 classes they designate?
You can also retake if you got any sort of D. 

~~And yes, the upper-div thing could still work, but you need a major in the interim so L&S doesn't get mad at you for having no major.~~ never mind
Well, even if that is the case... based on how I've done on these two midterms, I'd likely have to get at least one standard deviation above the averages in order to pass the class. I have 0 confidence that that is possible. And then the final... I'll probably fail that since it's cumulative. 
I guess another part of my uncertainty comes from the fact that I've never been able to finish anything at a hackathon... So like I kind of feel like I can't do anything in CS. I mean yes, CS is not just about coding, but if I can't even build something on my own, that seems pretty telling of my (lack of) ability, and makes it harder to have anything concrete to base passion on. 
>  Does that mean you're graduating in December 2015?

Yes.

I failed CS 61C. I failed it because I was too worried about CS 170 and didn't pay enough attention to my progress in CS 61C. I passed it the second time because I think they grade easier in the summer. And it doesn't count if you got a D or an F. 

> I thought they didn't have the cap when you started presumably as a freshman. That'd be around 2011 if you didn't take a gap year, though if you're a transfer student then you started in 2013 around when the cap started to be put in place.

They didn't, but I started CS way too late -_- I took CS 61A in Spring 2013. 
[deleted]
keep taking upper divs until you reach 3.3?
I mean, if that's what they say to do with the old requirements, but you should talk to one of the advisers since things besides the GPA cap may have changed.
[deleted]
In that case I would just NP the class and take it next semester, good luck!
> I'd likely have to get at least one standard deviation above the averages in order to pass the class.

Homework can help, and the curve usually helps. If you're only looking to get a C-, it's definitely possible. I've done like 2 standard deviations below on midterms and still passed a class... but yeah C-s aren't very helpful for declaring lol.
> I guess another part of my uncertainty comes from the fact that I've never been able to finish anything at a hackathon...

Lol that's definitely not a good indicator. Plenty of people can't finish things at hackathons - most of the products are super rough, and they hide the fact that things don't really work. It's not uncommon to use dummy data because they can't get to the real data just so they can demo the features, or to squidge the end of the demo a bit because they didn't have enough time to get the final page to work completely. 

It'd be more concerning if you didn't finish homework. Even not finishing projects is within the realm of ""normal"", especially with professors like Hilfinger (if you've ever had him). 
It actually wasn't. 

It was announced the beginning of Summer 2013 and implemented starting Spring 2014 (they were originally debating implementing it either Spring or Fall 2014). Anyone who was in 61A Spring 2013 and didn't take 61B during summer or double up on 61B + 61C during fall was caught in the cap. 
Unfortunately upper div CS classes will no longer count toward your declaration GPA
Or applied math.

Tragedy has struck Berkeley…,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/13ohgen/tragedy_has_struck_berkeley/,2023-05-21 22:25:02,"It is with deep regret that I inform you all that today, at approximately 9:30 PM PDT, prominent(and incredibly sexy) r/Berkeley shitposter u/Cal_Aesthetics_Club has been found alive and well at his residence.

Authorities have determined the cause of life to be birth via c-section and, although the investigation is ongoing, no foul play is suspected at this time. Police were en route to notify u/Cal_Aesthetics_Club ‘s kin and spouse Oski of the tragedy only to discover that they(with the exception of Oski) were already residing in the same house that he was found in and were aware of him being alive.

Suffice it to say, his family has been deeply impacted by the tragedy. “I don’t see what the issue is if he’s alive and well…”, said his mom, appearing perplexed. “I don’t even know him and why did he say I was his spouse?!?!?!,” exclaimed Oski, also very much perplexed. “The shit’s still alive?? Goddammit!,” said his little brother, crying tears of frustration and sadness.

In the words of police spokesman rcinvestments, “Ayo this is an unprecedented disaster of epic proportions with no comparison, with the exception of maybe the death of Harambe. That gorilla was just chill like that, you know?”.

Both President Biden and Vice President Harris have been notified of the tragedy and have cancelled their planned trip to Wakanda, accordingly. In lieu of that, they will be flying to Berkeley to console the city’s grieving residents and offer light in a time of darkness. When asked for comment, President Biden replied, “I, as President, swear to solemnly uphold my duty and ensure that such a catastrophe never occurs agai-Oh look! A squirrel!”

Other political figures have also weighed in with their opinions: Former US President Donald Trump tweeted, “Shit like only happens in Biden’s America! When I become President, I’m going make America white…err…umm…I mean great!…again…”.

Additionally, leaders from around the world have offered their condolences in unique ways: “If you want, I could make him disappear! But remove those semiconductor sanctions, first!”, said President Xi Jinping. “I, too, can do that! Just undo all the Ukraine sanctions!”, exclaimed President Vladimir Putin. “ “I, three, can do that, if you reinstate the 2015 nuclear deal!” said the Supreme Leader of Iran. “I don’t even know what’s going on but, if you piss me off, I will send nudes…uhhh…I mean nukes!”, threatened Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.","man has too much time

CoC Announces PNP!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/jpfheg/coc_announces_pnp/,2020-11-06 14:59:46,"PNP announcement from the Dean just now! 

copy and pasted:

 Dear College of Chemistry students,  


After carefully considering advice from the campus Faculty Senate and the ASUC Office of Academic Affairs, the College of Chemistry has decided to accept P/NP grades for college, major, and CoC minor requirements for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. (This does not apply to the UC-wide Entry Level Writing requirement: College Writing R1A must be taken for a letter grade and completed with a C or better to satisfy the requirement.)  


We have also extended the late change-of-schedule deadline to December 3, and waived the one-time late action policy for late drops and late grade option changes.  


Our intention is to support CoC undergraduates during this difficult period by reducing stress, while still encouraging learning and progress toward your degrees.  


Please note that changing a class or classes to P/NP may not be the best action in all circumstances. Other strategies, such as dropping a class or taking an incomplete (to spread out some work), may be more appropriate ways of coping with difficulties.  


We understand that these changes raise important questions about your academic progress and professional prospects. We hope to address your concerns at a CoC virtual town hall meeting on Monday, November 9, at 5:00pm. We plan to have faculty, staff, and industry representatives available to talk about how P/NP may impact academic probation, financial aid, graduate school admissions, job searches, etc.  


Please register in advance for this town hall meeting:  
[https://berkeley.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMqduCrrjMrEtSW7NJ9itgcAMZ74pKw6j7u](https://berkeley.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMqduCrrjMrEtSW7NJ9itgcAMZ74pKw6j7u)  
After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.  


We ask for your patience and understanding as your advisers navigate the implications of these policy changes. Early next week, we will update the Undergraduate Student Services website with further information Please wait until AFTER the town hall to contact your adviser with questions about the P/NP and late-drop options.","What's your source for this? I didn't get this email
does this mean there’s no limit on how many classes we can take p/np? or can we still only take one p/np but it can now be used for major reqs?
I just saw the student affairs Instagram make a post about this as well
i dont know unfortunately :/ you can register for the town hall meeting though and ask your question to them
Great! Thanks so much. Lol I am so happy right now"
Course just got canceled and need help,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/oqyj77/course_just_got_canceled_and_need_help/,2021-07-24 14:24:46,"Hello, I’m a rising sophomore and due to logistics of taking the AWPE exam, I had to put off taking RC classes until my sophomore year. I was planning to take RCA in fall and RCB in spring and be done with it. However, the RCA course I enrolled in just got cancelled out of nowhere and there are currently no openings in other RCA courses. Also, I’m stuck below the minimum unit count and need 4 units to meet the minimum units. I was looking through available courses and saw that almost everything is filled up and couldn’t find many options. I will be taking 61b and 70 together in fall so I don’t want to be cramped with another tech. Does anyone have any recommendations about how to proceed with the RC reqs since it seems that I won’t be able to fulfill them by the end of my 2nd year? Also, it’d be great if anyone knows of any interesting courses that are still available and let me know!","How did the course get ""cancelled,"" did they send out an official email about it? Did you go through all the RCA listings like Slavic R5A and whatever? I feel like there were always a few less-than-ideal courses that had a few openings for students who somehow got shafted by the system one way or another, but if literally every RCA course is filled then I'd say look to fulfill a different breadth requirement. 

Depending on your summer plans, you could always take RCA next sem and take RCB in the summer term so you'd get them done by the start of your third year.
Weird that there are zero R&C A openings left and a ton of people on waitlists.  

You are pretty much in a bind, I don’t think you can afford to wait it out any longer.  You won’t be able to register for junior classes if you’re not done by summer after sophomore year.  You should apply for a R&C A equivalent class at say Berkeley Community College.  You’ll need to get an L&S advisor to sign off on this.
FWIW there are a few departments still hiring GSIs to teach R&C courses (saw a few positions in art history, for instance); more classes might be posted before the beginning of the semester? Good luck OP.
They just sent out an email saying they have to close the section. Unfortunately, there are absolutely no openings in any RCA courses apart from FPF ones rn. 

Unfortunately, I won’t be in Berkeley next summer so I can only do online but I’m not sure if it will be offered. I heard taking it at a CC online is an option but I’m not sure if international students are allowed to do that.
Is it required by the College of L&S that we should finish R&C A and B by the end of the 4th semester? Would the summer after the 4th semester be included? Thanks.
Thanks for the response. I scheduled an appointment with an Ls adviser on Tuesday and will ask them the same questions. Do you know if I end up taking RCA equivalent at a cc in fall can I take less than minimum units at Berkeley? Otherwise, would it be better to take RCA in spring and RCB equivalent at a cc over summer if they normally offer an online option and if it’s allowed by Ls?
Great, thank you. I’ll be checking for an opening then.
I'd just get crackin on a different breadth requirement at this point, then. Rough spot, sorry about that.
What will happen is that if you don’t have both classes enrolled/taken by the middle of your 4th semester, you will have a hold placed on you that prevents you from registering for your 5th semester.  Ordinarily one would then set up a meeting with an L&S advisor promising to finish it in summer somewhere, either at Berkeley or at a CC, whereupon the L&S advisor would then manually lift the hold.  I don’t know what happens if a student then reneges on taking it in the summer after 4th semester - don’t know anyone who has done that.
You can ask the L&S advisor the minimum units question.  I would think you can go under if you’re getting units done at a CC since you’re forced to, but double-check.
Berkeley offers an online option for R4B in the summer. Usually session A.

Just take R1A in the spring and enroll in R4B in the summer. As long as you are enrolled in R4B before Fall 2022 registration you will not get a registration hold
Thank you so much for the information.
Sounds like a good option. Thanks!"

Please help- pros and cons of UC Berkeley (for global studies major)? Compared to NYU?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1cauhkd/please_help_pros_and_cons_of_uc_berkeley_for/,2024-04-22 20:21:32,"Hi! I am currently deciding between majoring in global studies at UC berkeley and NYU liberal studies core program which is 2 years g first of which id spend in washington, d.c.) and then majoring in international relations. What are your thoughts? Especially if you are a global studies major what has been your experience? Do you think there are good opportunities and internships for this at Berkeley? My family is kinda pushing towards Berkeley over NYU because they’re saying it’s a way bigger name globally and domestically but I’m slightly hesitant. I really wanna know if that’s true because they’re south asian immigrants and just doctors so idk if they’re right or not lol. And again specifically for what I wanna do I feel like NYU does hold credibility? idk (Also cost is not a factor.) Here’s a bit of a breakdown- 
NYU: 
- I think would enjoy the unique classes like for science (esp bc i dislike science typically) and general requirements more 
- smaller classes by far, more discussion based and stuff 
- washington dc and nyc location 
- idk i’m already from the west coast so i think it would be funsies to try smth new LOL 💀
- no campus, but eh
- some people say it’s hard to have support and good advising from the school, but i’ve also seen some say there is
- may be a bit of a nuisance to have the LSC program, someone said it’s more restrictive than berkeleys general requirements i think 
- less prestigious
UC Berkeley 
- more prestigious, people see the name and just… yeah apparently 
- huge class sizes, hard to get help or develop a relationship (this does worry me especially bc it’s a bit hard for me to advocate for myself but it’s a work in progress) 
- really competitive, can be toxic- i assume nyu is decently as well but for some reason i saw a lot of comments about this for berkeley but not nyu. 
- homeless people, bad area outside campus, someone said more likely to get spit on at berkeley than nyc tbh lol 
- pretty campus? haven’t really seen but may visit also wait this isn’t even important lol but 
- more flexibility with general ed requirements perhaps 
- might have to do actual science? ew but i’ll look into this more hold up 
Okay that’s all I can think of right now that I’ve gathered from online. Any help or input is appreciated thank you!🩵 Sorry to bother ","Well idk the right choice, but it's not competitive, not toxic, had no problem getting help or building relationships, no issue making friends, and certainly never been spit on lmao
hi! i’m currently an (intended) global studies major (and also majoring in comparative literature) and i dont know much about nyu liberal studies program (tho i did apply like 4 years ago). 

i honestly am enjoying the GS major because of how interdisciplinary it is and how you can essentially choose what you want to specifically study with your reqs. tbf, i did do a dual degree so i’ve been at cal for only a year and a few of my reqs were fulfilled at the other university i attended. i’m currently doing world history (in the polecon dept), asia in global context, and politics of southeast asia, which have shed light on how historical issues continue to manifest in social, economic, and political issues. the assignments offer a lot of space to be creative w your thinking and focus on an issue you’re really interested in. 

ik ucb gets a rep of being competitive and having huge class sizes, but if you’re in the social sciences and the humanities, it’s much more collaborative and not as grade deflated as STEM (i believe). in fact, ive met a lot of my friends through some big global studies classes but also know that you will find a lot of friends through the clubs you join. 

also, i feel like i’ve developed great relationships with my professors throughout the year by participating a lot in class and going to their office hours a lot. your professors often will like to chat about their interests and your interests, because there are many professors in the gs dept who are genuinely interested in knowing more about you and helping you develop as a person. major advisors are very much accessible in gs and easy to call. (i will say i have a closer relationship w my complit advisor because complit is a smaller dept.) 

because global studies is very broad, you have the option to choose big lectures (sometimes w discussion sections) or smaller lecture, discussion based classes. in terms of the science req, i personally did mine at community college the year before i started university. there’s also a few quirky, laidback ones that a lot of humanities and global studies oriented students take. a lot of ppl i know take earthquakes in your backyard for example. 

in terms of opportunities and internships, i’ve personally been lucky to have had a few through applying through Berkeley’s handshake lol. but also because berkeley is so huge, there’s a lot of opportunities everywhere that you feel like you don’t know where to even start. for example, i applied to a few internships in some of uc berkeley’s for the next year and i’ve been lucky enough to be considered in the running by two of them. in terms of the summer, handshake is definitely helpful as well as the global studies instagram where they promote a lot of opportunities you can apply for. i’m currently will be staying over at berkeley for my internship this summer. i lowkey also look at a lot of the flyers on the bulletin boards have on campus because they also provide info to things i would not know even with social media.

i think a lot of the competitive, difficult accessing resources stereotype about berkeley comes from the stem side of the school because there tends to be a lot of students in STEM. being a diff path from stem just means experiencing uni life differently and honestly, there’s no one experience that defines a lot of people’s experiences at cal. 

if you have any more questions, pls feel free to private message me!!
also: easier to make friends at nyu probably because i’ll be in the lsc program in dc which is like 80-100 students TOTAL 😭💀💀

Student who have taken chemistry/math/physics courses at cal,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ggtvnc/student_who_have_taken_chemistrymathphysics/,2020-05-09 20:19:02,Can you describe the attitude professors have around students. I’m afraid that they don’t care about our desire to succeed I hav read countless blogs regarding professors at cal and how they are very irrational and don’t understand for example adjusting to the Covid situation. How good are they at teaching? Is there a passion in communicating knowledge? I’m in CoC if any of you want to describe that department ty!!! Go bears!!,"I agree with the Saykally comment but Geissler is great for chem 1a! Really supportive and engaging. Alexander paulin for math is great as well for math, he's really passionate about his subject and offers 10 (!) office hours a week. I had Mike deweese for physics 8a, didn't love his class but I also hate the subject so it kinda evens out. He was adequate and definitely enthusiastic but his teaching style didn't click with mine.
I’ve found that this notion of Cal professors all being irrational egomaniacs is mostly unfounded, and is the result of very specific incidents that involve fewer than 10 professors in the EECS, Chemical Engineering, and Math departments put together, being blown vastly out of proportion by a disgruntled but vocal minority of students. This has just been echoed Ad Nauseam because so much of our school body’s identity is based on ‘how tough we have it’ compared to everyone else. The majority of professors in all three of these departments are more than understanding of the current situation, and are pretty nice people overall and willing to accommodate students in most situations. Yes, Cal is a tough school and can often be unforgiving, but the professors are not intent on ruining your life like they are made out to be. I don’t know who told you otherwise, but most professors you meet will want you to succeed, regardless of their actual quality of teaching.
Saykally for Chem 4 is trash but math and physics have been amazing haven’t had one bad one. Professors care a lot it’s just these courses are hard so people confuse difficulty and caring
Can't speak for chemistry, but I've had great experiences with professors in math and physics. 

In particular, Michael Zaletel for Physics 5A and Nikhil Srivastava for Math 54 have been excellent. Both super engaging, helpful, and show a lot of care for their students. I have Nikhil this semester and he was very generous in the transition online.
For math courses, I find that many professors are very helpful and willing to listen to student concerns.  I don't exactly know what you mean by ""care about our desire to succeed,"" like, no my professors are not actively showing concern to those in the class who aren't keeping up.  But they're extremely helpful and available for anyone who expresses that they need help.

Certainly none of them are irrational, if anything sometimes the level of rationality and attempts at ""perfecting the system"" can be a little much.

The math professors are for the most part rather good when it comes to teaching and lecturing, and do enjoy the teaching part of their roles.  I have yet to have a professor who I felt was indifferent to it, everyone has had a good attitude and energy.
In general I think professors in all three departments vary widely in terms of how effective they are in teaching.  Naturally, some will be more open to answering questions during lecture than others.  That said, at the end of the day, every professor I've had did seem to want to teach to the best of their ability.  No one was there just ""going through the motions.""

Particularly, I find that office hours are an extremely under-utilized resource, and in these one on one/smaller settings, professors who give poor lectures can explain a concept much more effectively.
I second Paulin. Absolutely amazing had him for Math 1A and currently taking 1B
Absolutely agree with Geissler. I had him for Chem 1A in my first semester and he really makes an effort to make sure his students understand. His tests can get pretty tricky but there's a lot of support for it so its doable.
Can you speak more about 5A w/ Zaletel, in particular how you balanced 5A with the other techs you were taking? I want to do CS61B, EE16A, and Physics 5A next semester but I'm worried about the workload.
I took CS 61A, EE16A, and Physics 5A and while 61B will take more work, the combination is definitely doable. Professor Zaletel's problem sets are long and difficult (but interesting!), so on a weekly basis 5A will likely take more time than your other classes. I worked with a friend and typically I'd dedicate a whole day just to do the problem set. SPS also hosts study halls for 5A that might be useful for tackling hw. Tests are reasonable and easier than the hw. While there were some weeks with this combo that were not fun, it's definitely manageable if you stay on top of things.
Sorry I didn't get back to you! Finals week and all. I basically agree with what milamila said. I took 5A, 61A, Math 53 and an easy breadth (IB 35) last semester and found it pretty manageable. Zaletel's problem sets were challenging but very enjoyable, especially if done with friends. He gives more homework questions than needed to get a full score, but I definitely recommend seriously attempting every problem, as it will essentially guarantee a full homework score (if you lose some points to errors) and will make you learn the material very thoroughly. I actually much preferred them to the easier but more tedious and less illuminating 5B homeworks. Since you're taking 16A, I assume you've done Math 1B. While it's a only coreq, a good understanding of Taylor series will definitely help.
Thanks for the insight. Also, how much physics experience did you have going into 5A?
To add on, I think having some prior exposure to calculus based physics really helps with 5A, but any solid high school physics would be sufficient. As far as managing workload, I think taking extra time to really understand homeworks saves a lot of time down the road when preparing for exams, and is a good rule for managing many hard classes. This especially applies to classes like 5A where the homework is challenging, moreso than exam questions.
A fairly significant amount, however, plenty of people come in with just AP/IB Physics background (or hs physics) and do fine. IMO, your math and problem solving background matters a bit more than your direct physics knowledge. The curve for the class is also pretty generous
Thanks for the reply. My physics knowledge is very minimal (I'm familiar with kinematics, but nothing else) and I don't have any calculus based physics experience. Do you think this will make the workload of 5A too high to take w/ 61B & EE16A?
I think the workload would be doable if you have reasonable confidence in your CS and math ability. Experience in Java or basic data structures for 61B, or a good ability to think about abstract math for 16A. If not, I think it would still be doable but would be very time consuming, especially for only 11 units. I'd recommend reading the first few chapters of Kleppner and Kolenkow's Intro to Mechanics, the 5A textbook, to get a sense of the class. A fair number of the problems come from there, and a lot of the class follows the book. I will admit the book can be a bit confusing at times, but there are definitely worse textbooks. Yoh should be able to find it online.
Alrighty, thanks a lot for the info"

On the first “quiz” for discussion, I deadass got almost everything wrong and couldn’t even answer any of the proof questions. I had to go to the discussion with the same material—twice. And this is even after trying to review the course note before lecture and attending lecture. Feels so bad. My knees are knocking. 

That being said.. how likely is it for me to get a C if I do all the homework’s, watch and take notes during lecture proactively, pay attention to discussion proactively, and practice on some past exams prior to an actual exam?

EDIT: Thanks for all the thoughtful responses y’all. I feel better. I’ll definitely look out for CSM and attend a lot of office hours and HKN hours. ☺️

EDIT: Fixed C- to be C, since C is the grade I need.","First of all, take a deep breath. You're going to be OK. It's only the first week. There's plenty of time to figure out what parts you're good at and how to study everything else. Besides, 70 is one of those courses where knowing even 50% of the material will put you in the B+/A- range. I'm certain you'd be able to get a C- with your plan.      
That being said, I highly highly x10 recommend CSM. They're basically tiny tutoring/discussion sections (~5 people) and way more useful than any of the other resources imo. For this class, you really ought to *practice* the material outside of lecture and get feedback, and that can't really happen outside of small study groups/homework parties/OH/CSM.
gradewise, cs70 is not really any harder than 61a/b. this is objectively true - the class has more or less the same grade distribution (except for hilfinger's 60% A semesters), and you're competing against more or less the same people. some people find 70 much harder than the other lower divs, but a lot of people find it the same or easier. 

the real disconnect is that the actual *material* in 70 is much, much harder than 61ab. you have to realize that the majority of the class has *no fucking clue* what's going on. I got an A+ in this class and there were topics that confused the shit out of me. half the graph proofs felt like straight-up magic. berlekamp-welch never really made sense to me either. 

a very, very small percentage of people get below a C-. unless you've consistently been at the bottom of your other classes, I wouldn't worry about it. the class does not expect you to understand everything fully.

also, sahai loves to scare people with his **mathematical maturity** talks and what not but he has pretty nice grade distributions.

you're probably worrying for no reason OP. best of luck :)
Consider getting supplemental tutoring for it thru CSM, CS 370, or an EECS private tutor.
Highly recommend CSM! Also, don't be too worried about 70. I think if you just put in the time to understand the material and do homework diligently, you'll at least get a B (regardless of who ur taking it w)
C-? prolly anyone at Cal can pull that off if they do all those things you said
Don't think that going to two discussion means you're not cut out for it. That's exactly what is needed for some people, myself included. I took 70 twice, went to multiple discussions, and did everything I could to be ""average"" and get a B+. It's a grind
I finished with a 38% and got a C, so just do better than that lolll
If you're thinking of getting a C- and wanting to declare for CS, uh, you're not going to make it.  On the other hand, it's pretty hard to get any kind of C.  You literally would have to be in like the 5th-10th percentile to get a C-.  Conversely, in a 750 person class, you'd literally have be to be ranked in the bottom 75.
Yeah, I meant likelihood of C- as in how to avoid it. I actually need only need a C to declare CS. I recognize that I phrased the question oddly, so I get what you mean."
For everyone worried about being rescinded: My experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ftpmsp/for_everyone_worried_about_being_rescinded_my/,2020-04-02 09:42:13," Hi guys! 

I know a lot of you just recently got into Berkeley, and some of you are currently overly worried about being rescinded.

Here’s what my experience was (though it was 2 years ago now):

I went to a private school in Lebanon for my freshman year, I then moved to California for the remainder of HS.

When I was self-reporting my grades, I wasn’t focusing that much. I took an online business class in HS and I received what would have been equivalent to an A but I didn’t realize it was actually reported as a Pass on my transcript. I put that I got an A in the class when I actually just ‘passed’. This scared me shitless and I didn’t realize until after committing.

I also did not realize that Berkeley would require a physical copy of my Lebanese transcript with a stamp from the principal. I found out that I needed to get my physical transcript FROM LEBANON just a few days before it was required. My calcentral said it was late. I had no idea how I was going to get a copy of my transcript.

To make matters worse, I remembered something that I thought was a big fat deal breaker. In my freshman year, I took a theater class and I got a C+. When I moved to my new high school, they didn't add that to my transcript because I technically ""retook"" the requirement for arts. I never reported that to Cal because when I was looking at my California transcript (that had my Lebanon grades on it), it never had the C grade on there. I *GENUINELY* forgot that I even took that class. I thought Cal would interpret it as me lying about a poor grade when in reality I had just retaken ""requirement"" for a different grade.

So... what did I do?

When I initially realized that I put an A instead of a Pass on my self-reported grades, I emailed the admissions officer assigned to me RIGHT away. I made it clear that the reason I put an A was that I received an A, but the class was only reported as a Pass. I also knew that I could contact my HS in order to have them prove this point. **RESPONSE FROM AO: Thanks for letting us know, you're fine**.

I was emailed by my AO asking for a physical copy of my Lebanese transcript with a stamp, and for the package that it comes in to stay sealed. I told her I had no idea how I was going to get it since the school had closed for the summer, and since the school is a private school there is minimal staff on campus that could help me. She told me to find a way. Lucky for me, my family friend worked at the school and her daughter was coming to visit over the summer. I told my AO and she kept on telling me to hurry it up because it was urgent. I was so scared that they were looking for something in order to rescind me. I managed to get my transcript, and I had to take it to her in person. **RESPONSE FROM AO: She unsealed it, looked at the stamp and moved right along.**

When I remembered that there was a C+ on my Lebanese transcript, I emailed my AO before meeting her to let her know that my California HS didn't report that since I retook the requirement for a different grade. **RESPONSE FROM AO: She didn't care, said it was fine, and I moved right along.**

&#x200B;

After I got my acceptance letter, I started feeling like I didn't really deserve this opportunity. I know that I do now, but I didn't feel that way before. I felt like it might have been an accident and that's why they kept on asking me for things that friends I had made through facebook hadn't been asked for. 

Needless to say, they didn't rescind me. I don't think that you will be rescinded either. I know that people had worse experiences with potentially being rescinded, but this is my experience and I thought it would be good to share. 

Also, incoming freshman, you guys are living through a global pandemic, and I'm sure that they aren't going to be as stringent, so please don't worry too much","thanks for this.  My experience through 30+ years of dealing with Berkeley in different capacities has been that the rules are in place so that they CAN be enforced when necessary, but the people interpreting them are both smart and compassionate, and are given the latitude to interpret them as such.  In a time of such uncertainty it's frightening to have so much doubt about something as important as your college future, but this experience mirrors everything I've seen from Berkeley in the past.  Try and take comfort in that.

edit to fix a word
[Both the UC and Cal State systems will suspend the letter grade requirement for the 15 prescribed college-preparatory courses completed in winter/spring/summer 2020 for all students, including the most recently admitted freshmen. Cal State may make admissions exceptions on a case-by-case basis for students who fail to complete all of the required courses because of the pandemic.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-01/uc-to-suspend-admission-requirements-for-sat-minimum-gpas-to-help-students-during-coronavirus-crisis%3F_amp%3Dtrue)
This all over.

I had a 3.0 in high school, I can’t even remember my SAT, but I got a 4.0 in community college and had studied Japanese for 5 years and worked there by that point. They must’ve liked my essay a lot.

Always be honest. Always be sincere. 

It goes a long, long fucking way.
I had credit from another college that I reported having on my application, but when it was time to send in transcripts that college lost all my credit.  I emailed Berkeley letting them know of my situation, and offered to put them in contact with my high school so they could verify I took those classes.  They didn't talk to my school and not only was I not rescinded, I was given credit for classes they had no proof I took.  You will 99.99% chance not get rescinded.
Can they rescind me if I get a D in my multivariable class this semester that I’m taking at a community college, which I am taking for my own benefit of learning and don’t need to take to fulfill my A-G courses?
I also have a friend who, in a normal year, failed a couple of her classes and barely passed the others senior year and wasn’t rescinded, so if that amount of leniency applies then, it certainly will now.
Thank you for this!! When I thought I might be rescinded, there were not many posts on this subreddit to help. I definitely want to confirm what you said. Once they have accepted you, you reallly really have to go out of you way to get rescinded. I was missing Ge courses and did not do so hot my last quarter at mu university, and they said it was fine as long as I took the ge classes over summer and got above a 3.0 that quarter.
Bro I failed a class in sophomore year (it was a CAD class thinks it counts as arts) and never reported because it literally doesn’t exist in the Uc curriculum. 

I spent freshman and sophomore year in Nyc before moving to California. 

Is that something that will get me rescinded?
i deadass wasn't even allowed to graduate high school on time (found out that I didn't fulfill my P.E. requirement correctly 2 months before graduation... long story) and nothing was rescinded, I just emailed a few people to let them that I didn't have a diploma to send them and they truly didn't care.
Just to add onto this:

Everytime someone is worried about getting rescinded, I remind them that my dumbass roommate got a 33 on his IB (was predicted much higher) and has a 3.1 GPA rn and will most probably declare CS. If he can go from that low to doing reasonably well (3.1 isn't the greatest but it's not too bad either) then you needn't worry at all. He is OOS too.
Hi!! I accidently reported an extra class (with an A too!!) in my UC APPS!!! I am so stressed that they’ll end up rescinding bcus it does change GPA. But your story helps a lot. Hopefully they realize that it is an honest mistake.
BRO THANK GOD. 

This question was literally eating me away and you answered it and literally took away all of my concerns. 

I accidentally misreported my grades (super dumb mistake) and I’ve been thinking it’s clipped for me
Wow, this beautiful characterization of the system is spot on in my 15+ years of experience interfacing with Cal): byzantine bureaucracy staffed by compassionate human beings. Take heart, new Bears!
I think you should fill out the admissions update form on the admissions portal, but overall I think you should highlight that it's not a class you're taking for credit, I think it will be fine. 

I also think (someone correct me if I'm wrong) they've suspended requirements for incoming freshman because of covid19, so you should be fine. 

I want to emphasize *let them know, be honest, they* ***will*** *understand*
hello, were rescinded because of this?
I am so scared that due to my second semester grades it will be rescinded
Thanks for giving me confidence. Now wish me luck so that I get in today 🤡
Bruh I hope to god
Wait did your friend let Berkeley know of the fails in her classes beforehand?
Have you already sent them your transcript? I think the only reason they needed 2 different transcripts from me (Lebanon and California) is because I was an international student. 

If your transcript says that you failed the class, send them an update through the admissions portal and ***let them know, be honest and it will be ok.***
Did you end up getting rescinded?
You are going to be ok! Just let admissions know as soon as you can. They're really nice about it. Don't worry :)
I’m not sure? It was the second semester senior year, I think you have to turn in those grades right?
Hi! So I was told to wait till after my acceptances to contact the admissions office. That’s what I did! And luckily they were very understanding. My mistake did not affect my chance of admission like I was scared of. Going to ucla this fall!!
I did rn bc I was so inspired and they said “Please report this update via the Undergraduate Admissions Update form on your MAP@Berkeley.” 

What I need to report (accidentally misreported my grade) is not one of the conditions so I’ll write something on the comments on the additional information. 

I already accepted my offer of admissions though BRUHH
Almost exact same thing happend to me, I palned to take Ap Cal BC out side of school but didn't register due school and family issue but put A for both semester in the UC application.  Can you please tell your situation and how you contacted admission office(by update form or email). Please help!!
When all of my things went down, I had already accepted my offer too. Don't worry, it will be ok
Everything will be okay!!! I got into UCLA, called admissions and they said thwy open a portal to file changes and it worked out:)
Thank you for being so kind.
What did Berkeley respond saying?
They didn’t"
Does anyone know how a W (withdrawal) on a transcript for transfer to UC Berkeley would look to admissions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cr7nbk/does_anyone_know_how_a_w_withdrawal_on_a/,2019-08-16 08:08:05," I have straight A’s with the exception of one C. I started the course and realized too late that the level of study was too advanced. The only assignments for credit were two heavily weighted papers (one of which I’ve finished with poor results) and I’m thinking of withdrawing before the second paper to save my grade. If I don’t withdraw, I’ll have a C- at best, and my instinct is that a W is better than a D or C-. Any thoughts?","I have like 10 Ws, and I still earned my transfer. I had to withdraw due to family financial strains, we were hit hard from the recession. I retook most of them after a 6-years hiatus from school, and aced all of them. 
There’s a section in the application that you can explain why you have Ws, and from my understanding, they usually ignore the Ws if you retake that class or they were from awhile ago.  
Best to get a W, so you can retake it, if you ended up getting a passing letter grade, most CC dont let you retake that class without permission.
i have always heard that transfer admissions often overlooks one or two Ws
Anecdotal- but I got in with 4 W's. I don't think they care.
I had a W because I made a scheduling error one sem, retook the class the next sem and got an A.

Now I'm a bear.
Helpful, thank you! The course isn’t required so I’m not sure if I’ll retake it - it was bad judgement on my part to take it in the first place, and the course was poorly structured.
I always withdrew from classes I thought I'd get a C or D in, which kept my GPA competitive.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Just work hard and get good grades.

Master Post for Making Berkeley More Bearable from Incoming Seniors [very comprehensive],https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ouah3z/master_post_for_making_berkeley_more_bearable/,2021-07-29 18:01:29,"Hey me and my friends thought it would be a helpful idea to give some freshmen advice to survive/be happy at Berkeley since we’re all noobs again.

***General Tips:***

* Big C, Indian Rock Park, fire trails are really fun and local trails
* Be nice to Berkeley natives and your houseless neighbors. Remember you're only there for 4 years.
* Your friend group is going to change a lot throughout your first year, don't get too hung up on it.
* Almost all classes and student org events are on Berkeley time (starts 10 minutes after posted start time)
* Go exploring. Don’t be one of those people who miss out on all the exciting things in the bay. Available public transportation options:
   * Learn the BART lines and AC transit stops
   * BayWheels has crazy good deals for unlimited student access ($5 for a year if you’re EOP)
   * Bus rides around the city are free. No one really takes campus busses because Berkeley City buses are already really good
   * Gig rental cars are a dub
* **Download Transit** on your phone for public transit
* Don’t talk about your SAT/AP scores you nerds
* Everyone plays league/valorant/smash
* **Follow Flyerstack on Instagram/ join app waitlist** to keep track of events going on in Berkeley and on campus
* Don’t step on the seal or it will be one of the reasons you won’t get a 4.0
* Don’t buy your books unless you ABSOLUTELY need to (like homework codes). Get them online. (i'm not going to condone piracy but...)
* Everyone says it, but seriously, don't be afraid to ask for help from your professors or GSI's
* Don't live your entire life on campus, go out and explore shit. you're an adult now.
* imposters syndrome is real, but you deserve your spot here. Especially transfers.

***Food:***

* **Download snackpass** for online ordering and deals, for free food use my referral code (ashyang)
* Asian “ghetto” is great for late night options, gourmet “ghetto” on northside  is fire
* Andronico’s Community market is just Safeway but more expensive
* Dining Halls Rank:
   * Clark Kerr: food is the best, prettiest seating/venue
   * Foothill: sick views of the whole bay and campanile, food is aggressively mediocre, close to science buildings, get a seat by the window, we’re ranking this higher because of the views
   * Crossroads: food selection has more variety than cafe 3, vibes are better. They offer late night but tbh it doesn’t deserve the hype, go somewhere else on/off Telegraph It’s only worth it if you have leftover swipes
   * Cafe 3- awful unless you’re vegan (known as vegan cafe), there is meat but less selections than Crossroads. Kind of reminds us of pre-school
* On Campus/Close to Campus Cafe Ranking:
   * Babette Cafe (inside BAMPFA)- best coffee
   * !951 Coffee Company- both MLK and Channing Way Locations, pretty large latte size for the price you pay, it’s a nonprofit cafe that supports refugee communities
   * SoDoI Coffee Tasting House- if it opens back up after COVID, bomb-ass matcha latte, cute and family owned and operated
   * Caffe Strada- good price for size of coffee, a lot of robberies do happen here, lot of study space/outdoor plugs (but be aware)
   * Cafe Milano- coffee is not as good, but tons of seating (upstairs), good location
   * Romeo’s Coffee- kind of a gimmick location, cheesy romantic vibes, not the best for studying
   * Rude Awakening- good for studying, very close to campus on northside, coffee is mediocre
   * Way Station Cafe- deep southside, beer garden in back is good for hanging out
   * Best on campus cafes are: Yali’s in Stanley Hall for early lectures on east of campus and Free Speech Movement Cafe best for late night studying and apple clouds pastries are bomb
* Cafe’s not in Southside but still walkable/good for studying
   * My Coffee Roastery: super cute, and great coffee, next door is Flora Arte (super cute nursery/decor shop)
   * Blue Bottle- kind of basic, not as good for studying, good coffee, a little pricey
   * Saigon Express: high ranking because of their iced Vietnamese coffee, super cheap banh mi, pay in cash
   * Victory Point Cafe- can pay extra for board games, vanilla latte is bomb, plenty of seating/outlets, a little far
   * Gold Leaf Cafe- seating isn’t open yet, cute but millennial vibe

***Advice for frat parties and also parties:***

1. Don’t go to frat parties, but if you do if the frat doesn’t say the five pillars of consent when you enter RED FLAG
2. It won’t be as fun as you think it will be unless you’re friends with everybody
3. Get a pair of shitty, comfortable sneakers that you won’t be sad if beer or mud gets on them.
4. Most people don’t super clean jungle juice containers (personally I just spray it down with a hose) and a vodka plandle won’t kill as much mildew as you think it will.
5. You will need a bid for all frat parties after week one.
6. Bring your CalID during week one and GBO to frat parties
7. If you're a potential new member for PHC sororities during primary recruitment, you are not allowed to go to frat parties throughout recruitment week.
8. Learn rage cage/beer pong rules
9. Follow house rules for rage cage/beer pong. Each house/apartment has their own rules.
10. Shitty, cheap vodka/tequila/fireball is only downable for at most 1 year
11. Cheapest plandles: vitali (safeway), the plandle of gin (safeway),  Vodka of the Gods (trader joe’s),
12. Most Frat parties will only have shitty beer (keystone/natural light/coors) don’t expect claws and trulys (just pre-game)
13. Don’t lose sight of your cup, just throw it away if you lose sight of it
14. Go with friends and always keep tabs on each other
15. Eat before you drink
16. Drink water and electrolytes after (pedialyte is the best for hangovers)
17. MCGC, club, student org, and sport parties  >>> IFC frat parties
18. If you go upstairs for alc or whatever during a frat party be careful or go in a group","Damn. As a senior citizen 2012 alum I wish someone had given me this list back in 2008.  ""Don’t be one of those people who miss out on all the exciting things in the bay. "" <-- I was definitely one of these people and thoroughly regret staying in my dorm for most of my four years. Go out and explore!
[deleted]
Great list. Referring to the buses, you can get the best real time arrivals by texting ""actransit(space)bus stop #"" to 414-11. I keep a text file of bus stop numbers on my phone which makes it handy when you are taking multiple buses for trips. You can get the bus stop numbers from here.

https://www.actransit.org/actransit-realtime
On the flip side of things, rolling down 4.0 hill by the music building is a great way to boost your GPA!
Great stuff, agree with so many points here… especially with experimenting with life. Join clubs you’d never have thought to join before (e.g. tons of students join AFX which is this massive dance thing that happens in Sproul Hall), try out new boba places, take a Ballroom Dancing P.E., try out exercising on a regular basis in RSF, etc.

Don’t forget about the free printing from OCF. Make sure to look at OCF hours so you don’t miss it.

For frats tips, I’d say it’s most important to learn how to play beer die and the rules if you really wanna rush lol

And I’d also add to start using your Facebook more because that’s how you’re gonna learn about invite-only events, invite-only parties, and talk to your group members (on Messenger). For some reason Facebook (moreso than Snap, GroupMe, and Insta) is the main choice of communication in Berkeley.

And please don’t go too hard on the alc: if you throw up and black out in front of your roommates, have fun dealing with them the next day when you’re hungover…
Get kalbi from Steve's. Yummy and cheap.

Don't rely on being able to use the bathroom at Top Dog after a night of drinking.
What does #6 for parties mean? Why would you need your Cal ID at a frat party?
Thank you!!
Fuck how am i a senior already
For fruit and vegetables, Berkeley Bowl is the way to go.  Safeway is way more expensive.
Legend
Lol I'll be a senior and even I don't know some of these haha. The more you know ✨
As an incoming freshman, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!
Oh god the vitali lmao. Straight nasty
[Adding onto the whole transit thing,](https://pt.berkeley.edu/studenthandbook) because I'mma give you an award on that alone.
any advice for someone who moved into an apt building surrounded by frat houses without realizing it lol
Thanks for the transfer shout out!! LFG
Thanks for the tips. I would like to know where is the best setting to drop mdma.
Just going to save this.
Thank you so much!!
Good advice
Thanks
AH I think I watch your YouTube channel!
Transit app is very rich in information and has an aesthetically beautiful interface, but sometimes that makes navigating it (i.e. scrolling around) difficult. Instead, an alternative is the Transit Now app which is barebones: displays bus routes and estimated headway closest to your location in a list. May not be a like-for-like replacement considering it uses data (but not that much).

Edit: it's only available for Android
GBO week frat parties don’t need bids (invites) so the schools trying to prevent underaged/non Berkeley kids from going to them
Also even past the first week some parties will only let Cal students in. Typically this is handled just through bids, but sometimes the bouncer will want to actually see Cal IDs. The idea is that it keeps a party from just getting mobbed and that the party remains for college students.
Ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones. Good luck!
Lmao I’m doing that too I’ll lyk when I find out. Gl.
I mean house rolls r fun, I feel like frat parties would be a waste of the drug, sf clubs would be a vibe. Raves duh. Underground parties/clubs would be fun. House parties if you can find one would also be fun
:/ I don’t have one
Thnx but for privacy and security reasons, I never have my phone on the internet so I don't use apps. This is why I use and suggested the text version.
my building is sandwiched between two frats. i’m fucked

i was intending on using 53 as my math prereq for haas but i’m really stressed now aha. it’s on me for not being able to focus and work more for my exams, but is there a way i can possibly rectify this for my haas app next yr? ie take another math course to use as the prereq

sorry don’t mean to bring another stressed freshman post to the tl during break, but any advice will be of consolation !","You can take another math class, but this stain won’t be completely wiped off let’s say, a C in a 4 unit class can have sour impacts on your gpa for a while, especially since you’ve just started as a freshman and dont have so many units

Very stressed about my future,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y8icjr/very_stressed_about_my_future/,2022-10-19 16:52:00,"I’m a junior studying EEP (Environmental Econ and Policy). I plan on continuing my studies into postgraduates (in another field of study).

My profile so far is probably quite shit for being a master program applicant. My GPA is currently about 3.3 (and will likely go down further more as i will take more upper division courses), and I have a C and a D on transcript. I don’t have any research experience, and only have a few short-termed interns in startups. I also don’t think any of my professors have recognized me enough for me to ask rec letters from them. :((((

Im not sure if my should still consider pursing a master degree in the future or if I should just give up thoughts on it and enjoy my life. Anyone here have the same struggles? If there are any seniors currently going through the process (or current postgraduate students/alumni) out there reading this post, I would really appreciate if you guys could drop some advice on what to expect and what do do! :)","I know a number of masters graduates with mountains of debt and anxiety. If the degree is something you are interested in and it expands potential for future earnings, go for it. For me it would have to meet both of those criteria though.
Ok? You recognize your weaknesses and it's not too late to change them. Do better in your classes junior and senior year. Go to office hours every week so your professors recognize you and will write letters of rec. Apply to internships/campus research in the field you want to go into. You have plenty of time to prepare to be a good applicant, especially if you aren't going to go straight into a grad program after undergrad, which is often recommended, as they want to see work experience. Ace the GRE/GMAT/LSAT whatever grad test you need to take, and that will outweigh a poor gpa as well. If you have any mitigating factors, like the pandemic affecting your first two years of college, write a statement for that. 

You will be fine if you don't pursue a grad degree, but you are also more than capable of putting more effort in and doing better for the next two years if this is what you really want."

Part 2 of the exam was on MT1 and MT2 material and I bombed it. Just hoping to god I don’t get a C. Spring finals after a year online was just so rough I just can’t get myself to study I’m so burnt out and it doesn’t feel real. The stakes don’t feel as high and it doesn’t feel like I’m part of anything. Now to watch 20 lectures for Physics on Thursday... so if you are having a rough time you aren’t the only one. Only 4 more days till this nightmare is over.,"related to this SO hard for bio1b man. crammed all the organismal bio lecures and didnt even finish them... ate ass on the final bc of it :( u not alone hang in there. i feel so hard what u said.

Upper division as a Freshman,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cn3cu8/upper_division_as_a_freshman/,2019-08-07 02:01:28,"Hey,
So I’m an incoming freshman and plan to major in CS.
I’m taking CS61A and Math1A this fall. I am also taking Mcellbi 32 for my biology breadth.

I wanted to take an RnC A this sem but had the 2pm enrolment time so I didn’t get any, but am on a waitlist at position 4 for SASIAN R5A.

But I am currently enrolled in History 128AC as it covers both History breadth and the American Culture req. Will I be able to get through it considering it’s an upper div class and I’m a freshman 🥶

If I get in my RnC the swap will automatically drop History 128AC for me but I don’t think I’ll get in through waitlist.....","Upper and lower div doesn’t really mean a thing, aside from the fact that upper divs will more often have prerequisites and (typically, not always) be more work.  You’ll probably be fine if you stick with History 128AC unless you aren’t a fan of writing research papers cause despite not knowing anything about the class I can tell you that’ll probably be a significant chunk of it.  There won’t be enrollment issues or anything, except I know advisers are supposed to warn against taking upper divs if you have to clear your schedule with them.  But it’s just a cautionary warning, not a compulsory one.

I’m taking history 100ac and worried about the same thinf
My freshman year I took two history upper divs (124A/B) and they were much less time consuming than my other lower div classes. The number doesn’t mean much. It’s typically two essays, midterm, and final, with weekly readings that are meant for skimming.
FWIW, my kid took the Ethics in Data Science class last semester (also upper div), HIST C184D, which is a double dipper, Hist breadth plus it knocks out the HCE requirement for Data Science majors (he's a CS/DS double major).  That class might be more interesting from a history standpoint for techies, though there's a shitload of reading and writing in that class.
Like many posters said, the number doesn’t mean much. Often times you’ll find upper divs to be easier than the lower divs. 

Also, with history you should be fine; however, when enrolling in upper divs, make sure to check if there’s any prerequisite courses. Check out ESPM 50AC as well if you’re worried about the waitlist.
Oh okay! Yeah advisors do warn us just in case
Yep, was thinking the same honestly
Oh thanks for the insight!
I’ll check it out! Thanks
I’ll take it into consideration. Thank you so much!"

Who has taken Chem 3A with Robak? Did she lower grade bins?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q5psqi/who_has_taken_chem_3a_with_robak_did_she_lower/,2021-10-10 23:25:06,So I’m a little confused about grading for Chem 3A. Dr Robak is saying there is no curve for the class and in a piazza post she said she won’t lower the grade bins. If you see my last poll over half of people got below 70% on her exam. Is the average for this class just going to be a C-? What does she change?,"Oh you're that person on Discord aren't you... are you really still hung over on the exam? It is what it is, Robak has already explicitly stated multiple times that there will be no curve and that grade bins won't be shifted. You have an exam drop and there's MORE than enough time to work your ass off to do well in MT2, MT3, and the final.

&#x200B;

Do you really think that a poll on Reddit, much less Discord, is representative of the class? It's common sense that this is and will almost never be the case for people who aren't remotely in data science related fields. Robak herself confirmed that the grade distribution was in line with prior semesters as well.

&#x200B;

If you fucked up on the midterm, which it seems you did based on this amalgamation of a post, then take some god damn accountability to learn what you did wrong and improve. Meandering on Reddit, Discord, or otherwise and trying to convince yourself that 1) the majority of the class scored a C- or lower based on a non-representative poll and 2) the average will end up as a C- (see Berkeleytime) isn't and won't do anything bud.
if the average on an exam is unusually low she sometimes has a test corrections style assignment to earn some points back
but a 70% is not equal to a C- in her class, i cant remember exactly but i think 40% was a C- or something
She didn't change the bins when I took her in fall 2019, but she did offer test corrections for ~10 points
When did you take the class?
There are 500 total points in the class and her letter grades correspond to near-standard percentages. (Ex. 440 is bottom cutoff for A- and 380 is cutoff for B-) So technically a B- is 76% which doesn’t seem very generous.

Oh she must’ve changed it then, I took it 2 years ago"
Should I Attempt a Math Minor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/idgmih/should_i_attempt_a_math_minor/,2020-08-20 12:07:34,"Hi everyone,

##mostly background below##

I am an incoming freshman and have just finished the summer term. I am planning on pursuing a major in linguistics and a minor in mathematics, and since I’ve just aced the sole prerequisite of LING major—LING 100, I’m ready to declare the moment that the official grade comes out. 

I’ve been thinking about pursuing a minor in math mostly out of interest and the fact that it’s a good companion to linguistics. Back in the high school senior year, I aced a community college multivariable calculus as well as a proof-based integrated multi/linear algebra at Harvard Extension School. I have a 5 in Calc BC, and all of those together clears all lower division except for MATH 54.

I though I’d do well in MATH 54, but then I bombed everything related to differential equations and eigenvalues, received a D in final, and I landed on a C+ for MATH 54. 

##end of background##

Although this is my first semester and I could have come up with many excuses to “justify” a lower grade, I’m determined to redeem that failure and to reflect and learn a lesson from this. However, while I’m certain to declare linguistics major, I have to face the choice of actually pursuing a minor or not (I’m considering a math major mostly out of interest)

I enrolled in H110 for this fall back when I was very confident on 54. I think that if I improve my grade in H110/110 I can show that I’ve taken my remedial work as a redemption to a failure in lower level of linear algebra, but I know that I absolutely cannot afford to bomb another course (I was doing okay in 54 before the finals, which is why I didn’t switch to pass/fail). I’m forgoing very interesting linguistics courses this fall to secure math 110, and if I switch to P/NP or do horribly it at the end, it would really be a shame. 

That being said, I plan to pursue grad school and hopefully stay at Berkeley for linguistics. If I terminate my journey of math right here, I don’t want to appear like I’m hiding away from a subject after an initial setback and give up on it.

Meanwhile, even if I manage to pull out the rest of the math minor program with straight A, will a C+ in elementary course hurt the “validity” of this minor? For this summer at Berkeley, I’ve aced two upper division linguistics courses, and passed MATH 55 (as a P/NP) outside of that C+ in MATH 54. 

What would you do if you were in my case? Will you continue and declare a minor, or will you just pursue a single linguistics major with a future GPA that’s probably still solid? Assuming a promising performance in the linguistics program, would you make the C+ in MATH 54 as a non-core program not directly related to your major, or try to grind very hard to get a solid math minor (that has a C+ in the core lower division)? 

I’m a Chinese international student, and I’m studying remotely for this semester.

I’ll firmly say that my passion for math certainly isn’t done with a C+ in MATH 54. Back in my senior year in high school, I couldn’t drive, so I took Uber to community college for multivariable Calc twice per week in the late night session. I know that spirit will never die, and regardless of what happens, I’ll maintain some exposure to math probably throughout my life, be it formal or informal.","So generally I support the idea.  One piece of input I'll give is that H110 with Harrison is not really a linear algebra class.  It assumes you know linear algebra quite well and teaches you category theory and multilinear algebra (tensor structures and such).  On the other hand, Stankova's 110 is great and very fair, and I would say it's a better way to get back on track with Linear after having some tough times in 54.  One bad experience in a lower div math class should not make or break anything for you, those classes are weird and they're totally different from the proof-based upper divs.
Differential equations can go smd. I feel ya brothr
Sounds like a yes to ne
Dude I am trying to major in linguistics + math as well! I love linguistics to death, and I am taking Ling 130 and Ling 111 this semester apart from Math H110. It's kind of wild there another person out there trying to do the same thing I am!!! I would love to talk more about this over like a pm!!!

I am taking Math H110 this semester because the curve is godly (people say it's really much easier to get an A on it but the work and psets are longer and harder, but tests are pretty fair). Also looking at the syllabus yeah there's a bunch of stuff jammed onto there in H110 that regular 110 won't have, but Harrison (the prof) said that there are technically no prereqs to H110. So all in all, H110 would be more of a gamble based on your past, but on the bright side it has no or very little eigenvectors (which regular 110 does have a bit of) or diff eq. and Harrison said it can be taken by someone with no background, so you may very well succeed!

I have heard that Math 110 is the place to be if you want just linear algebra knowledge. I've heard good things and bad things about both professors, so if you want to play it safe 110 would also work. In the end, it's up to you since there are pros and cons both sides

All in all, I think you should take one or two more math courses (like Math 128A or like Math 113) before you throw in the towel just because of Linear Algebra which is but one part of all the math out there. Rn just focus on choosing the right H110/110 for you and decide later"

Or should I do Sethian and 7B in the first semester? What do y’all think?,"Take m53 before p7b.
Definitely take Math 53 before Physics 7B. I took Math 53 and Physics 7B together in first semester of freshman year, and some of the physics math computations were really hard and confusing because I hadn't learned 3d calculus concepts yet (math 53 only got to the math concept a while after we covered it in physics). You'll save yourself a lot of time and frustration by taking physics 7B in a semester after taking math 53.
Should I do with Sethian or with canic later?

What if you’ve already satisfied Math 53 with a CC class beforehand. Is it possible to take both 7A and 7B concurrently (in the same semester)?
doesn't matter.
Sethian was fine for explaining concepts, he just made the final quite hard for fa20, but I’m p sure he did curve it. It was nice to get it out of the way though, and it was a nice calculus refresher before I took 7b in the 2nd sem

good intership with really good essay and i say there is a shot.. u also get a chance to explain ur grades so if u have a solid reason that helps too
From what I've heard friends say, if you have a low grade like that, you need to make it up elsewhere in your application. For haas, that is with a stellar internship and work experience. If you have great summer jobs lined up and are active in school orgs during the year you can still get in.
a good essay heals all wounds
imagine having somebody who got a C+ in math 16b handling your finances lmao

(i'm just joking by the way, i know a few people who did extremely bad in math 16a/b and got into haas)
I would say be realistic. I worked closely with the admissions department and as a whole, Haas is definitely moving closer towards a holistic review with much more emphasis on experience and essays but a C+ most definitely will be a ding, especially in a math course. Enroll in the classes that are for your backup major because truthfully while there may be a few instances of people getting by with C's, they may have extreme family circumstances that caused that. 
I know a girl who got a similar grade in Math16B and still got in. I don’t know her too well but she definitely has an investment banker, work hard party harder personality. Hope that helps!
I know a guy who got into Haas with a not so great GPA. He might be the best communicator I’ve ever met though and pretty much talked his way in.
I wonder if there's any data on stats for haas admits? All of the ranges/tips I've heard sound like speculation. 
It's gonna be hard, my guy. At best, you're an outside shot. That essay better be 🔥 though lmao

What if there was a family circumstance that occurred but I forgot to mention it on my application?

You get admitted to EECS when you apply to Berkeley. So you could say it’s easier. 

Edit: the classes are abysmally hard, sure, but once you’re in you have to fail out. L&S CS doesn’t have that advantage. 
Nothing you can do at this point since they don't allow changes. You only have two options at this point: either you get lucky and are a part of the small group that gets an interview and you can explain it there or you appeal if you get rejected. It should be noted that I know of no one that has gotten in through an appeal

Take a look at the College Writing R4B's...it's a little daunting because you have to write a research paper for the class, but if you take a look at [berkeleytime.com](https://berkeleytime.com) and Rate My Professor, you can typically land a solid class.

I mean my experiences are personal, and the class you selected does indeed sound interesting! However, the two comlit classes I took covered generic literature topics while the grading was harsh (at least from a STEM major perspective lol). Half of the people I met in my comlit class selected comlit because they got a shitty registration time and all their other choices were filled up. I was one of those people.However, I will give them credit where its due and say that the comlit faculty is really caring and passionate about what they are teaching, it's just that they are really harsh graders. But honestly, your class sounds interesting and maybe comlit is changing for the better. Honestly, don't change your schedule based on a total stranger's word of mouth as myself, especially because my experiences are biased. Good luck and Go Bears!"

[Critique] CS70 is made artificially harder. Here's how it can improve:,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ura55a/critique_cs70_is_made_artificially_harder_heres/,2022-05-16 17:26:47,"# Introduction
### Motivations

I wrote this constructive critique to motivate CS70 and other similarly dense and not beginner friendly material courses to follow suit in the suggestions I give. CS70 staff likely know who I am and if you would like to have a more in-depth discussion, please feel free to reach out :)

### Establishing Credibility/Reputability

To preface: I have (and when I say this, I’m not exaggerating) studied on average ~10hrs every single day of this entire semester. From 1/18 till 5/12, I have spent approximately 900 hours on CS70 alone, which doesn’t include office hours or discussions or CSM sections. I go to 4 discussions per week (2 different TAs) and I always stay late to ask questions. Additionally, I attend 2 CSM sections per week, I go to OH every day, I have a tutor, post on Piazza and Discord anytime I’m confused, and I spend my entire day from start to finish in the library studying JUST 70. Think I’m overexaggerating or lying? My hours are tracked, 70 also has a log of all my OH tickets, and my discussion TAs, and OH staff can back this as well.

&nbsp;

**Why do I feel like I’m qualified to critique the course?** I have significant prior experience privately tutoring students before and have had substantial involvement in the sequencing, design, and structuring of 3 different courses as well as development of course material at my high school (internationally recognized for one of the courses). And as previously mentioned, I have followed and done everything as recommended by the course staff, Rao/Sahai, and others on how to study/”survive” in cs70.

---

#1) Overall

Let me be very clear, this course is not equitable. In fact, this is emblematic of a much larger issue: none of the lower-divs (mainly 61A & CS70) are. In 61A alone, prior experience is the single most significant predictor of success; according to Pamela, only 15% of NPE students get a B+ or higher. In CS70, this gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim; students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college whether it’s USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or multivariable/linear algebra at a local college have a MASSIVE advantage. It’s a compounding advantage because those with prior exposure need to spend less time to understand the material (the so-called “mathematical maturity”). More precisely, their per unit of time spent has a faster rate of change (their score) versus NPE students. Lower-income students also oftentimes have to work to support themselves while in school, so the only gap-closer (spending more time on the material) is now no longer an available option. I say this as a first-gen student coming from a low-income background where the highest level of math taught at my high school is Elementary Calculus. Not everyone had the ability to take rigorous math nor was put through it. Specifically, my school only offered Integrated Math I, II, III, then “AP” Calc. 

&nbsp;

The course is WAY TOO FAST-PACED yet expects students to be able to reproduce every proof from a note that we read the day before. The goal of the class commonly said by Rao, Sahai, and CS70 TAs is to “encourage learning” or to “just learn the material and you will do fine.” This fails to acknowledge that the barrier to entry is way higher compared to 61A or 61B; **CS70 artificially inflates the difficulty of the course by intentionally creating a scarcity of resources** (or not investing time into developing resources), which I would argue is contradictory to this commonly spouted goal of “encouraging learning."" “This is hard material” is not a sufficient excuse for poor presentation and teaching of material (both in the notes and in lecture). Furthermore, from my experience interacting with course staff in OH every single day and other mediums, it’s also clear that the hiring practices significantly prioritize grades over teaching capacity. I along with many others intentionally try to avoid certain course staff in OH because we consistently run into the same one-dimensional math comp explanations. Yes, the material is hard, but you do not have to make it any harder than it already is. 

---



#2) Lectures

My main point is this: the lecture should be intended as an introductory aid i.e a conceptual overview of all the main important pieces of the topic (ex: show FLT proof but not derangement, leave that for the note). This flows perfectly since notes should be used to deepen the understanding and discussion is used for application of the theory.

&nbsp;

An overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless (supported by student survey data as well) and it’s motivated by a variety of factors. I will mainly address the slides i.e the presentation of material in lecture in this section. 

&nbsp;

According to Professor Sen, lecture slides are said to never be changed or modified in any way no matter the professor (rules by the dept apparently?). I strongly disagree and so does the educational research. Lectures should include more visual aid and more colors instead of just black, blue, red. Colors help viewers stay focused instead of getting lost in a wall of all black text. Colors and graphic images help a ton with conceptual understanding and distinguishing what’s important and what to focus on. This could be something like putting a colored box around the theorem statement to make it easy to distinguish what the overarching statement is and then the proof in a different colored box can be formatted like a step by step tutorial (literally put step 1, step 2, and what we’re doing in each step) where every little detail is pointed out. This could be something as small as writing an arrow saying that this part of the expression is to account for the cookies, and this * 2 is for symmetry since bla bla. Most importantly, stop skipping on things you consider trivial- these are things that get students stuck from minutes to hours. Common instances of this are jumping 3 steps in a proof or implicitly making a simplification that YOU consider trivial. 

&nbsp;

Sometimes, slides legitimately just don’t cut it and that’s why you have the lecturer there. They should be there to guide you through their thought process and how they approach it instead of brainlessly clicking through slides. Literally write out your steps instead of rambling out loud what the steps are- literally write it out- write out where we are, then the next step, and then the next and explain while doing it. This provides a visual aid to focus on and the exact thing to associate with the explanation coming out of the lecturer’s mouth. Again, I can not stress this enough: visually walk the viewer through the proof instead of telling it to them and then having a bunch of slides spam clicked. The reason students come to lecture is to pick up what the slides alone cannot convey and it’s the rationale for each step, the thought process, the conceptual intuitive meaning. 

&nbsp;

Here are some exemplar models of good lecturing/slides: 

A)  [Stanford’s CS70 equivalent](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/index.html)

B) [MIT’s CS70 equivalent](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/)

C) [Alec Li CS170 notes](https://smartspot2.github.io/assets/pdf/CS170_Lecture_Notes.pdf)

---

#3) Notes

The notes are massive time sinks that are unnecessarily convoluted and overly complex for no reasons. The argument that this is how math is presented and that other courses later on will be way worse are bad cop-outs for putting in actual work into synthesizing and boiling down material into layman terms that people (undergrads) can actually understand. 

&nbsp;

The notes are literally pages and pages full of walls of black text. Add some freaking colors, box the theorem in blue, highlight the equation in red, or even something as simple as putting a visual of probability space A and B and their overlap and coloring it, or coloring the cycle of a graph. 

&nbsp;

Intentionally designing things by selectively excluding clear explanations or step-by-steps doesn’t help stimulate learning, it just confuses and angers students; for example, a visual step-by-step on how to build hypercubes and assign their bit strings instead of saying it in a one-liner in a gigantic wall of text. Why conceal information about how to deal with E[min(X, Y)] instead of explaining that you could convert it to P(X > t, Y > t)? Students don’t have unlimited time and it’s clear that our time isn’t respected; you can not reasonably expect a student to spend 30 hours on this course alone. 

&nbsp;

These are intentional choices made to artificially make the course more difficult and arduous than it needs to be. For students who don’t have time to spare this has a disproportionately worse effect (this group tends to be lower income folks, minority groups, less privileged). 

&nbsp;

The example of assigning bit strings on a hypercube is just one example (off the top of my head) of a concept that students routinely get confused on. If students ROUTINELY ask questions and have trouble with X topic or Y question every single semester, shouldn’t it warrant looking into? It clearly means that the explanation is not good enough. There’s a difference between trying to induce confusion to stimulate growth and a clear lack of a proper explanation.

#4) Exams / Walkthroughs / Recordings

To be blunt: make better solutions or make exam walkthrough videos. Potential suggestion is to have a TA make videos doing a conceptual overview of topics like Sahai did for the Sp2014 semester (can be viewed on YouTube). These short 10-15 mins videos made by Sahai and other course staff are phenomenal material that provide additional resources for students to access beyond just the notes and slides. 

&nbsp;

Exam solutions should be written like Alec Li’s Fall 2020 Final rewritten solutions. Every single step should be broken down (stop skipping steps, stop saying X is trivial, blabla) in laymen terms and how to conceptually think about it and the different ways you could approach it. 

&nbsp;

I’ve previously spoken with Tarang about past exam walkthroughs. CS70 used to do this in the past but stopped for some reason. His reasoning was that “we want to encourage learning,” but that is contradictory. 

&nbsp;

If your whole goal is to encourage learning, why offer a no-HW option? If anything, by that logic then all students should be required to do the HW not only for structural/disciplinary measures but to also develop a better conceptual understanding. Clearly, this isn’t the case and by offering a no-HW option the course actively supports the testing approach which goes directly against the whole “encourage learning” goal.

&nbsp;

### Other related suggestions:
61AB has a plethora of resources, so that even when you’re stuck you can find resources to help you get unblocked. Exam prep videos, exam prep sections, NPE sections, videos specifically about recursive runtime, or 61C’s catchup sections. In 70, you have lectures (which majority of people do not watch), notes, and in-person discussion (if you end up not being able to go, tough luck! If you forget the nitty gritty of what was covered, tough luck too!).

&nbsp;

The benefit of developing these materials starting now is that it will pay absolute dividends in the long-term. For example, students still watch the Enigma/Gitlet explanation videos from 61B which were made years ago. It’s not like mod arithmetic, for example, will suddenly change 20 years down the road.

&nbsp;

Here’s what you should do: build a database of resources, reuse it semester-to-semester → this reduces the workload of OH, TA’s, etc in the long-term and also saves on cost/time! That’s all to say that the second-order effects are huge. In fact, if the whole goal of the course, commonly said by Sahai and Rao, is to “just learn the material” then why restrict resources to force people to interact with course staff? Why create extra barriers to resources to enforce your methodology?   

### Suggestions:
* Discussion Walkthrough videos:
     * Data 100 releases discussion walkthroughs intentionally a week late to encourage people to go to live discussion
     * Ex: [Data 100 Fa19 Discussion 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CiUCgSr-Mg)
* Concept walkthrough videos i.e RSA, Mod Arithmetic
     * Ex: [61B Asymptotics Introduction](https://youtu.be/bBqfehNv7mQ)
     * Ex: [Sahai Mini-Lecture on Mod Arithmetic](https://youtu.be/l0DWLBX5d2A)
* NPE/Behind/LOST/Exam-prep Discussion sections
     * 61A, 61B, 61C, 189, 170, Data 100 all have some variant of these
* HW Walkthrough videos
     * Ex: [Sp14 CS70 Homework 1 Problem 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkm-YdTJjrk)
* HW Introductory videos:
     * Ex: [CS61A Fa21 HW03 Q: Num Eights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hihU9yqfndM&list=PLx38hZJ5RLZehTD4yb15G7zKmMEJDHNdn&index=3)

#5) Teaching Pedagogy / Hiring Practices
The hiring practices are based primarily on grades. While Richard has pointed out that CS70 no longer solely relies on an algorithm to assign points based on grades, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that most of course staff and especially readers are math comp kids. 

&nbsp;

The main reason for bringing this up is because those who come from rigorous math backgrounds or ones where they've likely competed in USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or taken multivar, lin alg, discrete, etc before even coming to Berkeley are gonna naturally be ones to do well in the course. Doing well in the course translates to better odds of getting hired. And funnily enough, out of the 48 cs70 course staff members who responded to the internal poll about comp math: 27 did comp math in HS, 9 did comp math but only in middle school, 12 never participated in math competitions. Now, I’m not a stats guy but that looks like an overwhelming majority to me. I want to be clear that it’s not problematic that they come from rigorous backgrounds, because I have received help from fantastic readers and TAs with a comp math background and they were great- but the flipside is that my poor experiences (as of many others) have mainly come from those with comp math backgrounds whereas I have had absolutely no issues from those without comp math background.

&nbsp;

It's very clear that this is true when a reader/TA gives an explanation that is one-dimensional; one that is likely derived from a math comp perspective. I have routinely had poor experiences with certain readers and TAs in OH, so much so that I along with many other students try our best to avoid them. Do you know how humiliating and demeaning it is to ask for help KNOWING that the person helping you will condescendingly mock you (most of the time implicit or implied, never direct) because you value the help more than getting degraded? In 61A and 61B, asking for help never felt like I was being ridiculed or looked down on. Yet, at 70, I feel it at every step. 

###Suggestions:
Introducing/encouraging course staff that comes from different backgrounds (non math comp, low rigor HS) would be a great addition. Another focus could be a better filtering mechanism. I like the approach that 61A and 61B take where you have to teach a concept to current course staff who role-play as students and ask student-like questions- teaching extends beyond just grades; someone with an B+ could be a WAY better teacher than someone who never struggled and got an A. If a course staff member feels that they communicate better over Piazza/Discord/Online, that should be a role/responsibility instead of shoveling everyone into a people-facing role which could have an adverse effect. As aforementioned in the previous section, within the content team one of the highly rated TAs responsible for those walkthroughs/recordings!

&nbsp;

It is SO important that the people joining course staff are non-judgemental, welcoming, and patient. The impact that these people have on students extends beyond just learning, it goes deep and emotional.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR: CS70 is made artificially harder by creating a scarcity of resources. The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school. Slides and notes have a lot of room to improve, and ""this is hard material"" isn't a sufficient excuse for poor presentation. CS70 should make walkthrough videos (discussion, hw, concept, etc) and not doing so goes against their own goal of ""encouraging learning"" by restricting resources. Furthermore, hiring practices are skewed and majority of course staff come from comp math or rigorous math backgrounds, which becomes problematic when students poor experiences are a result of one-dimensional math comp explanations.**","There’s still a ton of HS’s out there where the advanced curriculum is to start with Algebra in 9th grade and end with pre-Calc in 12th grade.  In face that’s what that lady at Stanford who got reamed by Prof Nelson is pushing for in schools as a standard.
Been saying this about the CS trifecta for declaration. Those with prior knowledge and experience with the material do significantly better than those who don’t. 

Great report!
I am a math PhD student, former Olympiad brat and I tutored CS70 for a bit this past semester.

This course is an abomination. It condenses years of math maturity and proof experience inside... 14 weeks. It is 4 classes in 1, neither of which is given enough time to grow into the minds of students. The easiest way to resolve the issues is to split the course into a 2 semester sequence that actually takes the time to teach you how to do proofs and why proofs matter in CS.

Also take out the probability module. I understand that it has bearing on other classes in CS, but... there are dedicated classes that teach you the material properly in the departments that teach these things for a living (stats, math).

That said, I also disagree with OP's take on the ""skewed hiring practices"" - mathematics is mostly about imitating the proofs and solutions of other people until you get it. The pool of people who ""get math"" to the level that it is required in the CS70 curriculum is already small enough - would you rather be imitating someone who ""gets it"" or who ""doesn't get it""? Or is the claim that there are other capable potential staff who get looked over?
Former CS70 GSI here.

These are all superficial problems. The real problem with CS70 is that it's a monstrosity spawned by intra-departmental politics.

They are trying to cram too much material because there are conflicting requirements from the EE and CS sides, but the EE v CS rivalry does not allow them to remove material so that what remains can be taught properly. They are also trying to make it “sexy” by teaching advanced topics like RSA, error-correcting codes, and linear regression.

Conventionally, math is taught by first providing a bit of motivation for a concept, then the concept is given a rigorous definition, then simple claims are proven, then its properties are explored, and finally some proof of a minor or major theorem is given. The proofs are often chosen to illustrate new mathematical techniques. 

In CS70, there's some motivation but concepts are not defined with rigor, there's no time, so simple properties are not explored, not shown and not proven, and we jump directly to some proofs that students are not equipped to understand.  Students are in a constant mathematical haze.

For example, to teach error correcting codes and secret sharing, you must first teach polynomials over finite fields. But CS70 does not even define what a field is, and finite fields are given a single lecture slide and a bit more than single page in the notes. 

I can give many other examples.

This is supposed to be the first course where students are exposed to proofs and mathematical rigor, but there's simply no time for that and the course fails in its most important mission.

There is no textbook. The reason is simple, no one else is crazy enough to cram all this material into a single course. The notes are no substitute. They are a mess.

The massive use of UGSI is a big problem. They are very smart and motivated, but they often don’t have the mathematical maturity or perspective to teach this kind of course, especially the second year ones.

And finally, if the department wants to require the student to work for the equivalent of an 8 unit course, it should be honest and list CS70 as an 8 unit course, not force students to give up other courses and any resemblance of social life. University regulations are there for a reason, y'all should file official complaints against the department.

On the positive side, at least it is not as bad as EE16B.
I see all the comments from CS and math legends. Imagine me, a cognitive science major (and creative writing minor), having to take this class as a major requirement without mathematical maturity or interest to be honest. 

I had to choose the no-homework option. There was absolutely no way I was actually capable to do the problems in the homework—I didn't even know how to start, or enough material to even attempt. 

Furthermore, as a social learner (as opposed to a textbook learner), I attended every lecture and discussion. However, lectures were disorganized and rushed, slides were not engaging and a mess as well. I learned more from 5 minutes from my discussion review lecture than 1.5 hours of Sen's or Rao's lectures—genuinely the biggest waste of my time. Especially Professor Sen, he was just inarticulate and mumbled in speech, disorganized in his thoughts and logic flow, and unfamiliar with his slides.

Lastly, reading through the post and comments, I liked the author's point of feeling looked down upon to ask questions because it was the case for me. As a straight-A student (except for my B+ in Math 54), I have never felt more dumb and lost. I was confused about the most basic concepts and after attempting to ask about my confusion a few times in a discussion class where it seemed like everyone else was understanding, I stopped trying to ask or answer questions by my UGSI (I felt like a fool having never answered a question asked by my UGSI right).  Another person in the comments were using the example of finite fields—I still don't know what they are—to say how fundamental concepts were not introduced that were built upon for the actual material in this class. I went to Professor Rao's office hours and it was the most condescending and unhelpful staff interaction I have had in Berkeley; I went to him with a list of conceptual, basic questions to ask but he didn't bother to listen to what I was confused about and started going on long tangents and told me I had to read the notes (and started reading the notes with me). I was actually speechless and felt helpless after the interaction. 

This semester, I went from Developmental Psychology to this class, which has been so irrelevant compared to all the other courses I have taken for the major (everyone I've talked to, including seniors who graduated, was confused why this was a cogsci req).  All this to say, I want to shout out all the people who took this class out of requirement but the subject matter was outside of their usual academic interest and expertise. I got around 1 standard deviation below the class mean for the final and most of it was by test-taking strategies more than the actual hours of review I put in. Oh, and I have cried four times because of this class this semester. This class was absolute torture. Cheers.
I think you bring up a lot of good points, but the teaching issues are harder to fix than you realize. I got an A+ in the class and was a reader for a semester of 70, but the honest truth is I still didn't understand like half the material in the class well enough to walk someone else through it in depth - most of how I solved problems was just intuitive leaps that I couldn't fully explain to another person. (part of this might be that I'm not the greatest teacher, but I still believe what you can teach is a strict subset of what you yourself understand.)

cs70 is a very, very difficult class conceptually speaking. there are a literal handful of people per semester who genuinely understand the material inside-out, to a point where they can teach it effectively. these are usually the people who've been doing competitive math for 10+ years and made USAMO. my experience has been that these people (as opposed to people that just dabbled in competitive math - making aime 2-3x will help you ace cs70 but isn't really impressive on the same level) are usually the best TAs. using grades isn't the best metric, but I understand why they do it for 70.

I think this class would heavily benefit from GSIs with a lot more experience, since almost no undergrads are actually qualified to teach this class. The ones that are are usually anomalous math prodigies.
Excellent write up! I’ve had similar feelings regarding classes with artificially inflated difficulty at this school, and you have great suggestions to help prevent this. Classes like CS 70 really soured my opinion of Berkeley.
Thank you for writing up about CS70. I've learned to hate this course for the whole semester that I took it especially given how it has pushed my body to its physical limits. I do like the content in the course but this course has a very unwelcoming environment.
Wow, amazing advice
Thank you very much for the post! I gave it an award because hearing this info is truly eye opening.

I am taking this class this coming Fall. Given that you've spent so much time on the course, are there any resources/tips/strategies you would recommend? Especially because you say attending lecture and reading notes is not enough.

Anything I should know about the course to succeed? Thank you!
i really and truly appreciate when course staff/tutors/folks involved with the course share things like this. i was a nontraditional/reentry student and CS was nonexistent in my high school and none of the community college courses i took articulated to berkeley, nor were they remotely as ~rigorous as the 61 series/70 expects. i felt awful trying to navigate these classes and my TAs definitely tried their best but there was always a vibe of 'yeah it's hard but there's nothing wrong with the course, keep trying and you'll get there' when in reality it was apparent that students with prior experience in competitive math or programming or who had been exposed to this kind of material before coming in had a huge advantage and when that seems to be an ever increasing proportion of the student body as optimizing your college app and experiences skew more getting towards programming experience as EECS/CS continues to be an incredibly selective major in an already selective school, the expectation becomes that you're already familiar with the course material and the tests become an exercise in pattern matching or gotchas since the content is already known to the majority of the class and the exam scores 'curving' to some average or bin shifting reflect that. 

idk im rambling but thank you OP for expressing this so well
I come from a rigorous math/cs background and also have friends with a similar background and I have to agree with the vast majority of what you said. Prior experience makes 70 along with a whole plethora of classes significantly easier. I also agree with the premise that there are many things the course staff could do significantly better about the presentation of the material. Certainly there are going to be discrepancies no matter how good the teaching is, but it should be the goal of the course staff to bring everyone up.

I do think however that it is a bit of a stretch to say that the course staff is making content artificially harder. I don't think neither the professors or the TAs have such malicious designs, and the course policy instead stems from a difference in teaching philosophy. I want to preface by saying that I feel their teaching philosophy is not necessarily wrong, but it does mean there are some significant consequences.

First, for context, I want to elaborate exactly why previous experience helps. While there is some effect of learning the same content before, that's not all of it. I have a comp math background, but I didn't know about a significant amount of course material (70%). The 30% I knew is a good chunk, but I think an even bigger factor is the level of mathematical maturity that comes from that previous experience. Making intuitive leap of faiths is a natural extension of that experience, and I think that is exactly what the professors are trying to nurture. I don't completely agree with the policy, but I think skipping a bit of the proof such that you have to fill in the gaps is one way to encourage such growth. It's a pretty common method, especially in math.

Ultimately, the material itself is only a part of what you are supposed to learn. There's definitely a lot of other things (dealing with notation, intuition, problem-solving persistence) that the course is trying to 'teach' on top of the actual course material that are arguably more important. At the very least, that's the impression I get from prof. Rao's mini-rants during lectures. However, it is empirically extremely difficult to develop these skills, even on a 1-on-1 basis. Imagine how hard it is to do at such a massive scale. For better or for worse, CS 70 as it is today is a compromise -- it accepts that some people may not follow (due to inadequate resources), but I believe it at least attempts to maximize the amount that does and get as much as the core skills out of the class.

I will end this part by mentioning that I know people who do not have extensive math backgrounds, but have gained significant mathematical maturity during their time at Berkeley. There's also a lot of privileged people who have tried to get into comp math and couldn't. This is to say that privilege certainly has a part in accruing opportunities before college, but at the same time it isn't perfectly clear cut. I believe most are well aware of this, but I think it's important to say nonetheless. While 70 might feel and legitimately be unfair, it's also the class where all those inequalities come to light out of necessity. I'll go further by saying that it has potential to be the class that closes the gap and level the playing field, so to speak. I certainly think closing that gap is part of why Berkeley exists.

Given these thoughts, I have a slightly different conclusion in diagnosing the problems and a set of solutions that will most likely never happen. The main problem is that 70, as a requirement to declare the major, takes the majority of the responsibility to impart mathematical maturity to CS students. One class is not enough, yet it's important that it is a prereq because many upper div classes will require sufficient mathematical maturity not to mention the course material in this class. In an ideal world, I would split 70 into two classes, 70A, 70B, and an accelerated honors class H70 like in a lot of math classes. First would be geared more towards mathematical understanding, the second towards the more specific parts of 70. Splitting 70 would give the needed time to digest the content and develop necessary skills. Anecdotally, one of the best ways to develop my own math skills was to spend a long time with one problem, but the pacing of 70 currently makes that hard to do, especially if you don't have experience before. An accelerated class would satisfy those who do have experience. With the budget as it is, I don't see this happening any time soon though.

On a side note, many TAs might lack significant teaching experience, and therefore lack certain qualities that you mentioned. I think it's important to realize that some TAs are going to be undergrads not much older and experienced than the students so mistakes (to some extent) are to be expected. Please, give specific feedback so that they have an opportunity to grow. Also, as you've said, a majority of TAs have comp math backgrounds, and a majority of bad experiences for you come from people with majority comp math backgrounds. Do account for base-rate fallacies when generalizing your experiences.
>The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school.  

Facts. It's actually insane how much of an advantage silicon valley kids (you know, the types that went to schools like Lynbrook, Monta Vista, Mission SJ, etc. etc.) have when it comes to a course like CS70. Most of these kids have had significant exposure to multivariable calc, LA, and other advanced math that while not directly applicable to CS70, has certainly had a profound impact on their mathematical maturity which is huge in a class graded on a relative curve like CS70. And that's not even including the easier access and greater opportunity these kids have when it comes to pursuing competition math (AMC, AIME, etc. etc.). Many of low income friends in CS/EECS have stated that they were lucky to even have AP Calc AB (Calc 1) offered in high school. 

I hope your post gets the necessary traction and spotlight deserves. CS70 is by far the most unequitable CS class at Berkeley, which is a real shame. Considering that courses like 61A have made large strides to level the playing field (precursor classes like CS10, etc etc.) , I have optimism that the situation regarding 70 can and will be improved.  

Excellent write-up, OP.
i like how they give examples of good notes at other universities and then alec’s notes are just there too
100% agree. Heard the ""hard material"" excuse while taking the course all the time and just kind of accepted it but you are totally right...there are barely any resources. I came from a school that did not have any math competitions, in fact I had no idea they existed and had the hardest time in 70.
I don’t care if you don’t end up passing or getting a good grade in CS70, this is such a strong data backed argument with incredibly specific suggestions to improve that I will give you a referral to Google if you DM me when you’re on the job hunt. Dead serious. This is way better than most product proposals or eng docs I’ve seen at Google
\>students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college

I don't understand this point. 61A and 70 were never meant to be entry level classes and the professors really try to get this point across. People shouldn't be attempting 70 without at least Math 1A, 1B, and 53 if not more unless they're confident they know what they're doing. Prerequisites aren't enforced because some people have other backgrounds. Many students come to Berkeley with absolutely no experience, take CS 10/Data 8, Math 1A/1B/53 and do well in both 61A in 70.
I don’t know how to do the quote shit but this may be ugly, but a few takeaways 
“In CS70, the gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim”
Source?? In fact I would imagine it’s significantly smaller if we’re considering everything, because for a substantial amount of students CS61A is their first time ever coding, whereas CS70 is certainly not their first exposure to math. Additionally, many recommend taking courses such as the EECS16 series and Math 53 in order to prepare for CS70. This preparation simply doesn’t exist for the 61 series as the only courses available are CS 10 and Data C8, which simply do not come near the rigor of the CS61 series.
“An overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless” 
And an overwhelming majority of students struggle in CS70. As someone who went to essentially every lecture, I can assure you a large portion of students did not go at all, however the people that I know that did go (granted this is anecdotal), ended up doing well in the course. I would love to see data on this, and of course this is just speculation, but I guarantee there’s a positive correlation between lecture attendance and grades. 

“I have spent approximately 900 hours”

I’m sorry but this is just absurd. There just exists diminishing returns in studying and it simply does not make sense to be spending this much time. Not all studying is created equally, and I highly encourage you to reach out to peers that did well and see what their strategy is and adapt your study habits.
 
This one is two quotes 
“For students who don’t have time to spare” 
“Why offer a no-homework option”
You critique CS70 through Tarang with past exams not including enough walkthroughs on the solutions. First off I think I agree with this philosophy of not just handing out the answers to students, and the person that convinced me was Professor Adikhari who designed Prob 140, and is an incredible professor. When you have difficult topics like Discrete Math and Probability Theory, all the learning comes through struggling and developing your own problem solving techniques. Seeing the answer just simply restricts your ability to learn. And I think the no-hw option exists purely for the reason of being accommodating. 

“61AB has a plethora of resources”

I have to hard disagree with this. In office hours for CS61B it was extremely common for people to wait for 3 hours absolutely stuck on a bug, only to get 3 minutes with a TA that gave them the completely wrong advice. That simply doesn’t exist in CS70 where there isn’t the same existence of getting stuck on a bug, and there is always quick response times in office hours (legit the few times I went I was the only one haha).

Overall, I think CS70 is difficult because 1) people do not take the proper prep courses to gain that “mathematical maturity” (cringe term but true) and 2) because you just simply can’t half ass it like CS61 series where you can just spend a couple days grinding practice exams (61A) or projects (61B/C). Attendance is absolutely abysmal in CS70 and it’s just not a course you can be not present for and do well.
This deserves a thoughtful response from the course staff. Thanks so much for posting this. Illustrates why we need to have a direct to major process that uses holistic review rather than a 3.3 grade-driven process that lacks transparency, creates artificial scarcity, and favors specific backgrounds.
Facts it doesn’t help that it’s curved either
Going through this post reminds me bad memories of similar experiences in 61A and 70. Seeing others who already knew the content breeze through the course was so discouraging. Between working part time and studying for these courses, I basically everything I could to end up with straight B+s. Things are not hard but the pace is gruesome and the instruction is very poor.
LMFAOOOOOOOOO YOU SPENT 900 HOURS ON THIS CLASS????? thats probably triple the amount of time I spent for my entire 4 years at berkeley on classes combined
How does one prepare for cs70 if they don’t have competitive math experience?
My dad is Mit graduate who specializes in mathematics and even he said the notes are too difficult to understand and that the notes are terrible as this class is suppose to be introduction.
The lecture slides thing is plain false. The lecture slides are updated and passed through by the professors before being posted.
I tutor CS in my free time, and the amount of kids I get learning CS and mathematical concepts in sophomore/freshman year of HIGH SCHOOL and even BEFORE is astounding. These students have very wealthy and intelligent parents that push their kids education since they’re really little. That’s why these kids are over represented as students in the CS/EECS population at Berkeley, Stanford etc is. It’s really unfair since it makes the population studying CS homogeneous while reducing discoverability for students who are talented but didn’t have the same level of exposure to math and CS as kids.
I'm taking 70 this summer, any advice on how to prepare beforehand?
I have not taken CS70 so I cannot speak to most of this but I will say that simply hiring to course staff those who earned the best grades is definitely a practice in other courses (across other departments), and is a problem in those cases as well. The argument is that someone needs to know the material extremely well to be a TA—this is true, but actually being able to teach the material is an even more important skill that often gets overlooked.
Can’t wait for OPs critique on 16B next 😂😂
Absolutely fantastic write up and I sincerely hope the cs department reads this thoroughly and takes it to heart. You didn’t just make arbitrary suggestions, but gave examples of what they look like when implemented properly.
(Disclaimer/background: I did math comp in middle school and up to Calc 1 in HS)

As much as I agree with the vast majority of this, I would argue that having the previous math exposure is frequently detrimental to you as the rigor of these classes is often a lot less than what you would learn in Math 1/2 at Berkeley. I admit that I had privilege in that I did not have to work a job while at Berkeley, but I did extracurriculars/clubs amounting to ~20 hours a week and was able to keep up with the coursework well enough with lecture/HW party/sections and little outside studying other than the week prior to an exam. That being said, the course material (especially the notes) really needs an overhaul, and I can absolutely relate to feeling disparaged by some of the course staff when asking questions. Frankly a lot of my understanding for this course (and other courses, especially Data 100) were aided the most by my interactions with other students on piazza, both me trying to help others and vice versa.
I took CS70 this semester and I agree with everything here. I assume you know this, but apparently the reason for a no-HW option is a lack of resources for hiring tutors (therefore not enough graders). 

I think this might reflect on at least part of the reason why CS70 is so unnecessarily hard: not enough CS funding for the upper divs means they *want* to weed people out, which leads to extreme inequity because it's harder to weed out people with prior experience. They might not even want to make it more equitable because of this. 

Let me know if you have more info on this. You clearly know more than me and I would love to hear what you think.
This is fantastic.
Wow who would've thought that people who are better at math would get better math grades. Very cool!
Facts! Why doesn't the school just let us take easy classes and get rid of classes I don't like personally? It's not fair!!!
They'd have more leeway with difficulty if CS was direct admit honestly.
disagree, 70 is easier then 61a and 61b.
No you’re wrong
Berkeley admits too many people
One minor thing I disagree with:

>The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school.

""this course is racist because some races don't have knowledge going into the course that they need for the course""
why is it even a requirement to begin with. blows my mind, along with 16b
Is this course worth taking for a minor
This is an extreme mischaracterization of what the CA math framework proposed. In the section people cited as supposedly claiming this there was even an explicit goal of everyone being able to take calculus by the end of high school. The Stanford person who worked on the framework was obviously wrong and imo racist in her personal communication, but the campaign against the framework was largely STEM academics with no knowledge of teaching best practices who were against anti-racism reform (it was and is broadly supported by math education experts!)
At least we had Calc BC for the tryhards. It was combo class with AB tho so they barely got to series. I wanted to do nursing and so did ap stats rather than calc, so big regret esp considering i'm doing cs major lol.
Agreed but cs70 is on a whole other level. I had an advance math backgroud. One of those kids who declared math their first semeseter. I noticed how poorly supported cs70 was but said nothing to anyone because it's the reason I scored so high in that class, by having background and knowing alternative actually helpfull online resources.

Got ~0.7 sd in 61ab but was able to score 1.2-1.5 sd on cs70 because how poorly normal students were taught in that class it actually gave people like me an advantage.

This is a prime example where you can't have good and cheap at the same time. They should hire 20hr full GSI from the math dept. to teach this class because not every 8hr kid with an A+ have years of teaching experience or experience with grad level proofs to do this job.
And if you think CS70 is bad, you should take a look at EE16A/B.

The entire curriculum of a four year EE degree, neatly packaged in two 4 unit courses.
A lot of the actual Olympiad kids (not AMC/AIME people) are really, really good at explaining their thought processes because of writing tons of proofs. The problem is in CS70, a lot of the readers are not at this level, and so they are not very good at explaining things as they are still learning how to teach.
hey Shakespeare I appreciate you sharing! Could you be explicit which classes have substantial material in cs70? i think it's 

1) some very early abstract algebra/number theory material/general 'discrete math&proofs', arguably two different classes

2) probability

3) some linear algebra?
""Olympiad brat"" I wish I could have that title lmao
> intra-departmental politics.

Can you elaborate on this? I thought a discrete math and probability course is pretty universal at any school that has a CS program?
Preach
The struggle was real
> how I solved problems was just intuitive leaps that I couldn't fully explain to another person

Not a CS major but it sounds like you're either psychic or just have an IQ over 120 lol. You're very lucky. I'm an MCB major, but my roommate took this class and this class genuinely terrifies me following the stuff about Sahai and looking over my roommates notes.
It definitely depends on the student, but I found that forgoing attending lecture, and instead reading the notes thoroughly before discussion was really helpful. In general, a lot of learning happens in discussion - applying the theoretical concepts you learn in notes/lecture to challenging problems), so its important to have a solid understanding of the concepts before going into discussion. Also, discussion content is fairly similar to exam content so it helps you in ways that might be instrumentally useful to performing well on the exam.
once you have a decent understanding of the content, I would honestly just recommend grinding past exams. Go through at least 6 practice exams and I guarantee you'll be able to get through half the exam from pattern recognition alone.
I would forgo the lectures as it is practically the note but u don't get to go at your own pace. Spend lots of time on the notes before starting the assignments. Don't just read a theorem and it's proof. Prior to reading the proofs spend time applying it to an examples you think of and try finding a case that breaks the theorem (If you actually find a case you probably need to reread theorem for understanding). Doing it this way should help u understand the proofs easier and better.
> precursor classes like CS10

Fun fact, that use to exist for CS70: https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4510, it was incredibly popular, with rave reviews, and as far as anyone could tell really helped a lot of students in CS70

but ~~Sahai~~ theory professors killed it because ""sInGlE sOuRcE oF TruTH""

Some faculty are actively preventing efforts to bridge that gap.
your point about the difficult high schools is correct, but not for the reason you think. fact is not all algebra 2 / precalc / ap calc classes are created equal. the double honors math pathway (algebra 2 in 9th, precalc 10th, ap calc 11th) at many of these high schools, including mine, was **very** rigorous. like, most of these classes were harder to get As in than cs70, even if they were conceptually easier. tests would be hard and require outside-the-box thinking in ways that most high school math classes do not.

even if someone never touched competitive math or a course beyond ap calc in their life, if they could get As in the hard math classes at my high school they'd easily be prepared for cs70.
they would fit right in at Google... all talk and no work being done
Here's the thing, plenty of people took Math 1A and Math 1B before coming into 70 and they still struggle. Rarely have I seen people that have already taken those courses do well in 70 just because of those 2 courses alone. It's usually because they did competitive math in the past or they come from a privileged background where they had access to many resources that helps them be prepared for 70.
I don't know how anyone could get a full understanding of the material from lecture without being able to rewind and rewatch.
[deleted]
Some professors don't even have lecture slides. When I took 70, both professors went the handwritten route.
There was a lecture slide on villagers committing suicide this semester. I think for the most part, unless it’s something controversial like that or stable marriage being changed to stable matching, what the OP said about the slides never being changed is true (ask the professors yourself).
facts, i also tutor math and cs, and students whose parents can’t pay $60+ per hour for math / cs tutoring are miles behind those whose parents can
Get exposed to the content beforehand. Start off watching the YouTube lectures from 2015 (Vazirani) and then read the notes. You don't have to understand everything or even half. Start thinking in the way of 70, and you'll be more prepared than just memorizing content.
How dare you
What they’re saying is that minorities are statistically *less* likely to have prior access to competitive math resources and experiences. So, the minority students are at a disadvantage *in comparison* to the non-minority group of students. They’re not saying “some races” don’t have the knowledge, or that “minorities are dumb” as you went on to say later. They’re just saying it’s *less* likely that minorities will have the necessary experience needed due to socioeconomic constraints that disproportionately affect them. Nothing to do with how intelligent students are.
The entire lower-div gauntlet is basically an IQ test anyhow. Wouldn't  really be an issue if Berkeley lowered admit rate and stopped the L&S loophole, so people knew upfront what they were getting.
The material is cs70 is far more relevant to CS than 16b. You absolutely need that mathematical maturity to take 170. 

CS really isn’t just programming. I think and I think most people would agree that programming is by far the easiest part of CS, with math being the hardest part.

There’s a reason a CS degree at a university takes 4 years vs a boot camp which can be a few weeks.

*This isn’t to say that 61AB are just programming but that obviously plays a big part in those courses, and is a big part of the challenge of those courses (ie 61B projects).
So are you saying that this site https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home is BS?  The vast majority of high schools that are in California (almost assuredly not attended by freshmen STEM students at Berkeley) and throughout the country operate with the schedule that I mentioned - Algebra in 9th grade thru pre-Calc in 12th grade.  And that’s the “advanced” curriculum.  Many students barely get to Algebra by the time they finish HS.
i lol’d at your flair lmao thanks for the laugh
Which alternative resources did you find helpful?
what helpful online resources would you recommend for 70? thank you!
How come? Genuinely interested in your take.
Agreed. It is really not easy to teach these kinds of math concepts, and to be frank a large number of uGSIs just don't have enough experience to be effective teachers. In contrast to the CS department, the quality of GSI instruction in the math department (I took 55 and several math upperdivs) was phenomenal and it felt like I was learning from a wealth of knowledge when talking to math grad students.

I understand the need for uGSIs - it's a resources problem. But for such a fundamental class, I think the standards should be higher.
Lmao grad students often don’t care about teaching as it’s just a job to them. Many times I’ve experienced where they aren’t even familiar with what is assigned and have to read the question making you wait even longer — anecdotal evidence from me in math classes but true
Why hire from the math department? If it’s a question of there not being enough CS people (some have indicated this isn’t the case and it’s just they don’t want to pay for a grad student?) I don’t think math is any better. They offer up ugsi spots for math majors decently often because of not having enough interested grad students (and not bc they’re not willing to pay), presumably bc a lot of the math dept is funded by nsf grfp
[deleted]
Agreed, I see this in a lot of mathy eecs classes (when I took eecs16b, I went to homework OH and an ASE gave me wrong advice on how to approach a linearization question — that involves partial derivatives — and from what they said, I could tell they hadn’t taken math 53 or any higher classes). You have no way of reviewing ASE/readers so if they are going around giving false info in OH then there’s not much you can do.

I think a stronger emphasis on teaching experience and not just hiring readers who got an A+ would help a lot. If you have a **structured** pipeline of AI → CSM/reader → TA then you can actually review their teaching experience and hire course staff that will help students learn the best. I think cs70 has started to do that and as they purge out the bad it will lead to a better course experience for everyone!
1) Number Theory

2) Graph Theory/combinatorics

3) Probability

4) Math 55
Discrete math and probability are universal for CS, not necessarily as a single course. Where I went to school there was a separate discrete math course (sets, prooof + combinatorics), and a separate probability course, but every school has their own way of doing that.

What the intra-departmental politics dictate the specific content. For example, as far as I know, the EE professors insist on continuous distributions. The result is at most two lectures, two tutorials and one homework. Some semesters it's even less. It is simply not enough.

The result of the politics is that there's simply too much stuff, and you can't cut it down. You can't even blame the professor teaching the course because they're doing their best under the constraints they are given.
There isn't enough time to ""solve"" each multiple choice question on exams, the best way to do well is to get good at ""intuitive leaps"" (aka guessing).
If you’d taken CS70, you’d realize that the intuitive leaps are actually a substantial part of the class. That’s part of the “mathematical maturity” that is mentioned, and it’s very hard to explain why you did the things you do after the fact in some cases. It often boils down to “I felt that this approach was best” and then has to be justified after the fact when talking to students.
120 IQ is barely considered smart, just fyi
[deleted]
I don’t understand how limiting resources like these does to help anyone. ~~In the most polite way,~~ fuck anyone who actively tries to discourage others from learning and attempting to get a better understanding of topics so that they can succeed academically. If people are seeking resources such as these, it’s most likely because they’ve never had the opportunity to get a high quality education prior to Berkeley. In fact, for some students Berkeley might be the first institution which gives them access to great resources such as these.
>but Sahai theory professors killed it because ""sInGlE sOuRcE oF TruTH""

Did you hear from Suraj/other decal teachers directly, or is this just something you heard? I find it a little hard to believe because CSM is still around, making content and teaching hundreds of students.
Right? At my bay area school our pre calc class included things like probability, induction proofs, etc. we started proofs in 9th grade with geometry which definitely helped to grow  mathematical maturity
LOL touché fair point
The weird obsession with color coding the notes. The only data I see is the internal poll. Staff obviously cared enough to try to figure out if this was the case, and it’s not easy to rectify. What are they going to do, ask if you’ve done math competitions in the past and filter you out based on that? Doesn’t seem very likely. But I do think the hiring process could be better. A simple google form asking for some essays does not seem enough, especially since you’re boiled down to writing skills at that point.
Yeah 1A and 1B are nowhere near enough. I took 70 with no comp math background at all and did very well just because of having taken other math courses for the physics major. You can build a strong math background right here at Berkeley it just takes a couple semesters. Most people are taking 70 way too early for their own good.
or maybe some people are just naturally smarter
completely agree. I did terrible in cs 70, but I can thank vazirani’s lectures for helping me not do even worse! his lectures definitely explain the concepts much better than rao or then notes
That’s just because he reused old slides without looking over them very carefully or consideration of triggers. This is not an indicator you’re forced to use the same slides as in the past. Otherwise you’d be hearing about this suicidal villagers every semester and complaints.
im getting downvoted so let me explain.

for 61a, the tests are harder than the homework. I could easily do the homework and labs but when it came to tests, the harder questions + time pressure made it extremely challenging. In 70, if you can do the homework, the test questions are comparably easy so there's no nasty surprises on exam day. furthermore, Scheme, environment diagrams, trees and tree recursion are killer topics, I don't think cs70 has any topics that hard. 

&#x200B;

for 61b, imma just say engima and gitlet. cs70 doesn't have anything close.
They're saying minorities are less likely to have access to resources. That's what you said.

Every course has prerequisites. Knowledge builds on other knowledge. That's how academia works. It's not exclusionary, that's just how it is.

Do you think that because some people don't have access to prerequisites we should make the class not based off of those prerequisites, or we should teach people the prerequisites?
I'm in no position to agree or disagree with you, but I'll just simply say that randomly blaming things on ""racism"" because ""minorities are dumb"" is really stupid (replying to the post, not your comment). Your comment is very reasonable.
Yes this website is a mischaracterization of the framework. The main groups that gathered signatures for these open letters were splinter groups from the AMS and other mainstream organizations that formed several years ago to oppose diversity/equity measures (Aaronson in particular is in leadership of several of these groups). There are obviously a huge number of people who have signed them --- again, overwhelmingly people who are not math education experts --- but I would suspect a large portion have not read the framework and have instead been convinced by a similar characterization. The original framework explicitly stated a goal of making it possible for everyone to take calculus by the end of high school (specifically, in Chapter 9) and subsequent versions after this campaign have been updated to make that even clearer.

When prominent mathematicians send out emails saying it's going to make everyone able to take less math, it's ridiculously easy to garner signatures. I see maybe two or three signatories here that \*might\* be considered math education researchers
No they’re saying that eecs16b *tried* to jam that stuff into the class, but obviously it doesn’t work and ends with miserable, confused students
I'm confused--Math 55 covers all three of the above as well, arguably in more depth than 70. How is it the fourth class contained in CS70?

My experience is that CS70 is just Math 55 with slightly less emphasis on set theory and formal rigor, and more emphasis on algorithms and applications.
Lol a lot of people are taking the 120 thing too seriously. I mean more on that scale then. 

To give you a satisfactory answer, when I say “psychic” I’m referring to the type of person that takes half the time to understand the material in compared to a normal student in this class. It’s probably what contributed to their grade.
Shouldn’t the average Berkeley student have the ability to read the room? and this thread is extremely noob-friendly, you’re the outlier by lack of tact.
Seems like the problem is that they need to hire *someone* to do the job anyway, and there's no 30 undergrads with years to teaching experience to hire.
Definitely agree. But with the new enrollment policies and also considering the fact people like transfers have to take courses like 70 ASAP. I don't see it getting any better.
No, I think OP is trying to say that a course of this design, rather than attempting to mitigate those differences in some way, exacerbates them unnecessarily. Academia doesn’t need to be excessively exclusionary. The same material could be taught in more accessible ways.
I don't know if there's been a public response to these letters by anyone that I can point you to, but the people I've talked with in Berkeley's education department have suggested just reading the framework. I will also add that beyond just the aforementioned messages from Boaler, a lot of her actual work has been criticized by a decent number of math education people as being an outdated because of its attempt at ""colorblindness"" and individualism. Her inclusion in the framework writing was to have a broad range of ""perspectives"" (and I might add, it is not surprising to me that she is the one who turned to problematic rhetoric)
I can agree that if something can be more inclusive it should be

But I think a course having prerequisites is fine

And I don't think it has anything to do with race"
Will I get rescinded?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/btuhh0/will_i_get_rescinded/,2019-05-27 19:20:36,"Sorry if this kind of post isn’t allowed or looked down upon but I really don’t know what else to do at this point. So I’m currently a senior in high school and got off the waitlist 2 weeks ago. I’ve never been so happy but I was wondering how strict the admissions policy is. You see, I never expected to get off the waitlist to Berkeley as it was my reach school, so when I got waitlisted at every school I applied too (literally every UC, USC, NYU, BU, etc)I thought my life was over because I knew that getting off the waitlist was a one in a million chance. I completely gave up on everything and going through another surgery (nothing life threatening but was just fucking awful) made it even worse. I had all D’s but was able to raise them all to 1 A(student service), 2 B’a (AP Physics, AP Literature) and 1 C (AP Calc). That makes my UW GPA 2.75 for this semester and the admission policy requires a 3.0 UW. Would this cause my admission to be automatically rescinded? I asked my school counselor and he told me he’s never had a student rescinded for a C and that I should be fine but I’m still not too sure. I already called admissions but they guy just kept telling me too fill out the form on calnet. Any input or help would be really appreciated. Thanks.","So I filled out the Undergraduate Admissions Update Form on the MAP@Berkeley website last year because I didn't meet one of the conditions of admission (same as you) and on the form there's a place where you can explain your situaton!
I think you're good, 1 A, 2 B's, 1 C is a 3.0 UW
Email your admissions officer they usually will work with you and things should be fine as long as you email them!! Their email is on your conditions of admission
Ok so then just put on the academic update form and include the reasons why
Yeah that seems to be the most common suggestion. Just curious what was the process like and how long did it take?
The A in student service doesn’t count sadly.
Hi, I just checked my conditions of admissions but it just says that my admissions officer will be assigned in early June.
Alright will do, thanks.
I just submitted my form online with the associated documents, and I found out the same day! They email you when they have an update. It might take as long as a week or two. Don't worry too much though, I think you'll be okay! I know I was super worried when I was going through this, but it turned out okay 😊
You should probably tell them. I think they would work with you because you had a reason for not meeting the GPA requirement
This is late but I think it does count bc i read somewhere on another thread that an admission officer said that as long as you have above 3.0 UW on your high school transcript, even including even yoga or pe or electives, then youre fine
I’ll definitely be submitting the form, thanks so much for all your help and reassurance.
that’s what I was planning on doing but not sure as to who I should contact?
For sure, thanks. I actually sent in an update form and explained my situation to them and they said my admission offer would be retained. Thanks though
No problem, good luck!!
You must contact the Admissions Office using
the Undergraduate Admission Update form, if you believe you will not be able to meet your Conditions of
Admission. The Undergraduate Admissions Update form is available to students on the MAP@Berkeley
portal page. 

You will most likely be accepted regardless due to the circumstances so don't worry too much.
there's an update form on the portal that you got accepted on. If you're definitely not gonna make the gpa you should probably update them, but you gotta be careful with how you do it
[deleted]
For sure, thanks for the reassurance and reply.
For sure, will definitely look into that. Thanks so much for the replies I really appreciate it. Any tips on how I should approach it. I heard that it’s sometimes a better idea to just see if admissions will let it slide but I don’t really want to risk that."

I miss my college advisor’s last office hour and I can’t contact the office of register since I couldn’t find their email... What should I do?

The people at Cal are the one actually doing all the credit transfer and stuff. Community college only sends out transcripts and degrees.
You should be able to get a transcript sent from that college to Berkeley through an automated online system, not having to deal with any actual people. If Berkeley gets your cc transcript they will automatically give you credit for any transferrable courses.

Be honest; What should I do to get into Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c04c6v/be_honest_what_should_i_do_to_get_into_berkeley/,2024-04-09 14:50:03,"Hey chat! I'm currently a junior (second semester) in highschool with substantial aspirations to go to UC Berkeley. I know it's not end all be all as I plan on probably settling for in-state if I end up not getting in, however dreaming big doesn't hurt. I understand that distinctive essays, PIQs, ECs, and an overall exceptional academic performance is pretty much the basis requirement but I honestly just feel a little insecure comparing myself.

My very personal reasoning to my drive to this school is to literally leave my hometown (I know this isn't valid enough, bear with me I'm desparate), to gain new experiences, and (being transparent) to earn the prestige. My overall reasoning would be the fact that UC Berkeley can offer a more challenged but creative course that'd overall contribute to my innovation skills and it'd introduce me to a larger, more in-tune with my life ambitions, social setting. From UC Berkeley, I hope to take away skills in strategic business and apply that to marginalized communities that may not receive the benefits of a dependable/prolific launchpad. Although these skills could be picked up from other schools, UC Berkeley has proved to me to be most alligned with myself and somewhat attainable.

I think sharing this, you can probably guess I'm aiming for Haas School of Business with a major in something business (administration, entrepreneurship, innovation, idk yet). Wanted to ask what you guys think I should do/involve myself in while I still have like 1.5 years left of high school? Is there anything I should just drop? And just answer literally **any** **advice** on how to hack the system tbh !! ALSO PLEASE PUT **SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES** !!

Weighted GPA: 4.234

Unweighted GPA: 3.754

Completed Credit Hrs: 39.0

Class rank: top 150 out of like 800

SAT: 1310 (I know UC Berkeley doesn't consider anymore)

ACT: n/a

Classes chosen for next year are: AP CS, VU Finite Math, VU Eng Comp/Lit, Accounting Fundementals, AP Stat, Marketing Fundementals, Strategic Marketing

Relevant past classes: AP Lang, VU Amer Hist, all honors classes + up to Spanish III credit, PLTW Business Management, PLTW Biomedical Science + PLTW Human Body Systems (at some point I was very much a science person and it's not that I don't like it, I'm just passionate about other things but I don't mind doing science since I do well \~ earned Science Student of the Month!)

Extracurriculars: Board for a club with the purpose of global service and philanthropy (helped in starting it freshmen year), NHS, NSHSS, S.T.E.M. tutoring, regular tutoring, D.E.C.A., Pre-Medical Club, Mentor to incoming freshmen, an adequate amount of volunteer work for local non-profits and my church

\- Siren","Got to a community college for 2 years, then transfer to a 4 year
Top 150/800 as an OOS second semester junior seems rough ngl, especially with nothing super spectacular on the college app. Not saying not to be hopeful, but it isn’t very likely.

Also, NSHSS is a scam.
isn’t national honor society a scam lmao
An OOS student with a 3.75 gpa? Not much you can do except pray and apply to UCR as well
gonna be honest with you, being oos and asian will be big, big hurdles.  there's really not much else you can do from an academic standpoint.  your stats are already pretty impressive, and you don't have to worry about the SAT score since Berkeley won't consider it.  the only thing you have in your control at this point are your essays.  you're going to have to ernest hemingway your way to berkeley.  start now and really dig deep into your life and passions, and how you're going to use cal's resources to enhance them and make the world better.  sounds corny, but they eat that up.
If youre aiming for haas you need a higher gpa
Basically you need to convey both why you’re exceptional and need Berkeley, specifically, to attain your goals.
One thing rich kids do is hire people to help improve their essays.  I know because I have seen it.  The only advice I can give there is you want your essays to show your specific interest in Berkeley in particular and create a compelling narrative that makes you stand out.

  
Also look at fall back schools that are not as competitive but still in the Bay Area (or LA too if you want to go there) etc.  

The California State University system has a bunch of schools all over CA. 

  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\_State\_University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University)
Rn, your biggest hurdle is that, to get into Haas as an OOS, you’ll probably want better states (3.75 unweighted and 150/180 are probably below the average for admits). I don’t think Berkeley looks at rank directly (I could be wrong on that), but colleges will usually have data on your school (so they’d probably know what a typical GPA for your school is as well as the general GPA distribution), so they’ll have at least a rough idea of how you stand against your class. Considering that you’re in second semester junior year and Berkeley will only see your 9-11 grade GPA (won’t see first semester senior grades), there probably isn’t much you can do other than do as best as you can this semester and maybe do some summer courses or something. If you could get up to 120/800 (top 15%) or 80/800 (top 10%) before start of Senior year, that could help. However, at this point I’m assuming that’s probably either impossible or extremely impractical, so I wouldn’t worry about it.

The best thing you can do to get the best marginal increase in your chances is probably ECs, ideally something outside of school. Your ECs seem really cool and I’m sure they’re things you’re passionate about and enjoy, but I’m not sure if any of them would stand out too much. The best thing you can probably do at this point (since you basically have a summer left) is to either do an internship relevant to your major (tho I’d assume most applications for those have ended) or start a project or a business or something. I think the latter might be better, because whatever ECs you do don’t necessarily need to be “prestigious”, but it helps if it distinguishes you from other applicants. There’s a lot of applicants who do tutoring or start clubs (not diminishing the effort you’ve probably put into those tho), so anything you can do that makes you stand out from the thousands of other applicants will be good.

Beyond that, make sure to put a lot of effort on your essays. A lot of people underestimate the importance of essays, but essays can honestly be what gets people in in some cases. I know a guy who had basically zero CS ECs, but got into UIUC CS (out of state) over people from my schools with much more CS experience; obviously I can’t say why exactly, but I do know that he was probably the best writer in my school, so my best guess is his essays were what put him ahead.

Last thing I’ll add is to not over think things too much. The whole college app process is kind of a crapshoot. I know two guys that founded a company as high schoolers with over >1M in VC funding and got rejected Berkeley this year, and I know people who did… frankly jack shit for all of HS, and got in. There’s so many variables, many of them highly subjective, that there’s no exact science to say who will get in and who won’t. Regardless of what anyone here says, you *can* absolutely get accepted; you obviously shouldn’t *expect* to get accepted (not as an insult to you, just that almost no one should assume they’ll get accepted to Berkeley OOS, especially Haas), but you shouldn’t assume you’ll get rejected. I’ll bet money that weaker applicants than you have been accepted, and stronger applicants than you have been rejected. You really just gotta take your shot and see how it goes, and I wish you the best of luck.
People in here need to pull their head out of their asses lol. I got in as an OOS Asian kid with relatively similar stats, but a way worse GPA and more extracurriculars. I was lucky to have a good test score but that doesn’t even damn near make up for the hole in my GPA. Focus on writing your essays about something you’re actually passionate about and find something in your extracurriculars that demonstrates your ambition. There’s a reason that thousands of bots with perfect GPAs and millions of Key Club hours get rejected: they don’t actually care about any of the work they do. Everything reads as a ploy to get into good schools, and admissions officers see that. Just be yourself and show them how much you care, and whatever happens happens; college is a crapshoot anyway, just make the best of it. Good luck man rooting for you!
If your gpa is there you need exceptional essays and a passion that you show in those essays. Uc also loves to hear about personal growth and interesting stories that reflect how you are an individual and will stand out in college

Those are words from a former uc admissions officer that was a substitute teacher I had a few times.

Also dont make the admissions officer feel stupid, ie dont start an essay with a definition
Make sure you proof read your personal essay to the nth degree. Your writing is your writing. Your story is your story. But your spelling is Merriam-Webster's. So it's Fundamental and not Fundementals. Your punctation is Chicago Manual of Style. So semicolons, and not commas, separate independent clauses.

Work your ass off knowing full well that if you get admitted then you'll work even harder.
Hey man, same situation, same year, same target school. If you want to talk or share anything feel free to pm me :)
If you don’t get in as a freshman, go to a community college and complete the IGETC and pre-work for your desired major. They have transfer admissions programs to help. I went to DVC and got into every UC I applied to. I got my degree from Cal like everybody else.
Play more Lego Fortnite



But, to be serious, I think you're on the right track. You seem to be a bit scattered with respect to extracurriculars...are you able to dedicate enough time for the extracurriculars you care about/are passionate about?

For me, I felt like my leadership positions helped me the most with being admitted to EECS. However, GPA is definitely the most important factor from what I know. I wouldn't overflow extracurriculars if it sacrifices the GPA (I know some people might disagree with this).

Overall though, I would try to narrow and focus your extracurriculars and try to get leadership experience.

I don't really know about a lot of scholarships except this one: [https://alumni.berkeley.edu/get-involved/scholarships/the-leadership-award/](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/get-involved/scholarships/the-leadership-award/)
Continue doing your best and don’t get discouraged if you don’t get in straight out of high school. You basically need to be close to perfect academically at least on paper. If you don’t get in and you 100% want to go to Cal and only Cal, transfer from a CC.
What is vu?
First thing I’d do is stop calling it ‘UCB.’ Disgraceful.
Improve your gpa, you should be in the top 10% of students. See if you can talk to an UCB counselor
Bruh idk do your best but there are many places you can go that are not your hometown.
have a story; mine was the fact that i failed my freshman math but ended senior year w an A in calculus 3 and a passion for math. you need to show that you will be successful there, so pick something your passionate about and build your application around it. ur piqs are super important too so get a head start on them this summer
Are you applying for Spieker?
Also, I have to say, dont think Cal is your end all be all for schools, there are plenty of good schools for your undergrad, frankly i wouldn't worry about where you go for your undergrad too much as your MBA will be more important, focus on job prospects, a CSU is a very good option for career minded majors like business for your undergrad, and plenty of vary good CSUs, also plenty of good UCs as well, like the under-appreciated UC Merced
Learn to shoot 3 pointers at a 40% clip and run an offense, maybe take your team to the second round of state playoffs with strong assist numbers and good point of attack defense.
ur gpa sat and class rank suck tbh
a california community college \* if you want to go to a UC
I’m pretty sure that’s NSHSS or something like that, NHS is a club at my school

Edit: My bad completely missed the second part of ecs
But don’t read like a classics novel at the same time
OOS is a mixed bag with the UCs it occasibally helps cause the budget. Asian doesn't matter, we are barred from considering race 
Does that work? I’d be super put off as an AO hearing some kid say “hey I NEED to go here” lol
Liked your response but saying people did jack shit for all of high school and got in just sounds ridiculous. You are not these people and you are not living their lives. Most likely you did not see every single aspect of their applications/essays nor are you an admissions officer with any sort of qualification to judge weaker applicants from stronger applicants.
Honestly the light of hope I needed. Thank you, let me know about any other specific obstacles that you had to overcome (being OOS) or anything that helped you find a way to stand out.
seconding this! also an oos asian student!
Would being an OOS ~> CA CC ~> UC be the better option?
Leadership is a key element in Berkeley applicants but I guess in my area, we don't place as much emphasis on it. What would be approachable leadership positions that would matter? Like more leadership roles in clubs or just gaining experiences in management?
it's like college credit for in-state. realizing it's possibly irrelevant now but still decided to place it on there. would ap classes be the better choice?
changed just for you ;)
I was wondering if applying straight away would be the best move. I feel hesitant jumping the gun so I want to put myself in a better position first.
I'll definitely keep CSU in mind. Not trying to be the stereotypical ""I wanna be in Cali"" crowd but I genuinely think it would help and give me the type of experience/education I'm looking for. Also could be giving myself a death wish but hey! We all start somewhere.
Ehhhh, jack shit might’ve been an exaggeration, but I’m pretty confident I know what was on their app cause I saw their app (ECs and essays). I mean obviously it’s very subjective, it could’ve literally just been that the AO thought their essays were really good. But overall fair point, I’m not an AO so I can’t really judge.
third-ing this as well! yes stats are obv really important but i def got in not because of my gpa (as international/asian). my outside work was pretty good and i really conveyed that into my essays. i know one of the admissions and they really do see ur app holistically. please dont be discouraged and if anything u can do, do more community based experience, one that u truly give a shit about. i think alot of ca schools (not just uc) eat that shit up <3 wherever you’ll be im sure you’ll do great :) berkeley/not!
Yes. Check out the UCB transfer guide, they have a specific section for Haas.
low-key just rise up the ranks in clubs
You’ve got a great shot to get in now
If your not a california resident then dont go to a UC, unless you want to pay over 48k in tuition, and thats just your first year"
Cs61c project,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pt58su/cs61c_project/,2021-09-22 04:09:04,I’m going absolutely crazy for this class. I haven’t got checked off for lab for 2 weeks at this point and I completely don’t understand c or anything we have learned in class at this point. There was a project due on Monday and I asked for and for a 2 day extension on it but despite that I literally haven’t got past part 3 which means I literally have a 0 out of 100 at this point and I’m legit so fucked. Is it possible for me to give up on this and focus on catching up on the class material again or should I try to use my slip days and get some points on the project? I have slept for like 4 hours a night for the past 4 days ish now and I’m really going crazy I just don’t know what to do ahhh. I don’t have any friends/lab partner to work on this with or in the class in general and that’s prob messing me up too I just haven’t been able to.,"So for starters I would first work on the 5th task of project 1. It’s writing test cases for the staff’s code, so your code doesn’t have to pass the task 5 tests you writeto get points for that part and it may help you to think of test cases first before writing the code for part 3 and 4.  By doing part 5 and filling out the survey, you will earn 25 points right there. I would then work on discussion 2 and lab 2 in order to figure out pointers. After that, try part 3 and part 4 again on the project. I don’t have a lab partner for 61C and I’d be more than happy to work with you. The labs take me forever too, so maybe we can help each other. PM me if interested.
There is a Discord server for this class and I would seek a private tutor because I heard that students wait hours for office hours especially near the due date. In the worst case, turn in what you have so that you can get some credit."

I don’t think that I will be able to raise this grade up very much, or maybe even pass at all since there are still 2 more midterms left. Being on the pre-health track, having a good gpa is very important for me. So I need help deciding whether I should change this class to a p/np and then take math 1b next semester (I have ap credit from ap calc for 1a and I have heard good things about the professor) or whether I should stick to letter grades and be ok with a C (and maybe even retake the class if I fail?). Any suggestions will be really helpful here.","I finished math 10a with a C+ and stuck through with 10b even though switching to 1b was an option. It was rough but I ended up with an A in 10b thanks to the slc and adjunct courses so improvement is possible. I would stick through with grades, but its all up to you. Though I will say if you switch to 1b you will be relearning some of the material from 10a
I would say to p/np, a C- or a C is a red flag for medical school applications and you would need to explain the reasons behind the grade.
if you’re ok with lowering your unit count, you can also late drop
assuming stankova is the one teaching the class id also try to see what that grade actually translates to when the class gets curved at the end. when i took the class 2 years ago i ended up with an A despite getting midterm scores that were average or just slightly above, it's a hard class but the curve is generous. i do think the 10 series is more rewarding than the 1.
I’m taking Math1B & going to take a stats class Separately. I heard that was easier. I’m not great at math and I’ve done decent in Math1A & I’m staying afloat for Math1B. Paulin who is teaching Math1B this semester is very caring and dedicated to his students. His exams are hard but there is a curve for them if needed.

Research Project Idea,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uxdknk/research_project_idea/,2022-05-25 02:30:17,"Hi! I will be an EECS junior in the next fall semester. After having some industry experience (one internship last summer, one this upcoming summer; both in backend/fullstack dev), I think directly working after undergrad might not be for me and wanna try something new like a research opportunity (in any field really, system related ones might be more aligned with my current experiences but ml interests me a lot like all other students lol). 

However, all my previous experiences are centered around web dev using Java or Go, and I also haven’t taken many senior courses (only 61a b c and 170). Although I got A/A+ in them, it doesn’t seem like it would help me in conversation with prof/PhD student.

To make up for it, I’m thinking abt doing a more involved side project this summer to show case my interest and pick up some useful skills (more importantly just be noticed by researchers). 

But I don’t have any idea of what kind of project will be liked. So I wanna ask if anyone did something similar to get a research position and mind sharing some ideas. Any comment and input is greatly appreciated! 

Also if anyone used the DARE program, do you have any comment on that (does people actually get picked, is the competition high)?","How’d you do so well in those classes
Lol. Although I don’t think I was the best student in class, I’m more than happy to share some of my experience in those classes. For 61a and b, there is honestly not so many things I did. The courses were graded on a scale back when I took them (and they r probably still), so I just did all the assignments on time and tried to get all the bonus in projects to help with test scores. 61c was kinda of annoy for me cuz it involved so many topics and some required memorization (at least for me). But it followed a similar pattern.

70 and 170 r two totally different stories. Both felt more abstract and tricky. What I found helpful the most is to read the hw solutions after they r released and try to recreate them after some time. Also, doing a lot of past exams or even reading past exam solutions are can save your life on exams. Sometimes the same question pattern appears multiple times.

Also remember I spread out those courses in two years so I had more time for each class…

Help in resolving NPs,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ngtejs/help_in_resolving_nps/,2021-05-20 00:06:58,"So I got a NP for a R&C class that is supposed to satisfy the second half of the requirement. It’s been a really tough semester and I’m pretty depressed over receiving this kind of grade. Right now, I’m just mentally lost — don’t know how this will affect me nor what I should do to mitigate this. 

That being said, does anyone know if NPs have a significant impact on activities requiring transcripts (like grad school, research, haas admissions, internships, honor society admissions, etc) and advice on what I could do to possibly move forward? I can’t help but to be at least a little worried about this.","It will definitely impact your haas admissions criteria since the r&c classes are prereqs to applying. You’ll prob have to take another one. But don’t worry, the haas application had a specific space for students to talk about any bad grades they got, giving them a chance to justify a though semester or whatnot. If you are honest about your situation this semester, it might be looked at less than other parts of your app.
An NP can only affect you negatively. How much depends on the context of your other grades and major. What major are you?
Even if I end up taking another R&C B class to replace the NP? I thought it was possible to replace it with another class, according to what I’ve heard
But they even reject 4.0’s 😢

Context: Robert La Follette was a progressive Republican from Wisconsin who helped to revolutionize the state's structure, and made it a blueprint for other states to come in creating a government that responded to the needs of the people.  During the early 20th century, La Follette pushed for the initiative and referendum systems, the recall vote, called for strong unions, and helped develop public policy based upon research and the findings at the University of Wisconsin, embracing the benefits that learning and higher education could bring to the state.  He was eventually elected to be a US Senator.  He dared to break from President Taft during the 1912 presidential election but refused to support Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Party at that time.  He was an outspoken critic of Woodrow Wilson and his choice to join World War I while senator.  He would eventually become the presidential candidate for the Progressive Party in 1924, where left wing supporters and socialists voted for him against Calvin Coolidge.

____

To put this another way: the EE~~(CS)~~ department students at Cal were so Anti-War they actually sent a telegram at the outbreak of World War I and instead of writing to their own Senator, they wrote to the most outspoken opponent of the status quo.  They did this while the sitting president of the University, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, was a personal friend of the Kaiser [\(nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize!\)](https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show.php&id=8363) and held pro-German sentiments from his time learning and teaching in Leipzig, Heidelberg, Jena, and Berlin.

I want to take the easier course to maximize my GPA, any recommendation  on which one I should take? I have taken an introduction to c++ and MATLAB course at my previous CC. I don’t plan to take any more computer science after this choice. I’m open to hear insight and perspectives on the courses and how they compare. Thanks!","I've taken both as a MechE to EECS transfer and I would do anything to not have to take a class like E7.
If the E7 class is with Raja Sengupta, dont take it.
Havent taken E7 but I hear its a poorly ran course. By contrast, 61A is an amazingly run course, though the workload is probably higher than E7's. Also, avg grade in 61a seems to be higher according to BerkeleyTime.
E7 was a terrible experience
I've taken E7 as a MechE and 61A when I moved to EECS. Literally E7 is so badly run I can understand why any engineer doesnt wanna take CS class ever again. It's like 300 kids per 7-8 GSIs who never respond to piazza. I'm not sure about other professors but my professor, Raja, literally is the worst of the worst teachers I've ever had or ever seen. He literally came to class on Day 1 saying he hasn't coded in Matlab for over 3 years. Proceeds to fail to demonstrate how to create a function that does x+y in the next lecture as a kid had to correct him live. 

You learn the same thing as 61A minus the math computational part of E7, which isn't that great either. People only take E7 for the Matlab aspect. If you want to learn how to actually code, take 61A. I recommend 61A > E7 anytime.
What specific major? I didn't think that cs61a was an alternative for E7 in most non-eecs engineering majors. If you're doing meche-e or civ-e, E7 is probably a lot more important for you but I've only taken 61a.
Dang why do you say that? Do you think it would be different if it’s held remotely?
Yeah I saw that, but is that it because more COMPSCI majors are interested in getting a higher grade for their major? Or is it just easier relative to ENGIN 7
> He literally came to class on Day 1 saying he hasn't coded in Matlab for over 3 years. Proceeds to fail to demonstrate how to create a function that does x+y in the next lecture as a kid had to correct him live.


Lmaoooooo no way! How is this acceptable for a berkeley class
BioE and I’m taking 15+ units next semester so I’m only considering which one is easier to get an A in
The class is just so badly run. Please take 61A since you already know Matlab.
Ask anyone who took E7 Spring 19. What he said went on overheard instantly.
Ah ok. Given your background (Matlab), E7 will probably be more manageable.
I thought so as well, thanks for the response, but now I’m seeing people say COMPSCI 61A is more manageable, is E7 that bad? I for some reason want to take 20 units next semester to knock out as many BioE courses as possible as their class averages are A-‘s. Do you think it’s manageable if I invested all my time into my courses? I’m staying home so hoping that buys me a lot more extra time.
20 units is incredibly hard regardless of what you take, so keep that in mind. Idk much about E7, but from people who I know took it, it sounds like it's probably not harder than 61a, just less well organized. 61a is super well structured and everyone loves the professor (it's usually denero who teaches it I think)"
CS CC Transfer Student Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uzcgil/cs_cc_transfer_student_questions/,2022-05-27 18:07:58,"I enrolled for Laney’s 61A equivalent for Fall 2022 since Summer 2022 was filled (thereby being dual enrolled in Cal at the same time, hopefully this isn’t a bad thing? Will it still work where I can submit a transcript and get credit for 61A?).

Can Berkeley courses “override” CC credit?

So for example if I do absolutely terrible in CS 70 in fall and get something like a C+, then am I able to take CS61B (and presumably CS61A as well, even though I took CC class equivalents for both in the past) in Spring 2023 to “pad” my core class GPA, in order to reach 3.3 to declare?

Side question: would that also mess up the amount of time it takes to finish CS degree in 2 years?

Thanks again for all the help.


Breadth question: I finished my IGETC in CC, some of which was fulfilled with AP credits, does this mean I have to take any breadth courses in L&S CS besides the American cultures requirement?","1. Yes, you will get credit for 61a
2. No, they don’t override cc credit.
3. Yes, you can take 61a/61b to pad if you don’t reach a 3.3 to declare
4. Depends how you structure your semesters and classes.
5. Just need to do AC requirement. (I took one online over the summer at a cc. 

Source: Was a CS transfer who took direct credit equivalent of 61abc at cc during gap year. Coming back this fall to take cs70.
Sweet! Thanks for the info :) just a question about 2 and 3, so if I already get CC credit for a CS core class, I can retake the classes at Berkeley to reach 3.3 and therefore be able to declare CS? I just want to know in case I don’t get the B+ required for CS70 in my first semester
You can take AC at cc? I wish I had known this before :(
The answer is yes.

You should also consider retaking CS61B even if you do qualify for the 3.3 outright, for your own good.
Yes, you can. Audit over summer.
^agreed I audited hugs 2021 61B and watched lectures, did all the projects/assignments. It’s one of my favorite classes I’ve ever taken.
Sure, what’s that? What does it do?
Auditing a class is pretty much taking the class but not as for letter grade or anything. Kinda like doing a soft run of the class. Also, you don’t take the exams with class. They don’t grade your hw. You can self grade it tho.
Oh okay, so it’s like an effective way of preparing for 61A or CS70 before I actually take it in fall? How do I sign up to audit it? And there’s no real obligation to actually do anything in the class right? Also would it be all remote as well?
Yup, pretty much pre-studying the material. Email the instructor. No obligation, totally up to you. Idk if it will be remote this summer.
Thanks so much! Last question, what CC did you take AC at? And how can I check if one articulates from my CC to Berkeley or not? Thanks.

Thank you so much!!!","One of the best classes I’ve taken. Christyna is the most thoughtful, considerate, and BADASS professor I’ve had so far. When I missed an assignment, she was really understanding about my situation and granted me a reasonable extension.

I’m not minoring in education either, but I found the class to be really insightful. The 2 hour lecture is basically a 2 hour discussion though, so be prepared for lots of break out room activities! Sometimes it got to me especially since the class was at night and I was too tired to talk. But honestly you just get through it! And you’ll be proud of yourself for getting through it too. You learn a lot from your peers, the class assistants, and Christyna

Time commitment can vary. There’s weekly reading assignments with questions you have to answer. Those aren’t too bad and could take a good 1-3 hours. There are also two big projects, which will take I’d say about 1-3 hrs a week outside of class with your group. 

She’s a really lenient grader, just get your assignments done! 

Don’t worry about not having enough knowledge on education. You’ll learn a lot through readings, your own opinions, as well as from your peers and the staff.

I thought Berkeley does it based on semesters attended?
Yeah Berkeley does it on semesters attended, not on standing.
For 4-year students, enrollment day is based on number of semesters attended.  

However, having advanced standing can make you eligible (or ineligible) for certain classes, especially the ones that might say Junior standing and above, etc.  That could come in handy at some point.
Yuge if true. I unlocked it it then says it's not connected to any major characters
Oh I’ve never heard of that lol. Are there any cs/math/stats related classes that have requirements like that?
Yes, the EE16A/B classes have a priority for this, but in your case it hurts you a tiny bit, as there is (used to be?) a category for Freshman and Sophomore standing.  A lot of the UGBA classes have Junior+ standing prereq."

Substitution for MATH 1A online,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wcb7op/substitution_for_math_1a_online/,2022-07-30 17:05:58,"Hey! I just wanted to share this because I has SUCH a hard time with it this year. Personally it was super difficult to fit Math1A into my first year at Cal because our scheduling system is absolute ass. B/c of this I need to take it over the summer, but I’m out of state (so the guaranteed transfer online California CC classes were way too expensive) and I move around a lot over the summer so I needed something online, with a flexible schedule, that would actually be accepted by the Cal Math Dept. 

Long story short, the answer is taking Calculus I through Outlier (you can look it up). You’re given cred from the University of Pittsburg (accepted by Cal), it’s entirely online, pretty much asynchronous, available in 7week or 14week sections at anytime of year, and only $400. 

(This isn’t an ad I swear it has it’s own limitations but I wanted to share :))","Thanks for sharing! 

Is there a link, information source, or a checker for more courses that we would know for sure Berkeley would accept as equivalence?
It’s not on the database list of Pre-Approved Transfer courses from other universities, but then again that list is probably not comprehensive. 

https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/progress-planning/transfer-credit/other-higher-education-institution

I would triple check with the CEU of the Registrar and with the Math department before going forward with this.
For math 1A specifically or math classes or all classes? :)
Yes! For any math class to be guaranteed transfer you need to fill out the equivalency for the math department. That being said, everyone I know who has taken this course has had it accepted by Cal :)
For the Math 1A class and for general. More information is always welcomed 🙏

Berkeley M.E.T. or Caltech Bioengineering?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/myc38w/berkeley_met_or_caltech_bioengineering/,2021-04-25 09:43:46,"Hi all,

I'm trying to decide between U.C. Berkeley M.E.T. (Business+Engineering) and Caltech for Bioengineering.

I'm interested in computational biology and genomics, and definitely want to carry out independent research as an undergraduate.

I also plan on going to graduate school but am not entirely sure yet if that will be a Masters+MBA or a PhD.

The costs are pretty much identical for me as an international.

What do you all think?

Thank you in advance!","Look, I can’t tell you much tbh. But I will say this, both are amazing options! You really can’t go wrong with either but I’m sure someone else will give you a better understanding of each. Good luck and congrats!
I would say both options are different in terms of what they offer you. Berkeley M.E.T. will be much more business focused with lots of industry connects rather than research opportunities. I would expect Caltech Bioengineering to offer more research opportunities and connects in academia rather than industry. If you want to do an Masters/MBA, choose MET. If you are leaning PhD, choose Caltech. Either way, both schools are extremely prestigious and your career won't be setback regardless of your choice.
idk about cal tech, but ik fs that MET is an insanely prestigious program that hooks you up with many connections (internships, people,etc.). I would definitely choose met over cal tech
It’s probably easier to get research at Caltech
currently a met student, know a few people that had been deciding between caltech and met. it really boils down to deciding what you put value on; industry connections and a free network or are deadset on academia. another lens to look at is whether you'd rather spend a summer doing research or industry work. admittedly, in the past, met didn't have as many connections within bioeng companies, but that's recently changing. i'd also say if you don't particularly care about business, you might want to lean caltech.
if your goal is research and academia, go to caltech.

for most other things, go to cal."

Will I have any trouble if I explain the circumstances that led to me getting 4 B’s and 1 C in first semester? 

I did well in second semester of senior year, with 3 A’s and 2 CR.

I also did not fill out the form until now because I was unaware that first semester grades would be considered, until I emailed my admissions counselor asking why my transcript hasn’t been working.","You definitely won’t get rescinded. I had worse grades and the admissions office was understanding.
Aren't the terms of admission that you can't get *below* a C? If you didn't, then you're fine
Nah def not. Had worse grades and didn’t take a couple aps and was fine.
I got some non passing grades senior year and I just explained how I would never allow this situation to ever happen again and how it was not representative of my usual performance. They sent me an email three weeks later saying that low grades due to circumstances would not affect your conditions of admission. Don’t worry too much! Just email your officer and try your best to explain the situation surrounding the grades super clearly.
Thank you so much for the response, I really appreciate it. And I’m very glad the admissions office was understanding.
There is also a condition that says you need a 3.0 UW GPA for both terms, and I got a 2.8 for the first semester

PS. Thanks for the response, it’s very reassuring
Thank you so much for the response. It really calmed me down, and I’m not too worried anymore. I really appreciate the detailed response. Have a wonderful day!

Summer Financial Aid,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/go9ipr/summer_financial_aid/,2020-05-21 18:05:36,"I don’t know what to do because I can only take summer classes if I receive financial aid and I am currently only enrolled in CS70 during session C.

I need to be enrolled in 6 units, and CS70 is only 4. I don’t know what to do because I really need to take this class but feel like if I enroll in an R1B then I won’t be able to succeed in either class. 

Is it possible to take an R1B at a CC so the workload isn’t as much and then take CS70 at Berkeley. Would I still receive financial aid since i’m technically taking over 6 units but across two different schools?","You need to take 6 units at Cal to be able to receive summer financial aid. 

I personally think the best option is to take a 2 unit class in session A so that it overlaps w/ CS70 for only two weeks. Don't do session D because then it will overlap w/ CS70 for six weeks. 

I highly recommend History N100 in session A. It's asynchronous too so you don't have to worry about making it to live zoom sessions.
the AI form for 61BL is just out, if you've taken 61B and would like to get one/two units from there. it's 6 hours per unit-- working 12 hrs/wk with cs70 is quite doable if you're not doing much else, and I don't imagine AIing should be too strenuous. either way good luck, hope you find something!

Even if it isn’t inclusive enough it is probably the most inclusive you will get out of any school tbh I mean it’s berkeley afterall lol
Hi op! I'm not in CoC but I'm a sophomore in CNR, and have been in a lot of general stem classes like physics, bio, math, and data science and comp sci classes.

I'm not trying to scare you, but i also do want to lyk that it's not a perfect place. I'm also gonna plug the berkeley stem discord, which has a channel for queer and trans discourse: [https://discord.gg/YRBcZgf](https://discord.gg/YRBcZgf).

Pretty sure Nusctx 10 is also full, you might want to think of different options
so is eecs16a better than taking math 54?
From the context of a CS major- yes, since 16a prepares you better for 16b (it’s a natural progression) than math 54 would (you need to self study circuits)"

Honestly if you're on the fence, not going to college and regretting it is an easier mistake to correct than going to college and regretting it. Just live your life for several years, read and watch things you find interesting, get some work experience, and if you feel like applying to college eventually you can always do that as an adult.
Also consider seeing if they have diagnosable learning disorders and whether accommodations designed for people with those disorders do enough to help
Too little info.
The grades someone got and extracurriculars they did in high school isn't useful enough alone to determine what the prospects are for their future and career.

Abused at BAIR,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1bkeq9t/abused_at_bair/,2024-03-21 12:13:50," Hi all,

**TLDR: 7 undergrads, including myself, and a grad student were abused in a BAIR lab for many months. I have reported everything and nothing has happened over quite a few months now. This is a call to all victims of abuse in academia - Lots of power dynamics in the lab encourage us to stay SILENT. I understand this. The EECS department needs to create better systems for PREVENTATIVE and RESPONSIVE measure to incidents like this that PROPERLY address abuse. We need to stand up for ourselves. I was too afraid to stand up for many months. The school needs to do something substantial about these things. We need to make this school accountable and change this culture of abuse and subsequent silence.**

My name is Liam and I have something that I want to say today.

Seeing all the serious and supportive responses aimed at properly addressing harmful behavior has encouraged me to go a little more public with the tremendous amount of abuse that I and several other undergraduate and graduate students were made to face a little while back.

I apologize in advance for the vulgar language.

I  have already reported this to the school, to the chair of EECS, to the Principal Investigator of the lab, and to the EECS Department itself. In seeking to report this I've filled out every form that there is, and over the 6 months since I initially reported this to the PI, nothing has happened. The situation has not been properly addressed.

**I am explicitly not naming the person publicly, as I do not want anyone to harass them or the PI involved.**

I am an undergrad and I worked at BAIR. I worked with a very famous professor and his postdoc at BAIR.

This postdoc subjected quite a few undergrads (including myself) as well as a graduate student to abuse for many months.

Keep  in mind, the following are only a selection of the incidents that  occurred while I was working under this postdoc, as I worked with this  person nearly every day for 6 months.

**A brief list of things that happened:**

* The postdoc kicked a chair at me
* The postdoc threw his phone in anger during a meeting and almost hit two students
* The postdoc punched a wall in anger at me
* The postdoc would not let me go home and physically blocked my way as I was trying to go home for the day
* The postdoc told a grad student that he would ""f\*ck the grad student up  first"" if the grad student did not do exactly what the postdoc wanted
* The postdoc often went on vulgar, manipulating, gaslighting, and  emotionally abusive tirades aimed at his students. He emotionally broke a student.
* The postdoc yelled at a collaborator over the phone, said the F-word, then smashed his phone and hung up
* The postdoc called me a 傻逼 (idiotic c\*nt) to another one of his undergrad mentees and badmouthed me to the rest of his students
* The postdoc sh\*t on all of his mentees to his other mentees behind their backs
* The postdoc would threaten to fire his mentees if we didn't do what he wanted
* The postdoc would make disparaging comments about his students any chance he got, mocking us
* After I did not kowtow and walked out after the postdoc did not let me leave  the lab, he stopped talking to me altogether, even though he was my  supposed research mentor
* ""Jokes"" about giving us sh\*t letters of recommendation, dangling letters of recommendation over our heads to make us work harder, longer, and do what he wanted
* Constant emphasis of seniority and power above us, coupled with reminders of the evaluation he will present to the professor come time for letters of recommendation - standing up for ourselves would just jeopardize our letters of recommendation, as he would often suggest that he has a great deal of power in our graduate school application results. Coupled with his unreasonable demands and bad behavior, we felt our hands were tied
* (more minor) The postdoc mandated constant overwork and late night meetings, with 7 day workweeks
* (more minor) Pinging very often at 3 am, a lot, and multiple times in a night
* There are more things that I won't mention, for brevity

**Steps that have been taken:**

* I have extensive documentation of incidents that I've shared during all reports
* I brought the issue up to the PI
* I emailed the chair of EECS
* I contacted EECS student services
* I have asked multiple faculty for advice
* I have filled out the EECS incident reporting form
* I have submitted my report to OPHD
* I have submitted my report to the Abusive Conduct Compliance Division of Employee & Labor Relations

**What has happened so far**

* I left the lab
* 6 months ago, the PI gave a quick chat with the postdoc and his behavior did not change. I know this because some of my former lab mates still faced his abuse after I told the PI and left
* The school has been processing my report for 4 months. I have not heard a real update

**No disciplinary action has been taken. No new preventative measures for future cases have been taken. It seems to me  that the school and PI have ignored the problem as best as they could.**

**Personal Testimony:**

His  actions have impacted my lab performance. and more importantly, my  well-being. His threats and the effects of overwork while under him have  caused me a great deal of stress, burnout and anxiety. It has also caused me a great lack of self-esteem in research. My focus, engagement, and overall performance in academics were all impacted as an effect of  working with the postdoc.

I felt very intimidated after he  blocked me from leaving, and quite fearful after he kicked his chair at  me. In general, I felt demoralized due to these experiences.

I  have a poor perception of research, as well as my own research  abilities. I feel that I was not able to work in BAIR anymore. even  after trying for a few months after reporting the incidents to the PI. I  believe that working with this person has really discouraged me and has  really gotten me to question whether a career in AI research is for me.  I will not be conducting research in AI anymore. I believe that if I  had worked under another mentor from the beginning, this might not be  the case.  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an abuse of power that occurred in a very  hostile work environment. This person has violated countless items in  the code of conduct manual. He has emotionally and psychologically  harmed many students.

Myself, and 3 other undergrads brought the  issue up to the Principal Investigator. In addition 3 graduate students  brought the issue up as well. I do not believe the principal  investigator has taken this seriously.

I brought this up with  the EECS department chair and student services. Student services was  kind enough to help me submit a report to the school. I thank them for  that. However, I have been waiting almost four months since submitting  this report to the school.

**The School must take further action to  properly address the situation. In addition, the EECS department should  do something to make sure this never happens again, to anyone. They  need to create a more effective system to deal with these kinds of  situations. Dealing with this, virtually by myself, was a nightmare and I  do not want to see anyone else face the same fate.  We need to do  better. We need better trainings. We need better responses when these things do happen.**

We need to push  the EECS department to be a place where abuse is not tolerated and  trainings are better to PREVENT abuse from happening in the first place.

Abuse in Academia can be horrible and the EECS  department and community must do something to address these kinds of  issues, BOTH PREVENTATIVE as well as RESPONSIVE.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I  was afraid to report all of this for a very long time because I didn't  want my professor to make my letter of recommendation poor in  retaliation. I was afraid everyone was going to respond poorly. I was  afraid I'd ruin my reputation. I think we shouldn't have to live in such  environment. We can do better.

If you are a student facing  similar issues, feel free to reach out to me. I have a lot of knowledge  of what your options are. You shouldn't have to deal with this. I'm  sorry.","[deleted]

This shit won't stop until somebody's parent is litigious. The only way to stop it is to make UCB pay a shitload of cash for allowing their staff to abuse students.

One thing you can do right now, though — but it might only work if you have a grad student job with this person:

Report this to the California Dept of Fair Employment and Housing. 

You don't need a lawyer. You report it as a hostile workplace, and they start contacting UCB. That's when UCB pays attention. Cal DFEH can get you a settlement and can force UCB to take action to end the abuse (as well as retrain all its staff.) It takes a couple of months, but if you craft your complaint correctly you'll get results. Read their acceptable complaint reasons to see if any of them apply - if they don't, you don't have a complaint. If they do, make sure to highlight them in your complaint.

You could also contact a lawyer - some lawyers give free consultations - but they take 40% of the settlement, iirc. Although you could just pay a lawyer $600 to write a letter. A piece of paper with a lawyer's letterhead should scare the bejesus out of UCB. You just need an outside force to make them pay attention.
You deserve justice for this, fuck BAIR for protecting your abuser
A close friend told me about this situation last summer, and it’s appalling that the department has not handled this better. That professor also has built enough of a reputation in academia that there is 0 excuse for them to not act swiftly and appropriately in addressing the behavior of that postdoc.
""Seeing all the serious and supportive responses aimed at properly addressing harmful behavior has encouraged me to go a little more public"" is exactly why people should share their stories, good luck.
It takes courage to speak out on these topics as you have done. It's crazy that these things happen in one of Berkeley's most well-established labs
Thank you for speaking out.
So sorry this happened to you🙏
Thank you so much for speaking up about this, it takes an incredible amount of courage to do so and everyone in BAIR appreciates you for this. Thank you for standing up and holding this person accountable. I am so sorry to hear that this happened to you. Wishing you the absolute best in everything you do, and that you find your place in a healthy, supportive environment. Sending lots and lots of love <3
Liam, I’m sorry this happened to you.  Thank you for further exposing this issue.  I realized the system failed you but hopefully it won’t fail the next student.  I also hope you get some justice.
I’m sorry this happened to you and thank you for being brave. This should not have happened and I’m so disappointed in the response of your lab.
Would you be able to file a lawsuit against the PI and postdoc...maybe there are some lawyers that can help seek damages
I'm sorry that this happened to you. If it helps you feel that you are not alone, I think BAIR is unique in the things they get away with. I have found many faculty here to be both racist and sexist, telling women ""you are unqualified to do research in my lab"" or telling students ""I don't have time for you yet alone my own students"". I've even seen faculty ignore requests for collaboration and steal ideas from those students they rejected.   


I think they are allowed to get away with it because of the program's prestige. I haven't heard of such experiences from others. Don't let this abuse discourage you from research if you genuinely enjoy the work. Look elsewhere and really quiz the students of those departments to understand the culture there. Simple things to ask for are how often do students hangout, are you friends with your lab mates, how many people do you know were able to switch advisors, etc.

Some of these things are crimes. You can file a police report. File with the city of Berkeley police department not the campus police.

&#x200B;

Edit: Encourage everyone to never be alone with him. Record him at every opportunity. After googling the person that people here are saying it is then if he assaults or kidnaps someone else then they could punch him in the face and he wouldn't do anything.
Tbh completely tangential to this but hearing about your academics and research being impacted so heavily because of the abuse you've experienced really validates my experience, because everything you describe the postdoc doing kinda describes my home life with my parents (along with actual physical contact violence) for most of my childhood.

I hope you get the support and justice that you deserve, OP. Fuck that postdoc.
Is this something the union can help with, putting pressure on the dept to do something? Or does it not help because it’s a postdoc causing the issue instead of professor/staff?
Go to the police station, tell the police officer, and file a report or call the police while you are in school so something will actually happen instead of nothing.
this is more than enough to report to the authorities outside of the school. then the school will finally do soemthing. hope you get justice.
I’m so sorry you went through all of this. It takes real courage to share all of this - hope this will inspire more people to share their own experiences. Take care man
often you need legal action to get the school to do something. berkeley student legal services offers confidential consultations and services from berkeley law students, usually at no charge. they’ll be able to provide you a better plan of action than most of us https://sls.berkeley.edu
i hope things work out for the best, you seem like a very accomplished student and person. this postdoc is probably having issues on his behalf and is taking it out on those with less power than him. this is unprofessional and immature. 

the workforce isn’t going to be easy. i would know because i have family members working in research/tech in notoriously demanding companies. having a “strict” mentor/boss doesn’t always mean they want the worst for you — sometimes they want what’s best for you, therefore they push you to try your best.

in this case, this is clearly not what’s happening.

best of luck, and even though i don’t know who you are and your merits, get back on your feet and come back even stronger. you’ve already accomplished so much — use this setback as fuel to succeed even more. you’ve already got a great foundation. you'll be okay, everything will be okay. people who target on those with less power are such sore losers. they can’t even speak up to those above them 😭
sorry this happened to you liam
[deleted]
This sounds incredibly fucked up. If even half of what you said is true then heads should absolutely roll. 

I hope this doesn't come off as too flippant since I'm mostly serious here: this is what ACTUAL abuse of power and creating a hostile environment looks like. A professor many people have never even taken posting an opinion you don't like about dating on a discussion forum is NOTHING next to this. I hope the response from the student body is proportionally supportive of OP and his colleagues given that fact, but unfortunately I suspect virtue signaling around an extremely popular opinion is more important to most people joining that frenzy than challenging genuine abuse. 

Once again OP, I'm very sorry for what it sounds like you and many others have endured. If there's anything we can do, let us know. I hope you get the justice you deserve.
Most normal engineering research group
""I am explicitly not naming the person publicly, as I do not want anyone to harass them or the PI involved."" why the fuck did you make a callout post then? that's ALWAYS the result. do you think that disclaimer absolves you of the consequences?

not excusing the behavior, toxicity in academia is rampant, it's good to call it out, I'm angry that this happened to you, but fuck, own your actions. If you're going to do something, commit to it all the way.
Thank you for commenting.  I would recommend calling a lawyer and seeing what they think.  I have done that myself and it was easier than expected.  Even if they say there's no case, at least you would know.
My girlfriend has been through a similar experience, so I can relate to your struggles. I agree with u/NGEFan . It is okay to move on without pursuing litigation, but it is also okay to pursue litigation. There is no wrong choice here. I don't believe in karma, but I do believe that shitty people bite themselves in the ass in the long term. I pray for a lot of misery towards that guy and hope he gets what he deserves. Thank you for sharing with us and I hope you can find peace.

Don’t believe the research is the issue. It’s the reputation of an abusive individual staff & environment that’s the issue.

Crazy I had to scroll this much to find this. Berkeley is not its own city state or country. Post doc committed felonies, there is proof, great. The cops need to bring them in for questioning at the least. I’m sure the media would love to cover that. 


Even if it’s just monetary litigation like others have suggested, you’ll need to show you tried to contact law enforcement 
>i hope things work out for the best, you seem like a very accomplished student and person.

can attest to this point
There’s so many ways a situation can get toxic
Uhhh the consequences of calling out an abuser? At least they are doing something about it. Plus they did attach their name so that’s more owning it  than whatever you are doing, harassing them for saying there should be consequences for calling them out.

I think you're misreading the ""consequences"" part a bit, although it is kinda confusingly worded.  

He's trying to tell OP that obviously a callout post will involve consequences for the accused abusive postdoc (consequences like being fired). 

He is not telling OP that OP should suffer retaliation for writing this callout post-- that just wouldn't make any sense.  His point is that it's disingenuous for OP to make a callout post while also trying to ""shield"" the abuser from public anger and firing.  A callout post guarantees that will happen, and so OP should take responsibility for *that* ""consequence"" as the author of the callout.
try again, that's not what that says
Also reported them for harassment

People aren’t 100% rational all the time and their anger can just boil over I guess. We can’t really get into the mind of what they think
yes, thank you, that was better said than mine
Oh yeah fair point. That was just a misreading on my end oops
Oh you mean the consequences of being “dishonest” by calling out the abuser and not going further with it. Still they have their own experience that dictates what they said and who are we to judge them for not going further
Criticizing someone on a reddit post is harassment??

This really is the berkely sub
eat sand, telling someone they're dishonest isn't harassment. I'm allowed to voice my opinion.
[removed]
I am one to judge. I think it's wrong.
Well the person is calling out their abuser so think about what that criticism towards them for calling them out is
Think about how you sound telling the person there should be consequences for calling out their abuser
Fair enough. People can always do more and aren’t 100% rational all the time and the head space of being abused is rough
the criticism is dishonesty
You would have never survived a 2010 call of duty waiting room on Xbox live
luckily I don't have to, because that's not what I said. the consequences already exist, will always exist, any time you stand up to authority. I told them they should take responsibility for the consequences of *naming their abuser*, not that they should be punished for doing so. Because *they did that. The name is in the top comment of this post.* I'm FOR naming the abuser. I'm ANGRY that they pussyfooted around, like they wouldn't have to take responsibility for any professional consequences of this person being outed. Like that wasn't *the point of making a callout post*. 

I'm ANGRY because it's DISHONEST. 

Even luckier for me, I'm allowed to be angry at two things at once. So I can, in fact, simultaneously abhor this awful postdoc's behavior, while at the same time admonishing shockingly poor form and childish responsibility hiding.   
Liam, your hands will have blood as the consequence of your action. You made that choice when you made this post. **I think it's a good choice**. Now just *own that* and don't try to back out of it like you weren't okay with that happening all along.  


Beyond that, overall, this post is well-documented and well-written. Good job on it in general. This was my only note.
i think that's the de facto function that shame serves; forcing a double-check at time of submission
Dishonest to not want to name the person? We aren’t the person so they have their own reason to not want to name the person and can’t control other people if they have prior experiences with the abuser
Idk if that’s a good metric for anything that matters lol
dishonest because that defeats the entire damn point of writing this, dishonest because they did, in fact, give enough to tacitly identify the abuser; it's Jianlian, everyone seemed to figure that out right quick. dishonest because identifying yourself makes it *even easier* to identify them them. dishonest because it's performative and meaningless. dishonest because it *does* what it says it *will not do.*
Fair point
at the end of the day you're a pretty reasonable guy, and I regret my earlier emotional outbursts towards you. I'm leaving them up though. I said them and meant them at the time, and even though i was misguided, I still said them.
Same to you"
Vent about roommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xw0mk9/vent_about_roommates/,2022-10-04 21:30:40,"Warning: this is pretty long and contains some stuff I’ve had bottled up for a while. I’m also not feeling great right now due to school stress, EC stress, sleep deprivation stress, stress from the situation I’m about to describe, so it might come off as whiny.

I’ve recently not been happy with my living situation with respect to my roommates. (I’m been living with them for about two years.) One of them, Person A, reached out to me early in school, and at first I was pretty happy, since 1. I was worried about not getting a dorm from Berkeley, and 2. I didn’t think I would find anyone to room with me, since I’m a fairly reclusive person. The rent was cheap, and they seemed fine talking to me, which is a big plus as I’ve had trouble keeping friendly relationships of any sort in the past. (Long story… I’ve been ditched by a lot of people, and the few friendships that remained were fun for me, but they’ve petered out since I left high school. And they weren’t that close to begin with, even if I was able to talk with them about a diverse array of topics. I really miss being able to do that… but that’s neither here nor there, I guess.) So I moved in with them, and two other people I didn’t know. And we’ve been sharing this apartment for a while.

I’d like to say that my time here was all gravy and roses or whatever else, but it really wasn’t. A, B, and C are all pretty friendly with me sometimes—we’ve had conversations that were pretty interesting and fun—but my whole time here has still been tainted with a kind of awkwardness. Sometimes they’re talking and become quiet when I enter the room. To picture it, you can imagine one of those times when someone verbally acknowledges how awkward it is—an “ummm, awkward!” type of mood. It hasn’t gone away over the years, either—if anything, it’s increased. 

Since the first year—probably within the first few months, actually—I knew that the atmosphere would be off. I’m not all that similar to A, B, and C, so I often don’t make conversation with them and vice versa. And Person A, the one who asked me to join the group in the first place, has repeatedly asked me if I might consider finding a studio apartment, saying that it might be a better fit for me. Which is fine, I guess… I told them that I wasn’t able to find a single room apartment I liked the price of to begin with. Except that they’ve brought it up several times since then. Maybe they didn’t remember what I said to them, which again is fine, because I don’t expect everyone to remember everything I say. But I’ve given the same answer again and again, and the last time they brought it up wasn’t that long ago. At this point, it should have stuck, right? I’m just getting an odd feeling about them bringing it up so many times when I’ve repeatedly said that it isn’t monetarily easy for me. And if they do mean it as a pointed hint, I resent that they would try to frame it as a nice thing for me instead of a way for them to get me to leave without feeling like they chased me off. I don’t know if this is my pessimism talking or not. 

A few days ago, Person A “officially” told me that they were all planning to split up. (That was actually the last time they talked with me about potentially finding a studio apartment. They even offered to help me look along with the other roommates.) Now, that’s fine with me. People split up all the time and find new roommates, and we’ve been together for two years. But… they had already kind of been talking about splitting up before consulting me. I would be doing my homework in the room I share with Person B, and one of them would kind of just wander in and talk with the other about their plans for leaving. I did actually confront them about this later, but they said that they hadn’t made concrete plans, so they didn’t tell me before they solidified their ideas. (Looking back, I guess that’s reasonable. No need to tell me stuff that hasn’t been set in stone yet. But as the fourth renter… I really would have liked to know if even one of them was considering, just because it would shake up the apartment a little). Even then, I don’t think that’s necessarily malicious, but that night I kind of heard them discussing together in a hushed sort of tone in the living room. It stood out to me because they’re usually pretty loud when they talk together, and I overheard Person A talking about the conversation I had with them, regarding me eventually finding a studio apartment. I wouldn’t normally think that’s weird, but the hushed voices… that stood out to me as odd. They really don’t talk that quietly, even when I’m doing the same sort of thing I usually do away from them—studying, entertainment. They moved away from that topic and immediately resumed conversation with louder voices, so I assume it had to do with the topic and not some bizarre sudden respect for me potentially studying. (Days after my midterms, which they asked me about.) That kind of was the final straw for me. It seems so little when I write it out, but I really dislike my living situation, etc. being talked about by others while I’m not involved in the conversation. Even if Person A might have provided a reason for them to talk about it with the “helping me find a new apartment” thing, the hush-hush thing is still weird to me. Would there ever be a good reason to keep your voice down while talking in a group about another person’s apartment situation? Especially if they lived with you and were presumably distracted? I definitely was not aware that they were talking about me until I noticed the change in their tone. 

I know my roommate situation could be a lot worse… but I also kind of wish I hadn’t jumped at the first person to offer me housing. Even if it was a lot easier than trying to find a single apartment by myself. Even if I was pretty friendly with them, and thought it was as good a deal as I might get. I just want to wash my hands of them already, but I really don’t want to uproot myself in the midst of a semester. (Plus, it would be awkward to explain to my family why I’m leaving a supposedly stable roommate situation for a single.) And I would honestly feel bad about leaving the three of them to pay rent by themselves. I so badly wish I could just teleport or something out of here into a nice single room apartment so I can get the stress of my living situation out of my mind, because I have so much stress already. But I know it’s not like it’ll be better for me to leave before the time we’re splitting up. (I imagine if I were to explicitly talk to them about any of this, they would see it completely differently. Not to mention how much more awkward it would get for the next two or so semesters I’m spending with them. As I’m writing this, I’m remembering that Person B helped me make a program for generating random strings of DNA/RNA just a week or so ago, so I feel both guilty and upset.)

If anyone has comments, or suggestions, or commiseration to offer, please reply.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my lease ends sometime May next year. I talked with them a little about leaving early, and that’s what they responded with.","I'm going to be brutal about this. 
Your roommates don't want you to be their roommate any longer.
Staying in this living arrangement isn't going to get any better for you or them.
It's high time you seek alternative living quarters by the end of the semester if at all possible.
Sorry for being so blunt.
It may be awkward, but I think you should politely confront them on why they don’t want to live with you. Maybe you have done something unintentionally or maybe it’s something else that has nothing to do with you. I think it’s good for you to clarify this so you can know.
Sorry to hear about your housing situation. Just as a thought, you can apply for on campus housing, the co-ops, and reach out to the basic needs center for different options for housing. You could also try to sublease your room for the spring semester, lots of international exchange students start looking early.
I suspected as much. I really don’t want to move around during the semester, though. And I didn’t mention this in my post, but our lease ends at the end of the spring semester, so I would still have to pay rent (as far as I know). Money is an issue for me.
I don’t think it will work out if they’re potentially talking about me behind my back. Actually, I’m not really interested in the reasons anymore, no matter what they might be… the fact that one person kind of presented the idea of splitting to me instead of having a more open discussion really rubs me the wrong way. Even in the best case scenario, I doubt they’d want to stay with me after I cast such suspicion on them… not to mention it’ll be even more awkward. Thank you for replying, though—I do appreciate you taking your time to do so.
I actually left on-campus housing because it wasn’t letting me through, so I’m not sure if I should apply again. Definitely going to consider a co-op… isn’t the rent sometimes like $750? Less than what I was paying with these people 😂

Thanks for the advice!
Well then, you are stuck until the end of the lease unless your roommates agree that you can find another person to move in so you can leave.  Or they agree to find another roommate to replace you.

It sounds from your description of things that said roommates have been discussing this among themselves and not been speaking with you openly or honestly.  But you second guessing them and yourself doesn't work either.  

Someone needs to be direct in their communication to resolve the issue(s) here so all can move on.
Yeah, I talked to them and asked (well, more like told) them to keep me in the loop. They said they would, so… not sure what else I can do. Except maybe start looking for apartments immediately and confront them again when I’ve lined something up + checked the landlord’s policies + told my parents about the situation.
Sounds like you're getting some good advice here. Keep following up on any leads. I think you'll find a better situation pretty soon."
The Top 7 Tips For New Berkeley Students That Your GBO Counselor Won't Tell You,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i6x485/the_top_7_tips_for_new_berkeley_students_that/,2020-08-09 20:12:56,"There are still two weeks before school starts, and this sub is already polluted with hundreds of threads by new Cal students asking silly questions like “wHaT iS dA haWdeSt mAyJor aT cAl ??!? (aLsO cAn u suCC mE sMaLL wEe-weE)” We get it freshman / transfers: you’re ready to begin your transformation from an omega to a Chad or Stacy. But if you want to truly become known as a BerkeleyChad™ or CalStacy®, you need to ask the ***right*** questions. Your nerdy EECS GBO leader reciting their nonexistent sexual history over Zoom isn’t going to help you, so here are 7 tips to give you a head start over your peers. 

1. While at Cal, you’re gonna hear many people discuss the myth surrounding 4.0 hill; how, if one rolls down said hill, one is guaranteed to get a 4.0 that semester. Sounds like an amazing deal right? Well folks, I’ve tried this one a couple of times, and it may as well be called 2.76 hill. However, a magic guru with a beard longer than Santa’s told me the true secret behind 4.0 hill: you have to roll down it in the rain. I tried out this man’s theory and it works people. If you want to guarantee that your parents will be proud of you, roll down that hill when it’s at it’s wettest. 

2. So you’re listening to your first online lecture on Zoom, and you have a question for the professor. Now most people will go about saying “Professor Hippo” or “Doctor Elephant,” but you won’t, because you’re an alpha. Instead, address them as “Monsieur Hippo” or “Madame Zebre,” because all Chad’s and Stacy’s know it’s classier to address someone in French (despite the general pretentiousness and smelliness of the French). 

3. Another myth you’re going to hear a lot about is Berkeley time, where classes are “supposed” to start 10 minutes after the hour. Now, this is simply a trick used to identify all of the plebeians (aka freshman) at the beginning of the semester. In reality, all classes start 15 minutes after the hour, not 10. If you don’t want to be called a goober for the rest of the semester (and have your hard-earned reputation ruined), always show up 15 minutes past the hour, and never before. 

4. A couple of weeks into school, you’ve decided to break COVID regulations (since those are only for the nerdiest of omega’s) and go to a frat party. However, you quickly realize that you can’t get in, since you don’t know any other chads yet. Never fear, mon garçon! All frats use the same codeword to identify other chads: simply walk up to the normie at the front and say “I’ll give you a nickel if you tickle my pickle.” Don’t look at them after; simply proceed forward like the Chad you are, and nobody will bother you for the rest of the party. 

5. Eventually, you’ll need to use the restroom during class. Most people will say that you need to ask permission before leaving the lecture hall / zoom call. This is simply an attempt to troll you: pay no heed to these muppets. The only time you ever need to ask permission before using the bathroom is if you need to take a fat dump. In such a circumstance, raise your hand and say “Monsieur/Madame, I must excrete my fecal matter into the nearby lavatory,” and walk out. 

6. The official pajama day at Cal is October 31st. “But that’s Halloween!” some of you will exclaim, “I’m supposed to dress up as my favorite My Little Pony!” Listen up alphas: nobody actually cares about Halloween. To prove that you truly don’t care, simply wear your pajamas all day and, if anyone asks, say that you’re dressed as their mom/dad. That way, you can truly assert your authority as a Chad / Stacy. 

7. Many individuals (both men and women) at Berkeley are attracted to people who sniff loudly. If you really want to look alpha, sniff as loudly and frequently as possible in order to assert your dominance over the other Chad’s and Stacy’s in the room. Think of the classroom like an elephant seal harem: there’s only room for one alpha, but if you become the alpha the entire room will technically belong to you. If you hear someone else competing, be sure to increase the decibel level of your sniffs (there was a rumor spreading last year that a student actually snorted like a pig throughout the entire semester in order to remain the alpha). 

So there you have it kids: 7 tips that’ll propel you to the top of the Berkeley social hierarchy. Follow these steps precisely, and soon you’ll officially join the BerkeleyChad™ and CalStacy® club and never have to see your dummy GBO counselor again.","[deleted]
> classes are “supposed” to start 10 minutes after the hour.  

My breadth class that I'm taking this summer starts *on the dot :((.* Showed up 10 minutes late and was blasted :(
do you prefer a sharp acute sniff or one that is long and drawn out
Is it bad that I can’t even tell if this is supposed to be sarcastic or not?
Same thing for eating in class! If you ever need to grab sth to eat, you gotta raise your hand and announce to the class what you're gonna eat, and how many people you're willing to share it with.
I took cs 70 over the summer and my discussion GSI literally took off attendance points because someone went to the restroom without using the ""raise hand"" function first.

They really don't fuck around with that shit
Pretty sure that's actually against school policy lol
Maybe it's changed since I graduated but Berkeley Time definitely was a thing a few years ago. All my classes started at 10 after the hour.
See that's the thing - if, in a small section, my prof asks us to come early as a one off thing (we're a bit behind and still need to take a quiz"") - so be it. But as a semester long policy the people that do that can fuck off
It's not unfortunately :( 
especially for online discussions. They always start on the dot for me.
All of my other classes start 10 after the hour. But it's just this one class that's annoying smh

Sophomore Golden Bear Orientation Fee (Also Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 Transfers),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/py228l/sophomore_golden_bear_orientation_fee_also_fall/,2021-09-29 11:55:37,"Doesn’t anyone find it sus how we (Sophomores and Fall 2020/Spring 2021 Transfers) literally had to pay around $400 for the mandatory New Student Programming Fee, and all we got were Zoom meetings? NSS said they were considering an in-person element for us, but they pretty much dropped it and just asked us to have a random meet up one day. They didn’t even bother to put any effort in organizing anything lmao

Our New Student Programming Fee was not much less than the recent admits, and yet they had a full on carnival, light show at the Campanile, free lunch/dinner every single day, and a bunch of other stuff that costs a lot of money. They obviously deserved it, but so do we.

There is no way our entire \~$400 New Student Programming Fee was spent on Zoom meetings. If anything, it for sure saved them money since they literally spent pennies on the dollar on us. Zoom meetings cost next to nothing to set up, while setting up a physical location does.

They should allow us to have a complimentary GBO in the Spring, with just the in-person social aspects, like icebreakers, having lunch/dinners with our GBO group, go on hikes to the Big C, walking around Berkeley, the carnival, light show, convocation at California Memorial Stadium, and whatnot. The New Student Programming Fee that we already paid should go towards it.

I swear, I’m never donating to UC Berkeley in the future as an alumni if New Student Services keeps on pushing us aside. If we don’t get an in-person GBO, consider the \~$400 New Student Programming Fee for the Zoom meetings as my donation.

PS: I appreciate all of the volunteer GBO leaders that tried to make GBO special during Zoom university <3 This post is directed to NSS Administration, not you guys :)","When I transferred to Cal a few years ago, I remember I thought the price of Orientation week was insane even when it was in person.

Thanks! What did you think of the workload (hours/week, excluding lecture)
i took it fall 2020 with knobloch and reinsch; average time spent for people was around 20 hrs a week, but it was a particularly hard semester since the profs didn't balance the pset difficulty well
I see. Is that usually the case with either of these profs? I hope to spend around 10-15 hours per pset, 20 is quite a lot
Reinsch’s psets tend to take far less time, usually 10hrs.  Knoblochs were much harder, but they eventually lowered the work load by reducing the number of problems so I’m guessing psets won’t be that long
Depends on who's teaching, but I did fine in 105 with 12-15 hours of commitment."
depressed bear needs advice & help,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uomip0/depressed_bear_needs_advice_help/,2022-05-13 00:45:13,"hello, i’m currently majoring in Psych and i recently made the decision that i’d like to go into the pre-med route to do clinical psychology (i’d like to be a child psychiatrist). i’ve been really muddled career-wise for the longest time and this is the first decision i’ve made that i’m pretty serious about. i aim to go to postbacc some time after graduating. 

However, i’m realizing that this is a HUGE commitment in the long-run, and i’m starting to question if i would do well enough in that route. 

i recently came back from academic dismissal half a year ago at Cal and my GPA is so low (2.0). i have a year left here to raise it up but in light of finals right now, i didn’t reach my goal of getting the best grades. i’m not really sure, but it looks like I’m getting one A, potential B (this could change to C+ -- i JUST took the final an hour ago), and a C+ (this C+ was unexpected). 

i have depression, which was the reason i was dismissed, and it’s been hard outreaching for help/counseling/therapy due to financial and accessibility reasons. i'm already connected to DSP, which helps astronomically.

how i’m handling school coupled with my depression is starting to make me doubt if i'm even capable of following through with being a potential practitioner.

i have to be realistic, because i need to be a competent candidate if i want to go to postbacc. but i have a poor GPA, no relevant clinical hours, and feeling like a complete loser despite my attempts to want to do more. it's an extremely hard road to hoe, financially and mentally. 

it's not to say that i haven't made progress with being depressed. in fact, i've done MORE than i thought i ever could despite the hardship. i dropped out & got back in -- that MUST mean something for me. i'm more dedicated to my studies than i was initially. 
i'm changing, but i don't believe i'm changing enough that i'm fit to run with the other dogs in the medical race. i don't even come close stats-wise.

i'm proud to be a Bear, it's an immense honor to attend here. i like what i'm learning, but i don't know how much more help i need in this school to succeed other than the obvious ""you should really get that depression checked out"".

and despite my shortcomings, i still want to be a child psychiatrist. the vision of aiding our future and their mental health fulfills me. i could do that in other ways, sure. but i think i'm smart enough, and i want to challenge me. i just can't go through this life without trying. but is this too much to ask of myself? idk. right now i'm not feeling so hot about my abilities and what i am now. 

i'm unable to voice this to anyone in my life because i don't want them to believe i'm faltering. in the grand scheme of things, i'm really scared. the hand i'm holding is just myself, and i'm scared. 

any technical advice or general support to a small Bear in this vast world is greatly appreciated. 
to any students who are dreading finals, i'm sorry & i get it. you got this. 

_________________________________________________________

(a joke to lighten the mood: damn, ain't got no clinical hours, no A's, no money, AND no bitches??? bruh.)","First off, take a second to be proud of yourself. As you said, you have become much more dedicated to your studies and now you at least have a goal in mind. You have made tremendous progress already and now, it's all about keeping the progress rolling.  


Now, I don't know much about your specific situation or the exact path to becoming a child psychiatrist, but I do know that paths in the medical race vary quite a bit. Others may have a headstart on you now and you need to evaluate if you can realistically finish the things you need to get done. For example, lots of people get clinical hours and experience for a year or so after graduating before going into further studies. And also, goals change so just because one path will not work out doesn't mean a different one won't pique your interest or give you stability. Personally, I've also found the Career Center to be really helpful in giving more specific career guidance so that could be a potential option.  


Keep going, you got this!
In my experience, we tend to overemphasize our setbacks and tribulations. Your situation is probably not nearly as dire as it seems, (in terms of the distance between where you are now and where you want to be). 

And in terms of your question of whether or not you should pursue a path in clinical psychology, I think you should try to pursue a postbacc, but not at the expense of your mental health if it ever comes between the two. And if your performance, (while in the process of pursuing your degree), falls short of what you envisioned or the goals that you set for yourself, don't worry. That's usually what happens when people try to extend themselves to new heights, we fall short because our expectations are exceptionally high, but we achieve a tremendous amount of progress in the process, which you attested to yourself.

Good Luck!💙💛💙💛💙💛 I'm rooting for you☺️
This is a slightly shorter path to a career that would let you help kids with mental health issues. https://www.allnursingschools.com/specialties/psychiatric-nurse/
You can work while increasing your certifications and scope of care as a nurse. NPs can prescribe just like psychiatrists. 

Whichever route you choose I wish you the best. The world needs people like you in roles like this. Who better to care for kids struggling with depression than someone succeeding against all odds?
PsyD is less rigorous than a PhD, lots of programs will take your money happily and then you can practice
hello! thank you for reminding me to be proud :’). you’re probably right. i realize i’ll still be okay even if im not able to achieve right away postgrad. i can still accomplish it later in my life & i could go many ways about it. 

i have long ways to go, but i would not want to sacrifice my mental health. i will seek the career center later this summer to get a bit more direction. thank you!
hello! thank you so much for your reassurance. i definitely am somewhere different than i was before & perhaps this pressure is the consequence of wanting to extend to new heights. i’ll try with what i got! 
thanks for rooting for me!! i’m sure i’ll get there alright! much love :)
wow this is incredibly helpful, thank you! i would love to consider this in the future. it’s great to know i have this option! 

and thank you so much for saying that, really, it actually means a lot to me to hear. :’) to against all odds!!
California recently funded a special program run by UC Davis, UCLA and UCSF to train more mental health nurses to try to provide resources in the rural parts of the state. I don’t know exactly what that career path would look like but it might feel more practical than an MD plus Psych doctorate. The military also has programs and funding."
"Is taking CS188, CS170, and Data 100 doable?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hwhpu4/is_taking_cs188_cs170_and_data_100_doable/,2020-07-23 08:33:21,"I’m currently a rising senior and I’ve been thinking about taking CS170, CS188, and Data 100 in the same semester; I’ve heard that the workload for Data 100 and CS 188 is not super high, although I’ve also heard that 188 has gotten harder and 100 is deceptively difficult. It’s also worth mentioning that I’m not the highest achiever in my technical classes (received one C+ freshman year, and B’s up until now), but I’m reasonably confident now, and I never really was before. 

If the workload isn’t too bad, I was also even planning on taking two courses at the local community college alongside the Berkeley schedule, but wasn’t sure if that was a good idea. What do you all think?","I think it’s doable if you don’t have any other task that is significantly time-consuming like internship or a tough breadth class. They are all challenging classes but workload-wise they are okay unlike say 162 or other coding-heavy classes. (Well 170 is heavy but if you can keep up with the lecture it’s not that time consuming doing problem sets. IIRC I spent less time on 170 pset than 70 ones cuz the questions are more standard and less tricky)

Judging from your grades in lower div I honestly think you can get decent grades in these classes, but maybe lower your expectation as It would be hard to get straight A’s doing these classes together. Apologize if it comes off a bit harsh. Wish you good luck next semester!
What have you taken before and what have you gotten in them?
Have taken: 
CS61A: C+ 
Cs61B: B 
CS70: B 
Data8: A- 
Math 54: B

As you can see I hover usually around the B-range, but my freshman year was definitely an adjustment period. I’m also an intended Data Science major and existing Cognitive Science major, so I don’t necessarily need A’s in these classes, but I did want some exposure to these concepts.
Whats the hardest you've taken in a single semester?  if u took 61ab + 70 in diff semesters then doing 188 170 100 in same semester is a bad plan
CS70 was the hardest thus far; I took all of them in different semesters. I guess I should just stagger them then. In your opinion, which is the best class to postpone for another semester?
I think taking Data 100 before CS188 might be helpful since there's some overlap towards the end of the class
I second this, I'm taking 188 in the fall after I took Data100 this past spring."

Even if you’re planning to go to med school, law school, continue your education in any way, there are many indicators beyond GPA that can redeem you (like entrance exams), you still have time to do research (see URAP or cold email a prof — the latter sounds intimidating but it does work!) or join a club, and beyond all this, your resulting overall GPA sounds like it’s going to be really solid anyway. I’ve also heard across schools, grad admissions are aware that Berkeley is tough and a lower-GPA candidate with strong essays, scores, and/or interviews will still be competitive with those who have higher GPAs from lower-tier schools.

The only honors societies to shoot for are Phi Beta Kappa (for L&S / weird CoE majors) or Tau Beta Pi (for less weird CoE majors).
Hey, I'm apart of NSLS at UC Berkeley.  The society basically offers its members access to a leadership development program as well as a lot of member benefits, such as access to a job bank and to scholarships.  Like anything, you get out of it what you put into it.  Let me know if I can answer any other questions you might have
HKN for EECS.
That too.

In general: nationally recognized and undisputed honor societies for a specific profession are worth considering. EECS has HKN, IEOR has APM, MechE has PTS, CS (L&S) has UPE, etc...

""The National Society of Leadership and Success"" (NSLS) doesn't fit into the categories above because it is too broad; the only honor society of comparable breadth is PBK, but PBK is far and away a bigger deal than ""NSLS""."
Should I fulfill my GE credits at a local community college or at UC Berkeley?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d06cl4/should_i_fulfill_my_ge_credits_at_a_local/,2019-09-05 13:29:59,"Hi, I'm an incoming freshman spring admit and I'm in a dilemma:

Should I take courses at my local community college over fall semester to catch up on GE credits?

Or

Should I wait until next summer to take summer classes at UC Berkeley?

&#x200B;

Thanks!

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all the replies! I’ve decided to start on my GE requirements at a local CC! It’d be cheaper than taking summer classes at Berkeley and mean for a less stressful 2020 summer.","Unless you have something better to do, I would definitely take say 3 classes (maybe more) at a CC to cover your breadths, AC or other requirements such as an English reading and composition class.  You basically will save almost $7K is the way to look at it.  (\~$500 tuition for a semester worth of classes as opposed to $7K at Berkeley, and it's actually more since presumably you would stay at home).  I would do an English class, an International breadth and an Arts and Literature breadth that's combinable with a American Cultures fulfillment.  Throw in a Calculus class if you need it.

What intended major are you?  What AP credits or Dual Enrollment (if any) do you have?
Hey there! As a spring admit some years back, I knocked out some GE requirements at my local CC during the fall and felt great about the decision. Saves money, had no problem making friends in the spring when I started up, etc. 

&#x200B;

You may have to take summer classes eventually anyway... but if you don't take the CC classes now, then you'll need to cram more units into less time for more money (summer courses cost more). Why force yourself into that kind of stress? If you start college with the plan that you'll HAVE to take summer classes no matter what, then you've robbed yourself of time that is meant to be your vacation and could be some of the best days of your undergraduate experience.
One more thing to help you out - just in case you didn’t know how breadth classes work, you want to strive for double-dipping and take only those breadths that you unlikely won’t double dip.  So for example, in your case, you won’t need to take a Philosophy breadth because undoubtedly at Cal you’ll take PHILOS 12 - Intro to Logic, which doubles as a Philosophy breadth and required Logic area class.  Similarly, it is likely your History and possibly Arts/Literature breadths will be covered by required classes as well.  So in your case taking a Biological breadth or International breadth at the CC may make a lot of sense since it might be unlikely your normal courses over the next 4 years will cover those.

Make sure to use assist.org for your specific CC, match it up to Berkeley, and open up the General Education/Breadth Agreement to find all the courses that will satisfy the breadths you are interested in.  Courses taken that are not on the list won’t count as a breadth.
hey i came upon this thread and i wanted to ask if the grade you get on a cc course matters for transferring credits or does it just matter that you pass? I'm already enrolled at Berkeley and I wanted to take Physics 7a at my local CC but given my internship and part time job I'm struggling to maintain an A in the class and i don't know if that means I won't be able to get credit for the course
I’m intending to do a philosophy major; a bit undecided rn though. I’ve got AP credits from Calculus AB + BC, European history, Language + Literature, Psychology, Chem, US History.
Yeah I think you’re right. I probably don’t want to be cramming classes during my summer vacation. And the level of education I’m getting for my GE classes shouldn’t be too different between Berkeley and my local CC. Thank you for your reply. With your answer, I’m feeling more confident in my choice to first take classes at a CC!
Omg, that’s actually really smart. Thank you for the advice! I’ll keep double dipping in mind when I make my course selections at CC :)

Also, one last brain dead question if you don’t mind: does it matter whether you take honors courses or not at CC? From what I’ve heard, it shouldn’t matter so long as the credits are transferable, but I just wanted a second supporting opinion to make sure. Thanks!
No, your grade in your local cc course doesn’t factor into your GPA. Local cc courses don’t earn grade points, so as long as you pass your cc class, you’ll get the transfer unit credits without any impact on your UC Berkeley GPA. I got the information from these website if you want to learn more:

nice!  If you got 5's in BC and Lit, you should be waived for Math 1A/1B and the 2 R&C classes.  Or even if you didn't get 5's you probably have Math 1A and the first English R&C covered.  Unfortunately your other AP classes won't do much else for you.  

Yeah, I would take care of some of the breadths and/or the 2nd Calc class/2nd English class if your APs didn't cover.  Make sure you use [assist.org](https://assist.org) to match up your CC classes to transferrable classes at Berkeley.  IMO you don't get that much value-add taking non-STEM breadths at Berkeley.  The value-add comes from your major's classes.
I think the main (and only) reason why you might want to take Honors class(es) is to go more in-depth in the course material.  It might make some sense for a Cal student like yourself to explore/take an Honors CC class rather than potentially being unmotivated.  I might even recommend this for math classes.  For example, if you were to take Calculus 3 (Multivariate Calculus) at a CC there's a good possibility that the regular class might bore you to tears, if you got a 5 in AP Calc BC. In either case, the credits transfer over just the same, it's not like you would get extra credits or anything like that for Honors.
Ahh gotcha! Unfortunately, i got a 4 on Lit and Comp, so I guess that’s another class for me. I’ll definitely look into assist.org and plan my class schedule. As of right now, I’m planning on taking Engl R1B and an international studies breadth class (maybe more once I do a bit more research) Though out of curiosity, why do you recommend around 3 classes?
oh, re: the 3 classes, usually that's the equivalent of what they tell you to do your first semester at Berkeley - to take no more than 13 units, which is usually 3 classes plus a DeCal.  But you could do 4 or 5, it's up to you if you can handle it.  I'm sure for non-technicals, 4 or 5 is probably no big deal.
Ah gotcha, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for your help!"
Anyone taking data8 this semester,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e27c51/anyone_taking_data8_this_semester/,2019-11-26 16:12:49,I got 76/99 on first midterm (worth 15%) and I didn’t do well on project 1 and 2(like 74-80%)  and this semester the 3 projects worth 25% of total grade. I think my composite score for this class is like slightly below 25th percentile. Am I gonna end up like a C?:( should I late drop this class and retake it next semester? I didn’t see any distribution on the website and I am wondering if there is still a possibility to get a B- or above in this class. Any advice is really appreciated!,"This isnt high school! Your raw scores are NOT your final grade in the class. Based on what you said it looks like your on pace for an B+/A- or so
my bad is 25% percentile
[deleted]
>75% percentile

75th percentile would mean you're above 75% of students, so I think you meant to say 25th percentile? Unless you actually are 75th percentile so you're probably going to get an A/A-.

Assuming otherwise, running off what I'm seeing on the [Data 8 website](http://data8.org/fa19/policies.html):

>In past semesters of Data 8, more than 40% of the students received grades in the A+/A/A- range and more than 35% received grades in the B+/B/B- range.

It looks like you're probably good for a B/B-, if you keep pace."

I am going to say hi to the ones while they are here Especially since I'm not at berkeley anymore. So just a friendly reminder to say hi to your professors!

Also adding Professor Karl Hedrick (ME 132) and Professor David Dornfeld (ME 290I).

It is a sinking feeling to say the least that whoever taught you something is no longer with us.
Packard was amazing. Took him for E7 as well as ME132 and he was easily one of my best professors. Great human as well.

Next to passing on what they taught you to others, living on in your memory and appreciation is about the best they (or any of us) could hope for.  But yes, it's wonderful to appreciate them while they are still around to say ""hey"" too.
Had him in a freshman seminar a year before he passed. He was awesome. Even though I kept falling asleep in class because my sleep schedule was fucked up. He was super nice and always tried his best to make class fun and interesting. RIP

Not to sound sappy, but this is kind of literally how they are still with us.

How would industry & business school view P/NP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ki7h66/how_would_industry_business_school_view_pnp/,2020-12-22 07:30:23,"Hi, apologies if this seems like a dumb question. I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kayrdu/by_which_letter_grade_would_you_opt_to_pnp_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about weighing the consequences of PNP for med school. I was wondering if consequences would similarly apply for:

1. swe internships/jobs
2. business school

I would think employers likely wouldn’t interrogate why I chose PNP, because they’re probably much more concerned with actual experience/ECs. Would this similarly apply if I applied to business school later on, or do they also treat grades as strictly as med school (possibly treat a cherry-picked PNP among A’s as C-)?","Most companies don’t care about P/NP, or your grades in general. In fact, I have never been asked for my transcript. There are some companies (Goldman Sachs iirc) that care about GPA, but even then I would assume they care more about the overall GPA and would only look at a transcript to verify the GPA, and not about your performance in each class.
99% of SWE companies don't care for classes and grades. They just use gpa as something they can try to filter applicants out. I would bet they would not even ask since most places don't even ask for transcripts.

Business school on the other hand I would guess that the cherry-picking downside of med school apps apply here. It is really obvious to see that 2 A's and 2 P's(assuming all major requirements not breadths)  means you were in a situation fine to succeed and chose to lighten the load. Now if there is any merit to the reason for PNP you can surely explain that in your app but for most people who want to cherry pick they have no real reason. My guess is it will hurt you to cherry pick for all grad school scenarios since not every school gave the PNP option and not everyone used it. So in a hyper competitive space it is best to take it all for grade
Double bear MBA student here; I can say that I took 6 classes PNP as an undergrad and didn’t get any questions on it during my admissions process. I imagine schools know that fluff-looking PNP are likely just filling breadth requirements and would more or less mirror your performance in other classes, had you taken them for LGs. That said, if you take classes related to your major PNP then I bet you’ll get questions.
Oh wow, thank you for the information. If grades/gpa don’t really matter us much, what have you found the companies you’ve applied to cared about most?
Wow, thank you for the thorough response! Also yeah, the point about competition makes a lotta sense. Even if they publicly say a P won’t adversely affect you, if it’s sitting against a candidate who took it for a grade, clearly one is preferable to the other.
go bears! thanks for sharing. I can definitely see why PNPing major courses would be problematic. Do you think they would be as strict with minor courses?

(I’m pursuing a technical major (CS) and a humanities minor.)
For internships and entry level SWE jobs, companies usually look for interesting side projects and previous internship experience.
That’s a very good question. It might make them view your minor as carrying less weight, but with a strong technical major like CS they won’t be questioning your academic abilities anyway. My gut says you should be fine but I’m in no way 100% certain of that."

Do you think taking CS 70 and Korean 1a at the same time is a bad idea?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uey9n2/do_you_think_taking_cs_70_and_korean_1a_at_the/,2022-04-29 16:20:42,"Even though I used to be good at math, I kind of suck at it now, so I’m pretty prepared for CS 70 to be really hard for me (for reference, the worst grade I have is a C is Math 53, and yes I am a little  embarrassed, thanks for asking :D). 

I’m also a DSP student who struggles with reading heavy courses, so I’m pretty nervous about Korean 1a too. But I still want to take it eventually, because my immigrant father wanted me to have an easy time assimilating and now I can’t communicate with half of my family. 

I’m already enrolled in both classes, so it’s just a matter of choosing weather or not to take on this load. If I do decide to take these classes together, I’ll probably add either Chem 1al or CS61c on top of that. 
Any advice is helpful!! Thanks in advance!!

**Context:**  
This week, transit agency boards are weighing in on whether to support integrated transit fares.  [Integrated fares](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/atcYNHk4Eh2YdGnwBh-YDPBC_2qPv7WKfzKLXVjCZKzk0-OeU4pYT66WrxEcToe294raIOxPT3BPrq4Vd7-QCMQco9EQfSoJw4LLRmBf5gLCl4jZ27J71By-cYsCmNgr8aBkRH2lhk5IBnZ6jb2e2MiaYcyxc1Bcy0bG3U7QnyWpKsSAyJ-TpWg8nKQ8hmaBA9HNQZ6Jk8GpUsYckVMvWf-I4p_GG_kJQpeSG2oA59V0o4VLI_Pq4NRZ_MTyeiq6yhq6zMEue3cqbVZM4uDpGjjZtzKLi9qwGKDFd8UoUQmt4-VRGOMxjgcssqay5JFhbzhkFSaCORIpTAsw7FrWpQfb3xwNpBcGLdWZOm7uAYi1QBlFHeWEJEE0ysE9dwPP8tFoQi1PLHUrwHKYb2BdHTc1iZedsHY2Swt_zZcob1o/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h0/jWPg0KLHMl2zNjWH6NmPZ-QXi4bgzVY6bQdeyK7RHUY) are not only a critical part of a rider-first, seamless transit system but also a cost-effective policy that could help to bring riders back many more riders to transit.

BART’s weekday ridership has been running below 30% and AC Transit local ridership is still less than 50% of pre-Covid levels.

Making transfers free between agencies could add over 25,000 riders, a similar scale as flagship bus routes such as the AC Transit 51 lines; or both downtown Oakland stations together. And standardizing regional fares (BART, Caltrain, ferry, express bus) could help add about 69,000 riders, as many riders as another pre-Covid Caltrain.

As the pandemic eases and people adapt to new travel patterns, the regional fare [study](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/ss/c/tTBUZwcBH_2q13Ow12s-jckP20jWxBj3X4ev8eQSSIy3xELxy-gwghDjaXnqwIlt1qc3-WUcQbb24tZriw_aWbyJoUJH6uXe1zg_DTjXPrYzjCxFA68r3_dgQ_4PgdWuZX-4Fv-CnxgCvpJUmCDpDOH8BsRE0mmFFIqW4x5Xa-Xr5AiHQPENnkbLTmIYNV0ncpt92PVAe6sCNVmPGFotL8Ss1VTJ0zup3Kj-uAjfGmGOTef3McbcqujAVJET3_ZbywB9I_DRIntv2b8JFwchLDeYUUroqZCfTS8QovIsKXtPZnzUpJ-RDuN7KJeDNLRO37H1NBbUETzBXDEETxDLBgtCG7tEXrh5FYO-pY3LljrheBQZVj07kMy7XtvtNZlElvV4hBeeO49UqauFVGfJKJKeLBZmpae1Os01vHgjQqPeVvgak7XLnbOf6YRAXqUnz-2HaDgBKINjVM1ZYnjTOQ/3g2/S8daIensQryPPYcYcWxSPA/h1/BtYecKJOsAwSQvloNA6OUZ_n3J6wtmqo31VeV35x8p4) shows that fare integration can be a powerful strategy to restore transit ridership by making transit more convenient, attracting new riders and new trips.

**What the hell does this mean for Cal?**   
The Campus relies on both AC Transit and BART (as well as others such as SolanoExpress, WestCAT, and MUNI) to commute to the campus. Many students and employees have asked for integrated or discount fares to get around; however, it's rather difficult since Parking & Transportation is a self-funded unit and can only provide as many programs as budgeted (P&T pays out \~$4million annually to AC Transit, the higher education discount through BART would be estimated at  $800K to $1.4 million annually)  


As the development of the campus' master plan and Long Range Development Plan takes shape, as well as a ballot measure to renew the Class Pass in 2023, the campus stands to not only lose parking spaces, [but use this as an opportunity also be partners with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to improve the Clipper Card program](https://mtc.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=878224&GUID=69137C12-A9E3-4ACD-A51A-A9BE55274CDB&link_id=1&can_id=2a9949098c82f89a28e849287240afb5&source=email-this-coming-week-support-seamless-fares-at-sfmta-samtrans-caltrain-ac-transit-bart-2&email_referrer=email_1320093&email_subject=this-week-support-seamless-fares-at-ac-transit-and-bart) by support institutional passes such as EasyPass. It would be also important as we evolve in a post-pandemic world that  the campus, along with the region and state, get serious about environmental impacts due to increased driving and congestion. For students, this means expanded access to jobs and social events in SF, Silicon Valley, and beyond.",
Schedule question for MechE major trying to switch into EECS or CS (plz help),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/okc48i/schedule_question_for_meche_major_trying_to/,2021-07-14 12:50:12,"okay so this is kinda complicated. I am trying to switch into EECS, however my adviser said that they may implement a policy next summer that would disallow anyone from switching into that major. The good thing, though, is that I believe the CS major in L&S has the same requirements (3.3 in CS61A, 61B, and 70), so I am planning to just take those courses and see what happens. So, as a mechE major I have 15 units of technical electives which those courses fall under. I must take 2 technical courses towards my major each semester, so I’m planning on taking this schedule:

Math 53
Film R1B (or an equivalent R&C B course)
CS61A

My question is: will this schedule get an enrollment block, or are both the technicals I’m taking counting towards my major? It has been so hard to get advice on this since my adviser is so hard to contact and hasn’t given me great advice. If you have any other valuable advice plz plz plz lmk.","Umm not sure if the policy is set for sure since my advisor didn't know anything about that. But, regarding your question, yes you will probably have some sort of block for next semester and possibly a restriction from changing your major based on my advisor since you are not taking 2 technical classes in your CURRENT major.
I think your sched is ok since you are taking two techs and both are making progress towards both majors.  CS61A is an allowable elective for ME, so I think that should count. There’s a tiny possibility you may need to add something like Physics 7A or Chem 1A to your proposed Fall sched, in the unlikely event that electives don’t count. But you should definitely check with an ESS advisor.
do technical electives not count as technicals toward your major?
okay thank you so much. Is it crazy to do 3 technical courses or is that a normal thing?
I assume they do. Is 61A a technical elective for MechE?
It really depends on what the combo of classes are, how organized the person taking them is, what grade they are looking for, and if you want to spend your first semester doing a lot of social activities.  Some people have problems taking more than 1 technical, while others take 4 or more with no issues.  Many take the minimum 12 or 13 units, but if you search thru this sub, you’ll see a few students taking 24-28 units.  I would think that CS61A, Math 53 and say Physics 7A is a decent workload, but not anywhere near impossible.
hey did you end up switching in?
Yes

Using several [reputable](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080813163857AARspHD) [s](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079)[o](https://www.uclahealth.org/urology/mens-clinic/penile-implants)[u](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5450)[r](https://sexinfo.soc.ucsb.edu/when-will-my-penis-start-grow)[c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwjEeI2SmiU)[e](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006060217670)[s](https://twitter.com/UCDLoveLab/status/1129865683334905857), I have compiled an official ranking of the average penis size of students at each UC.

**9. Merced: 0.00 inches**

Here is the thing about Merced: it doesn't actually exist. Has anyone ever seen the Merced campus and returned to tell the tale? Sure, there are a couple of vans that skirt around the other UC campuses with ”University of California UCM” proudly slobbered on their sides, and the students at Merced have always vigorously defended the existence of their school, but I challenge any Merced student to give me directions to their school that doesn’t take a paragraph to write.

**8. Berkeley: 3.68 inches**

Berkeley would be much higher up the rankings, but unfortunately they’re seriously let down by the students in the computer science departments. It isn't that the CS and EECS students tend to have smaller pee-pees, because that is simply not true (CS kids are the chaddiest of chads). No, the real problem is that computer science students watch so much hentai that it’s impossible for them to get hard without having four different screens of anime tiddies bouncing up and down and a hentai body pillow sitting in their lap.

**7. Irvine: 3.69 inches**

I have a real problem with Irvine students. All the Irvine kids on tinder always brag about how nice their campus is, the length of their wee-wee’s, and how they did not actually get rejected by UCLA (they just chose to go to a better school). Unfortunately, it is all just a ploy to hide how small and insecure their dicks and egos are. However, the Irvine students certainly make the most of the phrase “it’s not about size, but about how you use it,” considering they're the masters of compensating.

**6. Santa Cruz: 4.20 inches**

The thing about Santa Cruz students is that they do not actually care at all about any type of ranking. Instead of taking lots of Viagra, Santa Cruz kids simply put on their yellow hoodies, lie down somewhere on campus, stick a fat joint into their mouths, and slowly slide along the ground making deep and erotic sounds in order to arouse themselves. This ritual is necessary for the banana slugs to get hard, since the perpetual cloud of weed that hangs over the Santa Cruz campus keeps the students supple and flaccid.

**5. Davis: 4.96 inches**

If you ever wander around the Davis campus, you begin to realize that it really is a cow town: the students literally moo as they slowly meander through the school. At first I thought it was just a ritual similar to Santa Cruz’s, but the sad reality is that Davis kids are so bored that they're always drunk. The Davis students never seem to reach their maximum pee-pee potential due to their drunken state, but at least they have something to show for themselves.

**4. Riverside: 5.39 inches**

Riverside kids have a lot going for them: pretty intense wee-wee’s, nobody cares about what they do, and they're great at exclaiming “rivaside, mothafucka.” Slightly above average is probably the best way to describe Riverside students, and they should be proud that, for the first time, they aren’t second-last on a list ranking the UC’s.

**3. San Diego: 6.33 inches**

Triton sounds a lot like Trojan, but fortunately for San Diego students they actually have something to show for themselves, unlike their pompous LA neighbors. Surfing is proven to increase pee-pee size by at least 10%. However, only half of the school actually surfs; the other half never leave their rooms, preferring to game or game or make fantasy YouTube videos titled “How I got into UCLA.”

**2. Los Angeles: 6.66 inches**

LA kids talk a lot of smack about how they have the biggest wee-wee’s of all the UC’s. Every other day you see another LA student post a picture of their penis on twitter with the caption “longest dong in the west baby haha #yeet #skraa #letsgetit.” However, like most of their delusions regarding their ranking, the reality is that they always have, and always will be, second best (with Chico State taking the top spot).

**1. Santa Barbara: 6.969 inches**

That’s right, the chads and brads that pollute Santa Barbara have the largest pee-pee’s in the UC system. Every SB student has: crazy big muscles, surfs, huge throbbing dicks, and a brain the size of a pea-pea. They don’t have to brag because they have nothing to compensate for, which pushes them up to the top spot.

The most important fact, however, is that $tanford sucks all of our schlongs.","Flawed methodology. You can’t just measure your own dick and declare it the average size for all of Berkeley.
UCSC should be higher up, just because banana slugs canonically have massive penises. A banana slug's penis can exceed the length of its body. The average banana slug penis is as long as the average human penis. And since they're hermaphrodites, every banana slug has one. 

Their species name, dolichophallus, literally translates to ""long penis."" 

They have sex for hours, and both of them get pregnant. It's intense.

Study Advice for a New Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gz0nc1/study_advice_for_a_new_student/,2020-06-08 07:45:44,"Hey, I’m a junior transfer and I decided to sign up for some summer classes though transfer edge. Currently I am enrolled in Data 8, and I’m 35th on the waitlist for CS61A. 
I asked my advisor about this schedule for the 8 week summer sessions, and she said that CS61A is manageable with DATA 8 if I have had extensive programming experience or outside help (such as friend who has taken the course before). I have taken an intro to C++ class and Object Oriented C++ course at my community college, along with knowing HTML/CSS/JavaScript pretty well. I am not sure if I have met the “extensive programming experience” requirements and know the class is primarily taught in Python, so my experience might not be strong enough. Although I am a Data Science Major, I have a ton of friends who are CS majors, so I could reach out to them for tutoring help as well. 

My questions, simply put, are: 
1. Is this schedule manageable given my experience? I have no travel plans this summer and will be staying in my home most of the time due to the “safer at home” orders. 
2. What advice do those who have taken the class before have for incoming students (please specify DATA 8 or CS61A for context)? 
3. A lot of people have told me that CS61A is a weeder class... is this true? 

Thank you for taking time to read this and if you choose to respond. With two weeks coming up until I begin, I want to hit the ground running so I don’t fall behind. 😃","Incoming freshman here so take my words with a grain of salt - I've taken these classes before but that's about as much as my experience goes. 

1. Yes, it's manageable. CS 61A will be much, much harder than Data 8 - the highest level of coding Data 8 uses will be taught within the first few weeks of 61A. But if you spend a lot of time *consistently,* making sure to stay on top of the material, you'll be fine. My only reservation is the lack of in-person help/tutoring/OHs (I used OH extensively when I took both classes), but I'm sure there'll be a solution. 
2. For both CS61A and DATA 8, I'd recommend that you take a look at the ""summer version"" websites for the respective courses from last year ([CS 61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su19/), [DATA 8](http://data8.org/su19/)). Personally, I'd work on 61A material until the 1st project, and if possible, do it by yourself by June 22. For DATA 8, read the textbook! The textbook for data8 is incredibly clear/concise/amazing, with great explanations and lots of examples. If possible, do some labs for Data 8, but if you're having a good time w/61A, Data 8 will be a cakewalk. 
3. Yes, it's true. CS(61A+61B+70) are the 3 weeder classes for CS majors, and thus, they are incredibly competitive. *However,* in the summer, it might not be as bad, as people who are serious about wanting to declare might choose to take it over the semester at a slower pace (tho some might choose to give it their best in the summer). Also, there are lots of visiting students and high schoolers who might not be able to cope with the Berkeley rigor (source: I took 61A as a rising junior in high school. Please don't do that lmao), and they might possibly lower the curve in favor of students who are on the borderline A-/B+ range.
How did you get in contact with an advisor as a transfer student? I was told we have to wait until July to talk to an advisor.
Thank you so much for your comment! It’s super helpful!!! Thank you for also including your own experience as well. 😃
Sorry if I’m being ignorant but, how have you taken these classes already if you’re an incoming freshman? Genuinely curious. But also, that’s impressive!
[deleted]
She reached out to me telling me that she had space in Data 8 summer sessions to add some incoming students if we choose to take it. I wanted to take another class as well so she suggested we had an advising appointment just for Summer to talk it over :).
No problem! Feel free to pm me if you have any questions regarding the courses; I've been a lab assistant for both of them :)
I've gotten that question before, no worries haha. I was looking for a summer program, and my friend (who was then a junior year) recommended Berkeley's Pre-College scholars program; I did 61A as a rising junior in high school. I loved it here (and it officially became my dream school), so I came back last year to be a lab assistant for 61A, and did Data 8 :)
Some of that intuition can be built from attending lectures (seeing how the computer steps through code), through homeworks, labs, and projects. The key thing here is to not procrastinate, do every assignment, and start them early so you can ask for help if needed. Since 61A exams are a bit weird/puzzle-like, the best way to prep for them is to do a lot of practice exams from online - there are more than 20 midterms/finals available, so resources aren't a problem. 

Really, the only thing is practice - if homeworks + labs  + projects aren't enough, there are tons of resources online :)"
UC physical campus tier list,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u5scg1/uc_physical_campus_tier_list/,2022-04-17 10:54:09,"hi! class of 2026 here. i only applied to UCs and got into all of them (except UCB lol). i was able to do a campus tour of all the UCs and i wanted to report on my impression of each campus 

C tier 

UC Merced 

Campus is really small. (as expected) Gave me high school vibes. It’s located literally in the middle of nowhere. Campus is even far away from the city of Merced. Buildings were new and nice, but at the same time architecturally boring. Like I said, the campus is really small and the only photogenic place is the nearby lake, which is pretty cool. The barren brown grassland around campus was a bit eerie and made me feel lonely. 

UC Santa Cruz

I was excited because of the thought of a unique nature campus, but the execution was a complete disaster. Campus is very spread apart into different colleges, but the connectivity/walkability btw each area is quite terrible. Architecturally, buildings were small and nothing stood out to me. A major pro was the nature itself, which was very pretty. The most photogenic places were trees. 

B Tier 

UCSD

The biggest campus I’ve been to. It was massive, too massive in my opinion. Campus architecture felt so STEM. Most buildings were dull, uncolored, and lifeless. There are too many huge roads cutting up areas of campus. Campus organization is a huge unaesthetic sprawl. The shining crown was the Geisel library and views of the ocean hands down. Surround areas were mostly residential and there wasn’t a college town atmosphere.

UCI

Campus was unified around a huge park, which was kinda cool. Landscape at UCI was very well kept and nice. Architecture was a huge let down, as most buildings were unimaginative (blocky) and too beige. No seriously, everything was blindingly beige, except this one horrid turquoise building. Campus also had too many parking spaces, which are just not nice to look at. I liked the Langson library bc it was the most unique building on campus. The surrounding area is highly residential and feels stale.

UCR 

Campus was unified around the clock tower and UCR logo, which are well placed. Architecturally nothing stood out. I couldn’t find a building tht was unique or somewhere I wanted to take pictures at. Buildings were kinda stale and run down. Overall very cohesive campus and walkable. A major con is that there is a MASSIVE freeway touching a whole side of campus. Also the surrounding area was hella sketchy.

UCD

Campus is very quaint and cute, just like the city. I can tell the campus is catered towards bikes bc there are hella bikes roads around campus. Architecture of campus is nothing to write home about and most buildings are not bad, but nothing outstanding. I’d say I really like how connected campus was to Davis and the cohesiveness of the campus. 

A Tier

UCSB 

I loved the campus. I loved how the architecture matched the beach vibes. All buildings looked the same style. One of the most cohesive campuses I’ve been to. Everything felt together. Views and beachside access to the ocean were the highlights. Campus was extremely walkable. Only con is that there isn’t really much connection to SB itself. 

S Tier

UCB 

Had an ivy feel to campus. I liked the classical style buildings, which were super regal, unique and aesthetic. Also their clock tower is hands down magnificent. I really loved the inclusion of Norcals redwoods in the Eucalyptus forest on campus, as well as a creek running across campus. The city of berkeley gave off an exciting college town vibe. A highlight was being able to see SF, the bay, and the golden gate bridge from campus. Some cons were that some of the buildings didn’t have the same architectural unity as other parts of campus and were old (makes sense bc its the oldest). Also the city of berkeley, like any city, is kinda dirty. 

UCLA 

The architectural unity of the campus is so amazing. Roads were paved amazingly and cater only to pedestrians. There’s no ugly roads cutting across campus like UCSD. Their older building core is super pretty and is as unique as UCB’s. The surrounding area of Westwood is super boujee. Campus is well maintained and is definitely one of the prettiest campuses ever. The cohesiveness of campus and location of dorms is very admirable. You definitely feel the Socal vibes on campus and the atmosphere was warm. In terms of the physical campus, nothing negative you can really say.","There are small parts of Berkeley specifically south of campus that one could consider as dirty. Most of the city is quite nice though.  It’s in an integrated urban setting, different than the other UC campuses.
> Also the city of berkeley, like any city, is kinda dirty.

I love Berkeley but this feels like kind of an understatement.
Completely agree on UCSB and UCLA. Both outstanding campuses but UCSB with the proximity to the beach and the mountains is in a better setting whereas UCLA is the better physical campus for sure.

Very keen to check out UCB on Cal Day. I'm glad your perception of the campus is much better than what I've heard from my Berkeley High friends.
UCSB gives me HS vibes, it’s just an open plan, no architectural styling, only plus was the beach…. Kinda like the people LOL
Agree except UCLA (which I live about a mile from currently). Way too corporate and spread out. Hard to grasp at a community level. I was student and staff at UCB — that’s what a campus looks like!
Yeah this is fair. It’s an eclectic campus, lots of variety and different architectural styles. I like it compared to a school like Stanford where all the buildings look more or less the same. That said, not every style is gonna be a hit. There are some eyesores. Like Evans. Fuck Evans.
I feel like you understated UCI's park, also... too much parking??
architectural unity is overrated berkeley easily has the most interesting campus for this reason
Good reviews, I agree with most of them. Honestly my biggest gripe with berkeley right now is the fact that the paved streets through campus are run down and ugly. I’d love to see them replaced with some brick streets
UCSB >>>> UCB campus, & I literally go here

Sorry but UCSB campus is so fucking nice, also big urban cities are very overrated and are only nice in theory in practice I really am not a fan (IK SB is a city, but it’s a different feel from LA or Berkeley)
Love Berkeley and its campus, my only nitpick is that the campus has a weird, depressed vibe
The only other UC campus that I’ve been to is UCLA, and I agree that the campus is S tier. As a Berkeley student, I would rank UC Berkeley as B or C tier. 

I was very underwhelmed when I first toured the campus. We started at the southern entrance, and I remember wondering when we would get to the actual campus. Once my group got to Memorial Glade (located near the center), I thought to myself “That’s it? This is the campus?”.  I thought it looked like a parking lot. I have a better appreciation for the campus now. I may have had too high expectations back then. 

The good news is that there are some upcoming projects to add more green spaces to the campus. Evans Hall (unattractive math building), will get removed due to earthquake instability and get replaced by recreational buildings (from what I’ve heard)
yeah the day i stop finding used condoms and raw sewage on the streets is when UCB campus goes to S
I'm also an incoming bear and  I visited the campus two weeks ago. I had high hopes and it definitely lived up to them. Really liked the overall vibe I was getting and after that  I decided to commit.
yeah i didn’t like UCSB too much… lots of concrete… didn’t feel cohesive…
Lmaooo what??? Ur just hating at this point… UCLA is known to be small and compact.
[removed]
like idk why they didn’t build a multi story parking instead of having a quarter of campus for parking
Wonder how well brick streets would fare with all the hills tho
IMO the UCSB buildings are quite bland and boring.. Theres not one building like Wheeler or Doe. 

Even the big grass areas, Cal (Memorial glade) > UCSB (area with all the science labs).

Awesome. I hope to join you at Cal. Just need to have a good visit.

I haven’t been inside UCSB (no guided tours during covid) I was just really impressed by the outside & the beach
Exactly. I went to UCSB and never liked the campus. It felt like a giant community college and got smaller and smaller every quarter. And while it’s on the beach, it’s still very much isolated ( I know I became a bit stir crazy after the first year and a half ).
Well, I guess the grass is always greener on the other side, but when I visited I loved their campus

I'm guessing that from the seats they won't be able to see the actual person on stage as there will be something obstructing their view.

Conditional Admission Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mybvrf/conditional_admission_question/,2021-04-25 09:33:25,"Hello, I was recently accepted as a Transfer student from another UC to the UC Berkeley College of Letters and Sciences.

Along with my Letter of Admission, I received a Conditions of Admission document, which explained that I must take the specific classes that I planned to take when applying earlier this year (specified via the UC Application on the Transfer Academic Update).

Unfortunately, while I attempted to take the courses, I only managed to complete 4 of the 7 courses I planned to take, as there was no room in classes. One of the courses is Calculus (I don’t think this is a specific prerequisite for C&L at Berkeley but it is for many other UC schools).

I will be speaking with a UC Berkeley advisor on Monday.

Does anyone with a similar experience have any advice? Do you think my admission will be rescinded?","I was a dual enrollment student in a CC and in high school, so not exactly a transfer student, but I wasn't able to get a spot in those 3 CC classes, so I dropped those 3 AP tests from my schedule. I was shitting myself when I read the condition, opened a case with Calcentral and they basically told me ,""thanks for letting us know, welcome to Cal"" a week later

Hope everything works out for you as well :) Welcome to Cal

Have you wondered how you could as well but you didn’t know where to start? Then this is for you!

This Monday (October 18th) from 7-8 PM I will be giving a [talk](https://berkeley-udls.github.io/) in Soda Hall in HP auditorium (306 Soda) about the fundamentals of credit cards and credit card rewards.

This talk will cover what goes into a credit score, how to build good credit and get started with getting credit cards, how to redeem credit card rewards for thousands of dollars worth of luxury travel, and how to create a strategy of what cards to get. 

A lot of people don’t realize how easy it is to get started in the game of credit card rewards and how much value they can get from it. It is quite easy to be able to earn luxury hotel stays worth thousands of dollars and first class flights worth tens of thousands of dollars. I hope to demonstrate how valuable this game can be and help people get started!

If you or anyone you know would be interested then please attend this Monday from 7-8 PM in HP auditorium in Soda Hall! There will also be a live zoom linked [here](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98097936555) 

Edit: please fill out [this](https://forms.gle/cEjJdstWp2aEP3Hj8) form if you are interested in attending. It’s completely optional but helps me know how many people are going

I missed the meeting but is there anywhere i can watch the zoom?
Wait you should never only pay the minimum.

You should pay off your card in full every month and only spend money you were planning to spend anyways.

If you pay any interest, you are losing far more money than you are gaining from the rewards.
high credit utilization is going to hurt your credit score
[deleted]
Yes! The recoding is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGNCwiZ5IKY)
With the catch that credit utilization has no memory under current scoring models, ie if you avoid maxing your credit line one or two months before applying for new credit AND you are not cycling credit (maxing your credit line and paying off the balance multiple times in a single billing cycle), you will be fine. 
But yes, always pay in full!
Yeah exactly, high utilization is only a temp problem for your score. But the interest payed will be more than the credit card rewards earned"
L&S CS Appeal Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1054cam/ls_cs_appeal_help/,2023-01-06 12:19:36,"Hello, I am a sophomore intending CS in L&S, however I messed up in my last prerequisite class, CS 70. For context, my grades were the following: 61a A-, 61b A-, 70 C. My cumulative GPA as a result is a 3.13, missing the 3.30 requirement. I am preparing for the appeal process and would like advice on how to approach writing my appeal letter and how to use my resources. I believe I do have a valid extreme circumstance, and I also believe I can contribute a lot to the CS department as CS is something that I am passionate about. With regards to my extreme circumstance, I was diagnosed in July with a mental health disorder that I don’t want to name because of the stigma. As a result, I went into treatment with some medications that have heavy side effects as well as needing to take lots of time to go to the doctor each week, as well as dealing with the actual symptoms of the disorder. I have good documentation for this, but I am aware that the review board may not see it as extreme. I also will not deny that I could have done better, I definitely had my part in this and that I will not throw everything on my illness. As far as what I can contribute, I was an academic intern in Fall 2022 for 61a, which I greatly enjoyed. Furthermore, I worked as a software development intern at Amazon during summer 2022, from which I hope to get a rec. letter. I know I am capable of succeeding in CS, but I will not deny that this semester has been difficult. All being said, I only have 3000 characters for my appeal letter, and would like any advice. Thank you! 

Tl;dr: 3.13 gpa for a 3.3 gpa requirement, have valid mental heath reasons (I think) and also believe I can contribute to CS community. Please help because I really want to get in!","best of luck with the appeal! i do think you make a very strong case since you're involved with the berkeley cs community through teaching + outside internship experience, so i really think just being honest about your circumstances this summer and your passion for cs will get you where you need to be. cs 70 is an insanely difficult class, and the fact that you powered through speaks volumes to your dedication and work ethic that the department would be idiotic to ignore. if not i'm sure you might be able to reach out to the student advocate's office (i don't quite recall the name), since you definitely have reasonable extenuating circumstances. best of luck, and i really hope this works out for you!
Just speak the truth and make sure to answer the questions for the letter of recommendation and the more proof you can submit as part of the application the better. If I recall you can submit supporting documentation. 

>but I am aware the board may not see it as extreme

Just focus on how your mental health has affected you. Don’t sell what your experiencing short because everyones extremes are different.

Good luck with the appeal! Curious why you didn't late drop.
Would you mind sharing what your scores were for 70 in terms of SDs? I only ask because I also got an A- in both 61a/b and am worried I'm on track for a C. Thanks!
Thank you for the tip, will look into it!
To be honest I was pretty certain I would get the grade I needed, all things considered. It wasn’t something I really anticipated, but hindsight is 20-20 and I definitely would have if I could go back in time."
How is your experience as an international transfer student @ Cal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ntfcnj/how_is_your_experience_as_an_international/,2021-06-05 23:24:38,"Hi there! I am a Cal c/o 2020 graduate. I am working on a talk as a complement of the BIO/golden bear orientation to provide some tips for adopting transfer life. Before I get started, I am wondering how is everyone's experience and what sort of area you think advice from upperclassman/older people would be helpful, thanks for your input!

&#x200B;

Below are some of the talk points I had in mind, not very structured yet:

 

What defines a good experience?

\- Xyz

&#x200B;

What are some stressors?

&#x200B;

\-lack of upperclassman or student figure that I can reach out to

\-feel strong sense of behind and loneliness

\-big big campus, big big class, feel it’s hard to make friends and gain personal relationship

\-academically challenged, feel ashamed to ask for help

\-stress about declaring and getting internships

&#x200B;

How to address the stressors?

&#x200B;

\- you can’t do everything at the same time

\- prioritizing and planning, use calendar

\- know the timeline, and plan ahead

\- research and have bigger picture overview before you jump in and sign up

\- your identity doesn’t lays on how you preform

\- find a group of friends to do things together, AKA your support group",
last minute enrollment HELP!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/waztzm/last_minute_enrollment_help/,2022-07-29 02:02:44,"so I signed up for a class with only a breadth requirement I actually already did (yeah…only realized that after carefully examining my courses over the summer…) and I’m trying to switch out of it for something else. I first tried to see if there was anything I could do for my last breadth requirement remaining but because I’m trying to keep Tuesdays as a don’t-drive day I’m pretty limited to just mwf classes and they either have requirements I can’t meet or are completely full. The class I’m trying to switch into (Class A) would give me the best chance at getting through this bump without issue but it has less than 10 seats left and my enrollment is at 2pm…

my backup (Class B) has 36 seats and it could also benefit me for graduating purposes because I’m interested in pursuing a minor those course can help me complete, but the catch is that I read part of the syllabus and it says we’re required to use a program in class that’s for computers only. And since I commute, I leave my laptop at home (it’s physically broken anyway and can’t even fit into my backpack due to the damage… so i’d have to somehow get the money for repairs). I couldn’t read the full syllabus so I have no idea if I would have to bring my laptop to school. I *could* rent laptops from the library continuously throughout the semester, but I can imagine that the extra issues that would involve for reservation,and the check-in/check-out processes would be pretty tiring long-term.

my other backup (Class C) has 12 seats and would fulfil that one last breadth, but a majority of them are for undeclared L&S folks, the category I’m currently under. the *only* con is that I’d have to spend more time in classes later in the day bc of the timing (I was hoping to use that time for a club I’m in) but honestly it’s a small sacrifice if it means I can swap out of the class I enrolled in earlier.

my last resort would be to stay enrolled in the first class I want to get out of, enroll into a 2-Unit decal, and then drop the first class. But I’ve never navigated enrolling into a decal before, and I really need to have at least 13 secured units for both my financial aid and L&S requirements…

any advice for what my move should be? i really want to get through this issue as harm-free as possible.

CS 61A with 2 other technicals,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dbksdb/cs_61a_with_2_other_technicals/,2019-09-30 17:06:30,"What do you think about taking CS 61A, Physics 5B, Math 53, and english r1A as a second semester freshman? I’m pretty above average here in the sciences but definitely not a genius. Will I kill myself doing this? I’ve taken C++ and Java in HS, but I had a very shitty teacher who basically wrote the code for us. I’m worried if I don’t take it now, my course load will only get worse as the years pass and it will be even harder to manage. Please help! I’m a physics major btw.","I'll give the advice I tell other freshman, which is to slow down and not to overdo it their first year, which applies well to 90% of freshman (the only exceptions I'd make is if you are a savant or went to a highly technical school which put you above and beyond the rest of the student body). 

There are a few reasons for this: the lower divs you need to focus on for your major are extremely important and will literally come into play for any upper division classes. Taking the time to let the information sink in is very important and additionally, if you're finding the material easy and it leaves you with extra time, there are plenty of ways to challenge yourself within the classes you are already taking.

If you overdo it, you may very well be able to maintain good grades but by having to spend so much time on each class, each concept isn't ""settling in"" as well as it should and therefore you're harming yourself and making your harder upper division classes more difficult in the long run. You can also fully take advantage of office hours and develop connections with the faculty that is much harder to do with a high number of technical classes (you may simply just not have the time to go to OH consistently).

Instead, try to take care of your breadth classes. Usually these classes are much less work-intensive, not only allowing you to focus on your core reqs but it may be the case that you find a field you want to minor (or even potentially double major in) that you wouldn't expect. I can't tell you how many times people have taken a breadth class they had to take anyway late into the game only for them to realize they love the subject matter and they don't have the time to take as many classes in it as they would like.

Furthermore, taking less technicals allows you time to do extracurriculars. Find a good niche of friends and give you a better idea of how much study and social time you need. Finding this balance early on will make your time at Berkeley much easier in the long-term, providing you a good support network of friends and mentally healthy breaks from the grind.

Trust me, you have plenty of time to take on a much bigger workload, but developing a strong, intimate knowledge of the core reqs for your major and improving on your daily work habits will make taking on this greater workload much, much easier.
Hey, I’m a freshman taking CS61A and Physics 5B and 5BL right now. I think 61A is fine to be honest; instead I find 5B to be a much harder class because of the homework sets. I think Math 53 should be a prerequisite for 5B, since the professor doesn’t hesitate to use concepts from much later parts of 53. 

From what I know, physics 88 is pretty common amongst physics majors and would help with your future lab classes. Ultimately, it depends on what you want to get into, but I would consider taking that instead of 61A if I wanted something closer to home.
It's doable, but on the more challenging side.That being said, you may not want to take CS 61A next semester because you will have Hilfinger .... I haven't had him as a professor, but the CS61B students seem to really be stressed out right now because of his crazy assignments. I think even an experienced coder may have difficulties in his class. Have you considered taking Physics 5C+CL, Math 53, English R1A, and an upper div physics course? Prerequisites aren't enforced at Berkeley and a lot of students will take 5C+CL with one of the upper div physics courses. You don't really need Physics 5C+CL for Physics 105 and 110A. Also, a lot of people take Physics 137A with 5C+CL. You can then take CS 61A in the Summer or Fall. FYI, they offer CS 61A online in the summer. It is the exact same class, you just watch all the lecture videos online (which students in the regular lecture do as well) and you take your exams at Berkeley or with a proctor that the CS 61A staff will arrange with a local proctoring service in your area.

Did this + math 54 my second semester freshman year (although I didn't do 5BL which was a timesink). I did fine but didn't have a ton of time for other things.
Are you planning on taking 5BL later? Don't underestimate the workload of that class. I would personally recommend against taking 61A with 5BL, since regardless of difficulty the sheer time commitment for both is so high."
Data 8 or Physics 77?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dpf6sk/data_8_or_physics_77/,2019-10-30 16:51:39,"I am a physics major planning on taking Physics 5B, 5BL, Math 53, English R1A, and some sort of programming class next semester. I am hoping to get an internship at JPL this summer with my dads friend and need some programming experience. Would data 8 or Physics 77 be a better “intro” class to programming? I’ve taken Java and C++ in high school but had a shitty teacher who would literally write the code for us. I have a general idea on how to write code, but don’t think I’m ready for 61A (nor will I have the time). Which class should I take?","Physics 77 seems more relevant to your major, and Data 8 doesn't cover much Python overall, so I would recommend Physics 77
Physics 77 is more relevant and will boost your physics major GPA
Don't know anything about Physics 77, but Data 8 is really good for people who haven't had much exposure to any programming languages.  You'll get to learn some Python.
In a similar situation. I spoke with some seniors and they told me to take physics 77.
I did a very similar course load back in Spring 2017 - I took Physics 5B, 5BL, Math 53, CompLit R1A, Physics 77 (it used to be 2 units back then, but similar workload), a breadth class and the Python Decal.

It was a pretty heavy semester with tons of reading and shits. I would say it's probably a good idea to keep just Physics 5B, 5BL, 77, Math 53, and the Python Decal. 5BL was a huge time sink when I took it and I heard it is still the same so you probably don't want to overload yourself. 

The Python Decal is offered by the Astro department, and I am assuming they are offering it next semester as well, so if you can get into that class, it will prepare you for Astro- and Physics-related problems. In my opinion, I think that taking 77 along with the Python Decal was a pretty great combination.

after all the nights wasting away staring at IntelliJ im now failing or maybe have some C if I step up for finals

i spent hours and hours a week on this class more than anything else and now i don’t have too much to show for it at all

what the actual fuck do i do :(","Hey first off calm down. You can still pull this back. I completely understand that it is a hard class, I'm in it as well and even though I am doing very well in the class, I can completely relate to your feelings as a lot of friends are feeling the same thing. 

1. Most of the final is on post MT2 content + sorting, so theres a good start for you to study.
2. You can bring unlimited notes. Use this to your advantage. I recommend maybe some CSM cribsheets + some solutions of his exams
3. Study with your friends. Often times in CS you will struggle with a question. Sometimes talking it with someone can offer you new perspective which can make your approach to a question significantly easier.

struggling bear losing sleep over this,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sh05gg/struggling_bear_losing_sleep_over_this/,2022-01-31 04:29:40,"hello everyone! i have been struggling with this so much recently and figured to post on here. i am currently a sophomore intending to major in public health. social welfare would be my backup major. 

so far, all i need is the 4 unit part of the biological sciences. i have already taken mcb 50 and bio 1b in attempt to fulfil this requirement, but i have failed both classes ( i would be like 2-3% away from passing with a c-) 

honestly, biological science is extremely hard to me and i struggle so much with it. i am currently enrolled into mcb 50 now and am lowkey disliking it. (the professor and lectures are all great, i just can’t get myself to kinda go thru with it) i am so scared that i will fail again and this has been v v stressful to think abt. i feel like it’s clear that me and bio sci jus don’t work out. 

i have considered taking mcb 38 and mcb 61 instead, because they would be 6 units together and i’ve heard that they’re more for students who are more humanities/social science based instead of bio sciences based. 

i have also considered just majoring in social welfare and minoring in global public health. i feel iffy abt this because my entire resume is all based in public health and i’ve always been strong abt how i came into cal intending to major in PH, so i want to stick to it. i love everything about the major. 

majoring in SW would be a huge stress relief because failing bio1b and mcb50 has already made me feel extremely unmotivated. i also really like the topics in SW too, but i feel like at the end of the day i will always regret not applying to public health. 

any advice comments tips are appreciated! just had to get this out of my chest.","I believe you need 7 units of sciences for PH, but I could be wrong.

Also if you are planning on waiting to see if you get into PH first, make sure you still are under the unit cap for SW (to be able to apply), because SW will not budge on their unit cap requirement
If i remember correctly, PH is in L&S right? If so, I’d just take whatever lower div bio sci classes ya need at BCC, they offer both BIO 1A and BIO 1B which directly transfer over to Cal. It’s the exact same content but due to smaller class size, you don’t have dramatic grade deflation/inflation / curves. Maybe give that a try?
okay thank you!! and i have 4 units left because i already took nst 10 which was 3 units
thank you!! sadly the lab units from CC doesn’t transfer over to Cal but they will be a total of 6 units so that is a good idea. thank you!!"
Where/how can I learn to manage time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9kxli9/wherehow_can_i_learn_to_manage_time/,2018-10-02 20:30:51,"So I'm having an incredibly difficult time managing my time, and most importantly, focusing. Everyday I come home and instead of getting started on the tons of work I have, I browse the internet and basically delay everything until the last minute, and stay up. I think it's a willpower problem. In high school I could coast by with no problem like this, but evidently not at Berkeley. Even every day I tell myself, OK I'm going to start on my work right away but I just don't. I already messed up a midterm, making it impossible for me to get an A in a class. I want to improve my habits before its too late and costs me any more. How do I focus? Manage time? Any methodical approaches? Is there any resource on campus to teach study habits and focus? Someone I can talk to? I'm willing to be spoonfed like a baby. I just want my 8 hours man :c","I may be wrong but I think your main problem is that you are used to going to class and then right as you get out of school your brain is like ‘okay time to play!!!’ since there was never a need to really work hard on academics outside class. 
But the reality is that even outside of class you need to be thinking and doing school.

Therefore to solve your problem the key is STRUCTURE. You should introduce more structure to your day to make your brain stop reverting to ‘play’ mode. 

Some things I do to give myself more structure: 

- keep a notebook and write down everything I need to do (not a fancy planner just a small notebook). Your brain might try to tell you ‘oh i don’t have that much work; oh that can wait’ but when it’s all written down in front of you then your brain will be like ‘oh shit that’s a lot, I better get moving!’ 

- everyday in that notebook I set a list of goals I seek to accomplish. I do this by looking at my list of tasks for the week and choosing a subset of those. 
How do I choose what tasks for each day? 
1) if it’s due soon (obviously)
2) if my prof or gsi for a certain subject is having office hours and I want to go, I will try to do the hw for that class before that time so I can ask good questions that will further my learning. That often means I get it done well before the due date. Because I COULD wait till last minute BUT that would make me miss an opportunity to really clarify the concepts, which would hurt me on exams. So not only would you be more on time, you are basically studying for exams at the same time which is super win win. And the profs and gsis will love you. 

- instead of going home right after classes I go to office hours or a library and do hw there. So I bring all the hw stuff I need (from my goals for the day) out in the morning so I don’t need to go home at all. Yes your backpack will be heavy but the benefits of this include
1) everyone else there is doing hw and studying which will put you in the mood for doing the same. You probably associate your room with play and sleep so your first instinct will not be to do hw. 
2) if you are in office hours there is someone to help you right as you realize you have a question. This is much better and efficient for you than having to wait several days to get help which would delay your learning and is frustrating. 

I personally don’t try to manage my time in the sense that ‘oh I need to finish this lab report in 1.5 hours’. I just give myself as much time as I need. Ideal learning is an organic process without arbitrary time constraints. Sometimes to really understand a concept you might need half an hour more than you wanted to spend. 

Also take lots of breaks so you don’t get too miserable. You will be more productive that way. But don’t go on your phone because that’s not really taking a break. That might take lots of willpower but you can do it!

Hope this helps!!

Edit: 
In high school some of my teachers in ap classes didn’t teach much so I could have had an easy time if my goal was the same as the teachers. However I had my own goal that was slightly more ambitious: I wanted 5s so that meant I had to develop self study skills. 

The same is true at Berkeley - you can do the minimum required of you and get a mediocre result and no one will care. But if you have ambitious goals that are truly your own and that you wish to achieve super badly - that is what will help you excel. So think about what you want and are you willing to work for it? 
Lol this sounds exactly like me. All I can say is it’s hard. Like, it’s really hard to overturn years of this habit and definitely won’t happen overnight or even over the course of a few weeks for that matter. You probably should look for outside sources of accountability until you can start to rely on yourself to hold yourself accountable.
Pretty much every Berkeley student I talked to that coasted through HS had the same issues you’re having (myself included, whoops).

Here are some things that helped me:

1.) Form study groups with floor mates/classmates and meeting in a campus study room/cafe/library. While you’ll definitely end up goofing around a bit, it’s easier to keep yourself accountable to your work when other people around you are also doing their work. Try to meet at the same time/date every week. Try to meet earlier in the day (all nighters might seem appealing, but if you can get the work done from 5-8pm instead of 12-3am you’ll actually get sleep).

2.) You can download apps onto your laptop that will blacklist certain websites for any length of time you desire — you can blacklist Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, etc. for a few hours (and shut off your phone) as a means to force yourself to do work with undivided attention. 

3.) When you get back home, don’t immediately get comfortable. Grab a snack, grab some water, sit immediately at your desk and get some work done. Time yourself for 30 minutes. You’ll be impressed with how much you get done when your brain is still in *gotta go places, gotta do stuff* mode. If you front load your work you’ll have more time for fun on weekends, and can relax more easily before going to bed. 
I think what worked for me was finding a group of peers that were ""good"" at managing time.  Namely, you'll likely develop ""good"" habits if you hang out with people with ""good"" habits.  Similarly for bad habits.  If your close friends are playing League every single day for countless hours, it's extremely likely that you are also playing League for a nontrivial amount of time.  If your friends are spending 40-50 hours a week on CS/Math/Physics, you most likely will also be spending a lot of time on CS/Math/Physics.  


Assuming you're aiming for good grades, the next step is to develop efficient study habits (which a lot of people do not have).  Studying ""smart"" for 10 hours is typically ""better"" than randomly rereading notes for 40 hours.  Again, finding the ""correct"" group of people will make this a lot easier.


Obviously, there are exceptions (and perhaps each course subject works differently).
It's difficult to do work at home. If you can't focus, go to the library.
Everyone has already given great tips but I wanted to share what really worked for me.

If I ever need to buckle down and concentrate on work, I go to the library and sit at one of the tables (not the desk/cubicle spaces). Just being around other working people somehow makes me work too. 
This article nails it on the head (for me, at least). Though it's short, each idea explored is important enough that it could be its own book.

Additionally, /r/getdisciplined . Though I recommend in-depth books over shallower reddit posts.
Thanks, I think I think I'll try the stay on campus strat. Then I will be forced to work.
Yeah unfortunately :/, where do I find these sources?
Thanks for the advice man, will try the study group thing. I kind of goof off in those too because I'm usually too tired from classes or something to focus but if I pair up with focused people I'm hoping their attitude will change me. I'm also kind of a slow learner so it's hard for me to keep up with groups but I guess I just have to work on it. Man, if I can actually consistently get enough sleep and not have to cram again for a long period of time I'll be so happy. It'll hands down be my biggest accomplishment in life lol like 6 years of bad habits are really catching up, i wish i took people's advice a long time ago.
Hey thanks for the reply. Can you expand on the studying 'smart' and good study habits part?
Oh I didn’t really have any official sources in mind, pretty much just asking a friend to roast you if you don’t do your work for example or forming a study group can go a long way
This school has a really good habit of making you feel like you're constantly drowning in work -- know you're not alone in that, and don't take it to heart. 

Ultimately, the ideal is to turn consistent bad habits into good ones. You'll get used to the people in study groups, and especially if they're in your classes, you'll get practice explaining concepts to each other. If you get to sleep on time, you'll have more energy to study. Make sure you're still taking care of yourself and eating well/drinking enough water. Office hours are an incredible, often under-utilized resource. 
Disclaimer: this is my own experience (in math and science), so yours may vary.


Internalizing material/understanding the material as much as possible is what I define as 'smart' studying.  For example, in mathematics, one learns the quadratic formula.  A standard student might do 100 problems on the quadratic formula and stop there, which is fine.  A more involved student would probably go through ax^2 + bx + c = 0, and learn why the formula works.  Then, they would ask ""can I do this for ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0?""  How about a quartic?  How about a quintic  (It turns out that quintics are not solvable)?  Perhaps you'd ask those questions about solvability in lecture/office hours.  You might ask your professor if there's more information about roots of polynomials and he/she might mumble something about the rational root theorem/Vieta's formulas, etc.  So, you've in theory thought a lot about ""solving for roots of polynomials.""


Compare the above with the route memorization path that most students choose (which, to be fair, is not a bad thing).  On an exam, one might get a more involved cubic polynomial that can be reduced by the rational root theorem to a quadratic (or some more involved factoring).  From there, one would apply the quadratic formula.  The more involved student would certainly have very little trouble doing this, while those who chose route memorization might struggle a bit more.


By the time one gets to upper level classes, there's already (in general) such a huge gap in foundation from one who chooses to internalize the prerequisites from those who just routinely solve problems.  Of course, solving problems is part of internalizing the material, but is often not the only part.  


At least in math/physics, I've seen too many people go through notes and rewrite every theorem/formula/example they've seen without examining what they're doing.  This often leads to poor understanding of the material (i.e. ""bad"" version of pattern recognition is being implemented).  I could not possibly imagine myself learning this way. 
 But again, this might work for some people."

brief context: incoming freshman deciding fall schedule, literally zero cs experience (tho i started the python module on codeacademy recently), intended econ/pre-haas, taking 61a because i'm genuinely interested, but also scared to take it. also got a lot of advice to take data 8 first, unfortunately because of my late enrollment time i don't think i can do that.

1. i'm considering p/nping this course. is getting a p for cs61a doable or even relatively ""easy""? and will it still take hella time and work?

2. if i switch to p/np, are there going to be any consequences? like i still don't really understand the 1/3 p/np course policy thing. also will haas applications look at this unfavorably? 

3. i saw someone say that we can ""drop"" from 61a to cs10 after the first midterm; for this to work, do i have to sign up for both classes during enrollment then drop one or is it an automatic switch from 61a to 10?

4. as an Econ/pre-Haas major, I just don’t know what I would take in its place. I don’t want to do a prereq yet like stats, econ 1/2, ugba 10 etc since I want to get accustomed to the work before jumping into prereqs. but I also don’t want to “waste” a class (i kind of want to take a useful class for my major, or build tech skills at least). I’ve already passed the r&c reqs. so no idea what I should do or what classes I should consider taking. should I just go for it and take a prereq?

5. lastly, is doing a letter grade cs61a doable with math54? 

thank you again!!","1. Getting a pass for 61a is very doable, I would say it's almost impossible to fail (very few but unlucky people do) because of how you can get a C- just by doing all the stuff that isn't exams (projects, labs, hws). Exams are the hard part which separate people into the B-, B, B+. A-, A, A+.
2. I don't think there is too much, I'm not part of Haas, but basically the 1/3rd rule is that only a maximum of 1/3 of your units and be PNP
3. I'm not sure of this either, but do know that it's ok if you do not do well. I remember getting a 47% on my first midterm in 61a, but it helped me gauge myself and prep much better for the final.
4. You're not really wasting a class if you decide to do a pre-req cause you will have to take it anyways at some point, don't worry about the workload, everyone has to get used to Berkeley workloads at some point, 61A vs econ1/2 vs other pre-reqs amount of work will always be alien to new students in some way
5. I think it is, I took math53 with it, but imo math 54 was nicer and smoother than 53, so I think doing math 54 with 61a is very doable and should not be too harsh. Then again, both of these courses are tough so its ok if you find it challenging
As suggested in another post, we now recommend CS10 as the first class for students who have not programmed yet. I do think passing is possible without it, but I think you'd enjoy it more if you had CS10 under your belt.

Another option to consider is CS88, if you're able to enroll in that. It covers all of the same Python topics as CS61A, but leaves out the final unit on Interpreters/Scheme. CS88 could be a nice option for you, since you're not planning to go into CS.
CS 61A is a difficult class for everyone, including people with experience. Since you have no experience, it's gonna be a more challenging ride for you.

In my opinion, it's just the density of the content and its pace, so if you can learn fast, maybe you'll be fine. IMO, having only Code Academy I don't think is sufficient enough (but YMMV) because having some programming experience seriously helps, especially on exams. You'll probably be fine in homework and projects though, but the exams are a wtf scenario, but still doable (it just requires experience).

I didn't see such a CS 61A to 10 swap system last Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, so I wouldn't rely on it too much and maybe enroll at the Adjustment Period to be safe, then double-check.

&#x200B;

Otherwise, I would vouch for Smarty\_PantzAA's answer, including the P/NP possibility and logistic questions"

Carol once again saves the day with a generic email detailing how students are not a reflection of the school!,https://i.redd.it/0oj5nn1e38lc1.jpeg,2024-02-27 16:43:55,,"She saw what happened to Harvard, MIT and Penn...
Good statement, don't see the issue. If the issues were reversed, there would be a different reaction coming from students reading this who may feel this is bs.

Disclaimer: I am in no way stating I support or do not support this speaker, their history, their message, etc.
Me from halfway across the globe: the fuc dey doin over there
Deeply strange that the statement suggests the protesters violated the first amendment rights of the speaker. I understand that the popular meaning of “free speech” works that way, but this is the head of a university - you should speak precisely and accurately.
Can you share the full email? (Alum not current student)
Yes, a good response.
I agree with Carol’s statements in the email. She didn’t say that students’ aren’t representation of school. She just addressed that they support First amendment, but the violence in the name of protest on campus violates others free speech as well.
She doesn't say if there will be disciplinary consequences for those involved.
A speaker from Israel should not be allowed on campus atm. Israel is committing genocide. The speaker is a member of the IDF. He is a murderer. He should not be allowed on campus. Hypocrisy at its finest UC Berkeley. Fuck you.
Honestly, I'm ashamed to be associated with this school. At least it helped me land a great job. That's all I got out of this place.
the students who protested and broke down doors just because the speaker was israeli… are not a reflection of the school’s values. or even basic values.
I'm too lazy to google it, so I'll just ask here. Wtf does she even do besides writing half-assed emails that she often has to self-correct by writing another one immediately after?
“please i really wanna keep my job” headass
Hopefully this president also resigns given clear mis handling of situation. Where was the police. I don’t buy anything regarding to delayed response. What if this was an active shooter incident. Do student groups need to hire their own private security. What if they did here and lethal force, which would be justified, was used against an aggressive protestor. 

University is in part to blame here

Except there's no way it could be reversed. The only way it could be reversed is if a Hamas fighter who killed Israeli civilians were invited to speak at Berkeley.
Some people just argue to argue :/
Dear campus community,  
   
We write to you today with great sadness, concern, and dismay in the wake of an incident on our campus last night, an incident that violated not only our rules, but also some of our most fundamental values. Our purpose is not just to inform our community about what happened. We are writing with the hope that we can and will come together in defense of our Principles of Community that safeguard free speech, diversity of perspective, and the ties that bind this community together.  
   
Last night an event was scheduled featuring a speaker from Israel, who had been invited to campus by some of our student organizations. Minutes before the event was to start, a crowd of some 200 protesters began to surround the building. Doors were broken open and the protesters gained unauthorized entry to the building. The event was canceled, and the building was evacuated to protect the speaker and members of the audience.  
   
We want to express our deep remorse and sympathy to those students and members of the public who were in the building, fearing for their safety. Today, like last night, our colleagues in Student Affairs are reaching out with offers of support and we are urging students to report what they witnessed and experienced to UCPD and/or our Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination. We share your anger and concern, and we understand that we must do all that we can to prevent anything like this from happening again.  
   
Due to safety concerns, we worked with the hosting organization to move the event to a different location, one that was believed to be more secure. We also stepped up security and sent a team of UCPD officers to the event. We approach events like this with two priorities: to do what we can so that the event can go forward, and to do what we can to safeguard student safety and well-being. Last night, despite our efforts and the ample number of police officers, it was not possible to do both given the size of the crowd and the threat of violence.  
   
We are committed to responding to violations of our “Time, Place, and Manner” rules. We deeply respect the right to protest as intrinsic to the values of a democracy and an institution of higher education. Yet, we cannot ignore protest activity that interferes with the rights of others to hear and/or express perspectives of their choosing. We cannot allow the use or threat of force to violate the First Amendment rights of a speaker, no matter how much we might disagree with their views. We cannot allow the use or threat of force to imperil members of our community and deny them the ability to feel safe and welcome on our campus. We cannot cede our values to those willing to engage in transgressive behavior.  
   
We will in the days ahead decide on the best possible path to fully understand what happened and why; to determine how we will address what occurred; and to do everything possible to preclude a repeat of what happened.  
   
The attack on the building, and on the event, was an attack on the fundamental values of the university, which are also essential to maintain and nurture open inquiry and an inclusive civil society, the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation. We are now, and will remain in the future, committed to Free Speech as essential to our educational mission, our institutional identity, and the strength of our community. We hope for your support as we seek to protect and preserve our Principles of Community.  
   
Sincerely,  
   
Carol T. Christ  
Chancellor  
   
Benjamin E. Hermalin  
Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost

They just *checks notes* are students here
Oh stop. You do realize your little reply is half assed
You realize she's retiring at the end of the term, right?
Tbh UCPD are always very slow at responding. A while ago (maybe last week?) there was a guy shooting randomly on Sproul Plaza and WarnMe didn’t even send a message until that shooter was caught. Gladly no one was hurt. Also, there was a mentally disabled guy smashing everything at that Shuttack Target. When I called 911 they said they weren’t available. It took them more than 30 min to show up. The police is apparently not as efficient as what we think and an active shooter will definitely screw everyone up💀
…what do you mean lethal force was justified…
Where were the police? One of Bears for Palestine’s complaints in their Instagram post is the police presence that was already there. Also saying lethal force was justified here is insane
*looks around for the government*


What are you talking about?

Free speech does not deny you any consequence. If you say, “i hate coconuts” and a bunch of people show up to protest you hating coconuts…you all exhibited free speech.

The government didn’t intervene. The people did. The people are free to tell you to eat hog shite. : /

i would suggest you do a quick check to see who your right to freedom of speech defends you from.
I would also suggest you realize that EVEN FREEDOM OF SPEECH, LIKE ALL RIGHTS, HAS IT’S LIMITS.
I wouldn't put it past them...
They may reflect the school but are in no way representative of it
If you call 911 from a cell phone, you'll typically get routed to a CHP or regional call center, who then routes you to your local jurisdiction. Even then, the Target is BPD jurisdiction, not UCPD. UCPD can respond, but they're not necessarily primary, to my understanding. 

The shooter situation, UCPD and BPD were on site in less than 3 minutes and apprehended the guy immediately. Most departments aim for around a 5-6 minute response time, but that's still generally not achieved or realistic, with many major cities having response times in the double digits. Being on-site any faster than that basically requires an accident of happening to be in the area.
UCPD literally arrested the shooting suspect within 2 minutes lol. The Shattuck target is BPD jurisdiction too, not UCPD.
Do you know that the police apprehended the suspect immediately? The warnme timing does not reflect the police response time to the emergency. UCPD did a great job.
Do you know that the police apprehended the suspect immediately? The warnme timing does not reflect the police response time to the emergency. UCPD did a great job.
Why? If you have an angry mob charging after you. Then yea if you end up cornered you are entitled to use lethal force to defend oneself.
[deleted]
Oh I see. That’s good to know
Clearly lethal force was nowhere even close to necessary in this scenario, since we can see there were only one or two injuries with none being used
Yes, you’re right, let’s all sit down with out hands together and demand decency…in the face of genocide. 


:S. I really need you to understand what a protest is. The government is limited in what it can do. I’m sure you’re one of the imbeciles who believe protesting is you running to get a sign off from the local police department to do a protest in a specific area with cute little signs and police escorts.


Again, GO READ A BOOK.
Genocide is when *checks notes* a country responds to the murder and rape of over 1000 of their civilian citizens by antisemitic terrorists"
Rescind grades (extenuating circumstance),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/c2cz8y/rescind_grades_extenuating_circumstance/,2019-06-18 22:21:42,"Hi! I’m an accepted student in the college of engineering, and am doing A-Levels. There’s the possibility of me getting a C in my final grades, in further maths. I take 5 A-Levels, and the norm in general is 3, with 4 maximum at elite schools. I’m set to get AAAB or above in the other subjects I take.

Obviously I’m pretty worried that I’ll be rescinded, although there are some circumstances that have led to this grade. Firstly, my grandmother passed away in spring, and I travelled to my home country (other side of the world) in order to visit her and help with the family before she passed. This was pretty difficult psychologically, and occurred in the most important period for these exams (the break right before testing). Hence, I wasn’t able to focus to the extent I wanted to in said exams.

Additionally, my mother has travelled to this home country many times to care for her other living parent in the last year, leaving me to care for my younger sister. This has also taken away from my preparations.

If worst comes to worst, and I do get a C in this exam (results come out August 15th), what are my options? For reference, I got 800 on SAT Math 2 and will be getting an A or A* at single maths A-Level","I failed a class second semester because I cut like 70% of class and I had to fill out one of those forms in the admissions portal. I was just straight up and told them that I slacked off but that this wasn’t representative of me as a student. My counselor also sent in a letter of support and like 1-2 weeks later my admissions officer emailed me and said everything was good. I'm sorry for your loss dude and you have super legitimate circumstances so don't sweat it :)

Yeah I got an F in AP Calc and I was tweaking out because I was admitted as an EECS major. I got an 800 on SAT Math II, an 800 on the SAT math section and I had straight A's in all my classes before second semester so that probably helped me out. And awesome, go bears

Need help with dsp accommodations,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/q77fmy/need_help_with_dsp_accommodations/,2021-10-13 02:26:28,"I have been dealing with severe anxiety and depression since the beginning of this semester. I am meeting with a therapist each week but I still haven’t been able to keep up with the classwork. So much so that I missed all the midterms and assignments since mid-september.

I was thinking of dropping out or transferring to a community college quite seriously, but I finally decided to change my major from econ to japanese. I was foolish to think there was anything more important than mental health(happiness). 

This is my third semester and my classes are three econ prereqs(econ 100a, 100b, math 16b) and two breadths (7 units). It’s way beyond drop-with-refund so I need to get through this semester anyway. I’m not sure if dropping one of the prereqs would be a good idea since they decreased the limit to two classes. That means I need to p/np some classes and try to get at least C in the other classes to meet the 2.0 gpa to get into the japanese major.

Tl;dr What kind of documents do I need from a mental clinic or counselor to successfully request for dsp accommodations? What kind of accommodations do they usually give? What classes should I drop and/or p/np?

Edit: thank you so much for helping me out. I was on the verge of giving up everything but I hope things will get better sooner.","Even if you join DSP, the accommodations that they give you aren't retroactive. It is very likely that you will not be able to make up your midterms. In general, DSP can give you extensions and extended time. They will not allow you to miss important exams if it is not documented and disability related emergency (e.g. hospitalization). I am not sure if extensions will help you since you still have to complete all homework by the end of semester and the work will just keep piling up.

You therapist has to fill out certificate of disability that you can be downloaded on DSP website. Then you have to submit it to DSP and make appointment during which they will discuss your needs. It takes a while to get the appointment (3-4 weeks) and get the documentation. By the time you will get it, the semester will be almost over. 

If you are failing majority of your classes, it is better to withdraw this semester or dramatically reduce your workload. Maybe apply for medical withdrawal.
I also second the advice to reduce the workload. I'm currently also doing 100a and 100b together, and that combination alone causes me so much anarchy every week to manage. I think you can drop to 13 or 10 units even, but make sure they're your favorite classes so you can still enjoyably do the material. If not, I would recommend taking a break this semester? I took a gap sem last Spring too and it helped me recover from the mental and emotional exhaustion of Fall 2020. 

I'm not too sure what you mean by drop with refund? I thought we're allowed to drop classes up to finals week and pay something like $10 per drop?
I actually withdrew for medical reasons last semester but they still made me pay all the tuition. I don’t think that’s an option.
I meant I still need to pay the tuition even if I withdraw this semester.
If I were you, I would drop any lower-division courses and breadths. You can always take them at CC (unlike the upper-division). Just keep the econ 100a and 100b if you think you can pass them. Try to reach out to the professor and apply for DSP. Maybe, the professor will be lenient and give you some clobber policy, so you can make up for your missed midterm.

You should definitely apply for DSP because it will help you in future semesters.
Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I was actually leaning towards dropping one of the upper divisions just because they are the main sources of stress and I don’t really need to take them anymore. I think I should drop 100b and p/np 100a."

# The 21 Essential Things To Do

* **Go thrifting at Urban Ore** *This place has more doors than Monsters Inc. It has even more toilets than it has doors, and all of those toilets are terrible, but checking them out is always the highlight of my visit. There’s a cat that hangs out among the bins full of paintings. Beware of Urban Ore if you have a rust-related phobia.*
* **Trespass on the Pier at the Berkeley Marina** *Actually, don’t do that. While I’ve visited many times, I’ve yet to jump the fence. The pier was originally built as a ferry dock to San Francisco, and on Big Game days traffic would be backed all the way up University as a result. The pier itself is massively long (originally 3.5 miles) and stretches towards Alcatraz. It’s mostly rotting now, but I think that the city council is considering rebuilding it, so fingers crossed that we’ll be able to set foot on it someday. In terms of things that you can appreciate more legally, consider throwing a barbecue or visiting the turkeys. On the way out you’ll notice how terrible the road is. My Uber driver once told me that this is because so many people would drag race up and down that they just stopped repairing it, and now driving it is an awful experience for everyone.*
* **Eat Tacos While Watching a Rose Garden Sunset** *This one feels pretty basic, but it’s remarkable how many people I know who haven’t ever given it a visit. One of Berkeley’s best civic installations, I think. Roses bloom between March and graduation, so get out there!!!*
* **Smell at corpse flower at the** [**Botanical Gardens**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/10/outdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden/?utm_email=34FD247564A7C51334A8C5E2AC&g2i_eui=6RGiZLQu26%2b7Ly8ImNGZHaWcBJW7A3VR&g2i_source=newsletter&utm_source=listrak&utm_medium=email&utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.mercurynews.com%2f2020%2f08%2f10%2foutdoors-6-hidden-gems-to-explore-at-berkeleys-uc-botanical-garden%2f&utm_campaign=bang-mult-nl-morning-report-nl&utm_content=manual) *Depressingly few Berkeley students take advantage of the fact that admission is free for them. You probably won’t be able to see the corpse flower since it only blooms every seven years (though you can see the plant in its non-flowering state--the entire thing is just one leaf that looks like a tree), but you’ll still be able to appreciate the Chinese Medicinal Herb Garden and the extremely specific ailments that each plant soothes. Pretend to get married under the trellis in the Garden of Old Roses. Resist the temptation to steal a vegetable from the edible garden. Buy me a succulent at the garden store (or look for the pencils I designed that are carried there!) Read Paradise Lost on a bench at the top overlooking all of Berkeley. Look for salamanders in the Japanese pond. Find the petrified tree log. Appreciate how well-kept the Bamboo Path is. And if you find pineapple sage, please bring me some.*
* **Save Hundreds While Shopping for Spices in the Sari District** *I don’t think that anybody calls it the Sari District beyond me and my friends. If you’ve ever taken the 51B down University though, you’ll probably have noticed that there are like three sari stores and three Indian grocery stores all clustered together. There is no better place to buy spices in all of Berkeley. If shopping is a social experience for you, as it is for me, it can be fun spending 30 minutes appreciating the massive selection that these stores offer, and if you plan on celebrating Diwali, also pick up some rangoli powder and candles!*
* **Spend a day in Tilden** *That there are some fantastic hikes up here is a given--I’ll let you find those on your own. There are several other things to try out up here though:*

>• Walk the rim of Lake Anza  
>  
>• Hunt for mushrooms  
>  
>• Visit the Little Farm (it’s a petting zoo I think?)  
>  
>• Ride the Carousel

* **Find the Weirdest Artifact in Elmwood**  *There are some strange stores up here. Foremost is Tail of the Yak, David Sedaris’ favorite shop in Berkeley, which has several live birds in cages. There’s also a very cool Ohlone art gallery, some famous bookstores, and usually way too many kids. While you’re here, grab a chocolate sample from Casa de Chocolates and find the weirdest ice cream flavor at Humphrey Slocombe (my favorite so far is candy cap mushroom brownie). Also check out the indie comic book store and Star Grocery on Claremont Avenue.*
* **Fly a kite at Caesar Chavez Park**
* **Allow a Monitor Lizard to Inspect your Soul at the East Bay Vivarium** *And while you’re there, explore 4th street.*
* **Try a new Fruit at Berkeley Bowl** *I love their pomelos. Quinces boiled in sugar and cinnamon are also excellent, and, if you haven’t ever tried cactus fruit, consider a prickly pear. Or a buddha’s hand. Don’t get cherimoya fruit though—I accidentally dropped $11 on a single one the other week, not realizing exactly what I was getting into. I exchanged it for a bag of roasted peanuts and an $8 return. They also have an impressive selection of roots that I can’t even begin to appreciate (though I did once try their Taiwanese burdock just because it was so absurdly long), and their quick-sell rack has produce for less than $1. If it’s the right time of year you can also find Turkish delight.*
* **Contemplate the Economics of** [***BioFuel Oasis***](https://biofueloasis.com/) *One of the Bay Area’s fabled biodiesel stations, located on Ashby west of campus. My professor had a story about a guy who would drive here all the way from Menlo Park, and use up half of the gas he bought each time just driving there and back.*
* **Crash an End-of-Year Barbecue at Bowles** *I don’t think their parties are exclusive? I’ve never asked. It’s a tradition though, and they’d probably be happy to have you.*
* **Or even better: Attend Dinner at Cloyne Court. Sign Your Soul Over to the BSC. And Then Escape.** *Green Day, No Doubt, and Elliott Smith all played here, back when the punk scene in Berkeley was alive and well, and back when Cloyne wasn’t substance-free. This repurposed hotel, which I have written about many times before, was designed by John Galen Howard (the guy who designed the Campanile and many other buildings on campus--note the resemblance to North Gate Hall!) and named for Cloyne, Ireland, the town from which Bishop George Berkeley (!!!) hailed. They have a sauna and ghost stories and some of the strangest culture you’ll find anywhere in Berkeley. Read literally anything that I wrote in* [*Spring 2020*](https://elbow99.substack.com/p/now-that-we-live-in-a-co-op-we-cant) *because there’s no way I can even begin to scratch the history of the building here.*
* **Witness 4/20 on Memorial Glade** *Whatever your relationship with weed, it’s a sight to behold. I was on Bechtel Terrace, attending English 165, on 4/20/20 at 4:20. I observed that a national pandemic didn’t stop them. The year prior, Cal Day would have fallen on 4/20, but there was no way they’d let parents onto campus that day so they changed it back to 4/13.*
* **Peruse the film archive at the BAMPFA** *This is another opportunity that woefully few students take advantage of. They have both rotating and stationary exhibits, and at the start of each school year they give out free pizza and posters. Visiting the library is fun regardless of how much you know about film (for instance, who isn’t interested in at least the \*idea\* of Soviet animation), and you can also go to artsy film screenings put on by the BAMPFA student committee.*
* **Watch the moon rise over the Berkeley Hills** *Sunrises are overrated, and our view is blocked by the hills anyway. Moonrises are, in my opinion, just as beautiful, though they’re much more difficult to catch because the moon 1) goes through phrases and 2) rises an hour later each night, so it takes a lot of planning to catch it. On the right night, the tendrils of clouds in the hills will appear to catch fire, and it’s surreal to see an orb appear to melt in reverse, warped by the shape of the hills. To catch the moon rising, look up the day’s moonrise, and expect to see it rise above IHouse. When you’re further from the hills, it will appear to rise sooner (because the hills will be comparatively closer to the horizon)--at the Berkeley Marina for instance, a 7:22 moonrise might actually occur around 7:30. If you’re trying to catch it across from Kroeber, expect to have to wait 40 more minutes.*
* **Buy something you didn’t need at the Berkeley Flea Market, or any one of the farmer’s markets** *You’ve probably stumbled into one of these by accident at least once. There’s a craft fair on Telegraph most weekends in December, a permanent flea market on Ashby each Saturday, and three farmers markets scattered across Berkeley throughout the week. At the very least, try some cheese samples.*
* **Spend a memorable Halloween or Valentine’s Day participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the UC Theater** *If you’re looking for a more mellow event, go to a concert at Cornerstone. I saw Summer Salt, Motel Radio, and Kid Bloom for $15 total. This is one of my favorite Berkeley venues.*
* **Befriend a cat a Sleepy Cat Books** *They only want to be your friend. The owner is also really nice. And look for the rest of Berkeley’s indie bookstores:*

>• Revolution Books *You might have seen their iconic corner signs on Telegraph. Here, the counterculture is alive and well.*  
>  
>• Moe’s  *If you’re looking for other locations featured in The Graduate, there’s also Sproul, Theta Delta Chi, and that boarding house on Dana and Channing*  
>  
>• Pegasus  
>

* **Stop into a store you’ve never visited on Shattuck or Telegraph** *At the least, every Berkeley resident should be able to say they’ve set foot inside of Amoeba or Games of Berkeley. J-town is good for snacks. If you’re closer to Northside, Victory Point Cafe is an acceptable substitution.*

# Weird Berkeley History and Rabbit Holes To Explore & Visit

Because of the nature of rabbit holes, I’m going to keep this section light so that you can discover each story for yourself.

* **What Was Formerly Barrington Hall** *Okay the stories about this place are WILD. Barrington (located near the Academy of Psychic Studies) used to be one of the houses in the Berkeley Student Cooperative. Steve Wozniak was a resident. Among other things, it was significant to the Berkeley punk rock scene, and maybe the heart of Berkeley counter culture itself. The cooperative was notorious for its non-stop partying and general lack of personal accountability (it was hard to say who was and wasn’t a resident) and eventually was shut down. There are stories of a python that escaped in the house, the “Hell Summer” that ensued when the BSC tried to crack down on the cooperative, and it birthed my favorite quote, “the poetry reading is out of control,” uttered by a police officer as Barrington residents took their last stand against eviction.* [*Here’s*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/countercultures-last-stand/#what-were-the-problems) *where I’d begin, though as with all good research, the real facts are in the footnotes. Also be sure to read the* [*response*](https://ejinjue.org/green-book/responses/fall-of-barrington-hall/)*. It’s hard to say how things really were, since Barrington is often used as a scapegoat for counter-culture itself, but we can be certain that it was a wild ride. Some of its legacy lives on in Casa Zimbabwe (and for a while, in Cloyne, although since the university owns the building they were able to crack down on the drug culture and it’s now substance and punk rock-free) and at 924 Gilman.*
* **2603 Benvenue #4, or, more famously, the apartment from which Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army** *This is a private residence, so if you visit please just glance at it before moving on. I make an annual pilgrimage here while listening to American Heiress by Jeffrey Toobin. I think a lot of my generation is unfamiliar with the story (I only came across it while listening to an interview with Terry Gross), but it was one of the most high-profile kidnappings in California history. To begin, I recommend the aforementioned book--it’s good audio for walking around Berkeley, though I think that Tobin held a certain amount of disdain for his subject--or even just Wikipedia. There’s a lot to dig into.*
* **Unabomber’s Cottage (2628-A Regent Street)** *He only taught here for two uneventful years, but somehow he’s inextricable from the Berkeley Identity. You can find your own way to this rabbit hole. While you can’t walk up to the cottage itself, you can catch a glimpse of it behind a gate. I’m unsure of whether they ever let strangers visit.*
* **Or if you’re looking for something wholesome, this Cal student’s** [**blog**](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eldrin/index.html) **from 1999** *This is truly a gem. This student wrote about his insecurities and friendships candidly. As a student who also writes, it’s so fun and strange to see many of my own thoughts written out two decades before I ever thought them. His photos are also excellent--there are a few shots of parts of campus that don’t exist anymore. Aashna and I did some sleuthing and found his LinkedIn profile today, and it seems that he’s accomplished all of his dreams and more. In a time of uncertainty--both in my life and in my country’s history--it really meant a lot that I was able to read his story and see that things turned out alright for him.*

# Trips By Bus

* El Cerrito--Sunset View Mortuary  *Find the oldest headstone. Spend 20 minutes at the Mausoleum at the top of the hill--inside it’s spacious and light-filled--and see how much you can learn about local history just by reading the names and symbols that appear on the memorial plaques. On Sundays they give sermons, and it’s haunting to hear the words echoing through the halls. You don’t need to listen closely.*
* Oakland—Mountain View Cemetery *This was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead--the same guy responsible for Central Park and, unfortunately, the Stanford University campus. Ghirardelli was buried here! Unfortunately the Cemetery itself is closed to the public, and I have some… mixed feelings about that, but the Mausoleum is open and it’s worth the trip. It’s a Julia Morgan building (she was buried behind it, and so was Bernard Maybeck) and I can’t believe that some of the rooms are indoors--they’re filled with plants and mosaics and water installations. It’s gothic, but it’s also uniquely Californian.*
* Albany—Albany Bulb *This is one of my favorite trips I’ve ever taken--I’ve been thrice now. This former landfill was home to an art community for several decades. You can still go visit their installations if you’re willing to do a little bit of exploration. There’s a labyrinth, dragons made of driftwood, and giant sculptures made of twisted metal. It’s a quiet place. Definitely read up on its* [*history*](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/albany-bulb) *before you go.*
* Albany—TEPCO Beach *This Albany beach is littered with porcelain. It was the former dumping ground for a ceramics company. When I went I was only able to find four different colors of porcelain (the periwinkle is beautiful), not including algae-stained shards and sea glass, but maybe you can do better? The shards with the Tepco logo printed on them are highly collectible.*
* Oakland—Lake Merritt  *Surrounded by interesting things on all sides. There’s a bonsai garden, tropical garden, community garden, and creepy Children’s Playland.*
* Oakland—[Phap Duyen Tu](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phap-duyen-tu-buddha-shrine-of-oakland) *This place has one of the most interesting origins of any of the sites I’m mentioning here. Some guy was tired of neighbors dumping trash on his cul de sac, so he put out a statue of Buddha hoping it would commend some respect for his corner. While he himself was non-religious, the local Buddhist community adopted the statue and gradually began building a shrine around it. What started out as weekly offerings slowly became more elaborate, and today the shrine draws worshippers every morning.*
* Oakland—Jack London Square *I’d sometimes find myself here after shows at the Fox Theater. There are lots of great plaques to read, if you’re into that. There’s also a fantastic Thai restaurant--at the least, try one of their desserts--a replica of Jack London’s Alaskan cabin, and plenty of quiet docks to watch the water from.*

# Scenic Walks

* Codornices back trails *Find the fence covered in paintings on the northern end of the park. There’s also a beautiful glade of wild onion flowers that gets trampled every year by seniors taking photos, don’t be like them.*
* Ohlone Park & Berkeley Greenway; bike it to Solano or Richmond *You’ll pass community gardens, dog parks, and street art.*
* Albany Hill
* [Mark’s Yard Art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mark-oliviers-yard-art)
* Blake Gardens
* Orchard Lane
* Berkeley [**Poetry**](http://berkeleyplaques.org/plaque/poetry-garden/?cat=33) **Garden** *Ginsburg was here. Kerouac too. Maybe you someday. Probably not.*
* Big C & fire trails.  *If you’re lucky, you might encounter some goats in the hills.*
* Wander the neighborhoods of North Berkeley *I usually start on Euclid to the Rose Walk (which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps) and from there take as many staircases as possible. There’s a Monastery with a fantastic view of the Bay if you can find it, and Grizzly Peak Blvd, not to be confused with Grizzly Peak Overlook, is one of my favorite places to catch the sunset. If earthquakes and finances weren’t an issue, would you live here?*
* **Berkeley Rock Parks** *I like grabbing a chicken sandwich and potato puffs from Gregoire’s before embarking on a journey to any one of these:*

>Live Oak Park (good for lunch dates since it’s near Gourmet Ghetto)  
>  
>Indian Rock  
>  
>The vastly underrated Mortar Rock Park  
>  
>Grotto Rock  
>  
>Cragmont Rock (good for rappelling if you have the equipment)  
>  
>Remillard  
>  
>Great Stoneface Park (explore Thousand Oaks--look for the urns designating the turn-of-the-century boundaries, as well as the indentations in the rock where Ohlone people would grind acorns) & all of the natural boulders worked into the neighborhood nearby  
>  
>John Hinkel Park (sometimes an outdoor music venue; pretty, ivy-covered walkways. I’d call it romantic.)","I throw this in since I used to work there when I was an undergrad:

Check out the archives and the Bancroft Library. There's a bunch of really cool old and rare books and a lot of Cal related historical documents. You can't check anything out of the building though, you can only look at it in the reading room.
To add onto the bit about fire trails:

This section in particular (starts from the stadium, goes up to Grizzly Peak) is my absolute favorite hike in the entire area. It's a pretty steep climb but if you're a good hiker or runner then it should be very doable. 6ish miles roundtrip. When you get up into the hills you can see a huge chunk of the East Bay and into SF - and then you realize how small Berkeley is compared to the rest of the world. It's also a great place to meditate.

Walking across the Golden Gate, and looking at Berkeley/Campanile tower is an amazing perspective! Then go up the tower, and look back at the Golden Gate.
1) stay up all night watching stars at Fire Trails contemplating just how big the universe is

2) storm the field after a Big Game victory


3) eat a Top Dog after a long day of classes. As you order, think about how you’re standing right where Steve Wozniak would have ordered his first Top Dog. Don’t think too long, or the cashier/chef might yell at you 

4) Build something cool. Even if it’s stupid and you’re the only one that will ever appreciate it. It’s worth it
The pier trespassing is dangerous... Could end up with someone dying. I don't recommend.
You know, I feel like I'd appreciate this a lot more if I wasn't stuck at home for my last semester :( 

great list, though, and maybe I'll just have to come back after I graduate...
Find someone who has a code to the Essex Baths.

See a concert at the redwood grove

Meditate at the Berkeley zen center (can combine with a trip to Berkeley bowl)

Attend the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary Easter celebration hosted by the Nuns of perpetual indulgence.

Find the concrete slide in the Castro. Take a walking tour while you're at it.

Swim at the hearst women's gym pool at least once - it's covered in marble and old statues, and has a great view of the campus.

Catch the art students' semesterly print sale days. Extremely cheap awesome art.

Speaking of art, you can check out a priceless piece from the University - and switch it out every once in a while for something new.

Not quite Berkeley specific, but gaze at the stars while taking a late-night cliffside swim at the Esalen center.

Go go Land's End. It's beautiful.

Take advantage of the SF museums. They're fantastic. They also do free days every so often, if you don't want to pay ridiculous admission fees. Just get there early.

Children's Fairyland is not creepy! It's cute, and it's over 70 years old, which is cool. Rumor has it that it inspired Walt Disney when he was planning Disneyland.
A must do for any EECS undergraduate

Spend an all nighter in the depths of Soda Hall working on cs project due the next day
Wow I grew up in Berkeley and gotta say you've hit practically every spot I can think of! I personally also enjoy Panoramic Way as a walk up to a nice view, and would add Point Isabel to the list of places to visit if you're into dogs.

Really enjoyed reading this and extra thanks for sharing the 1999 blog
It's a very minor point, but ""find a strange fruit"" might be better worded ""find rare fruit"" or ""find unusual fruit"".
this is very helpful for people who havent visited campus yet cuz of covid, thanks!
Watch a football game from T1GHTWAD HILL!
Thanks for these excellent suggestions! I just checked out *American Heiress* on your recommendation. As an undergrad, my friend John used to live in that apartment - I think he said they still had bullet holes in the wall.
Adding on:

\- Read a book in Morrison Library

\- Visit Cheeseboard Pizza at least once (but probably 100+ times).

\- Get sushi at Kirala

\- Take BART to SF on a free weekday and explore the city, visit the de Young or Legion of Honor, get lunch, go to Blue Bottle Coffee at the Mint

\- Visit the Old Rose Garden at the Botanical Garden in May -- all the roses are in bloom and it is stunning

\- Swim at Strawberry Canyon pool in spring/summer

\- Visit a coffee shop so many times that the staff know you

\- Take grad pictures around campus; cliche, but as an alum, I LOVE having these
As a 2020 transfer, this is very sad. Hopefully I can stay in the area after graduating and doing some of these next year.
22. Not get rejected

~ An applicant preemptively crying over my rejection this thursday
Should have included attend the Big Game!
Underground steam tunnels should be there too
Mostly food related—

Get some food from the Buddhist temple in South Berkeley, Vik’s Chaat, Ethiopian food (Addis; might be in Oakland).  

Tilden—play golf/whack a bucket of balls at the driving range.  It’s a pretty course and the three-tier driving range is pretty cool.

Bike the bike trail along 580 to Richmond and check out the Rosie the Riveter installation.  If you are lucky, a park ranger will be present to answer questions.

Ride your bike around town at night.  It’s fun!

Frolf.

Do the sake tour (if it’s open).

Berkeley Bowl—best grocery store EVER.  Get the Odoriko tomatoes if they have them.

Kirala—chawan mushi is like an ocean French kiss.
This is the coolest post ever, thank you

-freshman at berkeley
For now, I've got one that you probably know too well by now:

Your home. 


Stay home, please? 
We need this thing to go away.
Hey, I love you and this post
This is so beautiful. Tysm <3
god i miss trawling through urban ore on a sunny day 

the south berkeley farmer's market is also amazing too and if u have calfresh u can get $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce!!!
While you're at the Rose Garden, go through the tunnel by the tennis courts to Cordonices Park and ride down the concrete slide on a piece of cardboard. There are usually a few pieces lying at the bottom. (Do not attempt sans cardboard.)
“Does anybody here remember Barrington Hall? Does anybody here remember Barrington?”

—Primus
You should add in some stuff in San Francisco since it's easily accessible to us. Great list for Berkeley though- both the campus and the wider city.
Have ramen at Marufuku in Japantown :D
this is late but what’s wrong with cherimoya?
This is one of the best posts I've seen on things to do, ever. Thank you stranger! Making me reminisce on so many positive memories of Berkeley + the Bay area. Truly unlimited things to do. I feel so thankful. If I do even teeny fraction of these things, I will be happy<3
Isn't Bancroft closed to people without special access? I tried going in during 2019 but they didn't let me :(

&#x200B;

Will add to check out all the Berkeley libraries, Doe itself has at least 4 smaller libraries within it.
I adore that trail, but good god that one slope midway though is terrifying
hope you'll be able to visit someday; most of these things will probably be here once you do (: and I hope your last semester goes as well as it can!
the heart women's gym/pool is a fascinating and beautiful old building!! i had no idea it existed until i took a final in there lol
the man's had a glorious career, there is no doubt! didn't know about his involvement in UC directly though (beyond the work in Claremont), most of my knowledge only goes as far back as John Galen Howard. very cool!
children's fairyland was my childhood. no disney could ever attempt the beauty of that place tbh.
not just a rumor, that's a fact! and I should have corrected that by now haha my Oakland neighbor who reads my newsletters said the same. unfortunately I can only speak from my experience walking around it when it's closed due to covid, and that's a bit eerie. always wanted to go inside, maybe someday /:
That place is terrifying and it made me scared as shit of puppets. So I have to disagree with you
Previously WEB. Previously 260 Evans.
I hate that I did this, but also glad I did for the experience lmao. CS projects and all-nighters mix well together
updated; is ""strange fruit"" used as a euphemism on the regular? I haven't ever heard it outside of the context of the song
Because of the association with the protest / anti-lynching song?
oh whoa that's wild!! cool that they preserved the history, but also kind of disturbing, but also I'd totally pay to set foot inside and see (': and I hope that you like American Heiress! Toobin is fairly well-respected, but it's clear that he's got a certain angle and sometimes the way that he editorialized to that was annoying.  Kind of reminded me of listening to Serial honestly--good storytelling and the character of the people really comes through, but you also have to wonder what they're leaving out. I'd love to read Patricia Hearst's memoir if I ever come across it!
I also recently learned that Morrison Library loans out original artworks to students! If I were a student again I would definitely take advantage of this.
Wait how do you find these?
many of these are fine to visit in a mask, I think we all agree that we need this to go away but depriving your life of all pleasure until then is not the way to go about it
it was $11 for one fruit lol
Haha yeah - I remember the first time I went there and tried to run up it. Even to this day I still remember how difficult that was!
It's a commonly understood phrase, yes. The song was capturing a phrase used at the time, and it is used sometimes now.
Because of its association with lynching, of which that song is part. The phrase exists beyond the song.
https://youtu.be/Web007rzSOI

For anyone who has not heard this Billie Holiday classic.
I'll be relieved if Toobin doesn't hypnotize me into jerking off in public.

Look for the steam
oh lol I didn’t see the word “accidentally” until now
Indeed it does. Even beyond that historical meaning. The context OP provided rendered it harmless.
As an art historian I agree with your comment completely! Glad that you were not charged. Out of curiosity, what was the work?
I totally understand your position, I didn't think it was malicious by OP"
Math 1A or Math 1B over the summer (with R5B)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nm8zl5/math_1a_or_math_1b_over_the_summer_with_r5b/,2021-05-27 07:42:21,"Hello! So I’m an incoming freshman planning to take R5B over the summer and either Math 1A or Math 1B. I took AP Calc AB back in junior year and got a 5. It’s been two years since AB since I took a gap year, so I’ve been doing problems and going section by section through my old calc textbook, which covers both AB and, toward the latter parts, BC material. I’m about 1/3rd of the way through the textbook and will finish all AB and some BC material by the time Session C starts.

Should I take Math 1A or 1B? I’m primarily concerned about what grading might look like since I’m not sure who’s teaching Math 1B, and what the workload might look like with R5B combined with 1B. I also heard Paulin’s an amazing professor and kind of want to experience it myself in the fall.

General thoughts on which math I should take? And is it worth waiting to take 1B with Paulin?

As of right now, I intend to apply to Haas, so if I’m not wrong, CC probably isn’t an option.","If you take Math 1B at a CC before you enter, ie this summer, Haas will accept that as your math prereq. Once you start classes at Berkeley, then CC prereqs are not accepted by Haas.  And yes, you should take the 1B or 1B equivalent."
So your AC Transit EasyPass fouled up on the second week of classes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pgvo9o/so_your_ac_transit_easypass_fouled_up_on_the/,2021-09-02 18:58:33,"***So here's what I know so far, mods can you please pin this to the top:***

* Most AC Transit Pass numbers converted over to the following year. It's the 12 digit number on the back of the card
* Some did not, and this is not new. This is a Clipper (Regional Transit Agency/metropolitan Planning/Clipper Owner) and Cubic (Clipper Vendor) issue. Happens every year
* However, the pandemic might have caused an issue too since many cards have not be implemented in 520-ish days (AC Transit went fare free March 31 to October 19, 2020 - many students still did not come back until this past Spring or Summer).
* Transferring your EasyPass Cards to the mobile phone app has had issues with the institutional pass. The card is bricked if you do this. This problem has been around since the Summer when the apps had been released.

***So what are your options?***

* [This is an overview of the Class Pass program,](https://pt.berkeley.edu/StudentEasypass) including steps to deal with lost or replaced cards, especially those with balances.
* It's a very good idea to [register your Clipper Cards with the Clipper Card website.](https://clippercard.com)
* [Use discretion if you want to transfer your card over to the phone.](https://pt.berkeley.edu/EasyPassAug21) If you change your mind, you could go to the P&T office for a free replacement (but no telling when the free replacement turns over, likely when the institutional passes can be added with no issue).
* Make sure you tap the card on an AC Transit bus before contacting P&T. Chances are that it does work, chances are that applying the update to 630 buses is easier said than done.
* If the card charged you a fare, that means the card probably did not turn over when it was supposed to. Contact AC Transit for a refund, but after you've gotten the card reactivated or replaced.
* [Email Parking & Transportation](mailto:prktrans@berkeley.edu) or call. The office hours are 7:30-4 Weekdays (closed Labor Day). **Provide them with your Cal1Card number and the EasyPass Clipper Card number.**
* Getting the cards reactivated has been ongoing, but it may take a day to upload. Again, 630 buses with the terminals updated on wifi is easier said than done. 

***Other things to keep in mind.***

* [AC Transit is Free on Friday.](https://www.actransit.org/article/fare-free-fridays)
* Your Cal1 Card is still Valid on [Bear Transit Shuttles](https://pt.berkeley.edu/beartransit)
* [BART is 50% off through the entire month of September.](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2021/news20210726-1)
* I would suggest [emailing the AC Transit Board](mailto:myvoice@actransit.org) ([Individual Board Members Here](https://www.actransit.org/board-of-directors)) and the [MTC Board](https://mtc.ca.gov/about-mtc/committees/interagency-committees/clipperr-executive-board) to express your disapproval on this transition. 
* Sign up with [Seamless Bay Area](https://seamlessbayarea.org) and [East Bay Transit Riders Union](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjN6Mzk2eHyAhV1sjEKHcAtCnQQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Febtru.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw2gC-u7q6A8Olg3_MWaFnKr) and volunteer to assist with better implementation of programs like these (including fare integration with the other 27 transit agencies).","Thanks for the info👍
Just a heads up for those trying to get a refund -- AC Transit's customer service told me that ""they have no information about this technical issue"" and for me to get a refund on any of my charges on their buses, I'll have to physically visit their main office at 1600 Franklin St. in Oakland. I really hope the school can process a lot of this for us...
Contacted AC transit, they said to ""take it up to UCB"" because it's ""not their fault"" the card failed to renew, so they're not responsible for giving refunds. 

Contacted prktrans afterwards, they said to ""take it up to AC transit"" because it's ""not their fault"" the card failed to renew, and they don't issue refunds in the first place. 

Love me a Kafkaesque situation at 8 AM 😪 Might just have to take the L on the $8 I spent this weekend
https://pt.berkeley.edu/EasyPassAug21
Update on this: got to talk to multiple staff at P&T today — they said that they usually don’t do refunds or reimbursements, but since this is a mistake on someone’s end (didn’t directly acknowledge if it was their fault or AC Transit’s fault), they’ll likely announce some form of “policy” that will sound something like “we’ll cover bus fares from these dates up to x dollars”. 

It’s not a hard promise but sounds like progress to me! They took down my card number and name etc. so I hope they have updates for us soon.
There will be an update sooner than later. Thanks for your patience."

**Caution should be exercised in making any intercampus comparisons or ranking schools because university/college crime statistics are affected by a variety of factors.

~~I leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions.~~

On second thought, that may not be wise. I doubt most people will actually read the data. I'll just come out and say it: the rhetoric around crime is a bit overblown.","I put one of the FBI tables in excel and checked each [crime per 10,000](https://imgur.com/a/MjxLM8Y) students enrolled*.  That way you can compare UCs on a per capita basis.  In some cases I abbreviated the crime description.  (Ex: ""murder"" includes non-negligent manslaughter)

*EDIT: For UCs only
Despite less than some other colleges, a lot of crime is still a lot of crime.
Not gonna lie, the UCLA numbers are absolutely shocking to me. I was under the impression that Westwood was incredibly safe and much, much safer than Cal.

That said, most people didn't complain about crime until last year. Crime in Berkeley (and the whole bay area) has gotten a lot worse year since 2019. This is a national trend, though, so I'm not sure how badly the other UCs were affected.
Keep in mind that a lot of these campuses are a lot more isolated than UC Berkeley, a fairly open campus in the middle of a small city.
this is just like that ""division of diversity and inclusion is taking funding away from eecs"" circlejerk that happened on this subreddit a few months ago where a bunch of berkeley kids decided to make up a narrative with zero evidence
Yeah can you summarize...I don't have time to click on all those...

EDIT: I appreciate OP taking the time to collect all of these links! Apologies for my flippant tone, I didn't meant to sound ungrateful. When visiting this site on my phone, opening these links is very time-consuming and difficult because it doesn't open in tabs, it opens new websites or sometimes downloads something which takes a lot of time and often my phone then won't let me open it (not your fault of course, but still frustrating). A bit of extra work on OP's part will probably get their point across better and reach more people!
Santa Barbara not lookin' good with all those rapes. Yeeeeesh.
Are these crimes only listed when students were the victim, or just in the area in general? It could explain why SF appears so high if they're counting just crimes in the general area.
It seems like Berkeley is at or near the top for most crimes. LA might also have a problem though.
It's a difference in visual expectation. Westwood looks bougie af, while Berkeley looks jank af. You're trained to judge the janky place as more dangerous. But really think of it from the criminal's perspective.

For one, Los Angeles is a far bigger urban area than east bay, and therefore there is just a higher population of criminals nearby.

Secondly, if you want to rob someone, would you not target the bougie area with a bunch of affluent sheltered young adults who may have no idea how to keep themselves safe?

There's a reason USC built a whole ass wall around their campus.
based on the last 4 links, Berkeley has less crime than UCLA and is not the most dangerous UC campus
For the UC publications, click ""clery crime statistics"" located on the table of contents.  Page 73 for Berkeley and page 60 for UCLA.  The FBI one is just a table.
Damn, Auntie Barbara, what’s happening there
I strongly suspect it is only crimes against students.  Otherwise they'd have to define a perimeter in which the crimes occurred.  Also, the stats given are too low for the entire city: zero murders in LA and SF for example.
I 100% believe that and am not surprised.
Totally believe that! I just think a screenshot rather than lots of links and instructions for how to get there would be a bit more accessible.
Well, they could be using reports from UCPD, for example, who has some perimeter around the school where they report crimes. The SF numbers just seem so high (especially for property crime) compared to the other locations.
Yeah UCSF does show very high per capita property crime.  It ranks around the middle for instances of property crime but the enrollment is about a magnitude lower than many other campuses.  I'm not entirely surprised since vandals will break car windows apparently for no reason.  You can walk along the sidewalk anywhere at any time of day and see a row of cars with broken windows.  I know several people for whom it's happened multiple times.  A guy I know gets his car keyed all the time.  My friends have had their garbage cans stolen, stupid stuff like that.  Oh but one friend's residence was destroyed by arson.  Someone walked along his street one night setting house after house on fire.  He almost went to UCSF so he alone could've supplied >1% of the property crime reports.

One aspect to consider is that the same person could be the victim of property crime multiple times.  Even so, that stat is unrealistically high compared to the other campuses so there must be a nuance I'm not considering, such as what you suggested."
[vent] I want to rip my hair out,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eczzxy/vent_i_want_to_rip_my_hair_out/,2019-12-19 13:46:12,"I asked my GSI to reconsider the grade she gave me for a paper because she made mistakes. I ended up regaining those points but losing points elsewhere. It was a net loss of 2.5% of the paper’s grade.

I might fail my Math 1A (Paulin) final tomorrow. I’ve spent ~$300 in 1-on-1 tutoring in preparation of this exam. I’ve also been to the prof’s office hours, the GSI’s office hours, the SLC. I’ve read the textbook, watched the prof’s videos, watched videos from Khan Academy and various YouTube math channels. I’ve never missed lecture or discussion even though they don’t help. I think I have a D in the class at the moment. I need to pass this class to declare my major and I must declare by the end of this semester; “If you entered Berkeley as a junior level transfer, you must declare the major [psychology] no later than your first semester at UC Berkeley.”

My parents gave me a $1000/mo budget to find a sparkly clean single bedroom apartment with “no homeless people in the area.” When I told them that that was unrealistic, they said that I’d need to stay at home. My commute is 3 hours a day.

Is anyone feeling like shit right now or is it just me?

UPDATE 1: I think I may have passed the calculus class.  The final definitely fucked me up but I actually fully solved 1 problem (out of 10) so that feels nice ngl. I’ll come back and update you guys once the grade is posted.

UPDATE 2: I passed... with a C?! I was NOT expecting that! 😳","I apologize, as I'm not altogether familiar with the same pressures that you are presently facing, but I will say that it certainly seems like a great myriad of poor circumstances that make it quite difficult. When it comes to grading and re-grading, it is always a game of chance when it comes to rectifying mistakes made on the part of the grader that the grader may find other places where points may have been awarded that they disagree with - I make no specific comment on your specific situation, but I will say that I am flush with friends and colleagues anecdotes on punitive grading so if that was the implication, I don't totally rule it out.

For your math course, you've not yet taken your final, and I am not wholly privy to the details and extent of your performance in the class. For now, I wouldn't worry yourself with the later, only that you've time still to do what studying you think necessary and to do your best on the final tomorrow. Without sacrificing your overall plan, certainly keep it in mind, do not let your worries about performance tomorrow become a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I have no critique or advice about your work ethic, it sounds like you are doing your best and having a rough go of it, and there is no shame in having done your best. That's the rather simplistic form of that, but I really hope you'll do your best through tomorrow and see yourself to the end of this, because that's a victory in and of itself.

Everyone feels the crunch at this time, and it really pains me to see so many people struggle and suffer through these times. You don't need me to tell you any of this, of course, but I remember from my own time when I was floundering that it's nice just to know people hear you and don't turn their noses up or act high and mighty.

I believe in you, friend.
hey! You can actually ask for an extension to declare from the psychology department and they will most likely give it you, if you email them. They're really understanding, some transfers I know did not declare till their 2nd semester and they were just fine. good luck with everything ):
[removed]
You can get an extension on declaring, just talk to your advisor. However, do you think you'd be better off by taking Spring semester off to take Math 1A and Stat 2 at your community college? You can fulfill the quantitative reqs that way. There's no shame in doing that. Berkeley's giant classes are not a great way to learn math.

You should also talk to your parents about using your 1000 to get a room. That's too little for a 1bd, but it's enough for a single in an apartment. You can get a room in a university-owned apartment since you get 1 year of guaranteed housing, hopefully that's enough. There's no reason to go to Berkeley if your commute's ruining any chance of getting involved on campus or in research labs.

&#x200B;

what an asshole TA lol.
Good response from op above   


Also whenever you get your test back, you go through that shit with a magnifying glass. Yeah you can get a regrade, but you better be sure that their regrade doesn't turn up anymore points to be taken away.   


$1k /month budget for a room is not impossible, you just can't live by yourself.   


Also if you fail, it's not the end. Idk about Psychology Dept but other Dept's have been more than gracious to be flexible when it came to switching/declaring majors. (I was undeclared till end of junior year so..........)
I hope you’re right! Maybe next semester I’ll have the support that I need to continue, otherwise this whole Berkeley thing isn’t worth it.
Should I email them before receiving my calc grade or after? Because I’m not sure if I passed the class yet
The problem is that the parents then withdrew the offer of $1k a month. Sometimes you need to fib a little because commuting 3 hours a day is far worse than not being in a sparkly clean single bedroom apartment.
this is the first piece of legitimate advice i've heard from this man
They have specific expectations that I didn’t mention. It’s nearly impossible to find what my mom wants, and I feel like throwing in the towel. Getting up at 5:30am might not be so bad after a few months, right?

I also just really need to get away from them because they’re abusive.

I want to be closer to the campus community. I want to live with people who will become my friends for life. I currently have no friends and it sucks booty.
God community college classes were so much better, people actually want to help you there and I strongly rely on my peers for emotional and academic support

I wouldn’t be able to take a semester off because I’m premed and it’s already taking a long time. Plus, my mom would probably kick me out. She is only paying for things because I’m following her instructions

It’s not enough for a single in an apartment! The rare times that it is, it’s too dirty for my mom’s taste, or something else bothers her enough to say that I can’t live there :/
Damn I wish I had you before I took that stupid test
No, it’s typical course policy that is usually written out in the syllabus. This is to stop frivolous regrade requests. If someone feels that the grading was unfair for one question, the whole exam should be regraded to make sure that it is done correctly.
You should email psych sso now,. They might not respond because the office is closed for break I think, so you should email the individual advisors also. Have a good break!
Yeah, that makes sense. I’m still butthurt though LOL
Will do, boss! :D"

i have this book too.. love it
Glenn Seaborg was a Berkeley alum and the 2nd Chancellor of UC Berkeley. I had a physics teacher who was colleagues of his at one point.
i took chem 1a in 1997...and glenn seaborg was a guest lecturer.  he did the 'big game titration'....super awesome guy.  rest in peace good professor.
My grandmother worked with him at the Lawrence Berkeley Labs on the element discovery team. She has a bunch of pictures with him and some memorabilia from their time working together (including some gold lapel pins engraved with “Sg” and “Bk”).

Fall 2020 Update - Remote instruction will be an option; no tuition / campus fee refunds (lol),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/g6rwvu/fall_2020_update_remote_instruction_will_be_an/,2020-04-23 11:24:14,"Dear undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students,

We understand that many students have questions about campus plans for the fall 2020 semester. We wish to share information with you as proactively as possible while we carefully observe the progress of the current pandemic. 

Like universities around the world, we are working towards making critical decisions for the coming academic year in this evolving situation. We have an FAQ website that we will update as more details are announced. 

In-person vs. remote instruction decisions
We will not cancel the fall semester. We are working closely with our local public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. At this time we don’t have an estimated date. Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 2020-2021 may be delivered via remote instructio n. We do not know exactly when these decisions will be made because the public health picture remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall semester as soon as there is enough information to do so. The health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff will always be our top priority.

Given the uncertainty the world faces, some students may not be able to safely travel to campus. **We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as an option for Fall 2020, even if classes are held in-person.**

We’re making every effort to minimize disruptions to our educational mission and recognize that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as possible. When we do resume in-person instruction, it will likely be a phased approach with certain types of classes considered more appropriate to resume in-person than others. We will also likely make changes within classrooms and laboratories to observe publ ic health directives and guidance such as increased hand washing, avoiding sharing equipment when possible, and recommendations on facial coverings and/or physical distancing. Decisions about broadly offering Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading for fall semester will be made by the Academic Senate and will take into account the situation at the time. We appreciate your patience as we weigh these factors and gather more information about what the situation may be like in the fall. 

Tuition and student fees for fall 2020
**Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising.**

Some campus-based fees were established to support certain efforts like the Wellness Fee which is paying for many essential health services. Others were established to maintain the safety of buildings or other facilities when necessary for the health and safety of students—e.g., to address seismic deficiencies. Even as UC campuses such as ours have curtailed limited aspects of their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover will continue.

Student housing for fall 2020 
Under normal operations, all new students receive priority for housing. It is not possible to know at this time whether the COVID-19 pandemic will allow for normal operations in student housing and residential life in Academic Year 2020-2021. Consequently, we cannot guarantee housing priority at this time but we are committed to supporting students if they want to liv e on or near campus.   

For returning students, if fall classes are offered via remote instruction, we want to empower you to make the best decision for you and your family. We will keep the residential halls and apartments open as they are the primary residence for many students, unless we are required by public health authorities to close them. To date, we have not received any such closure order. If you do choose to live in University owned or affiliated housing, we will allow students the opportunity to be relieved of the financial obligations of their housing and applicable dining contracts and receive a prorated refund if the campus doesn’t resume in-person instruction during the 2020-2021 academic year or ends in-person instruction for an extended period of time (for example, in-person instruction is cancelled for more than 30 consecutive instructional days). 

For off-campus housing, students should pay close attention to the terms o f their lease. Most off-campus leases will not provide prorated refunds if students leave mid-lease. Consider trying to negotiate with the landlord for a month-to-month lease. This will give you more flexibility. Given the circumstances, some landlords may be more willing to negotiate. Learn more about leases at sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/leases.


We thank you for your understanding and resilience during these challenging and uncertain times. We are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible and we will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the coming fall. 

Sincerely,

Lisa García Bedolla, Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and Dean of the Graduate Division

Catherine P. Koshland, Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education

This message was sent to all undergraduate and graduate students.","Since they guaranteed remote instruction, how would exams possibly work if in-person instruction continues? 

I think this GUARANTEES that take-home/jank online gradescope exams will continue fall semester. Not only can you not social distance with 700 people taking an exam in Wheeler, but logistically it's a huge hassle if half of the course is taking an online exam with completely different format.

How the hell you curve that?
As a senior graduating in a couple weeks, although I was initially really sad about not getting to finish my college career in Berkeley, it’s becoming more and more apparent that graduating now is actually a lot more good than bad... I feel for you guys who are gonna have to put up with multiple semesters of this
[deleted]
I said this in another tread but allow me to repeat myself here: I’m most scared of the situation where we come back to school in person in the fall thinking the virus is all over and then it makes a come back in October mixed in with the regular seasonal flu and we all panic and have to scramble home again like we did this semester.... idk how likely this would be cuz I have no background in public health, but I did read on the news that someone at CDC said a second wave is possible and even likely. Please correct me if I understand the situation wrong, but with that (potentially big) possibility in mind I really don’t know if we should resume in person school at all for the fall:(
I mean someone has to pay for all the infrastructure right? As long as they don't charge for housing, it makes sense to me.
Getting spring admission is looking like more of a blessing every day
[deleted]
Seems like it's probably time to start making plans for deferral. For people planning to do so, what will you try to do for your gap semester? Remote internship?
I'm paying out-of-state tuition while living in-state. What the actual fucking fuckity fuck.
I find it interesting that they seem inflexible with regard to tuition and fees when they have to understand that such inflexibility will inevitably lead to a large proportion of students withdrawing for the semester.  I wonder what measures they will take regarding this.  It's a huge loss either way.
Why can’t they give some campus fee refunds e.g. RSF, AC Transit, and other services that we cannot use? I find it really unreasonable. Yea sure we’ll have access to staff through online classes which is ok to pay for but the issue is that we’re paying for services that we can’t even use!! Tell me where the money for our RSF membership that we’re paying for is going to when the gym is closed?? This is just really unreasonable. Considering the added fact that I already signed a lease for off-campus housing in January and now they can’t even give us a concrete answer so that I know whether I should argue to terminate the lease or not 🤦🏻‍♀️
RIP a digital year abroad isn’t quite the same thing
If fall semester is remote too I’m taking a gap semester
Mannn... I just hope whatever decision they make will be a solid decision. I don’t want to stress over whether I should choose online school for fall or if I should go in person to have that freshman experience. Just pick one!! I’m a horrible decision maker 😖😖
Oh man, I guess I'll miss out on those AC transit bus rides where tens of people get crammed into a bus for a few minutes at a time. Honestly, those should be refunded since people probably won't be willing to get on a bus during fall semester if there are still some social distancing restrictions due to the lack of a vaccine.
I do not understand why people are confused by this concept.  Just because you are not physically on campus does not mean you are not going to be receiving a UC education (exception being to the equipment and archives that are available).

As a graduate students at Davis I still had to pay tuition even though I had a remote program.  I was not confused by this concept when it happened 5 years ago.  Why would it be different now?
RIP to the people living off campus. So essentially, would labs for all classes be cancelled then, since if students are given the option to go remote, I doubt classes like Chemistry, Bio, and Physics can hold their in person labs.
Can we physically still go tho?
Exam format are likely up to instructor but I think everyone will take the same exam and in-person attendees would be treated the same as online attendees, since there's no way to do the reverse.
Maybe, just maybe, and hear me out on this one, _curving isn't a fair or reasonable way of grading a class_, so this is the perfect time to get rid of it.
Same here. I still take walks on campus but it's depressing how few students there are. Can't imagine a whole sem of this :(
I'll be the first student in the history of UCB to attend frow Hawaii.
At least this time they’ll have had some preparation time as opposed to having to scramble to hobble together an online class in the middle of the semester.
Yeah, the possibility of a second wave is very real, especially if we have a ton of students fly in from other cities + increase daily public transport. This is a reason behind their uncertain tone ""we're still waiting for public health etc, but for now we guarantee an online option"".
you are right, and I don't think schools like UC Berkeley would risk this even if majority of schools are. So the chance of canceling in-person classes is much higher than what many people are thinking(I would say 90+%). It's good to be optimistic but you cannot risk even a single student.
Yeah if my daughter was college-aged I’d most likely pull her out for the fall and find something productive for her to do around the house or at least be an unofficial intern for my wife and I. Can’t imagine being a college student through all of this.
I think many people getting angry about those fees aren't thinking about the numerous employees (not faculty) who would have no means of getting paid if not for those fees remaining to fund daily (minimum) operations, maintenance, security, etc. It's easy to assume those fees are just the university taking our money for kicks, but it doesn't feel like that's what they're doing.
God damn, I'm actually jealous.

Just got in after 3 years of community college, and now I'm losing 1/2 of my years at Berkeley for sure ☹️
Fall 2020 will at least have optional online classes. I don't know what the breadth of that will be, at least any course that's a major requirement or degree requirement.

The email leaves the possibility of either partial online (online for a bit, then in-person), or in person with social distancing measures, or completely online.

Though personally, I think it's pretty likely to be online at this point.
IDK it's really hard to plan because of the uncertainty. Personally, I will still enroll if it is hybrid instruction, but if it's fully remote, I'll most likely withdraw. But this really depends on the state of rest of the world. If we're back in ""lockdown mode,"" then I doubt companies will be hiring interns, much less min-wage jobs other than essential workers. In that case, I might just take a couple of classes because I would rather attempt to further my education rather that spend a semester doing a min wage job since my parents will most likely still be employed. 

However, if the rest of the world returns to ""normal"" and the only (main) thing that's online are colleges, then I would likely take the semester off and either find an internship or another job. But idk who will be hiring so it's really hard to decide so early, because if you can't find a job, the semester is completely wasted.
I will likely simply audit the classes I would have been taking (I doubt they will be gating anything).
tbf part of that is ostensibly at least in-state residents have supported the university through state taxes (and yes, some people just moved, there are exceptions)
One large reason that ""the situation remains fluid"" is because, as essentially a running business, they need to balance trade-offs. How much money will they lose by cutting tuition, vs. how much money do they lose by retaining tuition but losing students? (profit margins vs. revenue volume)

One reason I can think of with retaining tuition is that they get to keep the money-making whale in the room - international students. 

Out of state is ~$43,000, and in-state is ~$14,000, effectively making international students **x3 times more financially valuable**. They also have been making up larger and larger portions of campus population over the past few years. Most importantly, international students will likely be much more accepting of remote education because of travel restrictions, family obligations, as well as personal identification of where their home is (for example, the common theme of ""I'm going to America to get a degree, then coming back to my home country to work"")

But your logic still stands. This email, as well as watching the enrollment numbers, is a way for them to begin to test the waters and see how many people get spooked, and if they lose too much money, they will try something else. Because if they close campus or lose too many students, they stand to lose [hundreds](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-16/uc-reeling-under-staggering-coronavirus-costs-the-worst-impacts-all-at-once) of [millions](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fwrwjo/uc_berkeley_expects_100_million_loss_by_end_of_may/) of dollars.
I find it interesting that you think Cal is able to change tuition and fees as an individual university. Also, that you believe that any outcome is ""inevitable"" because it is one you might choose.
It makes me even more reluctant to attend the in-person or at all. This is comming off as: in-person option = half effort to keep up appearance and retain tuition.
People aren't confused, they take offense at the disconnect of paying money for a Berkeley education (which is normally in person) and instead receiving remote instruction, which is an objectively poorer learning experience. Sure, the piece of paper you will get handed at the end of four years stays the same, but what you gained along the way is measurably less.
Well, yeah, so everyone will take the online exam, which also can't be proctored.

Otherwise it would be incredibly unfair for the online kids to take an unproctored version of the same exam lol.
100% agree.
[deleted]
they will *most certainly* be cobbling together an online class again. it's just that this time they will have hopefully learned a bit.

edit: meaning, nobody is going to use the format *well*, like a class designed from the ground up would, but will instead still deliver the content exactly as they did before, but will have some tweaks because they now know how to use zoom.
and you can't force some students not to come. you either cancel it for everyone or give the option to everybody to attend. second option would need to ensure 40 thousand students from 100+ countries to be not sick. What are the odds....
If your daughter were college-aged, she'd be an adult, perfectly capable of making that decision for herself. But I understand that's what you'd do for _yourself_ in this situation.
Haha I’m 19 and my parents are advising me to withdraw for fall semester as well. My mom almost teared up last night saying she just wants to protect her little girl:( on another note tho, Im afraid that fall enrollment might look pretty ugly.
As a staff person, thank you for thinking of us.

Even with fees staying where they are, we are looking at massive cuts to departmental budgets. This comes as we were just *barely* done with the last round of belt-tightening to balance the campus budget. It's not going to be pretty.
Yea man I feel the pain. I was considering I’m going to UCLA if I got accepted but the spring admission is actually an opportunity I can pass lol
[deleted]
Let me rage.  
Jokes aside, you're right. It just feels bad.
As an international student I actually feel like... most of my friends and I are considering withdrawing if it’s fully online or due to some travel restriction we can’t physically get to america. Hugely due to the fact that it’s so expensive and being in a different time zone makes online school horrible. But that’s a very small sample size of just less than 10 of the people I talked to, might be wrong.
Wait so if I'm OOS, but they decide to do remote instruction for my classes, I still have to pay that huge tuition cost???
In person also requires rent btw:(
 very much agreed. Though maybe a relatively empty campus wouldn't be that bad if all facilities are open. It will be tough to tell how to make the decision.  Weighting the value of potentially lowered services with a much lower population using them.
Yes, and it is an entitled, bratty viewpoint because there are programs that are remote for grad school at Berkeley and other institutions and they need to be paid for.  I did not feel that was the case for my program at Davis (the first component of was in person).  In fact the remote learning was far better because there was a lot of down time that was cut out of things.

One loses the social aspect of college, but that is not what you're paying for when you pay tuition.
Hopefully there are other ways of evaluation that doesn't favor cheaters. For instance more weight on assignments/projects, etc. where we already have ways to detect copying. Some summer classes are also experimenting with this I think. Also, humanities could always give open-ended essays questions and check for plagarism like they alsways do.
well it's basically confirmed that there will be an online option so it means a majority of things will be online
But it might be, so there’s no reassign they shouldn’t be at least a little more prepared than getting blindsided in the middle of a semester.
That is very true... with that 90% chance of inperson instruction being canceled, what do you think fall enrollment would look like? I just don’t think my OOS tuition would be worth it if it’s online:(
Lol. She’s only one so it’s hard for me to think that far ahead. But good point.
There is already a hiring freeze that has extended to lecturers (so not just staff), as far as I know that is unprecedented.
 
It's almost guaranteed furloughs at the very least for staff if not significant layoffs. And we never did get back up fully after the disaster that was Campus Shared Services (shudder).

It's going to be very bad before it gets better.
What will get better, though? That's the thing, no matter what the virus is still here in August. We may have lowered the infection rate, new cases, and deaths with shelter in place orders, but the question becomes, how can we soften those while not just immediately causing another wave?

Treatment wise, COVID cases treated hydroxychloroquine apparently have a *higher* fatality rate than those of similar severity not given it. 

Colleges are prime position for viral spread. It involves mass domestic migration, a bunch of people squeezed into close quarters every day, and people living together in the same rooms with strangers.

How do you social distance in a triple? You can't.
I highly doubt it. Even though are age group is “fine” some of us have health complications or people might be living with elderly people. The whole situation sucks
""Just let me bang bro.""

""I do let you bang. I do.""
I'll agree that remote lecture cuts out a lot of downtime between classes where it's too short to walk home and do something else productive. However, this is but a trifle. 

My main point was sure, you can listen to a lecture online and that doesn't drastically alter the learning format of just being talked at, but for other classes, remote instruction just doesn't do them justice. For myself, this includes physics 7B (missed lab component) and environmental design 1 (where in-person site studies in Oakland are/were crucial to the semester-long project). I don't see how this is bratty - experiential learning is key for some people and in other cases, critical to the study of a subject. 

Furthermore, on the notion that ""there are programs that are remote for grad school at Berkeley and other institutions and they need to be paid for"" - the whole principle in these is that they are *planned* remote programs. When choosing a grad school, this is something that is known upfront and can be weighed among the factors of quality of education vs. price when choosing where to go to grad school. In this case, when choosing Berkeley as a the undergraduate program they would go to, students, and especially OOS students, factored that the quality of education justified the cost of attending here. If they had known in May of their high school senior year that one, and possibly two or three semesters would be taught remotely, some might have decided that this is not worth the cost and would have attended a different university. The cost/benefit equation has changed away from what the student expected. Therefore, it's completely justified for the student to wish for a reduction in tuition, or at they very least, bitch about it on reddit. Likewise, the desire of withdrawing for one semester to avoid this expectation/reality mismatch of services rendered is also justifiable.
I don’t mean to get into this but one thing I wanna point out is that, most of the undergrads here at Berkeley didn’t sign up to go to Berkeley thinking that it would be online. It’s great that for you an online education is just as good and I wish I could say the same. But for my major and classes I rely so much on talking to my professors in office hours and collaborating with classmate on projects in person etc. Speaking for myself the quality of online education is reduced. I think people are mad because of this sudden change to what we had agreed to pay for in the first place. (Like if you paid for a year of Spotify and in the middle they suddenly decide to not stream but send you the records you request. Sure the Music you get at the end is the same and you shouldn’t complaint about that, and some people might actually prefer that service, but if that’s not what you organically agreed to sign up for, it might be a little frustrating) that’s just my 2 cents and have a nice day!
> One loses the social aspect of college, but that is not what you're paying for when you pay tuition.

If you’re satisfied with the idea of online classes, go get your degree from the University of Phoenix and save yourself $100,000. It’s the same thing, right?
I believe a lot of students will defer their enrollment or take a gap semester. I really think that all majors(expect five-year ones) can be completed in 3.5 years and you can also always take a summer class for only 2k.  I really don't think Berkeley's (actually nobody's) online education would be worth 20k . 

There is a reason why Berkeley's masters in data science program is considered shitty by many students. It's the same classes taught by the same skilled profs, but it's fully online so it's certainly much easier to get in(since they can enroll more students) and definitely less reputable than masters in engineering. You shouldn't pay that much money for any online program, even something like a masters in data science at Berkeley.
I'm just wondering what will be different in spring 2021. Seems like without a vaccine, we're basically in the exact same situation :(
There are ways you can control that second wave though. For instance, you can phase out move-in times (have Bay Area people come first, then California residents, and so on) so that you can deal with new infections more spread apart. The issue is, you can't *not* have a second wave, unless you do the ""lockdown until there is a vaccine"" thing (which I haven't seen seriously discussed, and there's no guarantee of a vaccine). But, there are ways you can flatten the curve so it isn't as bad as it could be. 

There are also other treatments being tested for COVID besides hydroxychloroquine, so there's a chance there will be one by the fall.

And about social distancing in a triple: none of the guidelines ever apply to people in your dwelling. The issue would be within the bathrooms, dining halls, etc., not with the number of people in one bedroom.
If I read the text improperly, they are not charging lab fees, which means that you are not being charged for services that you would normally recieve.

It is true that remote learning does impact labs (and library and archive access for those of us in the world of Letters, rather than the Sciences), but you have to agree that it is a huge offer to let students not even attend courses but still get access to the education that they want to have.  The University is doing what it can to allow students to be safe while continuing their studies, and it should be commended for that, rather than be criticized for it.

There are many things that the University deserves criticism for, but this is not one of them.
You are being purposefully obtuse.  You have not given one reason why the University would lower tuition because of the circumstances.
Same. I feel like I can easily graduate in 3.5 years in my major so taking a semester off isn't that bad for me personally. I am also slightly concerned about what to do with myself in that time, idk if companies are going to be offering internships at this point and I am a little afraid that I would waste 6 months of my life doing basically nothing productive.
The problem with ""phasing"" move in times is just logistics, and the fact that almost all students other than Freshman don't live in University housing, so they really don't have a good way to control.

If all the OoS sophomores+ just come back, because well they already have to pay for August rent anyway, there's nothing you can do. And they will, because as we all know online learning is kinda ass.

>But, there are ways you can flatten the curve so it isn't as bad as it could be.

Well, yeah, like having services that can be done remotely, done remotely. Like most office work and... university. It sucks, but it's possible, and it helps the rest of the country get back to work. That's the logic.

>There are also other treatments being tested for COVID besides hydroxychloroquine, so there's a chance there will be one by the fall.

There's a chance of everything, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a useful therapeutic

>  none of the guidelines ever apply to people in your dwelling. 

That's for people in *normal* housing, which involves 1-4 people in a house or apartment. This is 3 people, *strangers*, put in the same room. Not a family unit, strangers. 

They're also use the same bathroom, have the same dining hall, touch the same elevator buttons, etc.
Please quote when I said the very fact of the University holding remote lectures is bad. While it's a ""huge offer"" - I'll agree, if there were no classes at all, that would be ridiculous - the University is refusing to reduce tuition for a comparatively *poorer* offer. At the end of the day I don't understand why complaining about that fact is ""entitled and bratty."" 

Is it realistic for the University to reduce tuition? Of course not, it's snatching for pennies when there's no global pandemic - it's going to be hemorrhaging money now as it had been before Christ's improvements. Is it justified to be pissed, nevertheless? I think so. Is it justified to want to not take remote classes next semester to avoid this convenient, but still inferior offer? Yes, and not bratty.
Because they’re providing an objectively inferior product?

Also, props for calling me “obtuse” when you just called students who don’t want to pay full tuition “bratty and entitled”
there are few online internships but don't be sad if none of them works out. if you really wanna do something important, here are some suggestions:

&#x200B;

contact really small startups(from skydeck or anywhere else) and ask them how you can help them remote. most will not be willing to pay you but that would be a great experience. 

take free courses from websites like udemy, you can even get a certificate for it for something like 100$

&#x200B;

start studying some of your spring classes during fall, you would get higher grades or take more courses since you basically know a lot about one of those courses.
Good point about the logistics. I’d imagine that there would be ways of coordinating between the city and the university, but it would be difficult. But there would be some incentive on the city’s part, given how much of city business depends on the student population. 

I’m just more of an optimist about therapeutics than you I guess. Keep in mind like every virologist in the world is working on this. 

About the dorms, the issue isn’t that there are strangers in your room (And they’re not strangers for very long). The issue is the other things you listed (bathrooms, dining halls,etc. ) It’s just not ever possible to social distance from the people you live with, and it’s irrelevant how many people are in the dorm, and whether you know them.
Explain how the education you would receive would be lessened.
>I’d imagine that there would be ways of coordinating between the city and the university, but it would be difficult.

To do what? Bar people from entering the city of berkeley unless they're california residents? I don't even know if the city has legal authority to do that. It probably doesn't lol. 

You can't reasonably stop people in the US from moving domestically, even the federal government can't, it doesn't have the constitutional power to. 

>I’m just more of an optimist about therapeutics than you I guess. Keep in mind like every virologist in the world is working on this.

Yeah, but just having more people work on it doesn't necessarily make anything possible. We never found a therapeutic for SARS or MERS. Hell, we never even made a vaccine for it. They tried, but it took too long (>5 years). 

>It’s just not ever possible to social distance from the people you live with

Yeah exactly, so its optimal to minimize the amount of people you live with. Effectively now, most students will lived with both their families and their roommates, doubling the ""can't possibly social distance"" number.
Some people have different learning styles and some majors benefit more from an in person approach.
I guess you can’t bar non-residents from entering the city, but you can do other things (testing, self quarantine, etc., stuff countries like Taiwan are doing). You can also make compliance voluntary, and I’d guess most people would listen. 

I’m under the impression that research on SARS and MERS slowed down after they went away, but you are right that having lots of people work on it doesn’t make anything impossible possible, only more likely that we find something. 

I still don’t understand your point about social distancing. If you move from a family house of four to a triple room, you are actually decreasing the number of people you’re living with. It’s not like you are now living with both your roommates and your family. I agree with the fact that the conditions in dorms are conducive to the spread of disease, but that would be the situation regardless of the number of the people in the room.
You might be surprised, but as someone with a Masters in Education, I am aware of learning styles, the research around them, and the public discourse that typically mangles what the research actually says.

The major benefit from in person education in an educational context is primarily felt in primary and secondary education where a teacher chooses to read the room and change the way they manage and deliver their content.  This is not something that is done in higher education in general because the expectation is that the student regulates and controls their own focus and effort in the class.  The sole exception to this tends to be in educational classes, and the effect on students who are used to the more mature and independent style of higher education tends to make them feel as if they are being treated in an infantile manner.

If you are entering Berkeley and have not learned to self motivate yourself in your education, then you are in trouble, because you are developmentally behind where you should be.
Personally, I struggle with maintaining focus and an in person class setting really helps me to focus on the physical presence of the speaker and helps my concentration. I also value the interaction I have with peers and going to office hours and clubs and stuff. I would, however, be interested in reading more about the subject and research that you mention so if you could direct me to some primary/secondary texts I’ll be sure to check them out!
For context, when I finished my masters degree, we were the one remote seminar in our program.  In our Zoom sessions we not only had regular chances to interact with our professor but each other, and spent time checking in and talking about our experiences.  We also had regular opportunities to have one on one conversations and office hours with our professor.  There was nothing lost in our experience except not having to spend hours to drive between where we currently resided and going back to campus.

As for the research, I will go digging in my files.  Sadly the days of having access to Google Scholar through UC just disappeared last spring, so I do not have everything I would like to show you.  In short, most education research is very locally specific.  Local conditions, supports, and culture have far more impact on academic outcomes than delivery techniques.  In addition, the most efficient means of transferring information is still proven to be direct instruction (lecture).  Still, we are told not to do it because general educational pedagogy is focused not on being efficient in transferring information but in improving educational outcomes for students with the least academic skills rather than trying to improve the academic outcomes for the majority of students.  Almost all discussions and research about learning styles is about increasing the outcomes of those limited few students who are otherwise not on level for reading, writing, critical thinking, or calculating.  Once again, if you are one of these people, that is support the tutoring center (and consequently the ASUC and student fees) covers, not University tuition."
Can I cram math 55 into 1 week?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n0v9cz/can_i_cram_math_55_into_1_week/,2021-04-28 19:53:20,"Hey guys...

So basically I'm still enrolled in math 55 but I stopped watching lecture after week 1. I've also missed both midterms and have only ever done one homework assignment (worth 15%) for the course. Here is the thing though, course policy is that missed midterms (worth 20% each) will be replaced by the final exam (worth 45%) and so if I'm not mistaken I could score up to 85% just taking the final. I'd like to get the class out of my way but since they haven't released a grade distribution I'm a bit hesitant. I'm considering 

a) dropping the class:
Less stress short-term, can focus better on other classes, but (likely) will have to take it again in the future, which means more stress then

b) p/np the class:
Medium amount of stress short-term, don't have to retake it in the future but it means I'll have a p on my record which might look bad especially if I could get a decent letter grade

c) go all out
High stress short-term, but I could wind up walking away with a decent grade if I do well. Also could probably still pass if I don't??



Any math 55 students, if you could give me some advice that would be great! Do I cram the entire course in 1 week? Would doing okayish on the final still let me pass the class? How bad do you think I'd have to do to fail?




Update: Thanks for the feedback everybody, I decided to drop it. I figured I'd rather focus on my other exams and spare the stress. Thanks to the few p/np believers though! I would love to see someone else do this and manage :p","You should drop. You quite literally have not taken the class and are going to try and manage what people do in 15 weeks in just one, which is ridiculous. If you don't drop, PLEASE make a follow up post because (for your sake) I hope you're a math god and pull this off.
Math 55? Good luck...
Just replying because I find OP’s entire approach to learning math honestly impressive lmao
wow. pnp it and let us know if you pass
holy fuck dude drop it, fucking drop it. you already didn't put any effort in, you don't have anything to lose by dropping it. sure, you'll have to take it later, but taking it in a non-pandemic semester might help you stay on track, idk.

but knowing what I know from cs 70, you can't cram this shit in a week. this is the kinda stuff you really need to take time to think about and understand.
Well, you might be able to. I am taking EECS 16b and learned the material from 8 weeks for midterm in 4 days. I just took notes of course notes and then rewrote them on my cheat sheet. I scored 57% without ever doing any problems before the exam. Just put a lot of examples from notes on your cheat sheet if you are going to do it."
