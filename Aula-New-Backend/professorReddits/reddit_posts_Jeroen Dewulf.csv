ASAMST 128 AC vs Dutch 171 AC,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/bx9u0c/asamst_128_ac_vs_dutch_171_ac/,2019-06-05 17:00:25,"I'm want to satisfy an upper division humanities and ac requirement with either ASAMST 128 AC (Muslims in America) with Bazian  or Dutch 171 AC (From New Amsterdam to New York: Race, Culture, and Identity in New Netherland) with Dewulf and was wondering what the courses were like in terms of workload (presentations, projects, discussions, and essays) and difficulty. Any insight or past experiences with these classes would be greatly appreciated! (P.S. looking into ASAMST 143 AC a bit as well)","Jeroen Dewulf is an awesome dude and his class is pretty easy. There are biweekly 1-page writing assignments that are graded on completion and two open-note written midterms, no final. You have to go to lectures as he takes attendance, but the content is interesting and he lectures well enough.
Thanks for the input! I've only heard good things about Dewulf's teaching style and personality so far, and the class seems super chill. I think I'm going to give it a try."
