Math 53 and the waitlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/4n7zv5/math_53_and_the_waitlist/,2016-06-08 16:18:45,"So I'm planning to take Math 53 in my first semester this fall.  There are two lectures: one by Edward Frenkel and one by John Steel.  I read that John Steel's lectures aren't really good, so I want to take Math 53 with Edward Frenkel.  However, all of his discussion sections are already full, and I can only sign up for the waitlist.  
1) How likely that I will be accepted from the waitlist?  
2) Anyone have any good/bad experiences with Steel?
  
Thanks in advance!","Generally about 10% of students will drop the course so a lot of people on the waitlist will get in. Your best bet is to sign up for a discussion section where you are number 1 or 2 on the waitlist even if it doesn't fit your schedule, once you get into the course you can work something out with the GSIs so you can attend one that fits your schedule.
What is your rank on the list?
Thanks.  How do I check the rank on the waitlist?
Could I ask how I can check that on Schedule Planner?
It should tell you your rank when you add yourself to the waitlist. You can also check the schedule of classes to see which sections have the smallest waitlists."
