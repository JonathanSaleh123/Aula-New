Ling 100 - No communication from prof,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/10dtxg9/ling_100_no_communication_from_prof/,2023-01-16 14:05:37,"I'm enrolled in Linguistics 100 with Andrew Garrett this semester, but haven't received any communication so far regarding this class. no emails, no gradescope setup, not even bcourses. semester starts tomorrow.

is it possible I'm  not on the mailing list or smth? or is this normal and I'm being paranoid","Sometimes other professors have everything ready before the semester starts. Some donâ€™t. Just have to wait and see when class officially starts.
I know a bunch of classes wait until the first class session to post bCourses and other info
Heâ€™s a great professor but I wouldnâ€™t say deadlines are his strong suit. Those of us that had his class last semester just got our grades last week
Iâ€™m also in that class and havenâ€™t heard/seen anything either
anyone hear anything yet? im sick so cant go to lecture today so im feeling p in the dark
makes sense, thank you!
thatâ€™s good to know, ty"
Who are the math GSIs that are currently carrying their courses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/11pxd1g/who_are_the_math_gsis_that_are_currently_carrying/,2023-03-12 19:20:11,We all know about the opposite issue - a lot of GSIs seem checked out or completely disinterested in supporting their students. A lot of math grad students are on Reddit - does anyone deserve a shoutout because of the wonderful job they are doing supporting their discussion sections or the entire class?,"Seewoo Lee was pretty awesome for 53 last semester
Jason Zhao for math 53 ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
I heard spencer is great for math 54 this semester and math 53 last semester
Andrew for 53 is AMAZING
Dennis for math 54
haya, nancy, garrett for 54 :)
I had Ryan Martinez last semester for 53. Dude was 100% the reason I got my first A on a midterm
I really like David Casey for Math 110
Up coz highly recommend staff see this and this has been an issue for yearrrrrs
Connor for Math 55.
seconded spencer is awesome
>:)

:)
I'm thinking of switching to his section, my current gsi is rly bad. Any more insight about how he facilitates class and the difficulty of his  quizzes. I don't like gsi's who make us do group work, nor am I looking for a gsi who give hard quizzes. 

I have to make up my mind by today, last day fro drop/switch, so LMK please!"
Cog Sci Major Schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/103qfrw/cog_sci_major_schedule/,2023-01-04 21:16:35,"Is this a good schedule or is this too busy? Any advice would be appreciated

Both classes are proof-based! I would take 12A in a future semester and replace it with another upper div category instead. I'm taking cogsci 144 for my linguistics req this spring and i heard it's easier than ling 100 so there's also that!!
I canâ€™t speak much to 55 or Philos 12A as I took other classes for those reqs but I have heard 12A has good fundamental logic that is helpful if you want some background for 55 or CS courses. I would guess 55 is likely to be the hardest out of all of these.

Psych C61 work load depends on how much reading you are willing to do since that is most of the work. Get ready to memorize a lot of information. I found Ling 100 to be a pretty manageable class and Iâ€™ve found that linguistics grad students and course staff are incredibly helpful.

This seems doable, especially with how much time you have between classes T/Th. Just take advantage of all the resources they offer.
Are you doing ok? alive still?"
