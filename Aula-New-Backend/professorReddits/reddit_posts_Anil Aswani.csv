INDENG 165 vs. EEP/ENVECON C118 for DS major CID requirement,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sb6qmd/indeng_165_vs_eepenvecon_c118_for_ds_major_cid/,2022-01-23 15:08:55,"Anyone took either INDENG 165 or EEP/ENVECON C118 and willing to share their experience? I'm still debating between these 2 and I need one of them to pass the Data Sciecne major Computational & Inferential Depth requirement. 

BG: took STATS 134, CS61A, B. Have only 1 reading intense technical and 1 math/stats/coding intense technical, others are breaths. Will have plenty of time to work on the CID requirement class. 

Berkeleytime: INDENG 165 has an A- average (so strange for a stats-intense class); EEP/ENVECON C118 has a B.

Instructor: Professor Villas-Boas for EEP/ENVECON C118 has a 4.1/5 on ratemyprofessor. Professor Anil Aswani for INDENG 165 looks like hasn't been on ratemyprofessor, but on ninja course he got a 90, 71, 100 from Spring 2015. 

Attendance/Zoom/OH/exams: INDENG 165 won't have recordings after we return to in person (professor made it clear on day 1); can't go to professor's OH because another course takes attendance/in person exams (like typical math/stats exams). EEP/ENVECON C118 will always have recordings, can go to OH, midterm and final are take-home (R studio and Jupyter Notebook projects).

Appreciate any advice! Thank you!",I took ieor 165 and it was very easy and the Prof is nice and chill.
