ECON C3 vs ESPM 15,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vziyyv/econ_c3_vs_espm_15/,2022-07-15 00:50:41,"I am an incoming L&S freshman planning to study biology and environmental science. I enrolled in ECON C3 and ESPM 15 and am choosing between the two (other enrolled courses include enrolled in MATH 1A, CHEM 1A/1AL, DeCal (total 10 units)). I've listed some attributes of each class below and am hoping that I can get advice or suggestions from people who have previously taken the classes.

ECON C3 Introduction to Environmental Economics and Policy

* Meets Social & Behavioral Sciences, L&S Breadth
* Professor Maximilian Auffhammer
* 4 units (total 14 units)
* Have never taken any econ related courses, absolutely 0 background knowledge in econ

ESPM 15 Introduction to Environmental Sciences

* Meets Biological Science, L&S Breadth (will meet with BIO 1A/1AL and 1B)
* Meets Physical Science, L&S Breadth (already met with CHEM 1A)
* Professors Robert Rhew and Patina Mendez
* 3 units (total 13 units)
* More interested in taking a course that covers both the scientific and social/political aspects of envsci

Any feedback would be appreciated.","econ c3 sucks take espm 15
really? mind elaborating?
i don’t know the professor teaching econ c3 this semester but it’s a pretty econ heavy class, if you have no econ background it would take some time outside class understanding what’s going on. also it’s not really “environmental econ” it’s just regular econ but all the examples are natural resources. if you don’t have to take it i honestly wouldnt
Heard that professor auffhammer is pretty chill and humorous, but I think I will choose espm 15 after considering your advice. Thanks a ton :)"

the academic senate's message about final exam grading,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/z4ok8y/the_academic_senates_message_about_final_exam/,2022-11-25 13:20:55,"TLDR: no PNP grading and mandatory finals. 

&#x200B;

""*TO:  UC Berkeley Academic Senate Members, Council of Deans, Department Chairs, Academic non-student appointees, Graduate Student Instructors, and Instructors*

Dear Colleagues, 

We are aware that the continuing UAW strike is a source of stress for all of us in the Berkeley community, and with exams and end-of-semester grading approaching that is likely to increase. The Academic Senate has developed some procedures to help instructors navigate the end of the semester should the strike continue and Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs) not be available to help administer and grade exams and other final assessments. 

The current situation highlights the contributions of GSIs and their essential role in fulfilling Berkeley's academic mission. While we have attempted in what follows to outline some approaches that should enable an easier end-of-semester for faculty, we recognize that there are no truly satisfactory solutions to the withholding of GSI labor. The procedures outlined in this message would go into effect **if the strike is not resolved by the end of the day on Monday, November 28**. 

These procedures are designed to respond to the workload faced by faculty teaching large classes in which student work would otherwise have been graded by GSIs, to support students who need grades assigned in a timely manner for a variety of reasons, and to address concerns of Senate faculty who are opposed to taking over struck labor. While the contract for Unit 18 lecturers prohibits sympathy strikes, Senate faculty who are not supervisors or managers enjoy a protected right to strike in sympathy under the Higher Education Employee Relations Act (HEERA). Faculty need to be aware that there is debate about when Senate faculty are considered to be managers. [Guidance from UCOP](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/sc-js-division-chairs-faculty-strike-guidance.pdf) suggests that faculty who supervise two or more employees are generally considered to be managers. Conversely, [a group of UC law professors argue](https://webshare.law.ucla.edu/faculty/bibs/zatz/HEERA_memo_FINAL.pdf) that faculty who supervise GSIs or GSRs do not count as managers because they do not formulate or administer University policies. Each of us will have to make decisions about how to conduct our work during the strike, and we know that faculty will act and communicate with the respect and awareness of the experience of others that define the Berkeley community. We all contribute to Berkeley’s educational mission, and the ability to work well together now and in the future will depend on acceptance of a range of principled actions in response to the strike.

**1. New grade submission deadline: December 31, 2022.** The registrar has agreed to extend the deadline for the submission of grades through Cal Central from December 21 to December 31. We are aware that an additional ten days is not nearly enough to mitigate the very substantial workload that faculty teaching large classes may confront. The revised deadline aims to offer faculty some relief while accommodating students who need grades to determine academic standing; eligibility for graduation, financial aid, or veterans benefits; and/or applications to certain majors and to higher degree programs.     

**2. No switch to default P/NP grading.** Berkeley will not be moving to a default P/NP grading system for the semester, as we did during the spring of 2020. While we recognize the loss of educational support undergraduates are experiencing during the strike, the strain on students does not reach the level imposed during the first months of the pandemic. Many students need timely letter grades for the reasons outlined in point #1; moreover, a move to P/NP would not address the increased grading demands on faculty because Cal Central requires a letter grade to be entered in the system at the time that each P or NP grade is assigned. 

**3. Submit as many grades as you can by the deadline**. Faculty who cannot calculate and enter grades by the new deadline **should leave the grade blank rather than assigning an I (Incomplete)** or any other option. We ask that you calculate and submit letter grades by December 31 for as many students as possible, and for **all** **students** who have notified you that they require a letter grade for one of the reasons listed above. 

Faculty teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses (except for courses in Berkeley Law) will be able to submit the grades you have while leaving the others blank until student work can be graded. This change to the system will take effect in early December. Once it is implemented and announced, grades entered and saved on the roster will post to the students’ records overnight, allowing for continual grade entry until all grades have been entered. After the grades have been posted overnight a grade change form will need to be submitted to make any corrections. 

Please do everything possible to meet the requests of students who inform you that they need letter grades by December 31 and to support their academic progress. In the absence of a letter grade, staff and advisors will need to contact faculty individually to establish grades for all students who need degree checks for graduation and/or who need grades for financial aid. The total number of course grades for students in these circumstances would likely exceed 20,000, which is an impossible job for staff who are already stretched thin.    

**4. Assessment and grading in courses that do not rely on GSIs should be carried out as usual.** For classes that do not rely on GSIs for grading, we encourage faculty to maintain the forms and modes of assessment announced in the syllabus and to submit grades by December 31.  

**5. Designing final assessments.** If you are teaching a large class without GSI help, try to find ways to reduce the time required for assessing student work. Some possibilities include shifting (fully or partially) to exam formats that can be automatically graded, reducing the length and scope of final assessments, or grading in a more schematic way (see advice on adapting and reducing the scope of assessments from the Center for Teaching and Learning [here](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/how-support-undergraduate-students-event-instructional-disruption)). **Canceling the exam altogether is not an option**. Academic Senate regulations require final examinations in all courses unless determined otherwise by the Committee on Courses of Instruction. Furthermore, canceling an exam would be unfair to students who are relying on it to improve their grades. If you plan to change the format of your final exam, you must obtain approval from your department chair.

**6. Exams for students with accommodations from the Disabled Students Program (DSP).**  In many courses, GSIs play an important role in arranging and proctoring exams for students who have DSP accommodations (e.g., for 150% time or a low-distraction environment). Some proctoring and logistical support for these exams has been picked up by DSP, but its proctoring facilities are at capacity. **Faculty should therefore consider replacing timed in-person exams with timed take-home exams that give students a total amount of time adequate to incorporate all extended time accommodations (typically more than 24 hours)**. For example, if an instructor provides 24 hours for students to complete a 2-hour exam, the DSP student with a 150% time accommodation would be allowed to take 3 hours within that 24-hour window to complete the exam, but the instructor does not have to provide a window of 36 hours. Gradescope and bCourses can both handle timed exams with accommodations; guidance on designing remote examinations can be found [here](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/best-practices-remote-examinations).

**7. Include students in decisions about assessments and grading.** Consider inviting students to collaborate with you in decisions about alternative formats for final assessments, the re-weighting of assignments, and other revisions to the syllabus. Students could be given the choice between taking the final exam (if they want a chance to improve their grade) or being graded on work already completed (if they are happy with their grades so far). Including students in your decisions will give them agency in this challenging situation, make them feel connected to the university, and emphasize that learning is a collaborative process. 

**8. Communication.** Clear and prompt communication will make things easier for you and others. Please communicate any changes to your final assessments and/or grading scheme to students as soon as possible, and let students know that you will be able to provide letter grades by December 31 for those who are applying to graduate school or need the grades to attest to their academic standing or eligibility for financial aid. Additionally, you should tell your department chair if you are planning a change in the format of your final exam.    Department chairs should, in turn, notify the Office of the Registrar of any changes in room reservations for exams, so those rooms can be made available for other exams.

**9. Resources and support for faculty.** The Senate is working with the [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/) (CTL) to support faculty in making changes to their assessments and grading procedures. Additional advice from CTL can be found [here](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/how-support-undergraduate-students-event-instructional-disruption) and [here](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/resources/flexible-instructional-strategies-meet-students-where-they-are), or [contact CTL to request](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/supporting-educators-across-campus) a one-on-one consultation. Once the strike is resolved the Senate also hopes to work with the administration to make funds available to hire readers to help with grading, although this may not be possible. I also invite you to contact me by email (masmart@berkeley.edu) if you have questions or concerns.

We hope that these recommendations will be helpful in negotiating what may prove to be a challenging conclusion to the semester. We are acutely aware of the energy and ingenuity with which Berkeley faculty have confronted the exceptional challenges of the past few years, and we marvel at your brilliance and your commitment. We wish you success and a measure of serenity in confronting these challenges, and also some moments of joy and repose over the holiday break. 

Sincerely,

Mary Ann Smart

Chair, Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate

It’s funny how this could all be avoided if you just pay the gsi’s
Good to know they don’t care about the GSI’s OR the students
This message never stated that there would be no P/NP grading option (the grading option we are fighting for, see petition below), it only stated that there would be no default P/NP grading (which is fine, because that’s not what we are fighting for.) 

Because default P/NP and optional P/NP are so different from one another, and they haven’t turned down an option, I’m not giving up hope on it yet.

[deleted]
So your telling me I actually have to study for the final?!
What about point 7 in regards to mandatory finals?
I don't mind no default PNP, but I'd like the option to have 2 max late schedule changed waived for this semester so I can PNP if I choose to...
[deleted]
Bruhkeley Moment
Doesn't point 6 defeat the purpose of a DSP accommodation? If other students are getting a full day, the exam will be upto that level of difficulty, and DSP students deserve more time than that.
Or the faculty for that matter.  I’m so glad I’m not teaching this semester.  There is no way I could handle things without my TAs
Or faculty. Don't fall into the stereotype of GSIs not caring about faculty. I don't think this is true, but this is how some people portray the strike. Don't forget faculty.
Can someone send this to someone in ASUC? Time is running out. Either something happens in the next couple of days or nothing happens at all.
FUCK THIS SCHOOL BRUH
Some of my classes are just giving a fully mcq exam on gradescope which is 24-hour and open book since they don’t have GSIs to proctor

Some (that are binned) aren’t even doing that and are just having exams where everyone gets 100%
It seems like people may have an option to take the final if their happy with their grade, but the final exams are not cancelled because people whom are not happy with their grade/need the final to pass etc. can have the oppurtunity to do so
Underrated phrase.
I could be wrong, but it seems like they’re just asking instructors to consider providing 24 hour windows for everyone to start the 2-hour Gradescope assignment, but DSP students would still be getting 3 hours to do the same thing. I have extra time accommodations and tbh a 36 hour window wouldn’t make sense because expecting students to pull an all-nighter to make use of their accommodations would be crazy. I don’t think any instructors actually assign alternative 24 hour exams where the exam itself is supposed to take you 24 hours lol
[removed]
I emailed several people in the ASUC about this today. Fingers crossed that on Monday we will have some support from them. If anyone wants to email them also/email the chancellor, I have a draft of the email I sent that you can use if you want, just DM me for it.
[deleted]
How can some classes give 100% on final exams even if finals aren't allowed to be cancelled entirely?
damn which classes may I ask?
There's no good solution for undergraduates or faculty while the strike is ongoing. This is not the strikers' fault. Faculty are screwed. Again, not the strikers' fault, but it's true.
We're working on it. As a few people have already noted, the timing is tricky and the Thanksgiving break certainly doesn't help. Our top advocacy priority is allowing P/NP to satisfy degree requirements for this semester only (i.e. ""optional P/NP""). My office will likely provide an update midway through this coming week with where we stand.

\- James Weichert (ASUC Academic Affairs Vice President)
I have a higher GPA than you, mate. Breathe in... breathe out... fuck off
As long as you give students a chance to improve their grade, it’s fine. For binned classes it really is as simple as that
CS upperdivs or CS grad classes. I don’t wanna name classes for privacy lol
Same
[removed]
GOD i pray CS70 does this
understandable. lucky you, I'm also taking all eecs upperdivs and none of my classes are doing that!
I agree. I tend to write that it’s not the strikers’ fault because anything not 100% positive about the strike gets downvoted to hell.
Oh my god I know right. But even if they do since the class is curved it basically means that the final will be useless
Idk what to even expect anymore from this class. How can they save the final at this point? Give us mcqs on gradescope and hope the distribution is decent? gah"
