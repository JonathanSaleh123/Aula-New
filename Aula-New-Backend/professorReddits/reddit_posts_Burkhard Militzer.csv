EPS 109: Computer Simulations with Jupyter Notebooks,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/trjrfg/eps_109_computer_simulations_with_jupyter/,2022-03-29 13:45:24,"Has anyone taken EPS 109: Computer Simulations with Jupyter Notebooks with Burkhard Militzer? If so, how is the workload? I'm planning to take a heavy-workload upperdiv CS class with Physics 7A and am deciding between taking EPS 109 and Astro 160.","[deleted]
Thank you so much for the detailed answer! I thought it sounded pretty interesting so definitely looking forward to it!
Hi did you end up taking this class? What were your thoughts on it?
I thought it was a pretty chill low-stakes class that was interesting. I have previous coding experience so I was able to pretty much breeze through the labs and hws, but don't worry if you don't because they go over everything you need. They have weekly lab sections that walk you through the labs, and the hws are just like the labs. The lectures are less about coding and more about the science behind the simulations, and I liked the professor's style of teaching. At the end the semester there's a final project where you have to apply one of the simulation methods discussed in class to a topic of your choice. I would go to the class website to see previous projects: http://militzer.berkeley.edu/EPS109/
Hi, since you said that you have coding experience, I'm assuming that you're CS/DS major. What would you say about the difficulty and workload of this class in comparison to some upper CS/DS courses like DATA 100 or CS 16X series? Also, does it involve in a lot of math because the syllabus does mention about ordinary differential equations and Monte Carlo?
Yup I'm EECS, and the workload/difficulty is pretty much nothing compared to classes like CS162 and CS161. I did have to go to office hours for some of the homeworks but overall it's not too difficult conceptually. Don't worry too much about the math stuff because the professor goes over it in lecture and gives us the equations we have to work with. The emphasis is more on coding the simulations rather than the math behind them. The most difficult part of the class, I would say, is the final project because you have to choose your own topic and apply the simulations from class to it, but it's also the most fun part. 
Hope you have fun!
Thanks a lot for the detailed answer! Also, how generous was the curve for this class?
I would say it's pretty fair, I got an 80% on the midterm and 60% on the final and still got an A in the class. As long as you put in a little effort you'll be fine!"
