I love Michael Ball as a prof but I hate his class so much ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c6og9x/i_love_michael_ball_as_a_prof_but_i_hate_his/,2024-04-17 16:21:33,"This is in no way Michael Ball slander I genuinely love him as prof he’s an amazing person and cares a lot about his students succeeding and is very open to answer any questions you have without making you feel bad for asking!

That being said I absolutely hate his class so much nothing makes me more miserable than doing assignments for his class! And it’s not the professors fault for being a bad instructor bc he’s not it’s literally my fault bc I feel like nothing goes into my stupid smooth brain! I legit don’t understand ANYTHING and the semester is almost over! I’m trying so hard to understand things but nothing makes sense to me idk what’s wrong with me what’s even more embarrassing is that this is legit one of the easiest CS classes ever which almost no one struggles with (c88) and here I am! I even thought I did really good on the midterm but my result was less than 20%!! I try practicing the homework’s and the labs but I legit still don’t get it!! And I know I wont be able to do any of those questions if it was written on an exam paper in front of me! I don’t understand anything at all I feel like I legit haven’t learned anything this semester despite really trying. 

And before you say it yes I do go to office hours as much as I can but can’t go everyday since my schedule is pretty much packed Monday-Friday but I do try to make time for it as much as my schedule allows me 



I just feel so defeated and burnt out idk how to help myself, I’m just so hopeless and miserable and the amount of agony and pain I feel from this “super easy” class is legit destroying me mentally in ways I can’t even describe. I can’t even tell my friends or people around me about it bc every time I tried to open up about how much I’m struggling in that class I just get laughed at since “c88 is so easy! How can u possibly struggle in that class” it just makes me feel so alone and 10x shittier about myself I hate it here.","Definitely isn’t an “easy” class when the midterm avg was a 52%
Gotta give yourself a lot more credit with how far you’ve gotten at least and still haven’t given up. When it’s all said and done, you’ll realize how much you’ve gotten out of a class despite what grade you receive, and knowing you tried your best! Every CS class is here is challenging and anyone telling you that CS88 is ‘easy’ are kinda jerks because it’s all relative. What’s more is that CS88 has been steadily getting more difficult over the years. From someone who once struggled big time in CS10.
That class isn't easy. I took it last semester and it beat me to a pulp. The bar to get an A is crazy high and the difficult exams and 2 projects that are 61A difficulty don't help.
Bro cs88 is not an easy class, the struggle is part of the learning
It's inherently not an 'easy' class. I definitely understand and hear you when you say you feel defeated, and burnt out--so do many other students. 

If you're new to Berkeley, it takes time to learn how to study, and distill complex concepts, or even apply them. That being said, how exactly are you studying? Are you taking breaks inbetween study sessions, because your productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness will go down exponentially if you don't. 

Also, in regards to Michael Ball, I do truly feel like he is a great professor, but a lot of the learning for this class goes on outside of the lecture hall. Just because Prof Ball can explain recursion in 5 minutes, does not mean you'll understand how to apply in a situation novel to you--that only comes through practice. But you still have a couple weeks left. Just do your best and try to code, and attack problems the best you can. Prof Ball is incredibly generous with his grades, there are many opportunities for EC as well as he curve to the MT, so just do your best and I'm sure he will take that into account; also, he is pretty active on Reddit so I'm sure he will see this and listen to your feedback.

  
Best of luck on everything, you got this.
Ball is life
I appreciate this, and feel you.   
Almost no one comes to my OH on Wednesday's. (Maybe they're too late...)

I do like to think of myself as a nice person, but people can STFU if they say this class is easy for everyone.

If you want advice around studying / prep /etc. Please do ask! I will also say that I know students who struggle with programming for a while and then things start to click - sometimes it takes more than a semester, so don't be too hard on yourself.
Dw, lower divs play gotcha with you. Once you take upper divs courses and look back at ur 88 assignments, you’ll be wondering why u didn’t get it haha
Ok, here’s a lil motivation story. I’m an intended CS and cogsci double major. I had never taken a coding class prior to Cal. I took CS10 in the fall, did ok but wasn’t one of the top students. I’m currently taking 61A. The first midterm, I was significantly behind everyone else. Like I got less than 50%. I didn’t want to drop the course because I was afraid that I wouldn’t have enough time to declare both majors. So, I stuck it out. I got 100% on all labs, homework’s, and projects. And then I spent as much time as I could learning how to study for 61A. I think I did 4-5 practice midterms total. The result? I had caught up with the rest of the class and am now on track for at least a B (shooting for an A-). Please please please don’t give up. Just because you don’t get it now, doesn’t mean you won’t get it at all. If studying in groups works better for you, try to find people to study with. Go over practice exams but don’t focus on the fact that you got the answer wrong, focus on how you can not get that answer wrong the next time (I still struggle with this). Don’t focus on the grade, focus on the content itself. You’ve got this!
I have had the same experience with people telling me this class is easy, ""how are you struggling? why do you even go to OH?"" I have realized this is not my strongsuit and that's ok, and people who say that stuff probably struggle in other things I'm good at, they maybe just don't verbalize it. (-someone who also thinks c88c is hard)
[deleted]
take the equivalent at a CC... it will be so much more relaxed.
Also in this class and am in the same exact position as you. Same feelings. It sucks.
Thank you for this 🙏
Isn’t this normal for cs classes?
Thank you for this!😭🫶
Omg you’re the first person I’ve seen that agrees with me not being easy😭 at this point I don’t even care about getting an A anymore I just wanna pass the freaking class and with how bad I did on the midterm specially when I thought I ate… so if u have any tips or advice on how I can make it better for myself plz share(:
So happy more people agree on it not being easy😭
Thank you for this, unfortunately I’m not new to Berkeley and graduating next year I’m just new to coding since I’ve decided to minor in ds and you were right he is active and actually replied to this post which I didn’t think he would but now I’m lowkey kinda embarrassed lmao
Yeah well that’s why I didn’t say anything negative about him as a person he’s a very nice guy
Thank you so much for your response professor I really appreciate your understanding. I have a time conflict with your Wednesday office hours which is why I’ve never been able to go to those throughout the semester but I’m gonna try and go this Wednesday, I’m too embarrassed to come show my face but I’ll come if I feel brave enough.
I love you Michael Ball
Hopefully :( but at the same time I feel like if I’m struggling this much in a lower div like this I can’t imagine how much more I’m gonna be struggling for my coding upper divs 🥲
Thank you for sharing your story so happy to hear that you were able to make a comeback! Good luck on the final 🫶
Thank u for this made me feel better! I also feel like coding is not my strongest suit lol
Yeah it’s literally 61a same textbook and same projects too except they don’t cover the last chapter or 61a or something like that so it’s supposed to make it a bit “easier” than 61a bc of that
I might have to if I don’t pass this shit fml
Omg dude we gotta make a comeback for the final! Feel free to study w me if u want 😭
I believe 88 is binned not curved
Tbh I had a very poor understanding of the material too even going into the final, but what helped me get a B+ at least was not bothering to rewatch any lectures because I didn't find them helpful, but rather just looking at the discussion recordings and doing all the problems + CSM worksheets. When they have review sessions during RRR week you should definitely look at all of them and take advantage of every resource they provide, just doing as much practice as you can. I hope everything works out for you in the end!
Yeah don’t feel bad about it, I struggled when I took this class and I ended up fine. Definitely don’t hesitate to ask extra questions in lab/OH if you want to better understand a concept.
It’s very hard to actually fail the class here. Unless you  absolutely do nothing at all. 20% is still a passing mark for 88
What is the difference? Between binned and curved?
Omg thank you for this! Where did you find the csm worksheets? Did you sign up at the beginning of the semester to join them or something?
How did you study for the final? Did you read the textbook? Bc for data8 reading the textbook is what helped me a lot
Tbh my midterm grade is much lower than 20% I just didn’t wanna say the exact score on here just incase the prof or GSI’s see this post so they don’t know who I am 😔
Binned means regardless of how the class does, if u score a certain amount of points ur guaranteed a corresponding grade. 

Curved means that depending on how the class does, ur score will change. If everyone scores a 90 and u score an 75, you’re screwed.
I'm not sure if this works if you didn't join it, but if you check [scheduler.csmentors.org](http://scheduler.csmentors.org) and log in and click on resources, there are worksheets with solutions for all of the classes!
Nah the textbook in 88 is kinda useless. I would watch the csm walkthrough videos and fill in the gaps by asking qs in oh
I see thanks for explaining
Omg you’re so real for this thank u smmm😭
Dude I feel the same way about c88 textbook! Data8’s was pretty helpful but not this one and what’s even more annoying is that there are a lot of videos in the textbook that help understand the concept better but it’s not working and DeNero who’s in charge of it legit said he doesn’t know how it happened and is not fixing it SO ANNOYING 

Also where did u find those walkthrough videos? Were you part of CSM?
Pretty sure they will post them when final logistics come out, but you can always just ask on Ed. Even tho CSM isn’t affiliated the head TA is still super nice about it. I did csm when I took the class and I thought it was super useful, so even if you just watch the vids you will prob learn something.
Ok I see thank you!"

pls help: CS 88 w/Michael Ball VS CS61A w/John Denero&Pamela Fox,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ny068z/pls_help_cs_88_wmichael_ball_vs_cs61a_wjohn/,2021-06-11 23:16:33,"I still need help choosing between these two classes for next sem: i rlly don’t know which to pick. I’m most likely going for DS minor cuz double major w DS will prob be rough for me at this point. ppl tell me to go w/88 bc most who go data science pathway do that i guess, but then others tell me 61A will be more worthwhile. Is there a big difference in level of difficulty between the two? If 61A is significantly harder, might just try to enroll in 88. I’m already enrolled in 61A on waitlist but like #41 so i’m sure i’ll get in. But if it’s a lot harder i’ll just try to get into 88. But if it’s not much of a difference, I think i’d rather take 61A to learn some useful technical skills. The only thing “close” to programming i’ve had is taking data 8. I liked the class more than i thought but it wasn’t a walk in the park for me personally, for reference.","I recommend Cs 88. However you might find 61B a bit harder coming from cs 88 rather than 61A. Just a thought.
I recommend CS88. The only topic you will miss is Interpreters/Scheme at the end, but you will get all of the Python topics, and those will serve you quite well in Data Science.

In addition, CS88 will go at a more manageable pace. Students generally struggle in 61A if their only introduction to coding is Data 8, as 61A goes very fast through difficult topics. CS88 gets to spend a little more time on each of those topics, and many of your classmates will come from similar experience levels as yours.
[deleted]
I’m going ds minor so i won’t need to take 61B! but i definitely was thinking about that when i was considering taking the major instead before.
my other classes are not hard. but i didn’t find data 8 super manageable. it wasn’t like getting out hand for me but it still didn’t come super easily to me -specifically the exams. i couldn’t get away with skipping lectures and not going to OHs. but i def am someone who is slower just in general LOL so if CS 88 covers less over more time, that would be good for me. dang it. so conflicted cuz i’m in a good waitlist spot for 61A. idkkk if it’s possible during phase 2 for me to get a  CS 88 spot. do you know the liklieness for that?
Damn you escaped some hell bruh
[deleted]
You will 100% get into CS61A at Adjustment time.  If fact, you could drop/swap the class with something else rn and add CS61A at Adjustment time and still get in.  That’s how confident I am.  (Well, might be too late  rn since I think Phase 1 is over).
lmaoo. Rlly was tryna tell myself to go for the double major but i don’t think i’m built like that
Will it not swap the classes if 88 ends up not being avail? so that i can save my spot in 61A in case.
oh wow i didn’t know 61A was that flexible. i thought that was the class that i needed to get first so i signed up for it first:/ ya phase 1 over... hopefully i can just swap next phase...
[deleted]
Yeah, shouldn’t be a problem to do that.
ohhh i see. and does it swap you into waitlists or ONLY actually enrolls you fully.
do you think i’d be able to land a spot in CS 88 tho during Phase 2?
Maybe, I would say 50-50.  Are you a rising sophomore?  If so, then you have a better chance than if you are a rising junior.  Chances are a lot of incoming transfer students will eat up the remaining slots for juniors I suspect.
I’m a rising junior"

Summer CS70 vs Fall CS70,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12e5nf5/summer_cs70_vs_fall_cs70/,2023-04-06 18:50:29,I'm having a hard time choosing between Summer 2023 CS70 and Fall 2023 CS70 since the summer session is taught by Nicholas Weaver and Michael Ball while Fall is taught by Rao. Would it make a difference in terms of enjoyment?,Summer is not taught by Nicholas Weaver and Michael Ball it is usually taught by experienced undergrad and grad EE/CS/Math students.  I would recommend taking it in the summer ONLY if you are doing nothing else.  The curve is just better in the summer.
Advice for what UD classes to complete before graduating for an EE/Hardware career,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8vpfq/advice_for_what_ud_classes_to_complete_before/,2022-04-21 12:39:06,"So I guess this would be a follow-up post to my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice\_for\_ee\_classes\_for\_fall\_and\_spring\_2022/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u8uawr/advice_for_ee_classes_for_fall_and_spring_2022/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So here is my current plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

105 with Ali M Niknejad - 4 units

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123, 130 and 189

&#x200B;

Replies from original posts mentioned that the workload for Fall might be too crazy.

And so I have an alternative plan:

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123 and 189

&#x200B;

So it all boils down to if I graduate finishing 5 UD classes (120, 123, 151, 188, and 189). Would this be a good set of classes to take for an EE/hardware job?

If not then I'm forced to go with the first plan and finish 7 UD classes (105, 120, 123, 130, 151, 188, and 189) and suffer for 2 semesters.

&#x200B;

 Thanks for the help!","Don’t take 188. Useless for your career goals and imo pointless to take in general. 

Taking 120/151 are a must. Simply putting 151 on my resume got me interviews from top hardware companies.

If you’re up for it you could squeeze one of 126/127 (I liked 127 better)
Since I’m not an analog hardware engineer maybe I shouldn’t comment, but if you’re interested in that kind of work I would almost suggest using summer to self study 105 and taking 140 next fall instead. I’ve heard that 105 is a good class but won’t get you any job interviews by itself. 120/140/151 will be a heavy workload but if you truly have a passion for these things I think you’ll learn a lot and have fun.
Thank you for your reply! Does it matter if I take 105 and 130 for hardware? Does having them benefit a lot? Does not having them hurt? I'm for sure taking 120, 123, and 151 just not sure about 105 and 130."

Someone who’s watched it/participated, may you bless us with a tl;dr?
Is it possible to pitch to the Bay Area VCs to fund/donate to eecs department? :(
- Per surveys, the current 3.3 declaration model leads to widespread anxiety and mental health concerns, while significantly disadvantaging URM and students with less prior experience. This has led to L&S CS having 3-4% URM lately compared with EECS's 22%.
- Out of MIT, Stanford, CMU, UIUC, UW, and Berkeley, Berkeley has the lowest full-time employment count in CS and by far the highest ratio of FTE to CS degrees issued.
- The College of Engineering receives about $54 per student credit hour (where a credit hour is 3 hours * number of units) relative to the $100-120/SCH funding received. To make up this deficit, we rely on savings from faculty going on leave (which scales directly with the number of faculty, **not** the number of students), or methods such as philanthropy, one-time allocations, fixed allocations, concurrent enrollment, etc. (which do not scale directly with the number of faculty or number of students).
- The gap between costs and funding received means the department is operating under greater and greater deficits.
- For Fall 2023 and beyond, a new proposal is in the works to have ~270 L&S CS freshmen per year. 200 will be accepted directly at time of admission into UC Berkeley, and 70 slots will be reserved for those who did not apply for CS initially but wish to transfer into the program after a year. 50 slots reserved for transfers, direct admits only.
- Potential measures for existing students include reducing the size of lower division courses, prioritizing EECS and L&S CS-intended students over undeclareds, allowing for alternatives such as Math 54 over EECS 16B, etc.
Looking at the draft plans, I would say if it gets approved, it would be a University of Washington style admission process.
Probably; something we wanted to talk about but didn't get to was external funding for EE/CS. One of the topics proposed was if we could get funding directly funneled into a fund for TA budgets instead of being stuck at the administrative level but that needs more digging into before we can concretely say that's a possibility.

Apple hardware for example though has been directly funding some EE/EECS courses, highest being CS152 I believe, and honestly if you're at an internship it might be possible to talk with people about funding the CS side. Opening a conversation tactfully shouldn't hurt anything.
> while significantly disadvantaging URM and students with less prior experience. This has led to L&S CS having 3-4% URM lately compared with EECS's 22%.

This is nuanced.

* EECS hit 22% a single year (last) because they changed admission criteria (remember CS is on academic merit - EECS is more holistic, that is subjective). It's back to 12% this year regardless.  I also don't think it is fair to use the word ""disadvantaged"" (at least in a meritocratic sense) until we have enough data on the GPAs of different groups under this revised admission system.
* LS CS has a significantly higher representation of women (28% vs 20% for EECS).  This bellies the ""less experience"" claim and also suggests the EECS admission criteria is actually *disadvantaging women* (they get in at higher rates under the more meritocratic assessment - and may be more risk averse to apply directly to EECS which can lower their chances of getting into Berkeley)

One thing Berkeley should consider is transferring rejected EECS applicants to the general L&S pool - which at least reduce the bias toward risk taking EECS produces.

On another note, did the video cover why money is not being transferred from other departments given demand for CS?
what's the impact of less FTE? i can see how there are less classes offered, but how less FTE affect class sizes? I would say barely; I would've thought the main variable for scaling classes is hiring TAs to scale with the increased grading and discussion sections and office hour
I thought it was weird that the L&S admit size was ""tuned to get the same admit rate as EECS,"" since he also speculated that people will be more likely to apply L&S to avoid being shut out of Cal. If they try to keep the rates the same the CS admit size will grow, but if they hold onto the CS admit size the CS rate will instantly be worse than EECS. It's just inherently unstable. With any luck they will get to a unified applicant pool quickly because alternatives all end up with miserable game theoretic angles.

I am at least glad that they noticed that the UCSD lottery was a dumb idea (seems like they realized last year, before it failed).
Oooo this is such a good idea, I imagine it will be a win win for both the company and the school.
It makes sense at the university level but not at the department level.  As someone reminded him, if your majors want 189 but can't get in, the play is to make your own customized 189 with blackjack and hookers (e.g., Stat, IEOR); if you do it right, you ask your dean for the added FTE and your department funding grows!
I think something that's also been a bit of a concern is if we actually **do** manage to get private funding and wind up relying on that, how much control do private corporations (or VCs) have on how we teach our courses, what we teach, and more. Almost like when politicians rely on funding from corporations.

The company's main asset would be establishing a direct pipeline to their company, but I'd imagine as a company, they'd want incoming students to have specific types of knowledge, which may not be what the course wants to teach (or primarily) teach and that could cause a conflict of interest.

So all in all... _complicated_!
It also seems large such a dangerous place to put the department in? The university should never *ever* be able to suggest that a department go beg industry for funding, and if EECS starts funding large parts of its TAS budget through it I don't doubt that the university will start expecting them to continue to find external funding and therefore never bother growing or expanding their budget."
thoughts on cs169,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/osrgnx/thoughts_on_cs169/,2021-07-27 10:38:33,"what is the difference between cs169A and cs169L from someone who has taken the class?

I really enjoy projects, so is this a project-orientated class?

are pamela fox and michael ball good profs?","A charges you $30 for a proprietary anti pirating textbook. Waste of money.
Took both, as usual profplum is right with the descriptions. Both are project oriented, but L gives you a full semester to work on a software engineering project while A uses mini projects to teach the fundamentals you need to take L. 

There were a lot of technical problems when I took it last year bc it was a new system, but some of the legendary TAs took the time to revamp it and so it should be a much more polished experience going forward. 

M Ball is the best, he's passionate about teaching and has plenty of domain knowledge and experience to share.
A charges you $30 for a proprietary anti pirating textbook. Waste of money.
A is the software engineering concepts class, L is the 2-unit team project where you build an actual system with a customer.  You can’t take L without A (except for rare circumstances).
One interesting thing about the 169L class is that the grade you get is sort of the way you are evaluated at work, as opposed to how you would normally be evaluated in a normal class.  In a normal class, you do really well on projects and tests, you get a good grade, say an A.  The criteria for 169L is slightly different - sustained week by week effort and maybe even more than that is very important in your evaluation (grade). So if you’re the type that waits until the last minute and then spends 40 hours a day getting the autograder to give you those last few points, that won’t work too well in this class."

Summer 2022:

188

&#x200B;

Fall 2022:

105 with Ali M Niknejad - 4 units

120 with Babak Ayazifar - 4 units

151 Sophia Lab Sophia + Lab - 5 units

195 Lisa Yan & Michael Ball  - 1 unit

&#x200B;

Spring 2023:

123, 130 and 189

Note: Was thinking of taking 140 in Spring but turns out it is only offered in Fall. So chose 130 instead.

&#x200B;

Thanks for the help!

This schedule sounds like a nightmare, and I would break it up if you could.
Yeah agree fall 2022 sounds tough
[deleted]
I see, since I was planning to P/NP 1 class per sem so maybe P/NP 105 for Fall (only need 20 UD units to graduate). Do you think this is a good idea (since I only have a year left)?
Yeah, I tried to fit 105 & 130 in there. Another option would be 120 & 151 for Fall and 123 and 189 for Spring.

Either way, I'm enrolling in the above classes and maybe tweak (P/NP or drop a class) as the semester goes.
I decided to do the following for now:

188->189  
120->123  
151

I decided to not take 105 and 140 to allow myself to really understand 120 and 151 which seem like the two most important classes according to a lot of people!

If I want to go into DSP, do you think it hurts if I don't take 105 and 140, or does it not really matter in the long run? What about Hardware companies in general?"

New Schedule Draft is out for Fa22,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/rvkrew/new_schedule_draft_is_out_for_fa22/,2022-01-03 19:47:26,"Link: [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html)

Interesting stuff I noted was

* CS 61A being taught by Professor P. Fox herself, which is great to see! I guess this means Denero is off in the data science dept, maybe there's news for data8/data100 there as well?
* Professor Hug back in 61b, i wonder if he will continue to teach gitlet so early in the semester if at all, I wonder who will be teaching data 100 then...
* New faculty hire in Lisa Yan (not completely new as they are teaching data100 with Prof Hug this spring [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-data-c100-001-lec-001)),
* Professor Ranade teaching 16b and 127 (which a LOT of people were waiting for),
* Michael Ball teaching 375,
* Professor Popa in 261 (which is completely unrelated from CS 161 which is taught by Nick Weaver -- kinda a shame as I wanted to see him branch out and teach some other classes (61b with Nick sounds fun lol, may make it redesigned in golang though XD, same with 162) but I understand that 161 being offered every semester is important to it being persisted and I'm sure fa22 161 students are overjoyed at the news lol)
* and Professor Rao in CS 70 again also was great to see as they are very familiar at teaching those areas.
* On that note Professor Babak Ayazifar will be teaching both CS 70 and EE 120 per [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/EE/schedule-draft.html) which is great news for anyone who couldn't get in this semester!
* Professor Chasins teaching CS 164 again, seems like a return for OCaml and a tearful goodbye to Hilfinger's ChocoPy (btw where is Hilfinger on here?? I hope he hasn't retired...).
* CS 168 finally being offered although CS 160 is not offered (not an issue since it's usually there in summers),
* Professor A. Sahai teaching  CS 182 (seems like we'll get another bio-focused 189 since he's not there but him teaching a PyTorch class (altho 182 is clearly more than that) falls in line with what I saw in eecs16b),
* 186 being completely online even with everything hopefully back in-person. I guess it will be CS W186 then?
* No CS 188, though if it happens, Russell and D. Song are my guesses for the professors if they get the funding for that to go through and Abbeel still isn't able to teach it.
* As well as a return of a few 194s (I heard a few more are planned yet to be listed though such as Dawn Song's DeFi CS 194/294-177).

&#x200B;

Keep in mind this is still a draft so changes can be made, but thoughts?","Lisa Yan was a lecturer at Stanford for a couple of years. She has a PhD in CS education (also from Stanford) and is an excellent instructor overall. Hug and Yan should be nothing short of the teaching dream team.
Holy shit they resurrected 168 from the grave
It is unlikely that I will do gitlet at all. As much as some students love it, it has relatively poor synergy with the course material, and I also personally find it a bit boring (sorry Joey! It is a **great** project, just not my style). But I'll review all the course evaluations over the summer to decide whether to keep it or not.
goated, thnx for the update
From what I've seen, CS 160 is planned for the spring next year.
182 is more of an applications class.  Wonder how Sahai will approach it.  Hopefully they offer it in the spring with another professor in case he makes it theory intensive.
Ranade and P. Fox, we love to see it
Oh I so want to teach other classes.  But 161 is one of the classes we’ve scaled to meet demand (500+/semester).  The only way to maintain that is run the class every semester.  I’d really like to do 162/redo-162-project-as-194/162 as a sequence.
Good to see 176 back, though Prof Yosef isn’t teaching it.  But since Prof Ioannidis is so involved on the comp bio end, she a good replacement.
Gonna take 182 with my favorite prof
who's pamela fox?
and also what has dan garcia been doing i haven't heard of him since his 61c semester in the first semester of online
damn 176 seems like a really cool class. Doubt I'll get in though. Are prerequisites usually enforced for CS classes?
[deleted]
I miss Ranade
SO happy about babak teaching 120!!
182 is taught in pytorch, not tensorflow
hmm does this mean Shewchuck is not teaching 189 this semester?
Just to clarify, who is teaching 189 in Fa 22?
I'm really interested in 168, but since it's scarcely offered, does anyone know whether it's a difficult class to get into? I'll be a senior then, so i should have a decent slot all things considering
No 188 either.
Is 162 a preq for 168? I’m seeing conflicting info on different sites
I would recommend Demmel/Nelson cs170. I took Jelani Nelson's cs170 and enjoyed his teaching style very much. It's a hard class, don’t get me wrong, but it was all worth it.
Yes, Prof. Hilfinger is retiring. His last lecture is tomorrow 4/29 at 1pm in 155 Dwinelle.
omg you just made me remember that Lisa Yan was the one i was referring to in [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/mm8sb0/comment/gtrc4dp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)   


I'm glad she finally decided to leave Stanfurd for Cal, go bears!
Let's just hope there exist enough TAs out there for the class to be a normal upperdivision size now...
Any thoughts on the lack of a fall offering for its future? Dyt it doesn’t matter as much as other classes because of summer + is cs160 usually a “fall xor spring” class?

I didn’t mention stuff like 270 not appearing for that reason (it’s biyearly spring only)!
I actually have the opposite viewpoint: Marvin Zhang's 182 appears to be less application-focused than past iterations (the usual final project is now a final exam being the main point, until the course site comes out not much more to say on the matter). I hope Sahai recognizes the power of PyTorch and brings back an application-based final project, as he did when introducing those notebooks into 16b. Marvin Zhang making DS 189 Listgarten/Malik-theory oriented instead of Shewchuk application-oriented is another example of how he prefers theory but we will have to wait and see what actually happens this spring (note that this makes sense for DS as many of those students are double majoring in a subject like biology so listgarten's version does make more sense to offer to DS students).

However, you very well could be correct. Maybe Sahai will make it even more theory intensive as that's always a possibility. The fact that NNs need big data makes me hope a deep NN class would be very application-based but if Sahai ruins it then we always have Levine's [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL\_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A) to lean back on and audit... definitely not the same though :(
Yeah I’m sure other universities would also love seeing a Rust OS project on the scale of pintos 👀

After all Berkeley did take inspiration from Stanford, this could be a chance for Berkeley to give back and help lead education in that sector!
hopefully me and you both survive through bestie 😵‍💫
Pamela Fox is a new lecturer who has taught 61a alongside DeNero and Hilfinger in the past alongside some other classes (she was a CS 302 co-lecturer last spring, the class for summer instructors, maybe 169 as well iirc but i have a shaky memory there and the other Professor Fox teaches that so I very well could be confounding the two).

I talked to her once about the work she did at Khan Academy on their CS curricula (which I actually used as a kid growing up)  as well as some stuff she did on Coursera. She's done *a* *lot* for 61a these past few semesters and I'm interested in seeing how she changes the course as it's a course that has been evolving a lot recently with SQL → Regex → BNF etc, as well as an A+ project and new additions from when I took it! I can tell she cares about teaching a lot and have had heard good things about people who took 61a with her though she came just after my time... I took 61a in su20 haha.

And I think Dan was on sabbatical.
usually not
yeah and we could also use those profs to teach grad classes like 286, does 186 still use Hellerstein's lectures lol?
well now she's back from her leave and teaching 2 classes at that :)
yeah, usually he teaches 120 in the spring only, this is quite a surprise IMO but a pleasant one at that!
yeah... i think i misremembered because it was pytorch that Prof Sahai introduced into eecs16b this semester (which is what i referred to), i think i just typed the wrong thing, ill edit it, thanks!
He is for spring 22, the above is for fall 22 which is after sp22.
Also note that Shewchuk is only teaching CS 189, DS 189 will be taught by Marvin Zhang
NVM: Listgarten and Malik
prolly will be. but i think most seniors will get into it. i doubt any juniors will get in. Depends on how big the class is also, if its around 500, itll be fine but if its < 300, then big yikes
FWIW there were 500 seats last time it was offered [https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-spring-compsci-168-001-lec-001)
it's not, that's an old prereq
and she can also teach CS 168 in the future so this is incredibly based
BTW, Lisa Yan also did her undergrad at Cal, which is doubly awesome
Prof. Fox co-taught 169 this past semester. I didn’t love the class (more specifically, I absolutely hated it), but its failings weren’t her fault and she clearly has a passion and a great talent for teaching CS. It’ll be cool to see her teach a class that isn’t buzzwordy garbage!
that's good. Still don't think i'll get in though since I'm not a cs major and I imagine seats are reserved T_T.  thank you for the answer!
[deleted]
Oop you're right my apologies.

Wait, 182 is being offered Fa22?! Let's goo!
ya but there were more TAs back then since 168 was offered once a year. Its been 2.5 years since, so there will be a lack TAs along with the fact that the budget is less
Thank you
yeh as i said above, havent taken a class with her so everything above was second-hand anecdotal. Though i bumped into her in Soda a couple of times and she was a nice person to talk to. Am also a huge fan of her work at Khan Academy. I think she'll do good things with 61a though i thought it was a great class as is when i took it (doesn't mean that it cant improve ofc).
if you phase 1, and wait it out then who knows
:o isn’t that the first live lec 186 in awhile? Is this confirmed or could this still change, might have to sign up for it if so
Yeah that’s also usually a spring-only class, I was surprised to see it there… I also think this is  Prof A. Sahai’s first time teaching it, should be an interesting experience
yeah ive been worrying about that myself tbh"
various 88's vs cs88,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/y5ueh0/various_88s_vs_cs88/,2022-10-16 15:52:05,"hey, i read through a bunch of old posts here and i'm still so fucking confused. there's a cs88, data 88, polisci88, eps88, stat88, urmom88. trying to decide between one of these (???) and 61a for next sem, but i'm super confused on how they compare to each other in terms of actually teaching the coding fundamentals i'd need for 61b, since the department ones (not in cs /ds) don't seem to be taught by cs profs. any insight would be appreciated, thanks!","CS88 is usually taught by Michael Ball, who’s on CS course staff.  He’s a really good guy to talk to and dedicated.  He’s on this sub once in a while.   I do agree with the other poster that CS61A is generally the preferred path to 61B, but CS88 (Data C88C) is ok if you’re not planning on being a CS major.
cs 88 = officially data c88c

stat 88 = officially data c88s

data 88e = lowerdiv course you can take in place of econ 1/econ 2 if you are doing a econ domain emphasis for data science major

They renamed cs88 and stat88 this semester bc they are officially in the data science department now, but people still refer them to their old names which makes it really confusing. I don’t think eps88 and polisci88 are related to these courses at all but correct me if I am wrong 

I personally recommend cs61a as the course that will  best prepare you for 61b, but many data science majors take cs88 and go to cs61b. You should be fine taking 61b after cs88 though (but you may have to work harder in 61b/it’ll be more difficult), since it teaches you the same content as 61a but is at a slower pace since it doesn’t cover scheme (last topic in 61a) and some of the beginning stuff because I think it assumes that you have some basic python knowledge from data8? not too sure though since I have not taken cs88 myself"
"Background on the strike, why I'm on strike, and why you should be too",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yy57d9/background_on_the_strike_why_im_on_strike_and_why/,2022-11-17 15:38:00,"Hi folks! I'm Liam, a member of CS 170 course staff.

We are currently in the midst of the largest academic strike in US History – as many of you have likely heard by now, over 48,000 academic workers are currently on strike. As of today, bargaining teams from all four academic bargaining units are attempting to negotiate with the University, and this small window of time will prove to be a crucial moment that must be capitalized on. The contract we decide on will govern us for years to come.

**Why you should strike/picket/support your staff:**

Students:

We are fighting for funding, specifically a more livable compensation for our teachers and a dedicated increase in EECS staffing from the UC. This will lead to a better learning experience for you as students, giving you advantages such as:

\- shorter OH queues

\- more small group tutoring

\- with more staff, you will be able to get into the classes you want to take

In addition to this, the students who are most vulnerable are those who were not privileged enough to receive extra academic preparation beforehand; students with less experience often have a difficult time in computer science, especially here at Berkeley, and it frequently results in them being turned away from it. This manifests itself in the following ways:

\- students are expected to do exceptionally well in our massively sized and difficult lower divs, yet are left to drown, lacking adequate course support

\- if students cannot pass the GPA requirement, they cannot even enroll in CS classes

\- non-majors, e.g. CS-cluster applied math majors, are not allowed to enroll in CS upper-divs period

\- the poor compensation and long hours make the (u)GSI position much less attractive to those who have to pay for school themselves(they could engage in private tutoring instead, or some other job that pays market rate), reducing the diversity in course staff and limiting access to these important jobs(which can be a stepping stone for an academic career) for underrepresented students

It is not hard to see that it is those students who are the least groomed-beforehand for CS (i.e. underprivileged students, the backbone of our diversity) that end up suffering the most; *if the University of California wants to continue to lay claim to its storied diversity, it must deal with the fact that it can only do so by diverting funding to the aspects of the school that actually serve to constitute and nurture this diversity.*

**Background on the strike for EECS:**

EECS has the largest population of academic workers on campus. Teaching quality has suffered. The way we've adapted is by resorting to more ""scalable"" options that aren't very productive for your learning, or for our assessment of your learning. We have created mass auto-graders to check your code instead of having a TA present to help you go line-by-line; the latter is how it should be, especially at the greatest public university in the country. We've resorted to multiple choice and short answer questions, discouraging creativity and stripping away from students the ability to explain why they chose what they chose –  we've increasingly taken away the human aspect of teaching, the aspect of teaching that leaves permanent, endlessly inspirational impressions on students. Personalized feedback and guided assistance is the most effective way to learn. Without this, we might as well all go on coursera to learn from Andrew Ng and search up practice problems on our own and grade them on our own – keep in mind how much you’re paying to be here. Is it so much to ask that courses be adequately staffed, in a non-exploitative manner? Because we cannot afford to hire more TAs, the quality of teaching in our department has really suffered. I’m sure many of you can attest to this.

In addition, lower division courses often have to rely on unpaid labor to adequately support students. Since they don't have enough money to hire more tutors and TAs, they often will rely on Academic Intern labor just to serve the course. I was both an AI and a volunteer for computer science mentors; Computer Science Mentors (CSM), a volunteering club, is also heavily sought after for assistance in the lower divisions. *To put it bluntly, the University of California is relying on unpaid volunteers in order to provide only the most basic academic infrastructure for their students*. It would be hard to call this anything but abhorrent and exploitative, and it has the stark consequence that the more vulnerable students who cannot afford to provide unpaid labor cannot get the experience they need in order to be competitive for a paid position; again, we claim to be committed to diversity here.

**Why I'm on strike:**

This is my 4th time on course staff.

OH queues are ridiculous. For example, the course I'm currently serving has 2-3 people staffing an office hours that regularly draws 30+ students, each of whom is different and deserves their own individualized assistance. This is all that we can afford. The homework in my class is hard, and more likely than not, each person needs a lot more time than the mere 10 minutes we allot to each student to understand the material. But there are more people in the queue, and unfortunately we just have to move on to the next person before adequate assistance can be given.

Here’s some simple math: in each block of one hour, each staff member can talk to 6 students on average. Since we have 2-3 staff, that means 12-18 students get help in an hour. There are 30 students and people are continually coming into OH for help. We simply cannot reach everyone in a timely manner. *I have friends that are discouraged from coming into office hours due to what is regularly a 2-3 hour long queue.*

I was a student in an upper division EECS class last year. I was at office hours once with 20+ students. There was one TA, who was there for one hour. Nonetheless, when that TA left, most of us were left no better off than we were before OH started. There were simply not enough people to staff that OH.

What would we do with more money? Staff OH properly. Hire more tutors for group tutoring! My course (CS 170) is difficult and people would benefit massively from small group tutoring, such that we can go through the algorithms and strategies together, and provide personalized feedback. We could afford to hire more people to read through your code and suggest best practices – who doesn’t want this? We could get rid of the rubrics for design docs that make it hard for you to really learn. We could make exams that actually test your knowledge, in a manner that’s far more equitable and far more thought-provoking than a small fill-in box, or bubble-in circle.

The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring. This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. *This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.*

**There's another, arguably more important side to it:**

GSIs, ASEs, and lecturers are heavily overworked and underpaid. Due to a lack of staff, we often have to take up extra work – we have to choose between our students and our own personal well-being. I've been forced to choose between a break in between my discussion and my office hours after a long day of work, or helping my students. This is tortuous because every single one of us feels a genuine, human obligation to our students. There are so many great things about teaching, and the university expects us to quietly bear the unnecessary hardships (overwork, underpay) just so we can do what we love. We as an academic community deserve to work with dignity – we should not be told to keep our heads down and suck it up. It is a job.

Lecturers often have to cover for the lack of funding and it hurts them immensely, not to mention the fact that it just isn’t fair. For GSIs in particular: GSIs are rent-burdened, overworked, and especially underpaid. They are people like anybody else, and should not have to be living paycheck to paycheck, if they’re even managing that. They deserve a living wage, especially here in the bay where everything is just unthinkably expensive.

**What you as a student can do:**

\- Show support for your staff on Ed. Tell them you support them. Heart their strike posts on Ed, it means a lot

\- Make a post on Ed encouraging TAs who are on strike to keep striking, ans TAs who aren’t on strike yet to start striking

\- Show up to the picket line. Visibility is super important in a strike.

\- [Sign the community support petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/uaw-undergraduate-letter-of-support?source=direct_link&).

\- Tell your friends who are indifferent about the strike why they should support the strike, and engage in proactive dialogues wrt the strike among your acquaintances.

**For those of you that feel that you have a duty to your students:**

Students are currently suffering, have been suffering, and will continue to face the consequences of understaffed courses until something changes. My heart sinks when I hear that my students are discouraged from coming into office hours because of 3-hour queues; I know, we all know that students greatly need more individualized support. Without any change, we will not be able to provide that which we know our students need. They deserve a better education than they are currently being provided, and in my opinion, fulfilling your duty to them means going on strike and picketing until UC can meet our demands. Only then will we be able to serve our students in the manner in which they should be served, as students at the #1 public university in the country.

**GSIs who are still going into work:**

\- You are likely overworked and underpaid.

\- There is little job security. For some PhD students, every semester is a new struggle to find funding, since not every PI has enough GSR funds, and GSI appointments are semester-by-semester

\- The quality of the education here will skyrocket with more funding. We will not have to resort to autograders and multiple choice questions – this means a more fulfilling, and more importantly less soulless, teaching experience.

EECS especially has had to deal with the brunt of the UC's unfair labor practices. Classes are universally understaffed, students cannot enroll in classes that they want or even need to take, lecturers and TAs are heavily overworked, and there is little job security for researchers and academic employees alike.

**Why we need to be out on the picket line:**

*Withholding labor is only half the battle.*

Picketing is so important because it gives us the visibility that is needed to make real change at the university-wide level. This visibility goes very far in showing the University how much power we, as the academic workers at the school, hold. We do a large majority of the work in the EECS department and the University must be made to understand how crucial we are as academic workers to the everyday-functioning of the school. No academic workers means no UC Berkeley. If we just sat at home and did nothing, the university would not care or notice. By making a lot of noise, it is unambiguously shown how many of us there are, and how much we are willing to do to be treated only fairly.

Plus! Picketing is fun! There is music, dancing, food, and all of your friends there along with you. You meet new people from different departments. You connect with others who are each there for their own reason. *These are valuable connections – anybody who’s friends with a grad student knows that it’s a great thing to have.*

**We are making history out there. There have been, there are, and there always will be many who would like to see the University of California made into a docile, lifeless machine – in the words of Mario Savio we must throw our bodies upon the gears, or we risk being enveloped eternally within them. See you on the picket line.**

Bingo!!!! this guy gets it.  Good job.
I’m all for the strike, but looking at the goals I don’t see how higher paid GSIs is going to increase funding for more GSI’s and improved undergrad experience. It might make it worse if budgets are already set for a number of departments no?

Genuine question here. I understand why it's necessary but sadly I don't know much about the financial situation of UC and I'm just wondering how the university is going to pay more once they reach an agreement with the union? Do they have a lot of extra money that they are spending on nonessential matters now (exceedingly high wages for administrators, buying random expensive things that only a few people use) or are they going to have to get the money from somewhere else (raising tuition, more funding from state gov, reallocating fund from sports or research)? If they are spending the money unwisely then they definitely need to use those money to pay our academic workers better. If they don't, does that mean researchers and atheletes will have less funding or we students have to pay a higher tuition?
OP post
I’m kinda confused on the budget for this, if salaries are increased and staffing is increased, where is the money coming from, higher tuition?
Quick question: Is my math here right? [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi_gsi_pay_gap_is_gsi_pay_really_only_16hour/)

I've been trying to understand the whole deal. Like I think right now UGSIs make $34/hour and GSIs make $16/hour. Is that right? And if the union wins that goes to $66/hour for UGSIs and $30 an hour for GSIs? 

I really hope you can get more money, especially for GSIs, but still honestly a little conflicted about the proposed UGSI pay if I'm understanding correctly. Like I can justify it that UGSIs can land really good internships, but if I'm just totally off base that'd also be good to know.
See hundreds of CS, EECS, DS and more students out on picket lines and supporting each other makes me so proud!   


The myth that engineers do not care and are uninvolved is clearly wrong!
I don't think the issue with CS is entirely due to low pay/benefits. CS is definitely overcrowded and deserve a larger share of the university budget overall, because it takes on a disproportionately higher teaching load.

What strike would do is put pressure to cut cost, which is already there. That's why CS is admitting fewer students and dropping graduation requirements right now.
The best way to support your GSIs is to post on Ed!  Make it known that you support them!
This is a really helpful post, thank you. I have a question about the $54,000/yr salary number. My understanding that is for 20 hrs/wk work. How can anyone expect to survive working only part-time? I know I am missing something so that is why I am asking, but it is unreasonable to me that people think they can take a part-time Job and that will support them. 

For examples, The literary workers in New York City are also striking right now. Many of them make around $40k/yr, have graduated from college, work full time and have to live in NYC.
This post is SO GOOD
I remember back when grad school was about school, and being a student was being a student...

...if someone referred to me as an ""Academic Worker"" I would be offended. I'm here to learn, and discover truth! I'm not here for a job. If I wanted a job, I'd have gone into industry.
Thank you Liam!!
Don’t forget defunding UC police.  You’re also on strike to defund UC police.
Fight for 66! ($66/hr and tuition reimbursement for uGSIs)
How would the strike lead to shorter office hours wait times? Higher wages would probably mean they hire fewer people right? That’s very simple microeconomics.
Stop harassing undergrads.
no on is gonna read this god damn book you just posted
I don’t go here. But what happens to your grades and Assignments? Is there concern over that or no?
Why don’t TAs just quit?

Everyplace is hiring.
Not exactly. In fact there are no discussions being held and (I believe) no OH being held either. As for Ed, the amount of support is nowhere near normal levels. Since Homework 12 is optional, I would assume most people have elected to focus their efforts elsewhere.
How does this reconcile with Justin scabbing?
I had the same question as well, as an alum who hasn't kept up with the situation. I had to re-read the post, but the OP does address it in the bottom of ""Why I'm on strike."" I take this to mean they're asking for an increase in headcount, and that puts pressure on departments / the school for higher hiring budgets? 

>**The union is bargaining for a 50% increase in EECS hiring.** This will allow us to have more properly staffed courses and an exceptional increase in teaching quality. This is crucial for the EECS department. No more 3-hour OH queues. More spots in classes. Graduating on time.
Two separate demands at the bargaining table. Higher pay, as well as increased staffing. Also, happier GSI makes for better teaching in my opinion.
They're two separate demands. Yeah it does sound counterproductive at first to ask for more money AND more GSI positions, but honestly EECS is small compared to the entire UC system so even the higher cost per GSI is going to be irrelevant in the bigger picture.  Like increasing everyone's wages is going to cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year, so a small number of extra positions in one department at one campus is not a big deal, esp. if they resolve the UGSI / GSI pay gap issue (assuming it exists and I did my math right).
I’m honestly not optimistic about future CS undergrad exp. Waiting two hours for a 10 minute uGSI session (who barely knows the topic better than you do) does more than dissuading you from seeking help: it trains your ability to do independent work to the point where seeking help is not even a part of your mind when you enter upper div courses. The current revealed gap already seems unfulfillable, and just imagine how many hidden gaps we are missing here…
I think the additional hiring is for TAs, tutors, etc. not faculty.
This will come from UC central funding, not the department. UC has the money.
My worry is that if the university is forced to both pay more and hire more they just won’t offer classes every semester to balance it out
Very OP
Couple things to clear up. In reality they are working full time. They are working as research assistants, as well as student instructors. They teach, do their own research, help their professor with research, and have their own classes on top of that. They are not working 20 hours. They are working much more (Teaching + research). Next, there is a cap on how much they can work. They cannot get above 20 hours of pay. They are also in school for 5-7 years. Are we really to expect them to live paycheck to paycheck for that long? They are productive instructors and researchers/academics and deserve to make a living wage. They quite literally make this school function. I am glad the librarians are striking. The bay area is quite expensive as well. Grad students have also graduated from college. We want this to be setting a benchmark for academic salary and hopefully other schools/organizations will follow suit for fair pay.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs.

If Berkeley wants to remain competitive as a top grad school, it needs top talent. To obtain top talent, it needs to get as close as it can to what other schools can offer. If top graduate students stop coming here, Berkeley very quickly devolves into a teaching school. Without good GSRs to do the ""grunt"" work for them, PIs would be less productive. Without good GSIs that can alleviate the effort of teaching, faculty would have more work teaching, and be less productive. Faculty choose to remain at Berkeley, despite the lower pay, because of the human capital: other faculty and high quality graduate students.

So it is ok for you to think that Berkeley shouldn't pay grad students for ""part time work"", just understand that it would just lead to destroying grad programs here and improving grad programs elsewhere.

From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge. Knowledge creates technology, which has massive spillovers/positive externalities. Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.
why does this subreddit has so much astroturfing

there honestly needs to be a limit on karma/account age before you can comment or post outside of the main Q&A megathread
Fuck off, and stop posting in bad faith about the most obscure corner of the proposal that 99% of people don't care about.
come back to reality
Context: This is for 20 hour GSI/head TA. This amounts to 54k a year, which is calculated based on the cost of living in the bay, as well as to make sure GSIs are not rent burdened, which is defined as spending more than 30% of income on rent.  This is the GSIs primary income. They are capped at 20 hours. They cannot get paid for more than that. For all their research and teaching, 54k what they should receive.
Holy fuck uGSIs are asking for A LOT more than what grad students get paid if true.
Ok, if you want to make more money than what a google internship pays, better become a C++ cow and work for Citadel.
Two separate demands. One for higher wages. The other specifically for increased EECS staffing. The increased staffing will lead to shorter OH wait times.
I personally haven't seen this behavior on my own picket line, but I personally have experienced jeering from some other picketers while walking to the library when I took a shift off. I really hope this isn't the norm for most picket lines, and I don't think it is. I'll make sure to talk to the people on my picket line for sure and some of the union leaders about this issue!
Fucker Carlson strikes again
Ah gotcha is this an eecs specific point?
Question for you, realistically what is the chance that both demands got fufilled? I wholeheartedly wish that can happen. I can definately see that EECS enrollment is impacted by short staffing and budget cut, and there have been lectures asking for more budget to the department as well. Hiring 50% more will improve undergrads experience, but bring this up under a post that advocate for GSIs higher pay is confusing as these demand conflits with each other.

It's not librarians. It is people at HarperCollins - literary workers in the publishing industry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/books/harpercollins-strike.html)

Well, I really want to support the strike so need to keep learning and will continue to do my best in that. Right now it seems you have lots of options, including coming back to school to get advanced degrees. Are they not allowed to work outside of the university? People like me worked 3 jobs just to be able to go to college and get my undergraduate degree. After college we worked 2 or sometimes 3 jobs to be able to afford to live where we live, had roommates and ate at happy hours. I am not unsympathetic, sincerely trying to understand but at the moment it doesn't sound like slave labor to me.
I'd be really interested in the net cost differences between Cal and similarly ranked programs because for instate undergrad there is a huge difference in cost vs. similarly ranked (mostly private) schools. Is that not the case for grad school?

And do note, I don't think Berkeley should not pay their part-time grad workers, but in my ignorance, I don't think $54k/yr is gawd awful pay. Median income in Alameda County is $45,882. Thank you for taking the time to give more food for thought. I appreciate it and do hope working conditions improve and a fair wage is worked out.
It's not obscure and it's abhorrent. Get the union to take it off so we can stop getting distracted by it. People DO care about it and it worries people that the union would be so stupid. What other stupid things might they do in the name of caring for their workers. For better or worse, members need to keep their leadership straight!
I’m just stating what the union is asking for / what the strike is all about
Devil's Advocate question. Why is it expected that GSIs be able to earn a living wage off of a 20 hour position? Both undergraduate and professional schools expect you to have negative net income, with the assumption future salary more than outweighs the costs.
Why would it be for 20 hours? My understanding is that you guys often put in 40 hours of work per week, so why not put in for reclassification as 40-hour per week full-time employees with the same salary? That is what I presumed was being advocated for this whole time, as it makes the most sense.
You have to keep in mind that the UC relies on the legal fiction that grad students only work 20 hours per week.
Unless things have changed since my day, uGSIs with 10 hour appointments make bank (well over $50/hour) thanks to the fee waivers.
So shorter office hours for EECS and longer for other classes?
That would really help the perception of the strike I believe.
Yes this is EECS specific but, to my understanding, it is the first time the UC has ever allowed bargaining over staffing for any department so this is a step in the right direction for everyone else
Sounds like it
The raise would bankrupt the department, but the union is saying the university should fund the increased staff levels AND the raises. The union site says the total cost of the whole thing is only 3% of the UC budget.
It’s super common for PhD students to be restricted from having any other jobs or if generous be limited to say 10 hrs/wk. For masters students it can be different, but PhD students are limited to the salary the UC and their department set for typically 5-7 years of their 20s and/or 30s.
You're missing the main point: grad students are not like undergrads. They're not like students at all, except for the first year or two of the program. PhD students in particular are expected to work extreme hours on their research, with teaching being something they fit in as they can. This research is not generally some self-directed thing for the educational benefit of the student. It is actual directed work necessary to maintain the universities standing, and continue to bring grant funds in. 

When I was a PhD student, my advisor made it very clear that he expected 60 hours of work a week. The fact that this is recorded as a 'part-time' 20 hours a week job is just a legal fiction that allows the University to avoid labor laws. GSRs and GSIs are direct employees of the university, and they are absolutely expected to work more than full time for that employer, regardless of what is put on paper to avoid paying benefits.
I think the point is we don't want grad students workers to have to work 2 or 3 full time jobs to survive. Again, they don't have much time on their hands after doing their own research, helping their professor with research, taking classes, studying for qualifying exams, as well as running EECS classes. I'd say they barely have enough time to do all that I just listed. Given that, finding outside work isn't that feasible in my opinion. For more perspective on understanding this, talk to some grad students and hear them out directly. I personally can only say what I've heard grad students tell me, but I'm sure if you talk to some yourself, you'll find some answers.
Nobody is getting 54k a year today. Mine is 30, many programs pay 24.

What do you mean by net cost? Tuition is funded by the departments.
It's about a lot more. You are focusing on literally the most controversial sounding piece of the proposal. UGSIs aren't that common across the whole system and you are trying to shoot down the whole strike because some relatively tiny group of people is going to make $66/hour under the current proposal (which is subject to change). You are totally ignoring the other 47000 people going on strike. See [https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/](https://www.fairucnow.org/cola/), like people literally cant afford to be grad students at Berkeley despite working 40 hours or more per week.
As a grad student I struggle with this question all the time and I don’t have a good answer. Because we do get tuition covered as part of our compensation package. One issue is that if we can’t afford to live here we will just go somewhere else where pay does have better correlation to cost of living. Another argument is that we should actually restructure graduate education as whole since PhD programs in other countries are considered jobs. 
If someone has a better answer I would love to see it! Because I support a lot of these initiatives and would love to get paid more but can make sense of UC’s “logic”
Because graduate students after the first year or two are basically working full time for the university for its benefit. At the beginning I think they all take classes, but eventually they're either in a lab 40 hours per week or they're teaching 20 hours a week and doing 20+ hours of research. 

I don't know much about professional schools, but I assume that students in them are mostly taking classes and doing assignments, rather than providing 40+ hours of valuable labor to their school.
From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition. Berkeley was already a tough choice compared to similar ranked programs because of the financial burden before years of inflation - other schools make you teach half and pay you more in less COL areas. The situation is even worse now - people are starting to consider lower ranked programs.

Further, there's no way of creating research professionals without years of grad school, so if we remove any incentives to produce research we will have a shortage of research professionals in 10 years.
What I'm saying is, according to what the union proposed on the salary adjustment, uGSI will get much more than grad students if the union won(66 vs \~30). So the pay gap between undergrads and grads will look even worse if you are implying grad students typically works more than 20 hrs.
Here's the thing. The UC budget is almost entirely salaries. The budget is also siloed, the medical centers/hospitals operate under a separate budget then the teaching parts.

What the union is proposing is firing/layoffs for probably 5% of the non hospital people (5% of the salaries, really) and taking that money and using it to up the pay of the people on strike.

It's not a bad idea, but it's just hard to imagine the university actually doing it 

I mean Elon musk just cut 50% of Twitter and that seems to be still functioning. So maybe the UC could do something similar.
So how is being able to get a PhD not a privilege? Who gets to go to school that long and not have to save money in order to do it? Doesn't getting a PhD generally increase your earning potential? I am not saying that I don't value education and in fact, I value education for the sake of it, but I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system. Which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing but perhaps someone should say that instead of saying they are rent-deprived.
Sooo, what I am hearing from you is that these employers (advisors, etc) are massively breaking the employment laws in California. It is interesting to me you would strike before reporting these horrendous breaches. Has that route ever been taken?
Will do. No one is suggesting 2-3 full time jobs, part-time jobs. Its sounding pretty privileged to me. I will keep asking and learning...
Nope. The most controversial is the defunding, deactivating of any police allowed on campus.
Wait, in what countries? Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc, and it's not like that up north...
So in some programs, the grant research directly tied to the dissertation, but sometimes the paid research might be different from the research for dissertation. Since 12 credit hours of research for a degree is separate from the 20 paid hours. 

Yes I support the strike and the initiatives being bargained for! I am not trying to undermine it with this. I just think the big picture of grad students as students instead of workers needs to shift at the university level across academia in general and thats a much bigger task.
>From a pragmatic viewpoint, because of competition.

Honestly, I'm really skeptical of this argument.  Competitive industries do not have labor strikes -- pay disputes are resolved by workers switching companies and not accepting offers at underpaying ones.   I'm guessing UC does not actually see that effect or they would have already been incentivized to act.

>From a societal viewpoint, unlike undergrad and professional students, PhD students are producers of knowledge instead of consumers of knowledge.

I think this is a more relevant argument to my question. It does seem to be a systemic problem though (UC if anything is put at a competitive disadvantage paying so much above market); I guess you need to start somewhere though. GL.
We are also advocating for 20 hour GSIs to be compensated at 54k yearly as well.
Ah, I missed the 'u'. Personally, I've always felt that it doesn't make sense to have undergrads receive the TA stipends with fee coverage, but I guess the department does need TAs. It does seem like a bit of a disservice to the other undergrads, though...

But yea, $66/hr plus fee waiver is kind of nonsensical for undergrads.
Sure it’s a privilege. For me personally, I didn’t feel like I could do it until I worked for a few years after undergrad and had some savings to fall back on because the pay is so low. It really depends on the field and career track as to whether it increases earning potential. For me, I’ll make the same or slightly more (will take a long time to make up for these years if ever), but I hope it’ll bring me a livable wage doing something more intellectually challenging than my previous track. Those who end up as adjuncts within academia, a path academia created for PhDs, may be on a worse salary trajectory than without a PhD. 

However, the UC has a stated goal of promoting diversity and inclusion within higher education. Right now, the pay is a huge barrier to that goal. Lower income students are less likely to get there in the first place, and they’re also much more likely to drop out due to financial hardship bc their stipend doesn’t cover the cost of living. After you graduate you’re encouraged to then go make low pay/minimal benefits for additional years as a postdoc in the hopes of landing one of the few coveted tenure track roles. Anecdotally, it’s obvious to me that a lot of students in my program get frequent/monthly parental support to supplement their income, which means their families are in a relatively comfortable situation. If the UC is serious about bringing a broader range of people into academia, pay needs to be higher. Otherwise, it’s just talk and academia will continue to be a place dominated by people with wealthy and/or professor parents.
>I always envisioned I'd have to pay for that education and that the work pay would be supplemental so this all seems to me like changing the system.

They ARE trying to change the system, they see the current system as exploitative and unfair, and there are merits to that argument (see OPs post).  It varies department by department,  research lab by research lab, and class by class on whether it actually is exploitative, and if so, how much.

Some grad students have to be a GSI most every semester because they don't have any GSR funding, yet are still expected to do research.  If the research is advancing the status of their lab and furthering efforts of research grants (rather than themselves), that strikes me as quite exploitative.  If they are doing independent research on an esoteric topic that no one is willing to fund, the question is why should that be supported by taxpayers or tuition or.... ?  (Where else is the money coming from?)

Grad students who are primarily paid as GSRs, and whose GRS appointments from their PI's grants/funding are bumped to 100% in the summer months (this is allowed and happens in some engineering departments), and who have reasonable career paths in and outside of academia after graduation... These people probably deserve a raise too (hello inflation!), but they don't seem exploited.  There is zero recognition by the union that there IS training going on beyond just first year classes.  Grad students are generally much much less productive researchers than post-docs.

GSI's who are working more than 20 hours a week average on instruction tasks should immediately raise this to the instructor and more staff should be hired - this is not OK and is exploitative.  Extreme expectations on research time for GSRs is also not OK.

The demand for fully subsidized childcare really gets to me, even though I generally support subsidized childcare.  There are programs for low income people to get childcare grants and these should be expanded / easier to access / less waiting.  But there is no special reason a grad student (who could be married to a high paid tech worker) deserves free childcare more than a retail employee, and no reason UC should be responsible for implementing this huge social benefit (that democrats tried and failed to pass).

A sizable wage increase and some other things, I support 100%.  Not to ""both sides..."" this, but.... there is a side to it beyond the reddit narrative.  
(edit, typo)
You'd think so, but nope! The UC has explicit exemption from many of the employment laws that apply to all other employers. Neat, huh?
Graduate student positions are created as half-time appointments to enable students to spend the other 50% of their time on independent research. To encourage this, many graduate students are contractually prohibited from taking a second job  during the 20 hours/wk that we not compensated for. We are stuck in a position where we are only compensated half time, but not allowed to seek outside employment. This is what is causing a lot of the disconnect between public-facing UC messaging and graduate student demands. There is no way they will give us full-time appointments, so we have to push for higher compensation for what is on paper a half-time appointment but is in reality an all-consuming job.
The 50% threshold is actually because it’s a requirement for international students to be on student visas, not because PhD students are expected to work only those hours
>Can't be in Europe where the academic pay is zilch even after post-doc,

Where are you getting this?
Most PhD programs in Europe pay very well with less teaching load, actually.
Interesting! Hmm, yeah if someone is getting funded by a grant from the government or however that works, it does seem complicated if all of the sudden they are twice as expensive.
If you are skeptical, go around a group of grad students and ask them where they had offers from and why they chose Berkeley.   


Competitive industries most certainly have strikes, but even if you assume that they don't, there are several reasons why grad school acceptance is not a perfectly competitive market, most importantly the fact that it is something that you can only choose once and switching costs are incredibly high. Your argument is basically ""I won't take a 100 dollar bill from the floor, since if it was real, someone else would already have taken it"".   


UC did not see the effect because grad students just accepted it quietly. Several departments pay an extra stipend to try to compete with other schools, but since the majority of pay comes from GSI/GSR appointments it was not enough.
Apparently few other ppl in the comments and them are referring to this post, and it's literally 66/hr vs half the amount for GSI instead of same pay.

https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/yx0mrr/ugsi\_gsi\_pay\_gap\_is\_gsi\_pay\_really\_only\_16hour/
This is THE best post on this I've seen. Thank you. Helps so much!  And for the record, I did state that changing the system is not necessarily a bad thing but I was just looking for someone to say that instead of complaining that people can't pay their rent. Thank you again.
I'd heard the Regents are an entity unto themselves and somehow incredibly powerful. Maybe this strike should be the beginning a tearing that corruption down.
Exactly! It’s complex accounting. In stem especially we are often paid out of fellowships or grants, with GSI positions filling in gaps where needed. These grants are often funded by government, and the university takes a cut of the grant for admin costs while another portion goes to the student and student’s fees. As a result the university doesn’t pay much for GSRs at all but reaps the benefits of the work being done. So when it’s sold to us as educational experience and a degree, instead of a paid job, it’s a little bs. I imagine there are logistics that would go into how grants would have to be allocated to cover these costs without just having to ask for more money in grants, if the university continues to take a large percentage of them, but that is research I’ll get into another day.

The GSI budget comes from the university/dept and so that is a whole issue that I rely on the union for because I have less experience on that front."
