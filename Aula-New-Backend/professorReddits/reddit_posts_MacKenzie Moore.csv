Declaring Cog Sci Major,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c2jxni/declaring_cog_sci_major/,2024-04-12 13:50:55,"Hi I'm a current  freshman and wanted to declare the Cog Sci major next year. One of the key requirements COG SCI 1, 1B, or N1has been offered Fall '23, Spring '24, but not Fall '24. I'm kind of suprised that it's not offered, given that it's a major requirement to declare the major. Is the course catalog not updated yet, or is it not being offered? Otherwise, how would I sastisfy this req since a transferable option isn't avaliable for most community colleges?","I find it hard to believe that the course won’t be offered in the Fall, so chances are that they’re still looking for someone to teach the class before committing.  I would email Mackenzie Moore and ask her."
