Anyone have tips to pass History 30 with Massimo Mazzotti?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xbbeqj/anyone_have_tips_to_pass_history_30_with_massimo/,2022-09-10 23:40:47,"I need some serious help yall. This class... Is confusing me. And it's only week 4... 

But the discussion posts are already making my head kinda spin... Like i kinda don't even understand what the discussion posts are really asking. And the readings are... Long and... Occasionally difficult to understand.

Anyone have any reading tips and tactics? Or a way to better understand/navigate through this class? (Or a good class with seats that i can swap into ðŸ’€)

Sorry if this is dumb it's just my first time taking a class like this... ;-;",haha im in that class too. yeah the readings are so fucking boring and long. try office hours
History 30 with Massimo Mazzotti?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/i89st7/history_30_with_massimo_mazzotti/,2020-08-12 01:04:42,"Iâ€™m an incoming freshman about to take his class this fall. Iâ€™ve only seen one review of him for this class, so I donâ€™t really know how he is or will be. Any tips are appreciated.","Was a pretty good class with interesting topics. It's very history and philosophy focused so make sure that's something you're interested in.

As for the work, it probably depends on your GSI but I never had to do more than 2 hours of work a week except when writing the final paper(only one paper when I took it). The in class midterms and finals involved id questions(identify a term from a list given to you beforehand, describe it, connect it) and an essay (chosen from several prompts). I imagine the tests might be different due to online but just wanted to share my experience.
Thanks a bunch for your input! Iâ€™m wondering how you did in the class grade-wise? Was it sort of an easy A?
The grading is done by the GSIs, mine was pretty lenient(idk about the others) but I kinda winged my final paper to focus on other classes so that tanked my grade. Everything else seemed pretty easy, not much effort to get 95%+. Not sure what the curve was though since a 93% final grade was an A-. If you're taking it as a breadth I'd probably just take it PNP to enjoy the course more."
