Hank Ibser Finals,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eabotv/hank_ibser_finals/,2019-12-13 15:19:55,"Hello,

I was wondering if Ibser's finals mimic, his practice finals?

Thanks.","Oh, most definitely not. Hank is gonna pull some crazy questions out of nowhere
I took both 134 and 135 with him. He’s going to pull a couple of questions out of nowhere that will fuck you like you’ve never been fucked before.

Make sure you really understand the theorems and definitions. It’ll be incredibly helpful.
Lmao stat 134 final with ibser was top 3 worst tests I’ve taken here. Felt like every question was a curveball with a couple knuckleballs mixed in for good measure. To the degree you can study for this kind of exam I would really focus on the theory in the back third of the textbook because that’s pretty much what gets tested
This is stressful to hear, but given the shitshow that was our midterm, I'm certainly not surprised.
I heard otherwise, from another person that it follows his practice. There seems to be some different experiences."
Any tips for Hank Ibser's Stats 20 class?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/cyc7j0/any_tips_for_hank_ibsers_stats_20_class/,2019-09-01 09:41:01,,"Hey, I had Ibser in the fall semester of last year.

His quizzes, singular midterm, and final are all exceptionally difficult, no sugarcoating that. Class averages were always abysmal so don't fret if you aren't doing so hot on those.

First off, do your homework, like seriously. Especially the R coding parts, there aren't many other ways to learn that material. Secondly, for R coding, I'd recommend making a separate sheet for the coding functions you use, like theoretically how to use them, and then in practice how the syntax operates. 

Lastly and most importantly, grind the past exams he releases. These questions are hard, but they are your key to succeeding in this class.

If you want my R coding sheet or any of the parts of the class I still have saved, PM me.

what percentage of the class or final is spent on the R or coding part vs the actual statistics part? bc i have zero coding experience :')
In high school I was not super great at quantitative classes. I did okay in calculus and kinda good in the courses preceding it. I would not describe myself as a math GOD either. This class is good about just rewarding hard work. A lot of people will clown around - BSing hw, not going through all of the resources that Ibser gives, not showing up to lecture etc.

Try your best and be sure to utilize your GSI. Mine was amazing and honestly, she is a big reason I did well in this class. Also the SLC. The tutors there are really amazing and great at explaning hw and past exam questions. The school has a lot of resources to set you up for success, just take advantage of them!
We had 200 points on our final, I'd say a good 50ish points were R questions."
