Cs70 + 61c was high workload imo.  Idk ur exact situation but if ur trying to declare cs I’d drop it since u alr have 20 units.  Otherwise it’s best to get it over with
It depends on your situation, what your major in, what class are you, and what you are shooting for for a grade. In general, when these types of posts are done, you have to give full disclosure.
20 units is a lot but besides that u should be good. Just stay on top of the course work.
(lol i would personally drop physics cuz Ronnie sucks ass and the course staff is wack too) 

Lisa Yan is the best professor i have ever had so it might be worth it to take 61c just for that (imo better than Dan). and if you don’t need to declare then i would drop 70 (cuz of workload) and/or do what i first said (cuz of personal opinions lol)
