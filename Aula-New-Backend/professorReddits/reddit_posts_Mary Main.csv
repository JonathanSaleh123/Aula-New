Asking Berkeley residents who are the most capable of being non-biased (and most readily receptive of the truth),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pz4mhz/asking_berkeley_residents_who_are_the_most/,2021-10-01 02:45:27," I have a deep confession to make to a noble girl by the name of UCSB. It is this: UCSB is the angelic (i.e. Sam Raimi's) Mary Jane Watson of our universe.

This position makes the most sense. UCSB and UCSC are the only girl UCs; of that, UCSC represents Aunt May as befitting of their slug-gishness. UCB and UCLA are the cutthroat and mentally ill Osborns, with UCLA explicitly played by James Franco (the Bruin) and UCB being the elder figure of the Osborns. UCSD represents Aquaman and he exists in DC, not MARVEL. UC Davis represents Firenze from Harry Potter.

**UCSB has the only masked-hero mascot of the UCs, meaning that it is the UC with the most right to the principles of Spider-Man**. With the most ethical and righteous of the Gauchos representing masked heroes, UCSB herself - nested in a notably German and Dutch county - is clearly the heavenly archetype giftedly portrayed by a Swedish+German superstar by the name of Kirsten Dunst. Finally, UCSB and its students are only half alive - *half of themselves* \- without one another.

It is rare that a connection would make so much majestic sense, and I will point this out to my fellow UCSB students. To reduce as much confirmation bias as possible, however, I would also like to ask the opinion of Berkeley students - see if you guys are seeing the same things I have pointed out.

Norman Osborn was a crazed maniac who tried to kill Peter Parker and those whom he loved, but I think you guys are more ethically capable than that. Thank you so much and please enjoy these treats after sharing your agreements and/or corrections.

i was going to ask how you assigned genders to the schools but that’s assuming this post makes any sense whatsoever.
Lmao *blushing*
Thank you; gosh, I'm blushing even more now.  Here is one more treat for you guys, featuring the sadistic treatment of the hero and his angelic lover.

"Course Review (Sp 22): Chem 3A, Chem 3AL, Bio 1B, Theatre 10",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/uydmuy/course_review_sp_22_chem_3a_chem_3al_bio_1b/,2022-05-26 11:07:15,"Hey, I’m back again! :) I wanted to share my experiences in these classes and I hope it helps! If you have any questions feel free to pm. Background on me: pre-med, intended MCB.

Chem 3A (Vollhardt): 6/10
- PRACTICE EXAMS, PRACTICE EXAMS, PRACTICE EXAMS.
- In terms of homework, there isn’t really. Most of your grade is from the exams, and the only “homework” is a weekly online quiz. Try to get as much of these points as possible as a small cushion to your grade.
- Hard to stay motivated on your own without homework assignments and with asynch lectures.
- Vollhardt is a funny, passionate professor. I liked him, just the structure of the course and my burnout made things difficult for me.
- lectures covered the main material, which follows the textbook that Professor Vollhardt wrote. Read the textbook, do NOT fall behind on lectures, and do practice problems. 
- SLC study group (+ SLC and RLT midterm reviews) was helpful, I went intermittently but should have committed
- Attend head GSI review sessions! He really distilled the material and was so kind
- No discussion sections, which was a major con for me as I learn well when things are broken down in a smaller group setting. 
- Course is curved - I believe roughly a 77% was an A- for this semester. Don’t get me wrong - it’s not easy.
- There are 2 midterms and a final. It got tougher as the course progressed. I basically need to review most of the course material after midterm 1 again before starting chem 3b.

Chem 3AL (Marsden) - 7/10
- The data analysis, pre-labs, notebook setup all add up. It takes time and can be challenging.
- There were many experiments where my work didn’t yield anything - that was probably one of the most discouraging things. I came out of lab feeling sad, overwhelmed, incompetent. Avoid this experience by THOROUGHLY watching videos of the experiment/procedures prior to the actual lab. Seriously. I know it’s “optional,” but unless you are a very quick learner, this is not something you can just bs and somehow get.
- Professor Pete is a nice guy, willing to answer questions, and presents the material in a digestable way in lectures. My one con is that he tends to cover the easiest examples of the concepts.
- No midterms. For the final exam, you don’t receive practice exams so it is important to review your lab worksheets. It was a rough final exam, but luckily my lab report scores went well and cushioned my grade.
- Go to GSI office hours! 

Bio 1B (Simms, Blonder, Blackman) - 8/10
- Medium/light workload - weekly participation based self assessment questions, lab worksheets, and there is a quiz in your disc section each week (we also had a paper to write, a presentation) - but most of this work was fun/okay
- Professor Simms taught evolution - loved this section because it was interesting and exciting, but also somewhat familiar and comfortable. I really liked the material for the most part - my only issue was that she would fall behind in the lectures so we were rushing for the last part of the unit. Her midterm was fair.
- Professor Blonder taught ecology - he was the best professor because he presented the information so nicely and made it very digestable. I’m not a big fan of ecology, but his passion for it got me interested. His midterm was very fair.
- Professor Blackman taught plant/organismal biology. This section was so rough. Heavy memorization, lots of reproductive cycles, dense lectures. The class did not do well on this midterm, average was a D-. 
- 3 midterms (1 for each section, MCQ + FRQ) and then a cumulative final (all MCQ) that covers all three sections. 
- Class was slightly curved (A- was about an 88.5%) because the final average was also very low. 

Theatre 10 (Modirzadeh) - 10/10
- AHHH I loved this class. The best I’ve taken at Cal. Workload is basically nothing, just need to write a journal for each day of class (3 days a week), a short paper on a play that you’ve seen, and some scene analysis work here and there. 
- you will need to audition for this class, but the audition is relatively simple if you just perform with emotion and show your range (really just public speaking skills). Auditions happen at the start of the semester.
- Participation based class! Attendance based class! If you show up and do stuff in class, you’re literally going to be fine. Most (if not all) people get an A
- No actual tests, but you will have performances. We had monologues, scenes, and final performances which required outside class rehearsal, but it was fun for everyone. 
- Bonded with my entire class, knew the names of everyone and we’re like all friends. It’s amazing.
- Leyla is a good teacher that cares about her kids. She is receptive to feedback, bubbly. Kind of like a real life Mary Poppins haha.","no math 10b or math 1b?
How do auditions work? Do you just enroll in the class and they notify you of the audition date and time?
Hi! I did math 1b in the fall! Check my previous post for that :)
Hey there! So basically, what I would do is leave space in your schedule for the section of acting class you intend to enroll in. Auditions will take place at the beginning of the semester, and if you are accepted, you will be given the permission code to enroll at the first class meeting!
Check the TDPS Callboard at the beginning of the semester for audition days/times! :)
Thank you so much!"
