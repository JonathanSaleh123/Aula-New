spring schedule freshman help!,https://i.redd.it/pes7p314z5dc1.jpeg,2024-01-18 01:03:19,"Is this doable?  Advice would be greatly appreciated 
Math 1b: paulin 
Nusctx 11: Jen Chywan Wang - online/ attendance is optional 
Data c88c: prof michael Ball
data c88s: Stoyanov 

waitlist: 
ugba 10
econ 100a","i only signed up for the discussion spot on 2:00-3:30 for math 1b because the other discussions has time conflict. I wanna do the lecture spot 2:00-3:30 with paulin and garret been but there’s a time conflict for C88c lab! 
does anyone know whether later in the semester we could switch lab times??
should i do econ 100a or ugba 10 instead of data 88c or data 88s or keep it as is?
From a course load standpoint it seems pretty manageable! Can’t help w/ ur c88 and lab timing q’s tho
is data 88s with stoyanov bad?"

Is **math 1b attendance** mandatory? ( Zvezdelina Stankova**)**   
If I have discussion on Tuesday, Thursday,  what **day would the quizzes** be?      
Do you have any GSI recs?","Attendance is mandatory with Stankova. As for the quizzes, probably Thursday but don't hold me to it.
