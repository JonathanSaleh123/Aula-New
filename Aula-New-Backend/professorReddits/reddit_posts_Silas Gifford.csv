"Has anyone taken Silas Gifford for Stat 20? If so, how is he?",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/15bmi8o/has_anyone_taken_silas_gifford_for_stat_20_if_so/,2023-07-27 20:50:08,,"Anybody is better than stoyanov. But Jeremy is the best imo
Whatâ€™s bad about Stoyanov?
She went off on tangents a lot, so often we weren't able to go over everything in class. Also I personally found her explanations to be confusing. She was not a bad person though. She really tried to teach and was friendly, but personally her way of teaching didn't work out for me. That's not to say you can't do well in her class. I had to rely on OH a lot and went to Jeremy's lectures and eventually did well.
