Physics 8A Stahler vs Speliotopoulos?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/oic924/physics_8a_stahler_vs_speliotopoulos/,2021-07-11 13:43:26,Anyone have any insight on Steven Stahler or Achilles Speliotopoulos in terms of difficulty or as a lecturer? Taking Physics 8A in the fall and pretty nervous...,"Stahler is very average; he's not the most exciting lecturer but he gets the point across most of the time, although spends lots of time on derivations. His exams are in the middle in terms of difficulty (mean 60-70), but sometimes involve random math tricks not even really related to physics such as multivariable integration and taylor series (this was for 7A though, not sure if that stuff's in scope for 8A).
Had Stahler for 7C  –– ditto for pretty much everything the other person said.

Never had Speliotopoulos, but his 7B exams that I did for practice had some of the most brutal problems –– my GSI claimed that if you could practice a Speliotopoulos exam comfortably, you were pretty much good to go for any 7B midterm.
I definitely recommend Spelio if u are engineering major or physics major
I had stahler for 7a, he was okay. Pretty average. I did some speliotopoulos practice exams and were super hard. Idk tho
thanks for your insight! i'm assuming derivations aren't expected for exams, but would you say his lectures/content explanations are pretty clear to understand for someone who struggles more with physics concepts? i learned the hard way from a different stem class here that having to self-teach myself an entire course ends badly...
I'm MCB- does that change things/matter as much?
correct, no derivations on exams. I didn't like his lectures that much and his writing on the chalkboard was sometimes hard to follow, but most of what he said made sense conceptually (it was also my first semester so maybe I just didn't know how to learn as well). Ultimately it comes down to how much practice you put in on hw/section/prepping for exams, I didn't fully understand all lectures but still did ok in the class by grinding for exams.
ohh gotcha alright i think i'll go with him then, thank you!"
