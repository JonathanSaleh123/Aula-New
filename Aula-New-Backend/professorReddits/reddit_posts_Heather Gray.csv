Robbery at knifepoint in Oakland/Berkeley - missing gray backpack,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9re4i2/robbery_at_knifepoint_in_oaklandberkeley_missing/,2018-10-25 13:45:12,"Hi everyone,

My partner was robbed at knifepoint in the Rockridge area (60th and Colby) yesterday night (10/24) at around 7:40 PM.  The thief escaped with her backpack.

Luckily, 2 great folks in Berkeley managed to recover both of her cell phones (a personal android and a work iPhone) off our Telegraph and Durant.

Long shot -- if anyone finds a heather gray TimBuk2 bag with blue/orange trim (link below) please let me know.  Stay safe, Berkeley!  Thanks to the folks who found our cell phones!

Search the area around the crime. Usually thieves will rifle through it and take what's valuable, unless they really like the bag. A polite stick up artist may even have you empty out your valuables for them and let you keep what you don't want. Morale of the story: scour the blocks around where the crime happened, open up dumpsters and such to check. These crooks are lazy, so it probably hasn't gone far! Hopefully a homeless person doesn't beat you to the bag 
I'm so sorry to hear about that! Hope she is safe, unhurt and gets her stuff back. I can't believe this happened in Rockridge - which is supposed to be safer than here
How were the cell phones recovered?
Had you been allowed to carry a firearm as is your 2nd amendment right this would not have happened.  Just look at what happens when you were not allowed to have the right to bear arms to defend your property.  It was forcibly removed by a thief and u had no way of defending yourself!  What if they wanted to take more than just  your property?
and a Robin to handle the business side
The whole country does.
Thank you!  Great tip -- great neighbors managed to find 75% of what was in the bag around the scene of the crime.  It looks like this was definitely a lazy robber.  I fear that the bag may be in the hands of a homeless person (though that is far and away my preference than to the thief).
Thank you.  We're surprised too!  I guess this kind of stuff is inevitable in a relatively big city like Oakland.  
My partner labels almost all her items with my phone number just in case things get lost or stolen.  We recovered the wallet from a neighbor because she put an emergency contact card in there.  Her water bottle and journal were recovered because my phone number was on there.  One of her cell phones has a prompt that says ""IF FOUND, PLEASE CALL…"" when you push the home key!
Robin handles all of Batman’s needs.
Ah, were the phones discarded by the criminal and then just found by someone else?
I believe so!  They were given to the Berkeley police department."
