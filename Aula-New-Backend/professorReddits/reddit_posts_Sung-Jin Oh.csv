Math 1b with Sung Jin oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qfy2g8/math_1b_with_sung_jin_oh/,2021-10-25 20:55:39,Anyone have him before? What are your opinions,"BRO SUNG JIN OH IS A BEAST. SEXY MFER 

HIS HANDWRITING SO CLEAN, BOARDWORK 10/10, HANDSOME 15/9, EXPLANATIONS 11/10. 

The only thing youâ€™ll be struggling with is understanding that you can never be with him forever since heâ€™s already married.
I had him for math 126, he was pretty clear in his expectations and when presenting the material. The class was really hard for me but I think thatâ€™s mostly because it was hard material, and nothing to do with how he presented it! I liked him overall.
tbh tho heâ€™s pretty good at teaching. Would give 4/5 teaching wise if 5/5 were the best professors Iâ€™ve had at berkeley. Solid guy though. Super nice, chill, and sexy af."
Math 1B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qgkci1/math_1b/,2021-10-26 17:33:02,any opinions on which professor i should chose? options are John Lott and Sung-jin Oh,"When I asked Paulin, he recommended John Lott since he's more experienced but it seems that a couple ppl here have expressed enthusiasm for Sungjin Oh so I'm not too sure.
Like Iâ€™m someone just trying to get my math reqs done it isnâ€™t rlly important for med school and I vibed with sung jin oh more so I picked him. The one review on rate my professor hooked me lol
how was his class?
I never took him! I am taking the course next semester I was just comparing his page and rate my professor vs John lottâ€™s. Sung-jin in my opinion seems more organized and I personally have no strong opinion on the other math professor. I want to go to a class with a professor I feel I will get along with/ will enjoy learning from.
I only picked Lott cuz Paulin recommended him and I heard his exams were easy ðŸ’€
Did you email him and he told you this? Did he talk abt Lotts teaching style at all?
I heard Sung Jin teaches clearly and fairly so Iâ€™m assume itâ€™s the same
I'm in the Precalculus essentials pilot program and he asked which professors were teaching math 1b next semester. Out of the two, he recommended Lott but idk how much I should trust him ðŸ˜…
Tbh itâ€™s your own opinion every professor has their strengths and weaknesses I feel like both are good :) lowkey for me I am just tired of older professors and Iâ€™ve never had a younger professor before"
Howâ€™s my schedule for spring ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/r0n4or/hows_my_schedule_for_spring/,2021-11-23 12:59:59,"1.Math1B- Sung-Jin-Oh (didnâ€™t see too many reviews about him, feel free to give opinions if youâ€™ve had him) 

2.Data8

3.Chem1A 

4.Chem1A Lab 

5.Potentially premed 101 decal or physics decal( to get a sense of how thatâ€™s going to be in the future since I have no physics experience) 

-I am a DSP student 

-I took chem32 in preparation for Chem1A",Sounds fine. Tech heavy but seems like youre prepared.
