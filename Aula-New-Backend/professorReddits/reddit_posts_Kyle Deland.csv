Legal studies 138,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/18yzmiq/legal_studies_138/,2024-01-04 21:58:36,Taking legal studies 138 with professor Kyle Deland. Anyone have any experiences (good or bad) with this professor? Haven’t seen many reviews of him. Thanks!,I’m also taking his class this semester! From what I’ve heard he’s pretty chill and understanding if you reach out to him
Legalst 138 vs 107,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/158or5y/legalst_138_vs_107/,2023-07-24 15:07:43,"I’m considering adding either Legalst 138 (Supreme Court and Public Policy) or 107 (theories of Justice). The professor for 138 is Kyle Deland, who has no reviews ( I believe he’s a grad student, and this is his first solo instructor class). 107 is w/ Sarah Song.

138 looks very Interesting but I’m hesitant due to the workload I’ve heard it entails w/ memorizing cases, and since it might be a wild card because the professor is new. I know I’ll take 107 eventually since it’ll be for a core requirement, but I heard professor Song is really good and the seats are more competitive to get her courses.

I would appreciate any feedback, especially from students who’ve taken either/ both courses!

Thankssss","138 is pretty easy, no matter who the professor is. I lucked out and got a special guest professor for this course, none other than the Dean of Berkeley Law, Erwin Chemerinsky himself. It was magical. But, regardless of who teaches it, it's about the Supreme Court, so it is modern, relatable, and most importantly - your opinion counts as a correct answer. You will examine the history of the Supreme Court and the most famous/socially impactful decisions of (mostly) the 20th Century, and on exams you can argue for your opinion without worrying about a right or wrong answer. You just have to use the concepts/points of law correctly to argue for your point of view. If you're interested in pursuing law it's kind of an essential course. That being said, I have no idea who this other professor is. I haven't taken Theories of Justice so I can't speak to that.
is law school in your future? always take the class with a predictable professor. a wild card new professor might make your life hell or not, but it’s better to know what you’re getting into. a B/A- could actually be detrimental in the long run, sadly for prelaws
both suck. 138 sucks a little bit less.
How was your experience with Kyle Deland? I am considering taking 138 with him this semester but the average grade on Berkeleytime looks very low.."
Switching to the Legal Studies Major as an undergrad ,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1dhfgmw/switching_to_the_legal_studies_major_as_an/,2024-06-16 12:40:18,"So I’m a L&S transfer student, about to start in Fall. On my application, I put my intended major as Poli Sci, and I’m receiving e-mails from Poli Sci advisors. However, I’m a lot more interested in Berkeley’s Legal Studies program and since I’m undeclared, I wanted to declare that instead. 

The Poli Sci advisors sent me a form requesting info that’s “mandatory for Fall 2024 enrollment,” should I be worried/contact them if I’m planning on declaring a different major? 

P.S. if anyone has more info on the Legal Studies program it is much appreciated. ","The legal studies major is fairly sociology heavy. It explores how law operates to shape society, with a familiar pattern of excluding or harming minority communities in America and around the world. There are some great courses, lots of opportunity to deep dive into American institutions like the Supreme Court, prisons, or the legal industry itself. Personally I loved it. Most of the students in the major intend to go to law school, but the same could probably be said for Polysci. Thinking about your next step might be beneficial to help you decide. If you do go with legal studies Sonia Katyal's Law, Sexuality & Gender is not to be missed. I also highly recommend Alan Pomerantz for his Supreme Court seminar. Nikki Jones has a course in 20th Century policing that's also really interesting, and my fave Professor was Kristin Sangren who teaches Sociology of Law and Punishment, Culture and Society. Have a blast this fall and get ready to read a LOT!
Declaring legal studies was fairly easy. I suggest taking legal studies 100 with professor simon and any class with Kyle deland."
