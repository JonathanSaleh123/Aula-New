Review of Professor Rasmussen IEOR 185 - Disrupt Berkeley (Fall19),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/e7az9u/review_of_professor_rasmussen_ieor_185_disrupt/,2019-12-06 22:32:15,"Hi, Professor Rasmussen doesn’t have a rate my professor or ninja courses, so I thought I’d post my course eval to his course here (my language is copy and pasted from the IEOR eval website), hope someone finds this useful! TLDR at end. 

————————————————

Please comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the instructor in classroom presentation and provide suggestions, if any, for improvement.

In every conceivable way Mr. Rasmussen failed to conduct lecture in an academic and thorough manner. The “lecture” portion of the course (I use quotation marks here because the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a lecture as a “discourse given...especially for education”, and Mr. Rasmussen’s “lectures” certainly did not match this definition) consisted of the same reused slides throughout the entirety of the course - I sincerely do not mean any exaggeration here, any surface examination of his slide decks on bCourses would corroborate my statement. I perceived his slides as serving the purpose of vaguely defining the trajectory of the course, rather than serving the purpose of instruction. As an example, Mr. Rasmussen failed to define or illustrate a “KPI”, and when a “gate” on KPIs for our project (effectively a midterm) was due, my team was left scrambling to figure out what that was - from an education perspective, this is unacceptable. I am an English major, so I understand to some degree the format of subjective instruction, especially in the context of an argument, but not one of Mr. Rasmussen’s “lectures” gave any direction to my team on how we should conduct our project. When I expressed my concerns about the lack of quantitative instruction, my comments were negated with the response “we are trying to simulate the uncertainty of start-up culture” - while in other circles this may be a valid mode of instruction, in an academic lecture setting, the failure to direct students on the subject matter of the course was completely abominable and fails the most basic of criteria for an effective “lecture”. 

What is your opinion of the instructor's effectiveness in interacting with students? Any suggestions for improvement?

Our weekly 2 hour section was formatted for each group to present on their projects. While Mr. Rasmussen did provide some surface level feed back on our projects, 2/3rds of my time was purely wasted while other groups presented. It got so bland that Mr. Rasmussen eventually let students leave as soon as they were done presenting, as his comments for other groups was simply not useful to our project. Moreover, Mr. Rasmussen did not have office hours, and he was only present as a lecturer around half of the time. His email communication was vague, and even soliciting a response to a due date was a monumental task. After Mr. Rasmussen returned from one of his trips (the reason for him not attending class), he would spend the first 20 minutes of class talking about things like “the gorgeous beaches of Brazil” and how he met a bunch of famous people. These comments made his “lecture” style almost bragging, and demonstrated a complete disregard for the students’ time and eagerness to learn. Moreover, these trips, from what I gathered, were not in any relation to his work with the university. I have had Professors miss lecture because they have had to give a talk on their book, but missing lecture (and failing to communicate with your students) for an external venture? How is that fair at all to me as a tuition paying student? His lack of interaction with students and failure to invest in our education truly made me loose faith in the University of California Berkeley as an academic institution. 

Please give your opinions on the nature and quality of the exams and assignments/projects

Projects were incredibly vaguely defined. I am a Math and English major, so I understand the nature of subjective feedback (ex. The process of grading essays), however, Mr. Rasmussen presented no desire to define what he wanted from our presentations. Interestingly, the lecturer of the main course, Professor Ken Singer, attended one of my group’s presentations, and he absolutely loved it. I remember him commenting that we should take this project out of the university, as there would be plenty of money to be made selling our project back to the university. My group was incredibly ecstatic with Professor Singer’s enthusiasm for our project, but much less enthusiastic with the B- we got on our presentation from Mr. Rasmussen for being “non grabbing” and “not clearly defining our objectives”. Moreover, even in the few instances when we got concrete feedback, to be blunt, I felt cheated, as something like a good “KPI”, “finance plan”, or “road map” was never once defined (even externally through a reading)! No expectations were outlined for projects before hand, and even though we could resubmit projects for a grade, the comments we had to work off of were so very vague - I implore anyone interested in the academic integrity of the University to examine his feedback and determine if anything more than “I didn’t like it” can be discerned. Moreover, when a winner for the “Colider Cup” (effectively a designation of “best project” was given), before announcing the winner, Mr. Rasmussen said “the winner was not chosen based on presentational ability not project merit”, rather it was chosen based on “what project he thought would compete the best” - is this not a long winded way of saying he chose the winner based on his own personal biases? How is that fair to me as an academic student? Is this not a slippery slope into grading based on personal biases that Cal has so diligently tried to avoid?

Please provide additional comments or suggestions about the instructor

If you want a “lecturer” that serves as a medium for education, I could not recommend a professor less than Mr. Rasmussen. Taking his course has made me loose faith in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department’s standards for hiring quality professors. As a recap, his ineffectiveness as a lecturer stems from (i) his lack of attendance, (ii) his lack of communication, (iii) his failure to reflect topics goals in instruction, (iv) his vaguely defined grading procedures, and (v) his lack of regard for the educational process (that being in the most basic sense, serving as a conduit between his own knowledge and the knowledge of the student). As a final point, since when does the University not require a syllabus for a class? The lack of a syllabus was taken as a point of pride in this course - to me, this seemed like a hand waved excuse to define grades arbitrarily - a function I see as serving no other purpose than solidifying the superiority complex of the instructor - a complex, that as research from Berkekey itself shows is non-conducive to a learning environment.

TLDR: don’t take Prof. Rasmussen’s IEOR185 class","What is it with the IEOR ""facilitators"" at this school? I just finished another IEOR course with a prof that was extremely similar - missed class all the time to give talks and attend meetings for outside ventures, and created entire assignments just so he could brag about how many CEOs he knows. The laughable thing is that he had an extremely strict attendance policy (no exceptions for recruiting events/interviews) when he himself missed 1/3 of the classes... what a mess lol. And yeah +1 on the grading thing, we never had a single assignment be graded the entire semester so I have no idea what grade I'm about to get.
>since when does the University not require a syllabus for a class

Wait you said you're a math major. I've never taken a math class here where we got a syllabus or really any indication of how to get any specific grade. Also rip this professor sounds like he sux
I’ve had some math classes where the syllabus wasn’t physically passed out, but on the course website, it was made clear that ex, HW =20%, Midterm 1 =20%, Midterm 2=20%, Final =40%. Also, all the math classes I’ve taken so far have very clearly defined what is going to be on a midterm, ex, Ch 6-8, and even though the lectures may have been quick, those chapters were in fact covered in class (the same can’t be said for Rasmussen)"
